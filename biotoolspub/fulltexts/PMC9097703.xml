      <title>Lay Summary</title>
      <p>In many research scenarios, certifications are required for data access requests.
Institutions must manage the relevant certificates to avoid potentially serious scenarios
that could impede research. Most existing systems suffer from risks such as
single-point-of-failure, a scenario in which an entire system can be rendered ineffective
with the failure of only one node in the network. To solve this problem, we developed
CertificateChain, a decentralized certificate management system that adopted blockchain
and smart contract (programs running on blockchain) technology and stores the certificates
on-chain. To evaluate the system’s performance, we performed experiments on it by storing
Collaborative Institutional Training Initiative (CITI) certificate files to test its
scalability and speed, as well as real-world testing using an accompanying web app. We
found that in terms of time, the system scaled linearly, and could quickly be searched for
any existing certificates. The limitations include the evaluation of other blockchain
consensus protocols, verification of certificate authenticity before and after uploading,
the scalability of upload file size, as well as an in-depth comparison to existing
centralized systems. After developing and evaluating the system, we believe that
CertificateChain shows potential to be a viable decentralized alternative for existing
centralized systems.</p>

    <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
    <sec>
      <title>Background and significance</title>
      <p>When performing research, especially when handling things like private health
information, training certificates such as Collaborative Institutional Training Initiative
(CITI, <xref rid="ooac019-F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>)<xref rid="ooac019-B1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> are typically required. Researchers must renew
these certificates when they expire and will sometimes be asked to present the digital
certificates to access data. Failure to properly manage training certificates can lead to
various issues. The inability to present a valid certificate can delay the release of
funding of an awarded grant, the consequences of which could be very significant. Lack of
a certificate needed to access data could also delay research, and thus any resulting
publications as well. As such, it is important to have a system in place for managing
these training certificates.</p>

        <graphic xlink:href="ooac019f1" position="float"/>
      </fig>
      <p>The traditional method for managing certificates in many institutions is to use email to
exchange the PDF files, as shown in <xref rid="ooac019-F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>. Although this solution worked well enough to meet the minimum
requirements, it had several issues. First, finding a PDF and then emailing it to someone
whenever they need it is slow and inefficient. In one study, it took faculty an average of
5.1 days to respond to a survey,<xref rid="ooac019-B2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref>
a metric that one could assume would likely be similar for a response to a request for
their certificate PDF. Additionally, it is prone to human error; emails can go unnoticed
amongst the many other researchers may receive daily, or they might be sent to the wrong
person. Finally, email also provides no way to know if a certificate is going to expire
without manually checking the expiry date.</p>
      <p>A typical approach to this kind of problem would be to set up a central database where
certificate-holders can upload their certificates (<xref rid="ooac019-F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). This would allow the party in need of certificate confirmation to
quickly and directly get the information that they need. Although this solution solves
many of the issues seen in the emailing system, it is not without problems of its own.
Having only a single central database leaves the system with a single-point-of-failure,
rendering it vulnerable to a malicious attack or simply a hardware or software
malfunction. There may also be conflicts when determining who will be responsible for
hosting and maintaining the database when there will be several parties using it.</p>
      <p>To address the above-mentioned issues for an email-based or centralized training
certificate management system, we propose a decentralized system that could act as a
single database without being vulnerable to single-point-of-failure. Although it would be
possible to create backups and increase redundancy with traditional databases to avoid
this issue, this is essentially what blockchain, a novel distributed immutable ledger
technology originally proposed for crypto-currencies, was designed for with its system of
nodes.</p>
      <p>Blockchain largely rose to popularity in late 2017 when Bitcoin became a viral sensation.
Bitcoin is just one of many implementations of blockchain technology, which was originally
created to support a decentralized digital currency now commonly referred to as
‘crypto-currency.’ It accomplishes this by creating a peer-to-peer ledger that keeps track
of all transactions that occur on the network and then updates on each participating
machine, or “node,” in the network. Therefore, there is no single-point-of-failure in a
blockchain network.</p>
      <p>Also, blockchain provides several other useful benefits for the situation.<xref rid="ooac019-B3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref> By providing immutability,
blockchain ensures that nobody can tamper with the data after it is uploaded.
Additionally, it eliminates the need for any one entity to manage and set up a database,
instead delegating the task to the entirety of the participants in the network, who each
set up a node that keeps track of the state of the blockchain.</p>
      <p>Although Bitcoin was the first use of blockchain, its rise to popularity brought the
technology into the public eye and resulted in a large increase in the number of
alternative crypto-currencies with the new technology of smart contracts.<xref rid="ooac019-B3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref> Smart contracts, adopted in
blockchain platforms such as Ethereum<xref rid="ooac019-B4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref> and Hyperledger,<xref rid="ooac019-B5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref> are programs that users can write and then run on the blockchain
automatically to manage data on-chain. Smart contracts are beneficial to the system
because the code stored on-chain is completely transparent and immutable. That is,
everyone on the network can see the code (and who wrote it) but cannot change it. If a
revision of a smart contract is needed, it can be deployed to the network as a new
version, but the contract it is replacing in function will stay in the history of the
blockchain for all to see. The technical features mentioned above for blockchain (ie, no
single-point-of-failure, data immutability, decentralized management, and high
availability) and smart contracts (ie, code transparency and code immutability) are highly
desirable for a training certificate management system.</p>
      <p>Although there are many proposals<xref rid="ooac019-B6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="ooac019-B7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref> for adopting blockchain and smart contracts in healthcare,<xref rid="ooac019-B8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8–14</sup></xref> the feasibility and scalability of storing certificates
on-chain are yet to be fully evaluated. Several previous papers explored theoretical
applications of blockchain within the field of healthcare,<xref rid="ooac019-B6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> but any actual testing was yet to be conducted.
Others created a system to store electronic health records,<xref rid="ooac019-B7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref> while our study focused on managing the
certificates. Another recent paper proposed using blockchain as a secure method for
storing educational class credits.<xref rid="ooac019-B15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref> There are a several other studies<xref rid="ooac019-B16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16–20</sup></xref> that attempt to use blockchain to verify certificate
authenticity, but only store hashes<xref rid="ooac019-B16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="ooac019-B17" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref> or states<xref rid="ooac019-B18" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18–20</sup></xref> of the certificates
that can be used to prevent forgery, and do not upload the certificate itself nor contain
any useful information about the certificate like its expiry date on the actual
blockchain. Although these studies demonstrate some of the benefits of blockchain, it is
still unclear if storing the training certificates on-chain may be a plausible solution
due to the increased data load. That is, existing systems focus only on handling small
pieces of data such as authentication information, as opposed to full certificate files,
which jumps from mere bytes in the normal use case to several kilobytes or even megabytes
when storing PDFs.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec>
      <title>Objective</title>
      <p>We aimed at developing a training certificate management system named CertificateChain
using blockchain and smart contract and evaluating its feasibility and scalability
empirically. The rest of the article is organized as follows: first, we will introduce
blockchain and smart contracts, our novel certificate dividing-and-merging algorithm, our
newly developed user web interface, and experiment settings in “Materials and Methods”
section. Then, the results of certificate storing as well as web application will be shown
in “Results” section. Finally, we will discuss the findings and limitations of this study
in “Discussion” section, followed by the conclusions in “Conclusion” section.</p>
    </sec>

  <sec>
    <title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title>
    <sec>
      <title>Blockchain platform and smart contracts</title>
      <p>Based on our previous survey of blockchain platforms,<xref rid="ooac019-B21" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="ooac019-B22" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22</sup></xref> we chose Ethereum as the underlying blockchain
for CertificateChain. Ethereum provides great support for advanced smart contracts, as
well as running private networks, and is well-supported by a very active community due to
its popularity as a crypto-currency platform. We adopted Ethash,<xref rid="ooac019-B23" ref-type="bibr"><sup>23</sup></xref> a Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus protocol for
Ethereum. We developed smart contracts using Solidity<xref rid="ooac019-B24" ref-type="bibr"><sup>24</sup></xref> that allowed us to store and retrieve full PDF
files from an Ethereum blockchain. Solidity is Ethereum’s own special smart contract
language taking inspiration from C++, Python, and JavaScript, and is Turing-complete which
provides much more freedom to smart contract developers, such as the capability to use
loops, when compared with what is available for a platform like Bitcoin.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec>
      <title>Efficient certificate dividing-and-merging algorithm</title>
      <p>An intuitive solution to store certificates on blockchain is to enclose each certificate
in a transaction. However, there is usually a limitation of transaction size, for example,
the Go-Ethereum implementation only allows up to 32 KB in a transaction.<xref rid="ooac019-B25" ref-type="bibr"><sup>25</sup></xref> To overcome this limitation, we
developed a dividing-and-merging algorithm, which split each certificate into 30 KB slices
before sending to the blockchain. Our algorithm then reconstructed the file into a byte
array on the chain. As such, the contract is not limited to PDF files but could be used to
store any file type or digital data using the same method.</p>
      <p>A straightforward way to store/retrieve the slices is to reconstruct the slices of the
file in order as a byte array on the blockchain. However, this required “sequential
transactions” which can limit the rate of the file transfer to the rate at which blocks
were mined/created while moving only one slice per mined block. To further improve the
efficiency of the certificate logging and querying, we designed a mechanism to instead
store the slices as objects at a predefined index within a hash table, which mapped slice
indexes to the raw byte data. This was done by taking the original file, which was
represented as a byte array in the Solidity smart contract and dividing it into smaller
byte arrays that satisfied the transaction data size limit. Using the certificate ID,
which is unique to each certificate, along with a simple incremental ID for each subarray,
which was passed in the transaction along with the data itself, a map could be created for
the certificate that allowed for easy reconstruction of the pieces as they arrived in any
arbitrary order. Due to the incremental nature of the slice IDs, the map could be iterated
over in order of the IDs whenever the full byte array was required, such as when a user
requested to download the original file, and simply append the pieces to reproduce the
full file.</p>
      <p>With this design, any slice of the file could be added at any time if it ended up in the
right position within the mapping on the blockchain, which was guaranteed via the mapping
instead of the actual chronological order of the arrival of the slices. This
parallelization of the transactions allowed us to perform all the storage/retrieving at
once, reducing the time required for a full file transfer to match the time until the next
block was mined, where previously only one slice could be transferred in this same time
span.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec>
      <title>User web interface</title>
      <p>Since most potential users might not be familiar with blockchain technology, it was
necessary to create an interface that abstracted the inner workings of the system away
from them and allowed them to interact with it in a familiar manner. We created a web
application using Spring Boot<xref rid="ooac019-B26" ref-type="bibr"><sup>26</sup></xref>
to allow other UCSD DBMI members to upload their certificates as a test on the system, and
utilized Web3j,<xref rid="ooac019-B27" ref-type="bibr"><sup>27</sup></xref> a Java
Ethereum library, to connect the web application and the underlying Ethereum blockchain
network. The web app took the certificate metadata and PDF and uploaded them to be stored
on the chain.</p>
      <p>By only requiring users to upload their certificate once using this web interface
(instead of accessing it multiple times as is required by current email systems), we aim
at reducing the possibilities for human error to cause any issues. This web interface also
allowed users to query certificates from the chain to view their information or download
the PDF file to their local machine. Importantly, it also enabled users to easily view any
valid certificates and to check whether a given researcher had a currently valid
certificate, rather than having to contact them personally.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec>
      <title>Experiment settings</title>
      <p>To test the scalability of CertificateChain, we measured the time CertificateChain
required for adding 100 CITI certificates of 410 KB each to a newly created blockchain. We
compared CertificateChain with a baseline method which added certificates to the
blockchain using sequential transactions. We also ran experiments both with PDF file
storage and without PDF file storage (ie, storing only the metadata, such as the name and
expiration date) on-chain for benchmarking purposes. Then, we compared the speed when the
certificates were added all from 1 blockchain node against the speed when they were added
evenly from 2 blockchain nodes. We set up a private Ethereum network including Ubuntu
Virtual Machines (VMs) in Amazon Web Services (AWS)<xref rid="ooac019-B28" ref-type="bibr"><sup>28</sup></xref> to serve as the blockchain nodes. We repeated each experiment
mentioned above for 30 trials. The system architecture used for CertificateChain
evaluation is demonstrated in <xref rid="ooac019-F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>.</p>

storage. At roughly 2.5 min to add 100 certificates, CertificateChain averaged about 1.5 s
per certificate upload. The retrieval time is negligible when compared with the storing
time.<xref rid="ooac019-B29" ref-type="bibr"><sup>29</sup></xref> In fact,
CertificateChain with PDF file storage was even more efficient than the baseline method
without PDF file storage. Each result is computed by averaging the time measurements of
the 30 trials, as depicted in <xref rid="ooac019-F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>.
Exact times for these experiments are listed in <xref rid="ooac019-T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. We further compare the effect of adding certificates from more nodes.
The results of adding certificates from 2 nodes (ie, adding 50 certificates from each
node) compared with adding just from 1 node is shown in <xref rid="ooac019-F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>. The system with 2 nodes adding certificates performed
better than the system with 1 node adding certificates, likely due to the increased
computational resources available.</p>

    <title>DISCUSSION</title>
    <sec>
      <title>Findings</title>
      <p>Our results demonstrated that CertificateChain was able to store and retrieve the
training certificates on the blockchain network in a reasonable time (1.5 s for storing a
certificate). For the submission of certificates by participants, CertificateChain was
able to handle uploads, queries, and downloads without any issues. No major usage hurdles
were reported, and no unusual delays were observed interacting with the blockchain
network. For the scalability test, CertificateChain provides a linear scaling of time with
respect to the number of certificates added to the blockchain. Thus, we managed to
securely store certificates on a blockchain in a manner similar in performance to
traditional database systems, while gaining several benefits. When using the web app,
users uploading a certificate would first select a certificate file, which the web app
would then store in memory and upload to the blockchain in the background while the user
continued with the rest of the process. This was done to keep the user experience fluid
and consistent with what a typical user might expect from a web app in terms of
performance. Combined with our web app, the system also reduces the opportunities for
human error by requiring certificate uploads only once, compared with the numerous times a
researcher may have to email their certificate without the system, and allows users to
instantly check if a researcher has a valid certificate rather than having to contact them
personally and ask.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec>
      <title>Public blockchain testnet</title>
      <p>Although CertificateChain was designed for private blockchain networks, we also conducted
a test on the public Ropsten “testnet” (ie, a public test blockchain network of which the
crypto-currency has no real monetary value)<xref rid="ooac019-B30" ref-type="bibr"><sup>30</sup></xref> to understand the performance of CertificateChain with PDF file
storage in a setting with many participating blockchain nodes and thus transactions. Using
a transaction timeout of 100 min, we uploaded certificates 1 at a time (as opposed to 100
at a time) and recorded the time to upload each certificate. In general, the time to store
a certificate was between 14 and 90 min. The storage speed was influenced by various
factors such as the number of other nodes mining on the network at any given time or the
number of other transactions waiting to be processed. These evaluation results are not
directly comparable to the results shown in <xref rid="ooac019-T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, because of the very different configurations between the private and
the public blockchain networks.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec>
      <title>Limitations</title>
      <p>The limitations for this work are as follows. First, our method focuses on storing actual
certificate files on-chain. We are yet to conduct a thorough comparative analysis to
compare our method empirically with existing studies which store hashes or states of the
certificates.<xref rid="ooac019-B16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16–20</sup></xref> Also, while we adopted Ethereum in our system, there are other
blockchain platforms, such as Solana<xref rid="ooac019-B31" ref-type="bibr"><sup>31</sup></xref> or Hyperledger Fabric,<xref rid="ooac019-B32" ref-type="bibr"><sup>32</sup></xref> that might be viable alternatives to Ethereum. We are yet to
implement CertificateChain on these blockchains to enhance the generalizability of our
system.</p>
      <p>Second, we are yet to investigate other blockchain consensus protocols, such as
Proof-of-Authority (PoA)<xref rid="ooac019-B33" ref-type="bibr"><sup>33</sup></xref> or
Proof-of-Stake (PoS). This study was conducted exclusively using PoW. However, Ethereum
has since begun a transition to PoA/PoS,<xref rid="ooac019-B34" ref-type="bibr"><sup>34</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="ooac019-B35" ref-type="bibr"><sup>35</sup></xref> and as such we expect it to be significant moving forward.
Additionally, we performed experiments on the public Ropsten testnet to “emulate” the
scenario of having numerous blockchain nodes. However, we are yet to investigate the
performance of the system on a large private blockchain network. Although in a private
network one could potentially consider participating nodes to be trustworthy, some of
blockchain’s benefits are not guaranteed unless a network is large enough to prevent a
single entity from controlling most of the nodes. Therefore, further experiments could
further ensure the feasibility of CertificateChain when the number of private blockchain
nodes is large. Besides, the main scope of our study was limited to a private network use
case, where several institutions seek to replace an internal exchange of certificates. A
significant redesign of the system for public blockchain networks would be required to
properly evaluate the feasibility in a use case where the system is open to the public as
opposed to a controlled private network.</p>
      <p>Third, although each of the certificates we used contains a permanent link to the
issuer’s website that can be used to verify authenticity, for other types of certificates
there might be concerns about the possibility of faking a certificate before uploading it
to the chain, which warrants further study. In fact, the whole biomedical training process
(eg, registration, participating lectures, and evaluations) could potentially be
integrated into the blockchain, thus all the information will be recorded on-chain with
reduced susceptibility to fraudulent activities. We believe that this application would be
particularly well-suited to the blockchain, as the transparency and immutability that the
blockchain provides have already been proven to be useful in demonstrating the
authenticity of other items such as medicine.<xref rid="ooac019-B36" ref-type="bibr"><sup>36</sup></xref> We are also yet to evaluate the performance of storing large PDF
files (eg, &gt;10 MB) or using more certificates.</p>
      <p>Fourth, we are yet to conduct a more in-depth analysis of the system’s performance in
comparison to a traditional database system, to further clarify whether the
transparency/immutability benefits of smart contracts in our system outweighs the
potential obstacle of increased software engineering complexity when compared with current
solutions involving centralized systems, and if so, whether it can do so at a competitive
price. This experiment was run on the AWS cloud platform, which cost about $60 USD per
month per machine, and due to the nature of private or test networks, required no actual
crypto-currency to operate (ie, the crypto-currency in the system had no real monetary
value). Although we consider this cost to be moderate for institutions who join the
private blockchain network, further investigation would still be required to determine if
this system, when scaled to the appropriate level, could be a financially viable
alternative to the established database systems.</p>
      <p>Finally, our system was evaluated on private or testnet blockchain networks, though it
theoretically could also be extended for the “mainnet” (the public Ethereum network using
crypto-currencies with real monetary values). That said, as of January 2022, the mainnet
gas prices would result in a transaction fee of about $23 USD to upload 32 KB of data.
With the 410 KB of CITI or 120 KB of HIPAA certificates used in our experiments, this
would put the cost at $322 or $92 USD per certificate upload, respectively. These
estimations show significantly increased costs when operating on the mainnet instead of a
testnet or private network. To mitigate this issue, further methodology improvements such
as storing a “preview” version of the certificates instead<xref rid="ooac019-B8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> would be required.</p>

    <title>CONCLUSION</title>
    <p>We developed CertificateChain, a healthcare training certificate management system based on
blockchain and smart contracts. CertificateChain possesses desirable technical features that
are important for managing training certificate PDF files, including no
single-point-of-failure, data immutability, decentralized management, high availability,
code transparency, and code immutability. We showed the linear scalability of
CertificateChain by automatically submitting certificates via scripts. We also deployed a
web application for participants to manually submit their certificates, providing a user
experience comparable to that of a traditional database. CertificateChain represents a
prototype that can serve as the cornerstone for future healthcare blockchain and smart
contract studies. These findings support the use of blockchain technology as a transparent,
immutable, decentralized, and highly available method of storing important data in general,
showing that blockchain’s uses extend well beyond crypto-currency and into the realm of
healthcare.</p>
