      <title>Abstract</title>
      <p>The transplantation of loops between structurally related proteins is a compelling method to improve the activity, specificity and stability of enzymes. However, despite the interest of loop regions in protein engineering, the available methods of loop-based rational protein design are scarce. One particular difficulty related to loop engineering is the unique dynamism that enables them to exert allosteric control over the catalytic function of enzymes. Thus, when engaging in a transplantation effort, such dynamics in the context of protein structure need consideration. A second practical challenge is identifying successful excision points for the transplantation or grafting. Here, we present LoopGrafter (<ext-link xlink:href="https://loschmidt.chemi.muni.cz/loopgrafter/" ext-link-type="uri">https://loschmidt.chemi.muni.cz/loopgrafter/</ext-link>), a web server that specifically guides in the loop grafting process between structurally related proteins. The server provides a step-by-step interactive procedure in which the user can successively identify loops in the two input proteins, calculate their geometries, assess their similarities and dynamics, and select a number of loops to be transplanted. All possible different chimeric proteins derived from any existing recombination point are calculated, and 3D models for each of them are constructed and energetically evaluated. The obtained results can be interactively visualized in a user-friendly graphical interface and downloaded for detailed structural analyses.</p>

    <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
    <p>Enzymes are powerful natural biocatalysts that have evolved through billions of years to perform the complex chemical reactions required to sustain life. Improving different properties of such biocatalysts has been one of the main objectives of protein engineering, and both directed evolution (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>) and computationally aided approaches (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>) have helped in this aim. Loops, particularly dynamic aperiodic regions connecting more steady regular secondary structures, have been repeatedly targeted in protein engineering (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Yet, the scarcity of available methods for loop-based rational protein engineering has been noted (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>).</p>
    <p>The transplantation or grafting of such elements from a source protein to a target one has long been considered a powerful approach to engineer the activity and specificity of enzymes (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5–7</xref>). Based on the study of successful loop transplants, it has previously been proposed that loop grafting requires a precise local geometric overlay of the source and target structures around the grafted region (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). This suggests that preserving the geometry and local conformation of the secondary structure elements (SSEs) flanking the grafted loop is crucial for the grafting success. Such conformational and geometric requirements were observed in the early <italic toggle="yes">de novo</italic> loop design, where the extent of backbone constraints was arbitrarily set to the first three proximal amino acids of each flanking secondary structure (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). However, individual grafting experiments differ on the extent of this requirement, making it unclear how much of the flanking secondary structure needs to be grafted along the coil part of the fragment. Additionally, we have recently shown that flexibility requirements in the context of loop grafting may be crucial for tailoring the desired enzyme function (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Indeed, protein flexibility is considered to play an important role in the evolution of proteins towards new functions, in particular the flexibility gradient between the active site and the protein scaffold (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>).</p>
    <p>In this context, the aforementioned geometric requirements can only help in keeping backbone conformations suitable for the preservation of an adequate balance between stability and function (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Furthermore, it has been shown that allosteric coordination of distant parts of a protein modulates the dynamic conformational space of loops important for the enzyme function (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14–16</xref>). In the context of loop grafting, the identification and potential design of such regions might be crucial for achieving the desired engineered function. There are promising results of loop grafting efforts, and several solutions are available for loop modelling and remodelling, such as Loop Modelling (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>), DaReUS-Loop (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>) or FALC (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). Nevertheless, no computational tool is at the disposal of the community to provide guidance on the grafting process while assessing the flexibility of the grafted regions.</p>
    <p>Here, we introduce LoopGrafter (<ext-link xlink:href="https://loschmidt.chemi.muni.cz/loopgrafter/" ext-link-type="uri">https://loschmidt.chemi.muni.cz/loopgrafter/</ext-link>), a web-based tool aimed to cover this gap in a protein engineering toolbox. Specifically, the web server automates the identification of regular SSEs in the input protein structure, allowing the user to fine-tune the limits of such elements. Loops and their geometries are calculated to provide the user with an easy way to compare the elements on the scaffold and insert proteins to be exchanged. LoopGrafter is designed to help researchers to identify regions of interest in their scaffold protein according to their dynamic behaviour: rigid, flexible or hinge regions connecting parts of the protein with different flexibility properties (i.e. one part rigid, the other flexible). Furthermore, motion cross-correlations between the selected loops to be grafted and other loops in the protein are assessed to suggest additional regions to be engineered. LoopGrafter calculates all possible combinations of the selected loops and, for each loop, every recombination point on the two flanking SSEs that generate a different grafted protein sequence. This exhaustive exploration of the recombination sequence space allows LoopGrafter not to require the sequence of the final chimeric protein as input, as it happens in available loop remodelling tools that can be used for loop grafting (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17–19</xref>). Three-dimensional (3D) models for each of such grafting solutions are generated and energetically evaluated to indicate and rank the experimental feasibility of the designed sequence.</p>

      <title>Determination of SSEs and flexibility assessment</title>
      <p>The 3D structures of the two input proteins can be uploaded from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>) or uploaded by the user. The secondary structure of input protein structures is calculated using DSSP (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). As in previous works (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>), in our pipeline a loop is defined as the super-secondary structure formed by two regular secondary structures and the coil region joining them. Based on these definitions, the input protein loop architecture and the geometries of their loops are calculated as described in the ArchDB structural classification of loops in proteins (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). To assess the scaffold protein flexibility, alpha carbon temperature factors are retrieved from the input crystal PDB file or calculated from NMR ensembles (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>):<disp-formula id="M1"><label>(1)</label><tex-math id="M0001" notation="LaTeX">\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

}{}$$\begin{equation*}{B_i} = \frac{{8{\pi ^2}}}{3} \cdot {{\rm RMSF}_i^2},\end{equation*}$$\end{document}</tex-math></disp-formula>where RMSF is the root-mean-squared fluctuation obtained from the different models present in the NMR ensemble for a given alpha carbon. Also, Gaussian (GNM) (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>) and anisotropic (ANM) (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>) elastic network models are calculated as implemented in the ProDy stand-alone package (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>) to obtain theoretical <italic toggle="yes">B</italic>-factors for each residue. The <italic toggle="yes">B</italic>-factor values of each residue in a protein segment (secondary structure or super-secondary structure elements) are averaged to obtain the flexibility values of such segments. Coordinated motions in the protein are predicted using ANM residue-to-residue cross-correlation values. Such values are used to calculate protein segment cross-correlation values as previously described (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>).</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="SEC2-2">
      <title>Exploration of the grafted region possible boundaries</title>
      <p>The input protein structures are superimposed using combinatorial extension (CE) (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). From such superimposition, a sequence pairing between the two proteins is derived from aligned structures by greedily pairing the closest alpha carbons from each of the input chains (residue doublet). Such atoms have to be within a distance cut-off of 1.9 Å. Residue doublets that do not respect amino acid correlativity in both input proteins are unpaired (and thus gapped). Residue doublets with a difference in sequence position four times higher than the distribution standard deviation are also unpaired.</p>
      <p>For each loop region to be grafted (understood as the super-secondary structure formed by the coil segment and its flanking regular secondary structures), all the different residue doublets on the flanking SSEs represent a potential boundary for the grafting experiment. Thus, different lengths of the flanking SSEs might be preserved from the scaffold, but the resulting graft design will contain the whole coil region from the insert protein. A boundary is defined on a given position only if such a position can be matched by the previously described sequence pairing. If such position corresponds to an unpaired residue (be it on the scaffold or on the insert proteins), the new boundary is defined by pairing the unaligned residue with the closest flanking residue from the sequence where the gap is. A particular pair of boundaries (N- and C-terminal) is only accepted for further evaluation if the grafted variant provides any sequential variation on the scaffold protein or any other accepted design.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="SEC2-3">
      <title>Generation and evaluation of 3D structure models</title>
      <p>3D models for each of the constructed grafted variants to be evaluated are built using MODELLER (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). The inputs of the program are (i) the 3D structures of the proteins (templates) from which optimal spatial restraints are derived, (ii) the sequence of the target ‘problem protein’ (in the present work, the designed grafted sequence) for which a 3D model is to be built and (iii) a sequence alignment between all of them. The sequence alignment is used to indicate both templates that need to satisfy spatial restraints. Assuming the existence of some geometric overlay of the scaffold and insert flanking SSEs around the grafted area (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>), the ideal model should incorporate spatial restraints from both template proteins on these overlaid regions.</p>
      <p>However, only the insert input protein should inform the grafted coil segment and only the scaffold one the rest of the model. To meet these requirements, the coil parts from the 3D template of the scaffold protein are removed, and the 3D templates for the insert protein correspond to the coil region with flanking secondary structures. To align these insert templates to the target grafted sequence, the 3D coordinates of each insert fragment to be grafted are superimposed again on the scaffold 3D structure using CE (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). In comparison to the whole structure superimposition, here only the fragments to be grafted are considered, and only one fragment at a time. From each of these superimpositions, a sequence paring is derived as described, which is used to derive the sequence alignment required by MODELLER.</p>
      <p>MODELLER provides a 3D model of the grafted design and a discrete optimized protein energy (DOPE) (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>) value to evaluate the goodness of the model. In order to obtain an independent assessment, each generated model is minimized by Rosetta FastRelax (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>) using rigid backbone and default constraints, and Talaris2014 as a scoring function (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). The combined score returned by the program is also used to evaluate the stability of the models.</p>

      <p>The 3D structure of the loop-grafted luciferase/haloalkane dehalogenase bifunctional enzyme (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>) was downloaded from the RCSB PDB (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>) (PDB ID 6s97). Residues were renumbered so that the first residue in the structure corresponded to residue number 1, and the coordinates corresponding to the sequences <sub>123</sub>IVHMESVVDVIESWDEWPDIEEDIALIK<sub>154</sub> and <sub>206</sub>WPREIPIKGDGPEDV<sub>220</sub> were removed from the structure (note a 11-position shift in comparison to the deposited PDB structure). This structure and the sequence corresponding to the chimeric protein carrying the luciferase sequence for these regions (Supplementary Data) were given as input to the ‘Advanced’ mode of use of DaReUS-Loop (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>).

        <title>Structure input</title>
        <p>On the web server home page, the user is required to provide the coordinates of two different proteins: the <italic toggle="yes">scaffold</italic> from which the loop(s) will be removed and the <italic toggle="yes">insert</italic> from which such loop(s) will be transplanted. These structures can either be uploaded by the user from their local file system or be retrieved from RCSB PDB (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). Upon loading, the SSEs of the input proteins are automatically calculated using DSSP (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>), and the two proteins are superimposed using the CE algorithm (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>).</p>
        <p>LoopGrafter web server is designed to assist the user in the loop grafting effort in six separate steps: (i) secondary structure definition; (ii) loop exploration; (iii) flexibility evaluation; (iv) correlation evaluation; (v) loop pairing; and (vi) loop grafting (Figure <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The user’s progress through these six steps is permanently monitored in a flow chart presented at the top right corner of the web server page. The completion of this workflow is required to start the loop grafting calculations. The outcome of these calculations is provided in an intuitive visual interface on the Results page.</p>
        <list list-type="bullet">
          <list-item>
            <p><italic toggle="yes">Secondary structure definition</italic>: As the proteins are uploaded, the secondary structure assignment can be visualized in a two-dimensional (2D) representation presented under the ‘Secondary structure’ caption, and their structures are shown in the 3D viewer situated at the upper left side of the web server page. At this step, the user is allowed to redefine such SSEs, by selecting regions on the 2D representation and changing its secondary structure assignment to <italic toggle="yes">sheet</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">helix</italic> or <italic toggle="yes">coil</italic>.</p>
          </list-item>
          <list-item>
            <p><italic toggle="yes">Loop exploration</italic>: Super-secondary structures consisting of two consecutive regular SSEs and the coil segment linking them are automatically extracted from the input proteins. Their geometries are calculated as described in ArchDB (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>) upon user’s request (by pressing the ‘Compute’ button). Once calculated, individual loops are represented as square brackets over and below the 2D representation of the input proteins. These brackets can be clicked to select individual loops and display their geometrical details: <italic toggle="yes">distance</italic> (<italic toggle="yes">D</italic>), and <italic toggle="yes">hoist</italic> (<italic toggle="yes">δ</italic>), <italic toggle="yes">packing</italic> (<italic toggle="yes">θ</italic>) and <italic toggle="yes">meridian</italic> (<italic toggle="yes">ρ</italic>) angles, which are the parameters describing the geometry of the loop (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). The selected loops can be zoomed and highlighted in the 3D viewer (upper left in the web server page) by clicking on the box-like 3D view button. Furthermore, when multiple loops are selected, these parameters can easily be compared in the ‘Geometry comparison view’, which presents a bar chart for comparing distances and dial graphs for inspecting the different angles. During this step, the user can define their own loops by clicking and dragging over the 2D view of any of the two input proteins, thus making a new loop selection that can be identified by a user given name. This feature is especially relevant to avoid small structure elements that might be detected in the region(s) of interest for grafting.</p>
          </list-item>
          <list-item>
            <p><italic toggle="yes">Flexibility evaluation</italic>: Since a rational driver for loop grafting efforts is to optimize the dynamical behaviour of the grafted region (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10–16</xref>), LoopGrafter provides the users with a quick assessment of the flexibility of the scaffold protein based on experimental data and elastic network models (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). The user can select which of these flexibility assessment sources he or she is interested in, and the flexibility values are automatically calculated for every alpha carbon in the scaffold protein. In the case of input NMR ensembles, <italic toggle="yes">B</italic>-factors are calculated from the root-mean-squared fluctuations comprised in the ensemble. For each selected flexibility assessment source method, flexibility values can be displayed in the 2D representation of the protein by selecting the preferred representation from the combo box at the top right corner of the ‘Flexibility evaluation’ section. Flexibility values are colour coded according to a colour-scale scheme shown in the upper right, and can be displayed for each alpha carbon in the scaffold protein or averaged per each SSE. Below, the averaged values per super-secondary structure (loop) are shown in separated boxes according to the same scale. Each of such boxes contains a plus (+) sign that enables the selection of that particular loop as a candidate to be grafted. Any loop can be selected for grafting regardless of their assessed flexibility. Below the 3D viewer, the candidate loops to be grafted and the preserved ones are listed during the whole process. Finally, at the bottom of this section, the agreement between the different flexibility methods is presented in the form of correlation values (Figure <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>).</p>
          </list-item>
          <list-item>
            <p><italic toggle="yes">Correlation evaluation</italic>: Once one or more loops are selected as candidates to be grafted, their correlated movements with other parts of the protein can be assessed in this section of the workflow. Here, two different values are presented: (i) the cross-correlation of the selected loops (super-secondary structures) to any other loops in the protein, shown in light shade, and (ii) the cross-correlation of the coil segment of the selected loops to any SSE in the other loops of the protein. The first metric gives an idea of the overall accord of the motion of the selected loops with others. Except in the case of loops present in regions with an important dynamic gradient (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>), these cross-correlations are typically positive and large for neighbouring loops. In contrast, the second metric focuses on the coil segment of the selected loops, which is usually more flexible and the main target of engineering. This segment-centred metric gives a more precise idea of the possible reciprocal conformational influence between the selected loop and other regions in the protein. The cross-correlation values are colour coded and range from −1 (red hue, perfect anti-cross-correlation) to 1 (blue hue, perfect cross-correlation). If by means of this exploration, a strong cross-correlation between the selected loops and other loops in the scaffold protein is detected, the inclusion of such cross-correlated loops as candidates to be grafted might be considered.</p>
          </list-item>
          <list-item>
            <p><italic toggle="yes">Loop pairing</italic>: Each of the selected loops to be grafted in the scaffold protein is paired to an equivalent loop in the insert protein during this step, which can be done either automatically or manually. The user is presented with the 2D representations of the two proteins enriched with a display of the selected loops for grafting in the scaffold protein and all the loops in the insert protein. If the manual pairing is chosen, the user is required to pick a replacement equivalent from the insert protein for each of the selected loops. Upon selection of such replacement or after automatic pairing, a comparison of the geometrical parameters of the scaffold and insert loop is presented (as described earlier in the ‘Loop exploration’ step). It has to be noted that the paired loops need to be structurally equivalent. This means that the pair of loops needs to be reasonably overlaid in space after the CE superimposition (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>) of the two input proteins (see the ‘Exploration of the grafted region possible boundaries’ section). When the selected loops are not structurally compatible, the server will not prevent the user from proceeding to the next step, but the number of presented solutions will be dramatically reduced or, more likely, will be none (see below). This task can easily be guided by the 3D superimposition of the input proteins available in the 3D viewer.</p>
          </list-item>
          <list-item>
            <p><italic toggle="yes">Loop grafting</italic>: The last step of the workflow consists of preparing the required information for producing 3D models of the different possibilities for grafting the selected loops and assessing their stability. First, after pressing the ‘Compute grafting sequences’ button, all the possible boundaries in the grafted region(s) that generate different sequences are explored (see the ‘Materials and Methods’ section). After this initial exploration, the user is informed about the total number of different grafting variants the server will generate and their sequences can be downloaded in JSON format. Compared to available loop remodelling tools (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17–19</xref>), LoopGrafter does not require the input of the sequence of the final chimeric protein design. Instead, it explores all possibilities for recombination points around the region(s) where the insert structure needs to be placed. Then, after acknowledging ownership of licenses for MODELLER (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>) and optionally for Rosetta (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>), the calculations can be started by clicking on the ‘Start modelling’ button. It has to be noted that MODELLER is required to generate 3D models for each of the grafted variants and to calculate DOPE scores (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>), and that Rosetta FastRelax is required to obtain Rosetta scores (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). Both tools are free for academic users. A bookmarkable link is provided to track the progress of the calculations. It can also be retrieved at any moment by introducing the session ID (permanently shown in the lower left corner of the LoopGrafter web interface) in the ‘Grafting results’ box present in the right part of the upper horizontal menu under the grafting workflow scheme.</p>

After systematic exploration of possible grafting boundaries (recombination points), the server provides a list of designed sequences.

      <title>Use case: transplanting two loops from <italic toggle="yes">Renilla</italic> luciferase to a bifunctional ancestor of luciferase and dehalogenases</title>
      <p>The grafting strategy presented here has been successfully implemented in grafting a particular loop from the bioluminescent <italic toggle="yes">Renilla</italic> luciferase (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>) to a structurally related scaffold. The scaffold was a bifunctional reconstructed ancestral protein catalysing both a hydrolytic dehalogenation of small halogenated compound and a light-emitting monooxygenation of a bulky coelenterazine molecule (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). Based on the previous observation of the dynamic behaviour of one particular loop in a dynamic hinge region (a loop connecting the rigid main domain with the flexible cap domain of the protein), the transplantation of such loop resulted in a grafted engineered protein (PDB ID 6S97) with improved bioluminescence. In more detail, scaffold residues 146–166 were replaced with residues 148–167 from the insert, and the grafting variant rendered a 40 000-fold more efficient bioluminescent reaction when compared to that of the scaffold enzyme. Furthermore, the grafting variant had a higher affinity towards the substrate and lower product inhibition compared to <italic toggle="yes">Renilla</italic> luciferase, but only reached 20% of its efficiency (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>).</p>
      <sec id="SEC3-2-1">
        <title>Data input</title>
        <p>The grafting approach reported there can be replicated using the LoopGrafter. First, in the ‘Protein upload’ step the bifunctional ancestor should be introduced as scaffold and <italic toggle="yes">Renilla</italic> luciferase as insert. The asymmetric unit of the bifunctional ancestor (PDB ID 6G75) consists of two relatively similar conformers, so any of the chains can be inputted to the server (here, chain A will be considered). In contrast, the asymmetric unit of <italic toggle="yes">Renilla</italic> luciferase (PDB ID 2PSF) contains two different conformers, one corresponding to an open cap domain (chain A) and the other corresponding to a closed one (chain B). Since the closed cap domain (chain B) is more similar to the scaffold bifunctional ancestor, it should be chosen as input for the insert protein. The global similarity between the proteins should be noted: scaffold and insert only differ by 1.27 Å RMSD after CE superimposition and 2% in sequence length. Crucially, the similarity values recommended for using LoopGrafter are &lt;8 Å RMSD and &lt;20% difference in sequence length.</p>
        <p>The two input proteins result in different secondary structure assignments in the N-terminal region connecting the main and cap domains (residues 135–167 in the scaffold protein). Particularly, a small helical element is present in the scaffold (residues 151–153) but not in the insert protein. Since this region is important for the grafting experiment, the helical structure can be deleted from the scaffold protein in this step. Alternatively, a user-defined loop bypassing the small helical structure can be defined on the scaffold protein in the next step. In case such knowledge about the importance of the region is not available at this moment of the process, the steps in the web server can always be traced back and one of the two strategies can be used. In this example, the region 151–153 from the scaffold protein was selected and set to ‘coil’.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="SEC3-2-2">
        <title>Flexibility assessment</title>
        <p>After calculating loops and their geometries in the second step (‘Loop exploration’ step), the flexibility and dynamic properties of the scaffold protein can be assessed in the third one (‘Flexibility evaluation’ step). From this analysis, the loop 6g75_A_135 can be identified as a key element connecting stationary and dynamic parts of the scaffold protein. This loop corresponds to loop 9 in (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>) and is the loop the authors successfully grafted to confer the scaffold protein a more efficient bioluminescence. Also, it is noteworthy that this loop plays a key role in opening and closing the active site pocket of both input proteins (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). This loop can be marked for inclusion in the grafting protocol by clicking on the plus symbol on it. It is worth noting that, regardless of the flexibility values calculated, any loop can be included in the grafting protocol. Thus, loops bridging more rigid or more flexible parts of the input protein could be grafted as well.</p>
        <p>Other regions in the scaffold protein that have coordinated movements with the selected loop(s) can be identified in the ‘Correlation evaluation’ step. In this example, the loop 6g75_A_210 strikingly has a notable cross-correlation with the motions of the coil segment of the previously selected loop (<italic toggle="yes">R</italic> = 0.42). This loop was not considered in the original grafting effort on the bifunctional ancestral scaffold. However, because of being involved in the joint dynamic system of opening and closing of the active site pocket, its transplantation brought the bioluminescence efficiency levels of the scaffold to the level of optimized commercially available luciferase (Toul <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, in preparation).</p>

        <title>Grafting preparation</title>
        <p>The final steps on the server before the actual grafting involve pairing the loops to be grafted from the scaffold protein with their equivalents in the insert protein. In this example, the equivalent insert loops to 6g75_A_135 and 6g75_A_210 are 2psf_B_137 and 2psf_B_211, respectively, which can be paired manually or automatically. The steps described here lead to 474 different grafting possibilities, considering the combinations of flanking SSE insertion points for each grafted loop that generate different sequences and all the possible combinations of grafted loops.</p>

        <p>The 474 chimeric sequences generate their corresponding 3D model scores ranging between 1716 and 2458 units according to MODELLER metric (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>) and between −262 and 67 Rosetta energy units (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). These scores are reported in arbitrary units and can be taken as a proxy for the energy of the model, and as a rule of thumb they are better as they get lower. The chimera constructed in the aforementioned publication (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>) scored 1839 units in MODELLER and −207 energy units in Rosetta, ranking 4th and 1st out of 18 possible single loop 6g75_A_135 designs. The experimentally attempted design for the second loop, 6g75_A_210, scored 1771 units in MODELLER and −150 energy units in Rosetta, ranking 2nd and 21st out of 24 possible single loop designs, respectively. The combined loop design achieved the score of 1928 units in MODELLER and −197 energy units in Rosetta, ranking 10th and 59th out of 432 possible designs. Overall, these numbers illustrate the capacity of LoopGrafter in spotting successful chimeric graft designs.

      <title>Comparison to available loop remodelling tools</title>
      <p>In order to illustrate the utility of LoopGrafter, we attempted to reproduce the same case study presented here using DaReUS-Loop (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>), a web server for loop remodelling that in its advanced mode of use allows for the generation of chimeric models. Given a gapped 3D structure, and the complete sequence of the protein to model (see the ‘Materials and Methods’ section), it performs a homology search to find structures to cover the gaps in the input 3D structure and generates 3D models for the identified loops, independently for each loop. DaReUS-Loop identifies the <italic toggle="yes">Renilla</italic> luciferase as source for the first loop (6g75_A_135), but not for the second one (6g75_A_210) (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table S1</xref>). The solution by LoopGrafter (combined loop design) achieved similar or better RMSD than the two solutions by DaReUS-Loop that identified the <italic toggle="yes">Renilla</italic> luciferase as source in the first loop (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table S1</xref>) when compared to the chimeric crystal structure reported in the case study presented earlier (PDB ID 6s97) (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Even when the second loop was not grafted in the original publication (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>), LoopGrafter results on this loop resemble more the original structure than DaReUS-Loop ones (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table S1</xref>). <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S1</xref> summarizes this comparison. LoopGrafter and DaReUS-Loop (as a representative of a loop remodelling tool repurposed for loop grafting) greatly differ in input requirements and outputs. <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table S2</xref> presents a summary of such differences. Among them, it is worth noting that LoopGrafter does not require the chimeric solution (sequence of the resulting protein) as input, but offers all possibilities of chimeras exploring different recombination points along the flanking regular secondary structures of the loops to be grafted.</p>

    <title>DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS</title>
    <p>LoopGrafter is a web-based application designed to provide guidance in the process of transplanting loops between homologous, structurally related proteins. The power of this technique in protein engineering has been shown in the past (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Surprisingly, loop-based rational protein engineering lacks systematic support (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). Other available tools and approaches addressing the problem of remodelling existing or missing loops in a given protein structure have been recently reviewed (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). However, transplanting a loop between two related proteins represents an entirely different scenario to that of loop remodelling, and thus those tools can rarely help in this particular task.</p>
    <p>With the aim of assisting the non-expert in the mission of transplanting loops between structurally related proteins, the server provides a step-by-step procedure at the end of which the user will obtain a number of chimeric designs and structures. The approach successively involves calculating loops and their geometries in the two input proteins, assessing their similarities and dynamics using elastic network models, exploring correlated motions among loops and finally selecting a number of loops to be transplanted. The exploration of the loop dynamics and especially their cross-correlations is often key to explain the function of proteins (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). The way LoopGrafter presents the cross-correlation analysis to the user enables the easy discovery of motion-entangled loops. Indeed, loops lining the access pathways to the enzyme catalytic centre can exert control over different aspects of the kinetics of the enzyme activity (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>).</p>
    <p>When designing chimeric proteins, one of the most difficult questions is deciding the exact sequence points where to perform the excision. ProtLego is a recent tool designed to generate interdomain chimeras (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>) that is exploring all possible excision points where the two related proteins structurally overlap in their single recombination point problem. In comparison, transplanting loops between structurally related proteins requires considering two recombination points for each loop to be transplanted. Even when LoopGrafter has looser requirements for defining such overlapping recombination points (1.9 Å compared to 1 Å in ProtLego), it still considers all possibilities that generate sequence diversity in the pool of chimeric designs. This provides the researcher with a systematic overview of all the possible grafting designs that can be tailored with their query proteins.</p>
    <p>Finally, we have showcased that the scoring systems from MODELLER and Rosetta help identifying loop-grafted chimeric designs that encompass structural and biological meaning. Among all generated chimeric sequences, based on the provided scores, the user can select the designs more likely to be successful in the lab. In the use case described here, experimentally successful loop-grafted chimeric proteins were favourably scored by both methods (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). The tool has been thoroughly validated against four additional biomolecular systems with grafted loops (Supplementary Data): monomeric triosephosphate isomerase (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>), immunoglobulin-like β-sandwich protein tenascin (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>), tyrosine phosphatases and <italic toggle="yes">Streptococcus pyogenes</italic> sortase A (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). In these four instances, LoopGrafter was able to identify the exact excision sequence (or one that is very close to) that was used in the experimental loop transplantation exercises. Other domains in which we envisage LoopGrafter could be exploited are CDR transplantation in antibody design (i.e. for antibody humanization) and the transplantation of loops with the purpose of designing inhibited (non-catalytic) protein variants and to tailor protein inhibitors for proteases. Relying on these strengths, we are positive that LoopGrafter will be a useful tool in helping the experimental efforts of protein and metabolic engineers. Future developments can focus on loop grafting in heterologous protein structures exploiting geometrical search engines (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>) to fetch compatible loops from the PDB (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>) and improving scoring functions for more reliable identification of functional designs.</p>
