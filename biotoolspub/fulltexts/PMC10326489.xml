      <sec id="s1">
        <title>Background</title>
        <p>Characterizing and quantifying cell types within glioblastoma (GBM) tumors at scale will facilitate a better understanding of the association between the cellular landscape and tumor phenotypes or clinical correlates. We aimed to develop a tool that deconvolutes immune and neoplastic cells within the GBM tumor microenvironment from bulk RNA sequencing data.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="s2">
        <title>Methods</title>
        <p>We developed an IDH wild-type (IDHwt) GBM-specific single immune cell reference consisting of B cells, T-cells, NK-cells, microglia, tumor associated macrophages, monocytes, mast and DC cells. We used this alongside an existing neoplastic single cell-type reference for astrocyte-like, oligodendrocyte- and neuronal progenitor-like and mesenchymal GBM cancer cells to create both marker and gene signature matrix-based deconvolution tools. We applied single-cell resolution imaging mass cytometry (IMC) to ten IDHwt GBM samples, five paired primary and recurrent tumors, to determine which deconvolution approach performed best.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="s3">
        <title>Results</title>
        <p>Marker-based deconvolution using GBM-tissue specific markers was most accurate for both immune cells and cancer cells, so we packaged this approach as GBMdeconvoluteR. We applied GBMdeconvoluteR to bulk GBM RNAseq data from The Cancer Genome Atlas and recapitulated recent findings from multi-omics single cell studies with regards associations between mesenchymal GBM cancer cells and both lymphoid and myeloid cells. Furthermore, we expanded upon this to show that these associations are stronger in patients with worse prognosis.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="s4">
        <title>Conclusions</title>
        <p>GBMdeconvoluteR accurately quantifies immune and neoplastic cell proportions in IDHwt GBM bulk RNA sequencing data and is accessible here: <ext-link xlink:href="https://gbmdeconvoluter.leeds.ac.uk" ext-link-type="uri">https://gbmdeconvoluter.leeds.ac.uk</ext-link>.</p>

      <title>Importance of the Study</title>
    </caption>
    <p>The cellular composition of IDH wild-type glioblastoma tumors (IDHwt GBM) impacts the cancer’s progression and response to treatment in ways that can likely be therapeutically exploited. To enable rapid and high-throughput deconvolution of the cell landscape of GBM tumors, we have developed GBMdeconvoluteR: the first publicly accessible web-based tool that accurately quantifies both immune and neoplastic cell populations within GBMs from bulk tumor RNA sequencing data. We used high-resolution imaging mass cytometry to validate our tool, and applied it to data from The Cancer Genome Atlas to show its applicability for confirming, and expanding upon, recent findings from single-cell muti-omics studies. GBMdeconvoluteR is available at <ext-link xlink:href="https://gbmdeconvoluter.leeds.ac.uk" ext-link-type="uri">https://gbmdeconvoluter.leeds.ac.uk</ext-link>.</p>
  </boxed-text>
  <p>Glioblastoma (GBM) brain tumors consist of a multitude of different neoplastic and non-neoplastic cell types.<sup><xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> The specific cancer cell subtypes within a GBM are directly influenced by the cellular composition of the microenvironment, which also has a role in shaping the progression of the tumor and its adaption to stressors including treatment.<sup><xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2–4</xref></sup> It is of paramount importance to accurately characterize the cellular make-up of GBM tumors. This will enable us to understand the phenotypes associated with changing cell landscapes within individual tumors, and to assess correlation between specific cell populations and the efficacy of new treatments, particularly immunotherapies. Whilst single cell and spatial-profiling approaches currently offer the highest resolution of cellular deconvolution, they are technically challenging, and prohibitively costly for larger sample numbers.</p>
  <p>Instead, approaches that propose to quantify cell types from bulk tissue RNA sequencing data have become increasingly popular.<sup><xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5–9</xref></sup> These can be split into two main types: those that employ a full cell-type gene-expression signature matrix; and those based on marker-genes for specific cell types. A widely-adopted implementation of the former approach is CIBERSORTx,<sup><xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> which was recently used to delineate pan-glioma cell types.<sup><xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> However, key studies have shown that the accuracy of any gene-expression based computational deconvolution tool is mostly derived from the signature matrix, or marker-genes, underpinning it, which must be derived from the tissue of interest.<sup><xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> We, thus, decided to create a tool that can specifically quantify cancer cell types, as delineated by Neftel et al,<sup><xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> and immune cell types from bulk IDHwt GBM tumor sequencing data. We developed this tool by amalgamating four independent single-cell GBM datasets to derive signature matrices for use with CIBERSORTx and marker-genes for use with MCPcounter. The latter was chosen as it has been benchmarked as one of the most accurate marker-gene-based tools available, giving consistently high correlation with ground truths across cell types.<sup><xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> We then compared results from these GBM-specific programmes to those from orthogonal cell quantification, using single-cell resolution imaging mass cytometry, on the same IDHwt GBM samples. We included both primary and recurrent GBM samples in our tool development and validation, to enable separate quantification of accuracy in longitudinal samples. We found that the MCPcounter based tool performed best at delineating both immune and neoplastic cancer cell populations and have made this publicly available as GBMdeconvoluteR: an online tool accessible via <ext-link xlink:href="https://gbmdeconvoluter.leeds.ac.uk" ext-link-type="uri">https://gbmdeconvoluter.leeds.ac.uk</ext-link>.</p>

      <p>Single cell datasets were amalgamated. Neoplastic cells were filtered, as has been done previously, by inferring and removing those with large-scale copy-number variations such as Chr. 7 amplification and Chr. 10 deletion using the inferCNV R package (version 1.3.3).<sup><xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> The inferCNV object was created using “CreateInfercnvObject()” taking the raw counts (stored in the “RNA” assay of the Seurat object) for each dataset. Annotations were not provided, instead each dataset was grouped according to sample (ie, patient). The gene ordering file used was derived using the annotations from Ensembl Genes 91 for Human build 38 (GRCh38), taking the gene name, chromosome, and gene span. The “ref_group_names” argument was set to NULL, to average signal across all cells to define the baseline. The “run()” function was then used to perform InferCNV operations to reveal the copy-number variation signal. A cut-off value of 1 was used for all the datasets apart from GSE163120, where a value of 0.1 was used as suggested by the documentation for InferCNV.</p>

      <p>Immune cell marker genes were identified from the integrated, clustered and annotated data using the scran R package (version 1.2.2).<sup><xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> The findMarkers function was used to identify candidate marker genes by testing for those that were differentially expressed (DE) between pairs of clusters using both <italic toggle="yes">t</italic>-test and Wilcoxon rank sum tests. Both “all” and “any” <italic toggle="yes">pval.type</italic> arguments were used to identify genes which were DE between any two clusters and highly ranked/significantly upregulated genes for a given cluster (all) or significantly upregulated compared with all other clusters (any). The multiMarkerStats function was then used to combine multiple sets of marker statistics. Neoplastic GBM cell marker genes were taken directly from Neftel et al<sup><xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> but were filtered to remove non GBM tumor intrinsic genes, to negate the noise that would result from expression of these in the tumor microenvironment.<sup><xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> Marker genes for a variety of GBM neoplastic and non-neoplastic cell types have recently been made available as a resource entitled GBMap.

These were used to train a random forest classifier, which returned probability masks for each image. The generated probability maps were processed to create single-cell masks using the image analysis software CellProfiler (version 4.1.3). First, probabilities were histogram-equalized (256 bins and kernel size of 17), and then a Gaussian filter was applied to enhance contrast and smooth the probabilities. Subsequently, an Otsu two-class thresholding approach was used to segment nuclear masks. Cell masks were derived from an expansion of nuclear masks using a maximum expansion of 3 pixels. The CellProfiler single cell masks were ultimately overlaid onto the single-cell segmentation masks and single-channel tiff images of all measured channels to extract single-cell marker expression means. The single-cell data was read into R using read_steinbock from the imcRtools R package (version 1.2.3) and the expression counts were transformed using an inverse hyperbolic sine function (cofactor = 5). The expression counts were corrected for channel spillover using a non-negative least squares method as previously described.<sup><xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> Briefly, each metal-conjugated antibody was spotted on an agarose-coated slide, and this was ablated to generate a background signal which could be used for compensation using the R Bioconductor package CATALYST (version1.20.1).</p>

      <p>Four independent single cell GBM datasets (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) were used to derive marker genes, or signature gene-expression matrices, for GBM tumor-infiltrating immune cells: B cells, T-cells, natural killer (NK) cells, microglia, tumor associated macrophages (TAM), monocytes, mast and dendritic cells (DC). <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref> outlines the process. Datasets underwent pre-processing independently to filter out poor quality cells and copy-number analysis to remove neoplastic cells, before being amalgamated. There were significant batch effects owing to different sequencing platforms and originating centres but these were effectively removed using regularized negative binomial regression<sup><xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup> (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S1A</xref>). One dataset (GSE163120) included the immune cell annotations determined by the original study. This information was used to guide clustering, with optimization focused first on maximizing cluster stability and then on the best separation of pre-annotated cell types.<sup><xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> Owing to the difficulty in separating immune types that are known to have similar and overlapping gene-expression profiles (namely TAM and microglia; and NK and T-cells) cells assigned to any of these groupings were isolated and further sub-clustered, resulting in definitive cluster annotations (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S1B</xref>).</p>

      <p>GBM-specific marker genes for each immune cell type were then derived by using differential expression analysis to highlight the top 25 genes, per annotated cluster, that were uniquely or predominantly expressed in that cluster, and visually checking these to identify specific cell-type markers corresponding to each immune cell type (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref rid="sup2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table S6</xref>). Marker genes for GBM cancer cell subtypes were adopted from Neftel et al.<sup><xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> In that study, four neoplastic GBM cell types were delineated from single cell data. We extracted the marker genes that Neftel et al<sup><xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> showed to delineate the four subtypes, but then removed those that are also expressed in the GBM tumor microenvironment, and would therefore confound the results of application to bulk tissue profiles (<xref rid="sup2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table S7</xref>).</p>
      <p>Single cell expression profiles for annotated GBM-associated immune cells, from our combined datasets, or for annotated GBM cancer cell subtypes, from Neftel et al, were amalgamated into a full gene-expression matrix.

      <title>Developing and Validating the Deconvolution Approach</title>
      <p>Two gene-expression based computational deconvolution approaches were investigated owing to previous benchmarking studies finding them to be the best full gene-expression signature matrix-based approach (CIBERSORTx) and marker gene-based approach (MCPcounter) available.<sup><xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> The approaches are distinct and give results with different interpretations. gene-expression signature matrix methods such as CIBERSORTx attempt to quantify cell types in a single sample, enabling comparison of proportions of all cell types within and between samples. Marker gene-based methods like MCPcounter instead score a single cell type for comparison of prevalence across samples; the score from cell type A cannot be compared with cell type B so within-sample comparisons of different cell types is not possible. To ascertain the accuracy of these programmes and determine which performed best, we identified five primary and matched recurrent GBM samples on which to perform both gene-expression based and IMC-based cell type deconvolution (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S2</xref>). The latter is an approach that characterizes cells, according to protein expression, at single cell resolution in tissues using up to 40 antibodies (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). We assembled and validated a panel of antibodies known to distinguish tumor-infiltrating macrophages, microglia, monocytes, NK and T-cells (<xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> and <xref rid="sup2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table S4</xref>).</p>

      <p>MCPcounter can be used in default mode in which in-built canonical immune cells markers are employed. When running the programme in this mode it can only be used for immune cell estimation and we refer to it as MCP<sub>default</sub>. In contrast, the mode using the GBM-tissue specific immune and neoplastic cell markers listed in <xref rid="sup2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Tables S6 and S7</xref> is denoted MCP<sub>GBM.</sub> In addition, at the time of preparing this manuscript a larger GBM-specific single cell resource, GBmap, was made available that amalgamated 26 single cell brain and GBM datasets.<sup><xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> We, thus, also ran MCPcounter using the GBmap marker genes, denoting this as MCP<sub>GBmap</sub>.</p>
      <p>We inspected the concordance between the absolute cell proportions predicted by CIBERSORTx, or the relative cell type prevalence scores that resulted from each version of MCPcounter, and the quantification by IMC. We did this for all tumors together (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref> and <xref rid="sup2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table S8</xref>) and for primary and recurrent GBM tumors separately (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S3A</xref> and <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S8</xref>).

      <p>The four GBM cell types described by Neftel et al<sup><xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> are delineated by gene-expression. Recent studies have shown that such transcriptional cell-type markers often do not translate to protein level markers for use in approaches such as IMC.<sup><xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup> We set out to test this for the GBM neoplastic cell types, specifically. To that end, in our IMC panel we included antibodies against markers of the four neoplastic GBM cell types from Neftel et al, prioritizing those that overlapped with markers of GBM cancer cell subsets identified in two independent studies: Wang et al<sup><xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> and Couturier et al<sup><xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> (<xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> and <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary S4</xref>).

      <p>Results (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref> and <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S3B and Table S9</xref>) suggest that the protein markers that we selected are capable of delineating neoplastic cell types: performance varied per method and cell type but to the same degree that it did with well-established immune cell protein markers. Again, when judging performance based on correlation with IMC, MCP<sub>GBM</sub> performed best overall: across all samples, the average Pearson’s <italic toggle="yes">r</italic> was 0.43 between IMC and MCP<sub>GBM</sub> compared with 0.02 between IMC and CIBERSORTx; and 0.22 between IMC and MCP<sub>GBmap</sub> (<xref rid="sup2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table S9</xref>)</p>

      <title>Application to TCGA Data</title>
      <p>Our results show that MCP<sub>GBM</sub> is able to accurately quantify immune and neoplastic cells in GBM-tissue bulk sequencing data. To show how this can be useful in gaining biological and clinical insights from large-scale studies, we applied MCP<sub>GBM</sub> to bulk RNAseq data from 93 GBM samples from The Cancer Genomic Atlas (TCGA). This gave a score per cell type per sample, allowing us to quantify the correlation of cell type prevalence across patients (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). Recent spatial, multi-omics studies have suggested that different neoplastic GBM cell types associate with, and are programmed by, different environmental niches of GBM tumors.<sup><xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> A key finding was that mesenchymal (MES) cancer cells associate with both myeloid and lymphoid compartments, whereas the remaining neoplastic cell types (AC-, NPC- and OPC-like cells) are significantly depleted in immune-rich regions. Our results recapitulate these findings: we observed significant, high, positive correlations between MES and all immune cells quantified, and significant negative correlations between the remaining neoplastic cell types. This phenomenon was more pronounced for non-MES neoplastic cells associated with neuronal development (NPC- and OPC-like cells) than for AC-like cells, also in keeping with the previous findings.<sup><xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> Based on the high numbers of samples in TCGA we were able to further separate patients using overall survival (OS) quartiles to extract worse prognosis (OS less than the lower quartile of 8.55 months) and better prognosis (OS greater than the upper quartile of 20.55 months) cohorts and compare score distributions (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>) and correlations (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>) in these patient subsets. The prevalence scores of cell types is not significantly different between worse or better prognosis patients (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). This finding is in agreement with a recent study that defined GBM tumor subtypes based on the tumor microenvironment, but showed no difference in survival between them.<sup><xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup> However, our results show that the correlations between cell-types are markedly different between better and worse prognosis patients (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). Patients with worse prognosis have higher and more significant correlations (both negative and positive) between neoplastic and immune cell types. The tumor microenvironment has been shown to shape the neoplastic cell landscape over time in GBM, with more aggressive tumors being linked to greater polarity and classification of neoplastic subtypes.<sup><xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup> Our results suggest that, in worse prognosis tumors, neoplastic and immune cells are more tightly associated, potentially through more direct inter-cellular communications, which could be promising therapeutic targets. These preliminary results exemplify how our tool can be used to develop new insights and hypotheses, by being applicable to large-scale datasets.</p>

      <title>Incorporating Additional GBM Cell Types and Making Our Approach Available Via GBMdeconvoluteR</title>
      <p>To make MCP<sub>GBM</sub> available to the neuro-oncology community, we have packaged it into an online application called GBMdeconvoluteR. We also give the user the option to use the marker genes from GBMap<sup><xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> because, although these did not quantify cell types as accurately as MCP<sub>GBM</sub>, the GBMap reference set extends the range of GBM non-neoplastic cell types that can be quantified from bulk expression data. GBMdeconvoluteR is, thus, a web-based application that enables users to upload bulk GBM expression profiles and output the relative proportion of immune and neoplastic GBM cells, or using GBMap markers genes as input, to also include normal brain and blood-vessel cells, across multiple samples.</p>
    </sec>
  </sec>
  <sec id="s34">
    <title>Discussion</title>
    <p>We have developed the first publicly available GBM-specific deconvolution tool that can infer both neoplastic and non-neoplastic cell population prevalence from bulk GBM tumor RNA sequencing data. This tool was developed by amalgamating four independent, human, single cell sequencing datasets to create tissue specific cell type gene-expression reference profiles. The single cell data was from <italic toggle="yes">de novo</italic> IDHwt GBM either at initial diagnosis (primary) or upon recurrence. Recurrent GBMs have been shown to have altered transcriptional profiles which may impact on the accuracy of the deconvolution results,<sup><xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> so we included these samples in the tool development and validation. We found that our approach is suitable for deconvoluting recurrent GBM tumors but, in keeping with the aforementioned studies, neoplastic cell deconvolution is not as accurate at the longitudinal time point. Our study confirms, as shown elsewhere, that tissue specific reference datasets are necessary to achieve maximal accuracy in expression based deconvolution.<sup><xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup></p>
    <p>We used IMC to ascertain the ground truth of cell type characterization and quantification. We then compared this with the results from the gene-expression based approaches to determine which should underpin our tool, and to establish its accuracy. However, it must be noted that the regions that underwent IMC, whilst encompassed within, were substantially smaller than regions that underwent RNAseq (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S2</xref>), and that the GBM microenvironment is notoriously heterogeneous.<sup><xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> That, and the fact that IMC was performed on different, albeit, adjacent tissue sections, means that a deviation from perfect correlation is not just a result of gene-expression deconvolution tool performance, but also in bona fide differences in cell proportions. In this way, the IMC results do not quantify the accuracy of each gene-expression based tool, but does enable comparison between them to identify the best-performer.</p>
    <p>Our study is the first to evaluate whether the marker genes of the four GBM neoplastic cell types, determined by Neftel at al from gene-expression data, are preferentially expressed at the protein level. We found a clear association between the protein levels of the selected markers and the gene-expression based quantification.</p>
    <p>GBMdeconvoluteR is a publicly available webserver, enabling researchers to accurately determine the cell types and prevalence in GBM samples from bulk RNAseq data. The marker-gene MCPcounter based method was the most accurate. It should be noted that marker-based deconvolution results in relative, rather than absolute, cell type quantification meaning comparison is possible within cell types across samples, rather than within samples across cell types. We applied GBMdeconvoluteR to data from TCGA and were able to confirm recent findings from single cell resolution multi-omics studies, regarding the specific enrichment of MES neoplastic cells in immune compartments, and depletion of other GBM cancer cell types. However, because our approach is easily applicable to large-scale sequencing dataset, we could expand upon this further to show that this association is stronger in samples from patients with worst prognosis. This leads to the hypothesis that quantifying immune:neoplastic cell interactions could be prognostic, or that targeting them could be therapeutically beneficial, exemplifying the value in applying GBMdeconvoluteR to gain biological and clinical insights.</p>
    <p>In summary, GBMdeconvoluteR can be used to assess associations between cell type quantities and phenotypic, molecular or clinical characteristics with applications for target identification, gaining mechanistic insight or stratifying samples for retrospective therapeutic evaluation or prospective precision medicine approaches.</p>
