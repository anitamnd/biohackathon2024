    <abstract>
      <p>Fluorescence microscopy is a critical tool for cell biology studies on bacterial cell division and morphogenesis. Because the analysis of fluorescence microscopy images evolved beyond initial qualitative studies, numerous images analysis tools were developed to extract quantitative parameters on cell morphology and organization. To understand cellular processes required for bacterial growth and division, it is particularly important to perform such analysis in the context of cell cycle progression. However, manual assignment of cell cycle stages is laborious and prone to user bias. Although cell elongation can be used as a proxy for cell cycle progression in rod-shaped or ovoid bacteria, that is not the case for cocci, such as <italic toggle="yes">Staphylococcus aureus.</italic> Here, we describe eHooke, an image analysis framework developed specifically for automated analysis of microscopy images of spherical bacterial cells. eHooke contains a trained artificial neural network to automatically classify the cell cycle phase of individual <italic toggle="yes">S. aureus</italic> cells. Users can then apply various functions to obtain biologically relevant information on morphological features of individual cells and cellular localization of proteins, in the context of the cell cycle.</p>

    <title>Introduction</title>
    <p>Automated analysis of microscopy images of bacterial cells has been a booming field, with several tools being developed in recent years. These include general image analysis software and associated plugins, mainly ImageJ<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref><sup>)</sup> or its “batteries-included” distribution, Fiji<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref><sup>)</sup>, but also more specific tools focused on image analysis of bacterial cells, such as Oufti<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref><sup>)</sup> or MicrobeJ<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref><sup>)</sup>. These approaches can be instrumental in measuring various morphology parameters of bacterial cells. Most of these parameters vary during cell cycle progression, and relevant information can be extracted from their correlation with cell cycle stages. This is particularly important for studying processes at specific cell cycle stages, such as DNA replication, assembly of the divisome, or splitting of a mother cell to originate two daughter cells. Cell length can be used as a proxy for the cell cycle stage in cells with a clear growth axis, such as rods or ovococcoid bacteria. However, this is not the case for cocci, which have a spherical shape. One example of a particularly relevant coccus is the gram-positive pathogen <italic toggle="yes">Staphylococcus aureus,</italic> a major cause of antibiotic-resistant infections and a powerful model for cell division studies<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref><sup>,</sup>
<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref><sup>)</sup>. However, analysis of <italic toggle="yes">S. aureus</italic> microscopy images is hampered by the frequent presence of clumps of adjacent or overlapping cells that result from its characteristic mode of division in orthogonal planes<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref><sup>,</sup>
<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref><sup>)</sup>. Furthermore, the nearly spherical shape of staphylococcal cells impairs simple analysis of the cell cycle<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, a different approach is required for cell segmentation and cell cycle stage assignment of <italic toggle="yes">S. aureus</italic> cells, when compared with model organisms that are elongated, such as <italic toggle="yes">Escherichia coli</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Bacillus subtilis</italic>, or <italic toggle="yes">Caulobacter crescentus.</italic>
</p>
    <p>The cell cycle of <italic toggle="yes">S. aureus</italic> can be described as having three different phases: Phase 1, prior to initiation of division septum synthesis; Phase 2, during which the septum is synthesized; and Phase 3, during which cells have a complete septum that divides the mother cell in two, prior to splitting into two daughter cells<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref><sup>)</sup>. Manual classification of the cell cycle phase of individual cells, based on membrane and DNA morphology, is possible but highly time-consuming and prone to user bias. Here, we describe a deep learning strategy for automated classification of the cell cycle stage of <italic toggle="yes">S. aureus</italic> cells. Deep learning strategies have proved successful in image analysis in various biological contexts, promoting accurate, unbiased quantification of different cellular processes<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref><sup>–</sup>
<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref><sup>)</sup>. The developed software, eHooke, can provide relevant information for individual cells in the context of cell cycle progression, including the identification of different cellular regions, measurement of fluorescence in specific subcellular regions, or measurement of morphological parameters such as area, perimeter, length, width, eccentricity, and irregularity.</p>

    <p>eHooke, developed using Python version 3.6, is a multiplatform framework for the automated analysis of bacterial microscopy images. eHooke also implements a deep learning classification network for classification of the cell cycle phase of individual cells. The software provides a user-friendly interface (Supplementary Figure 1), which allows the user to visualize the results of the different steps performed in eHooke and adjust parameters on the go, to fine-tune image processing. Sections below describe the capabilities of the software, illustrated using specific examples of biological interest.</p>

      <title>Cell segmentation</title>
      <p>To segment single spherical bacterial cells in phase contrast or fluorescence microscopy images, the background is separated from the cells using an isodata thresholding algorithm<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref><sup>)</sup>. The Euclidean distance of each foreground pixel to the background is measured to find the center of individual cells. This segmentation step can also be performed directly on binary masks obtained with other image analysis tools. Individual cells are defined using the calculated centers and a watershed algorithm<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref><sup>)</sup> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1a</xref>). eHooke will then determine the subcellular regions of <italic toggle="yes">S. aureus</italic> cells, namely the cell membrane, the division septum, and the cytoplasm (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1b</xref>). Subcellular segmentation is done by expanding each cell’s outline inward, defining the membrane, and then using the isodata thresholding algorithm<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref><sup>)</sup> to identify the brightest region inside the cell as the septum. The remaining pixels are considered the cytoplasm. At this point, the user has the option to select cells to be included in further analysis and discard inadequately segmented cells.<fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Cell segmentation. (a) Schematic representation of the cell segmentation workflow performed by eHooke. A base image (phase-contrast or inverted fluorescence image) is loaded, and an isodata thresholding algorithm is applied to create a binary mask. This mask separates the background from the foreground and is then used to find the center of individual cells by measuring each pixel’s Euclidean distance to the background. The pixels with the highest Euclidean distance within their surroundings are considered as peaks, which, together with the binary mask, are used to define individual cells by applying a watershed algorithm.

      <title>Automated classification of cell cycle phases</title>
      <p>Various cellular processes or cell phenotypes depend on the cell cycle phase of individual cells. Manually assigning a cell cycle phase to large numbers of individual cells can be significantly time-consuming, requires user training, and is subject to user bias (Supplementary Figure 2). Here, we established an artificial neural network (ANN) to automate cell cycle classification. To do so, we trained the ANN with manually annotated cells, imaged with either a fluorescence widefield or a structured illumination microscopy (SIM) microscope. These data enabled the generation of an ANN model to adequately classify the cell cycle phase of cell images acquired in similar settings, with either a widefield or a SIM microscope. To generate the training dataset, we acquired both widefield and SIM images of <italic toggle="yes">S. aureus</italic> strain JE2<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref><sup>)</sup>, labeled with membrane dye Nile red and DNA dye Hoechst 33342 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2a</xref>) and used eHooke to segment individual cells. A total of 11,370 cells imaged by widefield microscopy and 9,284 cells imaged by SIM were manually classified for the cell cycle phase by groups of two and three users, respectively (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2b</xref>). Of those cell images, 945 widefield and 536 SIM imaged cells were classified by all 12 users, who had different levels of experience in microscopy, but were all familiar with the cell cycle of <italic toggle="yes">S. aureus,</italic> to assess user disagreement during manual classification. Supplementary Figure 2 shows the considerable variation in the results obtained by different users, which was more pronounced for widefield microscopy images. Only correctly segmented cells and where the majority (at least two users of each group or at least seven users for images classified by all users) agreed on the classification were selected for use in datasets (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2b</xref>). From those, 10% of cells from each cell cycle phase were randomly selected and separated from the training dataset to be later used as a test dataset for the trained ANN. The remaining 90% of cells were adjusted by randomly discarding cells from the most frequently represented phases (Phases 1 and 2), so that the training set was composed of the same number of cells for each phase, resulting in a total of 9,786 cells for this dataset. The training dataset was further artificially augmented by rotating each cell image in 23 steps of 15°, producing 234,864 individual cell images.<fig position="float" id="fig2"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>Workflow for generating training and test datasets. (a) <italic toggle="yes">Staphylococcus aureus</italic> JE2 cells were labeled with a membrane (Nile red, in purple) and a DNA (Hoechst 33342, in cyan) dye and imaged by widefield and structured illumination microscopy (SIM). eHooke was then used for cell segmentation generating 11,370 and 9,284 images of single cells obtained by widefield and SIM microscopy, respectively. Scale bar: 1 μm. (b) Each cell image was manually classified according to the cell cycle phase by groups of two (widefield) or three (SIM) users; 945 widefield and 536 SIM cell images (marked *) were classified by all users and later used to compare classifications between users (see Supplementary Figure 2). Only cells where the majority of users agreed on the classification were selected for use in datasets. From these selected cells, 10% of cells in each cell cycle phase were randomly selected and separated to create a test dataset. For the remaining 90% cells, the number of cells in each cell cycle phase was balanced by randomly discarding cells from Phases 1 and 2, so that each phase had the same number of cells in the training dataset. Widefield cell images were then resized to the same size as SIM images. Resized widefield images were combined with SIM images, resulting in a total of 9,786 cell images. Each of these images was further rotated 23 times, 15° at a time, creating the training dataset with 234,864 cell images. For training, a data split of 70% for training and 30% for validation was used.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="S2633903X21000027_fig2" position="float"/></fig>
<fig position="float" id="fig5"><graphic xlink:href="S2633903X21000027_fig5" position="float"/></fig>
</p>
      <p>The training dataset was then used to train a custom-made ANN, composed of seven convolution layers, each followed by a reLU activation layer with three MaxPooling layers intercalated between the first four sets of convolution and activation layers; the network also has a flatten layer, followed by a dense layer, a reLU activation layer, another dense layer, and a SoftMax activation layer (see <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3a</xref> for a schematic representation of network architecture). For the training process, a data split of 70% for training and 30% for validation was used. During training, the ANN extracts features only from cells in the training dataset and uses those features to classify cells in both training and validation datasets. The ANN optimizes feature selection on each epoch to maximize the classification accuracy (calculated as the number of correct classifications per total number of cells) of both training and validation cells. To test whether the selected network architecture was appropriate, we performed ablation studies by training different network architectures corresponding to different depth levels (Supplementary Figure 3a): depth 1 corresponds to a network architecture composed of just one convolution layer, followed by a reLU activation layer and the flatten, dense, and SoftMax activation layers that are at the end of every architecture; higher depths correspond to deeper networks with additions of MaxPooling and convolution layers (followed by reLU activation layers); depth 11 corresponds to the initial architecture, where another dense layer (followed by a reLU activation layer) is added between the flatten and the dense layer that are common to all architectures. Then, we tested the classification accuracy of each architecture, corresponding to different depth levels, using the test dataset composed of 755 and 777 individual cell images obtained by widefield and SIM microscopy, respectively, that were not used during the training step (see <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). This showed that depths 7–10 had only minor (up to 1.6%) increases in overall accuracy (Supplementary Figure 3b and Supplementary Table 1), and therefore we decided to keep our original network architecture, which has been robustly tested by laboratory members in various experimental conditions.<fig position="float" id="fig3"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p>Schematic representation and validation of an artificial neural network (ANN) for automated classification of cell cycle phase of <italic toggle="yes">Staphylococcus aureus</italic> cells.

</p>
      <p>The overall accuracies of the ANN for widefield and SIM images were 84% and 86%, respectively. Confusion matrices for both widefield and SIM images (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3b</xref>, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">c</xref>) show that the trained ANN has a higher accuracy for Phase 1 and Phase 3 cells and lower for Phase 2 cells. The trained ANN was then integrated into eHooke, which allows the user to select cells corresponding to a specific phase, as well as to manually correct any misclassification by the trained ANN.</p>
      <p>To illustrate the usefulness of our model in a biological setting, we acquired images of <italic toggle="yes">S. aureus</italic> strain JE2 and of a mutant containing a transposon insertion in the <italic toggle="yes">sle1</italic> gene, which encodes for a peptidoglycan hydrolase<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref><sup>)</sup> and has been previously shown to have a longer Phase 3 and, therefore, a higher fraction of Phase 3 cells in the population<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref><sup>)</sup>. The trained ANN integrated into eHooke was used to classify the cell cycle phase of each correctly segmented cell. As shown in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3d</xref>, 34% of cells from JE2 parental strain were classified as being in Phase 3, whereas this number increased to 45% in the <italic toggle="yes">sle1</italic> mutant, in agreement with previous data<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref><sup>)</sup>. These results show that the trained ANN enables rapid and accurate cell cycle progression analysis.</p>
      <p>To determine if the trained model is generalizable to data acquired in several types of microscopes, we imaged <italic toggle="yes">S. aureus</italic> JE2 cells with labeled membrane and DNA using three different microscopes, specifically a Zeiss Axio Observer, a Zeiss Elyra PS.1, and a DeltaVision OMX SR microscope. A fourth set of images was obtained by applying a deconvolution algorithm to the images obtained with the OMX SR microscope, using Applied Precision’s softWorx software. Accuracy was equal to or above 84% for all cases except for the images where deconvolution was used, with an overall accuracy of 70% (Supplementary Figure 4). This is probably caused by the fact the training dataset did not contain deconvolved images, which inherently have a different signal profile and a different signal-to-noise ratio. These results indicate that our model may be applied to images obtained with other microscopes if carefully validated.</p>

      <title>Measurement of morphological features</title>
      <p>Standard morphological parameters can be automatically extracted from segmented cells, including cell area, perimeter, length, width, eccentricity, and irregularity (see methods). As these parameters vary along the bacterial cell cycle, measurements obtained from all cells in an asynchronous population may hinder differences associated with specific phases of the cell cycle. eHooke facilitates morphological analysis of cells in distinct cell cycle stages after automatic cell cycle phase classification by the ANN. Users can select cells on a specific cell cycle phase for subsequent analysis. To demonstrate this application, we acquired SIM images of <italic toggle="yes">S. aureus</italic> JE2 cells stained with the membrane dye Nile red (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4a</xref>) and used eHooke to automatically measure cell eccentricity, as well as to classify the cell cycle phase of individual cells. Grouping cells by cell cycle phase showed an increase in eccentricity in later stages of the cell cycle, indicating that cells become more elongated in Phase 3 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4b</xref>), in agreement with previous reports<sup>(</sup>

      <p>Analysis of cell morphology is relevant for many cell biology studies, including studying the mode of action of antimicrobial compounds.

<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref><sup>)</sup> (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4c</xref>).

      <title>Applications of eHooke in cell biology studies</title>
      <p>eHooke was developed to expedite various types of analyses that are useful for cell biology studies. These include:</p>
      <p>(i) Protein localization studies. As an example, we analyzed widefield microscopy images of <italic toggle="yes">S. aureus</italic> NCTC 8325-4 strain expressing a fluorescent derivative of Penicillin Binding Protein PBP2, an enzyme involved in the last stages of peptidoglycan synthesis and that is involved in the expression of β-lactam resistance in <italic toggle="yes">S. aureus</italic><sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref><sup>)</sup> (Supplementary Figure 5a). PBP2 is a membrane-anchored protein, which is enriched at the septum of dividing cells. However, it becomes delocalized and dispersed over the cell membrane in the presence of various classes of antibiotics that inhibit peptidoglycan synthesis, such as β-lactams or glycopeptides<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20</sup></xref><sup>)</sup>. PBP2 localization is a good reporter for peptidoglycan synthesis inhibition and can be assessed by calculating the ratio of the fluorescence of a PBP2 derivative at the septum versus the peripheral membrane<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref><sup>)</sup>. Manual quantification of this fluorescence ratio (FR) is quite laborious. It involves tracing a line on top of each cell encompassing the background and crossing the membrane and septum, plotting the fluorescence profile, and extracting fluorescence intensity values at the septum, membrane, and background. Supplementary Figure 5b shows FR data obtained for cells expressing GFP-PBP2 in the presence or absence of the β-lactam antibiotic oxacillin, either automatically using eHooke (considering the 25% brightest pixels of the septum, FR25) or manually using ImageJ<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref><sup>)</sup>. eHooke data agree well with manual quantification, showing the expected delocalization of PBP2 from the septal region in the presence of oxacillin, which leads to a reduction of FR.</p>
      <p>(ii) Analysis of mixed cell populations. Cell biology studies often require a direct comparison of fluorescence levels in two populations/mutants/strains. These comparisons are most accurate if assessed in the same microscopy image. For these pairwise comparisons, one of the samples can be labeled with a specific dye before mixing with the second sample, so that cells from each population can be easily distinguished under the microscope. The mixed sample analysis can be made automatically in eHooke, by loading a secondary fluorescence channel image corresponding to the specific dye used to distinguish one of the samples. The primary channel corresponds to the fluorescence of the protein/dye of interest. Users can then manually select cells with a signal in the secondary channel or use an automatic selection by setting a threshold in the secondary channel. To illustrate this application, we generated mixed populations (one of which was labeled with DNA dye Hoechst 33342) of cells expressing different levels of Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP), using <italic toggle="yes">S. aureus</italic> RNpGEreporter P<italic toggle="yes"><sub>spac</sub></italic>-GFP<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22</sup></xref><sup>)</sup>, a strain expressing cytoplasmic GFP under the control of the isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) inducible P<italic toggle="yes"><sub>spac</sub></italic> promoter (Supplementary Figure 6). eHooke was then used to measure the mean fluorescence of GFP cytoplasmic signal of both populations, distinguished automatically based on the secondary fluorescence channel (for Hoechst 33342). This simple analysis of mixed populations is helpful for various purposes, including direct comparisons of two samples, analysis of multiple samples using a fixed internal control to normalize absolute fluorescence values, or quantification of anucleate cells (lacking DNA) in a population.</p>
      <p>(iii) Calculation of Pearson’s correlation coefficients (PCCs). Proteins that are part of the same multiprotein complex or involved in the same function often colocalize during part of, or the entire cell cycle. Analysis of protein colocalization can be made by calculating the PCC (see methods) of the fluorescence signals from fluorescent derivatives of the two proteins. A PCC of 1 corresponds to a perfect correlation between the two signals, suggesting that the proteins colocalize during the entire cell cycle; a value of 0 indicates no correlation between the localization of the two proteins, whereas a value of −1 suggests that the two proteins are excluded from the same cellular localization. We have previously shown that PCC measurements can be used to estimate the order of arrival of divisome proteins to the division septum as the cell cycle progresses<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref><sup>)</sup>. We have repeated that analysis using eHooke to calculate the PCC for the signal of fluorescent derivatives of two divisome proteins, FtsW and MurJ, and the early divisome protein FtsZ<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref><sup>)</sup> (Supplementary Figure 7). As FtsZ is the first protein known to arrive at the divisome<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr"><sup>23</sup></xref><sup>)</sup>, early divisome proteins correlate better with FtsZ than late divisome proteins. This type of analysis can also be helpful in other contexts, such as identifying functional pairs of proteins or screening for compounds that disrupt protein–protein interactions.</p>

    <title>Final Remarks</title>
    <p>An obvious benefit of automated image analysis is speed, allowing the analysis of large datasets that would be unmanageable if performed manually. However, an equally important advantage is reproducibility. Quantitative analysis can be straightforward, but even simple measurements, such as determining the length of a cell, imply subjective decisions, like defining the cell’s edge. Qualitative analysis is even more prone to user bias and requires a “trained eye.” We have asked 12 members of the laboratory to classify the cell cycle stage of a common set of cells imaged by widefield microscopy or SIM. Supplementary Figure 2 shows the considerable variation of the results obtained by different users, demonstrating the limitations of analyzing large datasets, where subsets are interpreted by different people. It also indicates that the ground truth of the examples used to train and test the classification network was subject to significant uncertainty, since they came from manual annotations by different groups of users. Thus, the obtained accuracies for eHooke in cell cycle classification may be close to the theoretical maximum obtainable using these data as a reference. More importantly, this points to the need for objective and consistent procedures for classifying, measuring, and comparing cell data. By automating these procedures, eHooke guarantees they are consistent over different samples, which is not possible with human intervention.</p>

      <title>Automated image analysis in eHooke</title>
      <p>Image analysis is initiated by loading a phase-contrast image and/or fluorescence image. The software then uses the phase-contrast image or the fluorescence image to create a binary mask using the isodata algorithm for automatic thresholding<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref><sup>)</sup>, separating the background pixels from the pixels corresponding to the cells. This mask is then used to find the centers of each individual cell in the image by applying an algorithm that computes the Euclidean distance transform<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr"><sup>24</sup></xref><sup>)</sup>. The software uses those centers and a watershed algorithm<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr"><sup>25</sup></xref><sup>)</sup> to define the pixels corresponding to each cell. Measurement of each cell area is performed by counting the number of pixels corresponding to each cell. To measure eccentricity, the major and minor axes are defined as the major and minor axes of the smallest rectangle that can contain each cell. Eccentricity is then calculated using <xref rid="eqn1" ref-type="disp-formula">Equation (1)</xref>, where <italic toggle="yes">a</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">b</italic> are the semimajor and semiminor axes, respectively. eHooke will then define different cell regions: membrane, cytoplasm, and, if needed, septum. The membrane is determined by dilating the outline of each cell toward the inside. The separation of the septum from the cytoplasm is done by using the isodata algorithm<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref><sup>)</sup> to find the brightest pixels inside the cell, which eHooke then assigns to the septum. Pixels that are part of the interface between the membrane and the septum are removed from the analysis. To calculate the local median background, eHooke starts by defining a bounding box for each cell by taking the minimum and maximum <italic toggle="yes">x</italic>,<italic toggle="yes">y</italic> coordinates of pixels belonging to each cell and expanding the box to five pixels in each direction. The local median background is calculated from the background pixels defined in the binary mask in each bounding box while discarding the pixels closer to the cell defined by five rounds of binary dilations<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr"><sup>25</sup></xref><sup>)</sup> on the binary mask. The median fluorescence of each region is measured, and the local median background is subtracted. When the user selects the option to find the septum of each cell, eHooke also calculates the FRs of the fluorescence intensity at the septum versus the membrane<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref><sup>)</sup>, according to <xref rid="eqn2" ref-type="disp-formula">Equation (2)</xref>. FR will be calculated using all pixels from the septum (FR), or the 10% (FR10), 25% (FR25), or 75% (FR75) brightest septal pixels.<disp-formula id="eqn1"><label>(1)</label><graphic xlink:href="S2633903X21000027_eqnu1.jpg" position="float"/></disp-formula>

      <title>Automated classification of cell cycle stages of S. aureus</title>
      <p>To acquire microscopy images of <italic toggle="yes">S. aureus</italic> cells at different cell cycle stages, <italic toggle="yes">S. aureus</italic> JE2 strain cultures were grown overnight in tryptic soy broth (TSB, Difco: USA) and diluted 1:200 in fresh medium the following morning. Cultures were grown until OD<sub>600nm</sub> = 0.8, and 1 ml was stained with membrane dye Nile red (5 μg mL<sup>−1</sup>, Invitrogen: USA) and DNA dye Hoechst 33342 (1 μg mL<sup>−1</sup>, Invitrogen) for 5 min. Cultures were then centrifuged, washed with 1 ml of 1:3 (vol/vol) TSB/phosphate buffered saline (PBS) solution, and resuspended in 20 μL of the same solution. Cells were mounted on microscope slides covered with a layer of 1.2% (w/v) agarose in PBS. Images were acquired by widefield microscopy or SIM. Widefield microscopy was performed to image Nile red and Hoechst 33342 with an exposure time of 100 ms. SIM was performed using a 561-nm laser (100 mW) and a 405-nm laser (50 mW) with an exposure time of 100 ms. Every image was segmented using eHooke and cropped around each cell (50 × 50 pixels for widefield and 100 × 100 pixels for SIM) for both fluorescence channels to create single-cell images. To remove background and fluorescence from neighbor cells from single-cell images, the fluorescence intensity of every pixel not corresponding to a cell was set to 0. Cells were then manually classified for the cell cycle phase by groups of users. Only cells with the same classification by the majority of users were used for the dataset. From these, 10% of cells in each phase were randomly selected and separated to create the test dataset. Of the remaining images, cells from Phases 1 and 2 were randomly discarded to balance the number of cells in each cell cycle phase. Widefield microscopy single-cell images were resized to the same size as the SIM single-cell images. Both widefield and SIM cell images were combined in a training dataset. The resulting dataset was used to train an ANN to classify images of individual cells automatically. Ablation studies were performed by sequentially removing layers from the original ANN. Each architecture was trained with the training dataset, and the corresponding classification accuracies were tested using the test dataset. The proposed ANN model is composed of 22 layers: seven convolutions (each followed by a reLU activation layer), with the first four being intercalated by three MaxPooling, followed by one flatten, one dense, one activation reLU, another dense, and one SoftMax activation layer (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3a</xref>). The generated model was integrated into eHooke. The model classifies the cell cycle phase in images where cells are labeled with a membrane dye, used as the main fluorescence channel of eHooke, and, if available, an image where cells are labeled with a DNA dye, which should be used as the secondary channel of eHooke. For biological validation, we acquired widefield microscopy images of <italic toggle="yes">S. aureus</italic> JE2 strain and a transposon mutant in the <italic toggle="yes">sle1</italic> gene (JE2 <italic toggle="yes">sle1</italic>::Tn)<sup>(</sup>

Images of cells incubated in the presence and absence of oxacillin were then acquired by widefield fluorescence microscopy using the filter for GFP with an exposure time of 3,000 ms. FRs were measured using eHooke.</p>

      <p>Overnight cultures of <italic toggle="yes">S. aureus</italic> COL strains ColZZ (grown in TSB with 50 μM of kanamycin and neomycin), ColWZ, and COLJZ (grown in TSB) were back-diluted 1:200 in TSB supplemented with IPTG (0.1 mM for ColZZ and 0.5 mM for ColWZ and COLJZ) and grown until OD<sub>600nm</sub> = 0.6. One milliliter of each culture was centrifuged, washed with a PBS solution, resuspended in 20 μL of PBS, and mounted on microscope slides covered with a thin layer of 1.2% (w/v) agarose in PBS. Images were then acquired by widefield fluorescence microscopy. ColZZ images were acquired with an exposure time of 3,000 ms for both CFP and mCherry channels, ColWZ with 4,000 and 3,000 ms, and ColJZ with 5,000 and 2,000 ms, respectively. PCC values were calculated for each cell using eHooke as shown in <xref rid="eqn3" ref-type="disp-formula">Equation (3)</xref>, where <italic toggle="yes">X<sub>i</sub>
