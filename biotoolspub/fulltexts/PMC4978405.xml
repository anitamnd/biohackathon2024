    <abstract>
      <p>Gene expression time-course experiments allow to study the dynamics of transcriptomic changes in cells exposed to different stimuli. However, most approaches for the reconstruction of gene association networks (GANs) do not propose prior-selection approaches tailored to time-course transcriptome data. Here, we present a workflow for the identification of GANs from time-course data using prior selection of genes differentially expressed over time identified by natural cubic spline regression modeling (NCSRM). The workflow comprises three major steps: 1) the identification of differentially expressed genes from time-course expression data by employing NCSRM, 2) the use of regularized dynamic partial correlation as implemented in GeneNet to infer GANs from differentially expressed genes and 3) the identification and functional characterization of the key nodes in the reconstructed networks. The approach was applied on a time-resolved transcriptome data set of radiation-perturbed cell culture models of non-tumor cells with normal and increased radiation sensitivity. NCSRM detected significantly more genes than another commonly used method for time-course transcriptome analysis (BETR). While most genes detected with BETR were also detected with NCSRM the false-detection rate of NCSRM was low (3%). The GANs reconstructed from genes detected with NCSRM showed a better overlap with the interactome network Reactome compared to GANs derived from BETR detected genes. After exposure to 1 Gy the normal sensitive cells showed only sparse response compared to cells with increased sensitivity, which exhibited a strong response mainly of genes related to the senescence pathway. After exposure to 10 Gy the response of the normal sensitive cells was mainly associated with senescence and that of cells with increased sensitivity with apoptosis. We discuss these results in a clinical context and underline the impact of senescence-associated pathways in acute radiation response of normal cells. The workflow of this novel approach is implemented in the open-source Bioconductor R-package splineTimeR.</p>

    <p>In general terms, the expression of genes can be studied from a static or temporal point of view. Static microarray experiments allow measuring gene expression responses only at one single time point. Therefore, data obtained from those experiments can be considered as more or less randomly taken snapshots of the molecular phenotype of a cell. However, biological processes are dynamic and thus, the expression of a gene is a function of time [<xref rid="pone.0160791.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. To be able to understand and model the dynamic behavior and association of genes, it is important to study gene expression patterns over time.</p>
    <p>However, compared to static microarray data, the analysis of time-course data introduces a number of new challenges. First, the experimental costs for the generation of data as well as the computational cost increases with the increase in the number of introduced time points. Second, hidden correlation caused by co-expression of genes makes the data linearly dependent [<xref rid="pone.0160791.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Finally, one has to be aware of additional correlations existing between neighboring time points clearly revealed in published gene expression profiles [<xref rid="pone.0160791.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p>
    <p>Several different algorithms have been suggested to analyze gene time-course microarray data with regard to differential expression in two or more biological groups (e.g. exposed to radiation vs. non-exposed) [<xref rid="pone.0160791.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>‚Äì<xref rid="pone.0160791.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Nevertheless solitary identification of differentially expressed genes does not help to determine the molecular mechanisms in the investigated biological groups. Therefore, it is not only important to know differentially expressed genes per se, but also how those genes interact and regulate each other in order to determine specifically deregulated molecular networks.</p>
    <p>Currently, many different algorithms including cluster analysis [<xref rid="pone.0160791.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>‚Äì<xref rid="pone.0160791.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and supervised classification [<xref rid="pone.0160791.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>‚Äì<xref rid="pone.0160791.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] are used to identify relationships between genes. However, both of these methods suffer from serious limitations. First, the timing information of the measurements is not incorporated and, therefore, the intrinsic temporal structure of the time-course data is neglected. Second, the available standard clustering and classification methods are not designed to measure statistical significance of the results based on a statistical hypothesis test. By nature of these methods, clusters or classes of genes with similar expression patterns will always be identified but they do not provide a measure of how reliable this information is. For this reason, we preferred usage of a dynamic network modeling approach that allows delineation of relationships between genes along with providing statistical significance for these relationships.</p>
    <p>The aim of the present study was to identify and compare signaling pathways involved in the radiation responses of normal cells differing in their radiation sensitivity that could be used to modulate cell sensitivity to ionizing radiation. For this, we propose an approach that combines the detection of genes differentially expressed over time based on statistics determined by natural cubic spline regression (NCSRM) [<xref rid="pone.0160791.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] followed by dynamic gene association network (GAN) reconstruction based on a regularized dynamic partial correlation as implemented in the GeneNet R-package [<xref rid="pone.0160791.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p>
    <p>Most exploratory gene expression studies focus only on the identification of differentially expressed genes by treating them as independent events and do not seek to study the interplay of identified genes. This makes it difficult to tell which genes are part of the interaction network causal of the studied phenotype and which are the most ‚Äúimportant‚Äù with regard to the context of the investigation. The herein present approach combines the identification of differentially expressed genes and reconstruction of possible associations between them. Further analysis of identified GANs then allows hypothesizing which genes may play a crucial role in the investigated processes. This should markedly increase the likelihood to find meaningful results from an initial observation and help to understand the underlying molecular mechanisms. We applied our workflow on time-course transcriptome data of two normal and well-characterized lymphoblastoid cell lines with normal (20037‚Äì200) and increased radiation sensitivity (4060‚Äì200), in order to identify molecular mechanisms and potential key players responsible for different radiation responses [<xref rid="pone.0160791.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0160791.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Our exploratory approach provides novel and informative insights in the biology of radiation sensitivity of non-tumor cells after exposure to ionizing radiation with regard to the identified signaling pathways and their key drivers. Moreover, we could demonstrate that spline regression in differential gene expression analysis for the purpose of prior selection in gene-association network reconstruction outperforms another commonly used existing approach for time-course gene expression analysis.</p>

        <p>Samples were collected 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8 and 24 hours after sham or actual irradiation. Transcriptional profiling was performed using Agilent gene expression microarrays and comprises three major steps: the identification of differentially expressed genes from time-course expression data by employing a natural cubic spline regression model; the use of regularized dynamic partial correlation method to infer gene associations networks from differentially expressed genes and the topological identification and functional characterization of the key nodes in the reconstructed networks.</p>

In general, more genes were detected as differentially expressed in the cells with increased radiation sensitivity compared to cells with normal radiation sensitivity after each dose of gamma irradiation (<xref rid="pone.0160791.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The most prominent difference was observed when comparing the responses after 1 Gy irradiation. In the cells with increased radiation sensitivity 2335 genes showed differential expression compared to only seven genes in cells with normal radiation sensitivity. We observed the same trend after irradiation with 10 Gy where the cells with increased sensitivity showed 6019 and the normal sensitive cells 3892 differentially expressed genes.</p>

      <title>Pathway enrichment analysis of NCSRM identified genes</title>
      <p>Pathway enrichment analysis was performed on differentially expressed genes to identify over-represented biological pathways. The analysis on genes identified with NCSRM revealed 634 and 964 significantly enriched pathways for the cells with increased radiation sensitivity after 1 Gy and 10 Gy irradiation dose, respectively and 758 pathways for the normal sensitive cell line after 10 Gy irradiation. For the seven differentially expressed genes (i.e. FDXR, BBC3, VWCE, PHLDA3, SCARF2, HIST1H4C, PCNA) of the cell line with normal radiation sensitivity after 1 Gy dose of irradiation we did not find any significantly enriched pathways.

    <title>Discussion</title>
    <p>The success of tumor radiation therapy predominantly depends on the total applied radiation dose, but also on the tolerance of the tumor surrounding normal tissues to radiation. Toxicity towards radiation, which greatly varies on an individual level due to inherited susceptibility, is one of the most important limiting factors for dose escalation in radiooncology treatment [<xref rid="pone.0160791.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0160791.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. To account for radiation sensitivity of normal tissue in personalized treatment approaches the underlying molecular mechanisms need to be thoroughly understood in order to identify molecular targets for the modulation of radiation sensitivity and molecular markers for the stratification of patients with different intrinsic radiation sensitivity. In the present study we identified significantly differentially expressed genes over time between the radiation-treated group and the control group to be used as prior genes for GAN reconstruction. Two doses of gamma irradiation were used to characterize the differences in radiation response of the two lymphoblastoid cell lines with known differences in radiation sensitivity. The dose of 10 Gy was selected following the fact that the same dose has been applied in a previous research project examining the radiation sensitivity of the same lymphoblastoid cell lines analyzed in the study at hand [<xref rid="pone.0160791.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The dose of 1 Gy reflects the dose that is delivered as part of the so called ‚Äúlow-dose bath‚Äù to the tumor-surrounding tissue during the radiotherapy of the tumors [<xref rid="pone.0160791.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p>
    <p>Here, we conducted time-resolved transcriptome analysis of radiation-perturbed cell culture models of non-tumor cells with normal and with increased radiation sensitivity in order to work out the molecular phenotype of radiation sensitivity in normal cells. Moreover, we present an innovative approach for the identification of GANs from time-course perturbation transcriptome data. The approach comprises three major steps: 1) the identification of differentially expressed genes from time-course gene expression data by employing a natural cubic spline regression model (NCSRM); 2) the use of a regularized dynamic partial correlation method to infer gene associations network from differentially expressed genes; 3) the identification and functional characterization of the key nodes (hubs) in the reconstructed gene dependency network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0160791.g001">Fig 1</xref>).</p>
    <p>Our proposed method for the detection of differentially expressed genes over time is based on NCSRM with a small number of basis functions. A relatively low number of basis functions generally results in a good fit of data and, at the same time, reduces the complexity of the fitted models. Treating time in the model as a continuous variable, a non-linear behavior of gene expressions was approximated by spline curves fitted to the experimental time-course data. Considering temporal changes in gene expression as continuous curves and not as single time points greatly decreases the dimensionality of the data and thereby decreases computational cost. In addition, the proposed NCRSM does not require identical sampling time points for the compared treatment conditions. Furthermore, no biological replicates are needed. Therefore, the method is applicable to data generated according to a tailored time-course differential expression study design and to data that were not specifically generated for time-course differential expression analysis, e.g. existing/previously generated data from clinical samples. Thus, the adaption of the method to differential expression analysis comprises the potential to reanalyze existing data, address new questions <italic>in silico</italic> and thereby potentially add new or additional value to existing data. Incomplete time-course data, e.g. due to the exclusion of samples for technical reasons, that often create major problems for the estimation of the model, are also suitable for fitting the spline regression model as long as enough data points remain in the data set. This is especially valuable when data on certain time points, derived from a very limited sample source, have been excluded from a time-course data set and cannot be repeatedly generated.</p>
    <p>Since gene expression is not only dynamic in the treatment group but also in the control group, the inclusion of the time-course control data greatly improves the ability to detect truly differentially expressed genes, as the gene expression values are not referred to a single time point with static gene expression levels only. Comparing a treatment group to time point zero does not provide a proper control over the entire time-course, although it is widely practiced [<xref rid="pone.0160791.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>‚Äì<xref rid="pone.0160791.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The proposed workflow is implemented in an open-source R-package splineTimeR and is available through Bioconductor (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.bioconductor.org/">https://www.bioconductor.org</ext-link>).</p>
    <p>Amongst a panel, the two lymphoblastoid cell lines that were different with regard to radiation sensitivity after irradiation with 10 Gy [<xref rid="pone.0160791.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], also responded differently with regard to the quantity of differentially expressed genes. Interestingly, cells with normal radiation sensitivity barely responded to 1 Gy irradiation at the transcriptome level. Only seven genes (FDXR, BBC3, VWCE, PHLDA3, SCARF2, HIST1H4C, PCNA) were identified as differentially expressed, whereas for the cell line with increased sensitivity 2335 differentially expressed genes were detected after exposure to the same dose. A similar behavior was observed for those two cell lines after irradiation with 10 Gy. We detected 6019 and 3892 genes as differentially expressed in the sensitive and normal cell lines, respectively (<xref rid="pone.0160791.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Those results are in a good agreement with the previous proteomic study where more differentially expressed proteins were detected for the same sensitive cell line compare to the cell line with normal radiation sensitivity 24 hours after irradiation with 10 Gy [<xref rid="pone.0160791.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Thus, for both applied doses, the radiation sensitive cells exhibited much more pronounced transcriptional response compared to the cells with normal radiation sensitivity and thereby underlines the expected radiation response of those two cell lines.</p>
    <p>Concerning qualitative differences in the transcriptomic response of normal sensitive cells and cells with increased sensitivity after treatment with 1 Gy and 10 Gy pathway enrichment analysis was performed. Differentially expressed genes identified for all considered treatment conditions except for the normal sensitive cells after exposure to 1 Gy radiation showed statistically significant enrichment of pathways. Most of which were in agreement with known radiation responses such as DNA repair, cell cycle regulation, oxidative stress response or pathways related to apoptosis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0160791.s003">S2 Table</xref>) [<xref rid="pone.0160791.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>‚Äì<xref rid="pone.0160791.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Therefore, the pathway enrichment analysis results suggest plausibility of generated data and, more importantly, underline the meaningfulness of our suggested approach based on cubic spline regression for differential gene expression analysis of time-course data. However, differential expression analysis alone followed by pathway enrichment analysis does not provide any mechanistic insights. For this reason we performed GAN reconstruction using identified differentially expressed genes. Based on the assumption that the expression levels of functionally related genes are highly correlated, partial correlation was used for GAN reconstruction. In simple correlation, the strength of the linear relationship between two genes is measured, without taking into account that those genes may be actually influenced by other genes. Partial correlation eliminates the influence of other genes when one particular relationship between pair of genes is considered. Network reconstruction was performed separately for the cell line with increased radiation sensitivity after 1 Gy and 10 Gy and for the cell line with normal radiation sensitivity after 10 Gy of radiation dose. Due to the sparseness of the set of genes differentially expressed after irradiation of the normal-sensitive cell line with 1 Gy, no GAN was obtained.</p>
    <p>Subsequently, we identified the network hubs (i.e. most important genes) of the GANs by combining three network centrality measures: degree, closeness and shortest path betweenness [<xref rid="pone.0160791.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Combining different centrality measures is a widely used approach to identify nodes that are likely to control the network [<xref rid="pone.0160791.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Also, this approach allows identification of nodes that are connected to the central nodes at the same time which can be informative for the interpretation of the whole GAN or single modules making up the network [<xref rid="pone.0160791.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0160791.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].</p>

      <title>Identification of key pathways associated with radiation sensitivity</title>
      <p>In order to get functional insights into the reconstructed GANs the 5% top important nodes were identified after a ranking with the combined centrality measure and mapped to the pathways from the interactome database Reactome [<xref rid="pone.0160791.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. The obtained results revealed different pathways considered as the most important in cells with different radiation sensitivity after different doses of ionizing radiation. For the radiation sensitive cell line 4060‚Äì200 and 1 Gy irradiation, we mainly detected pathways associated with senescence (<xref rid="pone.0160791.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>).</p>
      <p>A different outcome was observed after irradiation with 10 Gy. For the radiation sensitive cells three out of the ten top pathways were linked to apoptotic processes with the genes BBC3, BCL2, TP53 as key players, whereas for the normal sensitive cell line we mainly observed the induction of senescence related pathways. This indicates that different doses are necessary to induce a similar response in the two cell lines. The activation of senescence genes is a damage response mechanism, which stably arrests proliferating cells and protects them from apoptotic cell death [<xref rid="pone.0160791.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Together with the senescence pathway we observed increased levels of chemokine, cytokine and interleukin genes that are known to activate an immune response and signal transduction pathways in response to irradiation.</p>
      <p>Although the senescence-associated pathways were not seen as the most important ones for the treatment condition 10 Gy/increased sensitivity, they were significantly enriched in the GANs of the three conditions 1 Gy/increased sensitivity, 10 Gy/ increased sensitivity and 10 Gy/normal sensitivity. All differentially expressed genes that related to senescence-associated pathways are shown in supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0160791.s006">S5 Table</xref>. The observation that cells with increased radiation sensitivity compared to cells with normal sensitivity, become senescent after exposure to doses in the range of 1 Gy, rises the question whether this has a positive or negative influence on the tumor therapy. On the one hand side, senescent cell may secret the so-called SASP (‚Äúsenescence-associated secretory phenotype‚Äú) factors, including growth factors, chemokines and cytokines, which participate in intercellular signaling leading to the attraction of immune cells to the tumor location that, in turn, eliminate the tumor cells and, thereby, positively contribute to the tumor therapy [<xref rid="pone.0160791.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0160791.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. On the other hand side, senescent cells and the SASP are reported to promote proliferation, survival, invasion and migration of neighboring cells by the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines leading to sustained inflammation [<xref rid="pone.0160791.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. In this way senescence cells can damage their local environment and stimulate angiogenesis and tumor progression [<xref rid="pone.0160791.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0160791.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Besides, there are some evidences that the induction of senescence in surrounding normal tissue may lead to an increased radio-tolerance or even radioresistance of the tumor and is, therefore, not desirable and negatively influences the tumor radiotherapy [<xref rid="pone.0160791.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Thus, it might be beneficial to block senescence in order to prevent the radio-hyposensibilization of tumor cells. Therefore, we suggest a detailed investigation of the consequences of senescent non-tumor cells with the aim to improve the radiotherapy of tumors in radiosensitive patients.</p>

      <title>Identification of senescence associated genes involved in cell radiation responses</title>
      <p>CDKN1A gene was identified as one of the most important key players linked to the identified senescence associated pathways for both 1 Gy/sensitive and 10 Gy/normal treatment conditions. For both conditions the expression of the CDKN1A was up-regulated for all considered time points. CDKN1A is a well-known damage response gene for which aberrant transcriptional response has been associated with abnormal sensitivity to ionizing radiation [<xref rid="pone.0160791.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0160791.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. The study by Badie et al. (2008) has shown that a subgroup of breast cancer patients, who developed severe reactions to radiation therapy, could be identified by aberrant overexpression of CDKN1 in peripheral blood lymphocytes [<xref rid="pone.0160791.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>].</p>
      <p>LMNB1 is another genes we identified as a response hub gene after irradiation of sensitive cell line with 1 Gy radiation dose that is associated with senescence. Although the LMNB1 gene was not identified as hub gene in the GAN of the 10 Gy/normal treatment condition, it was still differentially expressed. For both treatment conditions we observed significant downregulation of this gene 24 hours after irradiation. Shah et al (2013) has suggested that downregulation of LMNB1 in senescence is a key trigger of chromatin changes affecting gene expression [<xref rid="pone.0160791.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. In fact also in our data we observed strong downregulation of a group of histone genes associated with senescence (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0160791.s006">S5 Table</xref>) for the treatment conditions 1 Gy/increased sensitivity and 10 Gy/normal sensitivity. Furthermore, Lee et al. (2012) has shown that histone protein modification may have an impact on the radiation sensitivity of a tissue [<xref rid="pone.0160791.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Moreover, evidence has been provided that mutation of LMNA can cause increased sensitivity to ionizing radiation [<xref rid="pone.0160791.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>], however, to our knowledge there are no data showing the role of LMNB gene in the context of radiation sensitivity.</p>
      <p>Another potential therapeutic candidate associated with senescence that was identified for the 10 Gy/normal sensitivity treatment condition was MRE11A for which cell culture data suggest that treatment of cells with Mre11 siRNA increases radiation sensitivity and reduces heat-induced radiosensitization [<xref rid="pone.0160791.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0160791.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>].

      <title>Assessment of the false positive rate and validation of the NCSRM method</title>
      <p>The spline regression based differential analyses between technical replicates were performed in order to estimate the extent of random fluctuations of gene expression values. The detected 3% rejections of the overall null hypothesis of no differential gene expression are in accordance with the alpha-level of 5% of the familywise error rate (FWER) and can be considered as false positives. On the other hand, it shows that type I error, due to technical variation, is covered by the model and test assumptions (moderated F-test, [<xref rid="pone.0160791.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]) so that it was not necessary to include an extra parameter for technical replicates into the model.</p>
      <p>In order to validate the previously mentioned biological results using NCSRM, we performed the differential expression analysis with another established method for time-course data analysis called BETR (Bayesian Estimation of Temporal Regulation) [<xref rid="pone.0160791.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The number of genes detected by BETR was considerably lower compared to NCRSM (<xref rid="pone.0160791.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), however the majority of which were also detected with NCSRM (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0160791.s002">S1 Table</xref>). This is in line with the calculations on the false positive rates that have been conducted on the simulated data presented in the BETR study. In an analysis of the simulated data set, 65% of truly differentially expressed genes have been identified after accepting a false positive rate of 5% [<xref rid="pone.0160791.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. This means that a substantial proportion of differentially expressed genes remained undetected, which is likely to be also the case for the herein analyzed data with BETR. Although the numbers of differentially expressed genes and genes remained in the reconstructed networks greatly differ (<xref rid="pone.0160791.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), the qualitative results are well comparable (<xref rid="pone.0160791.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). For all treatment conditions where for which we were able to reconstruct GANs, we observed a great overlap of pathways where the 5% of hub genes were mapped to (<xref rid="pone.0160791.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). The detection of a higher number of differentially expressed genes with NCSRM resulted in larger GANs with additional information compared to the smaller GANs that were reconstructed on the basis of genes detected with BETR. This is underlined by the results of the conducted evaluation of GANs. Except one network based on the differentially expressed genes using BETR, all investigated networks consist significantly more common edges with the Reactome reference network compared to random networks with identical network topology and genes. This shows that the additionally detected genes with NCSRM add additional information rather than adding false positives or noise to the set of differentially expressed genes. Moreover the spline regression method is much more flexible and allows for more freedom during the data collection process. As already mentioned, NCSRM does not require the same sampling time for treated and control groups and can easily deal with incomplete data, whereas BETR method is not able to overcome or bypass those limitations. Thus, NCSRM is very robust against the frequently occurring shortcomings in study design and subsequent data generation occurring in life sciences.</p>

      <p>Prospectively, we suggest and plan a detailed <italic>in silico</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> analysis of the interactions in the proposed gene association networks in order to add meaningful knowledge to the mechanism of radiosensitivity at the experimental level. This novel knowledge has the potential to improve cancer radiation therapy by preventing or lowering the acute responses of normal cells resulting from radiation therapy. The results add novel information to the understanding of mechanisms that are involved in the radiation response of human cells, with the potential to improve tumor radiotherapy.

BETR is a well-established algorithm that has been previously compared to limma, MB-statistic and EDGE methods and showed the best performance [<xref rid="pone.0160791.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The results of spline and BETR methods were compared using the same initial microarray gene expression data set. The probabilities of each gene to be differentially expressed obtained with BETR method, were transformed to p-values as described in the original paper. Genes were considered significantly differentially expressed if the Benjamini-Hochberg adjusted p-value was lower than 0.05 (FDR&lt;0.05). This transformation allowed us to compare the outcomes of both methods based on the FDR values for differential expression. The resulting differentially expressed genes using BETR were analyzed and subjected to network reconstruction as described above for the differentially expressed genes obtained using NCSRM. Outcomes of both obtained association networks were compared to each other and to the <italic>a priori</italic> known biological network provided by the Reactome database [<xref rid="pone.0160791.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].</p>

      <title>Evaluation of reconstructed gene association networks</title>
      <p>In order to assess the quality of the <italic>de novo</italic> reconstructed gene association networks (GANs), we developed a novel method that compares the interactions in the reconstructed network to the experimentally validated interactions present in the Reactome interaction network. For this purpose we used the Reactome reference network, consisting of protein-protein interaction pairs stored in the Reactome database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.reactome.org/pages/download-data/">http://www.reactome.org/pages/download-data/</ext-link>). For the comparison, sub-networks of reconstructed networks consisting only of genes overlapping with the Reactome network were built. The number of common edges between these two sub-networks was determined and referred to the total number of edges in the reconstructed network (percentage of common edges in the reconstructed network). Further, a permutation test was performed to assess whether the number of common edges in the reconstructed network was significantly higher than in randomized networks with the same genes. Random networks were generated by permutation of the node names in the network, while preserving the reconstructed sub-network topology. After each permutation (n = 1000) the number of common edges with the reference Reactome sub-network was determined. The reconstructed network was considered significantly better than random, if more than 90% of the random sub-networks contained lower numbers of edges common with the Reactome network than the reconstructed sub-network (p-value &lt; 0.1). All networks reconstructed with the genes determined as differentially expressed from the herein presented spline regression method and the BETR method were evaluated.</p>
