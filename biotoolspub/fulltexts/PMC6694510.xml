        <title>Background</title>
        <p id="Par1">Experimental intercrosses between outbred founder populations are powerful resources for mapping loci that contribute to complex traits i.e. quantitative trait loci (QTL). Here, we present an approach and its accompanying software for high-resolution reconstruction of founder mosaic genotypes in the intercross offspring from such populations using whole-genome high-coverage sequence data on founder individuals (~ 30×) and very low-coverage sequence data on intercross individuals (&lt; 0.5×). Sets of founder-line informative markers were selected for each full-sib family and used to infer the founder mosaic genotypes of the intercross individuals. The application of this approach and the quality of the estimated genome-wide genotypes are illustrated in a large F<sub>2</sub> pedigree between two divergently selected lines of chickens.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>Results</title>
        <p id="Par2">We describe how we obtained whole-genome genotype data for hundreds of individuals in a cost- and time-efficient manner by using a <italic>Tn5</italic>-based library preparation protocol and an imputation algorithm that was optimized for this application. In total, 7.6 million markers segregated in this pedigree and, within each full-sib family, between 10.0 and 13.7% of these were fully informative, i.e. fixed for alternative alleles in the founders from the divergent lines, and were used for reconstruction of the offspring mosaic genotypes. The genotypes that were estimated based on the low-coverage sequence data were highly consistent (&gt; 95% agreement) with those obtained using individual single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping. The estimated resolution of the inferred recombination breakpoints was relatively high, with 50% of them being defined on regions shorter than 10 kb.</p>

    <title>Background</title>
    <p id="Par4">Genotyping by next-generation sequencing has emerged as a rapid, high-throughput approach to obtain high-density genotypes in large populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The downside of this approach is that confident assignment of individual genotypes requires costly deep sequencing, which restricts its application for large association panels. Cost-efficient approaches, such as reduced-representation sequencing (RRS; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]) and genotype imputation from low-coverage sequencing data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], have been developed to reduce the cost of genotyping large populations. While RRS reduces the cost by sequencing only a fraction of the genome without losing confidence in individual calls, the genotype imputation approach is designed for low-coverage sequence data and subsequent genotype imputation against a set of selected high-confidence haplotypes either from external reference individuals or from haplotypes reconstructed in the low-coverage sequenced individuals. Compared to RRS, genotype imputation can provide high-confidence genome-wide genotypes at a similar cost, which makes it a compelling approach for a wide range of applications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p>
    <p id="Par5">Several algorithms have been developed for genotype imputation based on low-coverage sequencing data. Some were developed for general pedigrees and data, while others were targeted for more specific applications, resulting in variation in their performances depending on how well underlying assumptions about the data are met. In populations with unrelated individuals, the individual genomes are often assumed to consist of short mosaics of ancestral haplotypes. Examples of software that have been developed for genotype imputation in such applications include Beagle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], MaCH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], and Shapeit2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. These software perform well for their intended applications but lose considerable performance when applied to data with ultra-low coverage (&lt; 1×) from experimental populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. In such populations, relatedness of the individuals results in the segregation of longer haplotypes. By developing methods that account for these relationships, much lower sequence coverage (&lt; 0.1×) is required to resolve, for example, the founder genome mosaics that are inherited by the offspring from the mating of two inbred parents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Multiple methods and software exist for analyses of such ultra-low coverage sequencing data in intercrosses between pairs of inbred founders, including FSFHap [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], LB-impute [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], and TIGER [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. This principle has also been successfully extended to populations that are founded by multiple inbred parents, with implementations in software such as Mpimpute [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] and Reconstruct [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p>
    <p id="Par6">There is a dearth of alternatives for analysing data from populations that were bred by mating two or more outbred (heterozygous) founders. For such populations, both genotype imputation and inference of founder mosaics in the offspring are more challenging due to the unobserved phases in the pedigree founders. A software useful for genotype imputation in such data is STITCH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], which can perform this task by using ultra-low coverage data in both unrelated and pedigreed populations. To reconstruct founder mosaics for linkage and QTL mapping, even fewer options exist because the methods developed for inbred populations described above [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] are not immediately applicable for such populations. Recently, a method was reported to perform such reconstruction while allowing for heterozygosity of parents and offspring in both bi- and multiparental populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. However, the accompanying software that implements the algorithm (magicImpute) requires a commercial platform. A recent article [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] describes an algorithm for calling, phasing, and imputation of genotypes from low-coverage sequence data in pedigreed populations using single-locus peeling, multi-locus peeling, and hybrid peeling, but the performance of the accompanying software, AlphaPeel was not evaluated here since it was published after this paper was completed.</p>
    <p id="Par7">Here, we report an approach and its associated software that facilitates cost- and time-efficient inference of founder mosaic genotypes in experimental crosses from outbred (heterozygous) founders using very low coverage (&lt; 0.5×) sequencing data. Although our approach has several similarities to earlier methods that were developed for inbred populations from bi-parental crosses, and uses one of these in part of the implemented pipeline, it provides extensions that are essential for the efficient estimation of founder mosaics in outbred crosses with multiple segregating founders. The properties of our method were illustrated by re-genotyping an F<sub>2</sub> intercross [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] between the Virginia lines of broiler chickens that were divergently selected for body weight [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Our results demonstrate that this method provides high-quality genome-wide founder mosaic genotypes with crossover events that were estimated with greater resolution and at a lower cost than that of reduced representation approaches based on a few hundred selected and individually genotyped genetic markers.</p>

  <sec id="Sec2">
    <title>Methods</title>
    <p id="Par8">When an F<sub>2</sub> intercross population is founded by intercrossing multiple outbred founders from two parental lines, the population can be divided into nuclear families with one F<sub>2</sub> offspring and four F<sub>0</sub> parents. The genomes of the offspring in each of these nuclear full-sib families will be mosaics of the eight haplotypes of the four F<sub>0</sub> founders, as illustrated in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. The linkage phases in the F<sub>0</sub> genomes are, however, unknown, which means that the line origin of the alleles in the F<sub>2</sub> offspring cannot be inferred with confidence in regions of the genome where the F<sub>0</sub> founders are heterozygous (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Using whole-genome sequencing, markers can be detected where the divergent founders are fixed for alternative alleles (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Using these markers only, the founder mosaic genotypes in the entire F<sub>2</sub> intercross generation can be imputed efficiently, one F<sub>2</sub> full-sib nuclear family at a time. In the following sections, we describe in detail the approach that is outlined in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. It is implemented in a freely available software pipeline that can be downloaded at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/CarlborgGenomics/Stripes">https://github.com/CarlborgGenomics/Stripes</ext-link>.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Reconstruction of the founder mosaic genotypes in an F<sub>2</sub> individual from a multi-parent F<sub>0</sub>–F<sub>2</sub> family with outbred (heterozygous) founders, using low-coverage sequence data. Informative markers (blue/yellow large font) are identified based on their fixation for alternative alleles in the pairs of deep-coverage sequenced F<sub>0</sub> founders from the divergent lines (HWS1 and HWS2 vs. LWS1 and LWS2) in the family. Blue and yellow bars represent chromosomes that originate from the high (yellow) and low (blue) founder lines, respectively. Uninformative markers that segregate in at least one founder (black small font) are discarded from further analyses. The F1 individuals used as parents for the intercross (F2) offspring do not need to be sequenced, as they are heterozygous for all selected informative markers. The F<sub>2</sub> individuals are sequenced to low-coverage and the reads are mapped to the selected informative markers. Then the founder mosaic genotypes (illustrated for one autosome by the blue and yellow bars) are inferred across the genome using the read mappings to the within-family informative markers using a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) developed for this task for inbred line crosses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12711_2019_487_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig>

      <title>Inference of founder mosaic genotypes in intercross individuals from a cross between outbred founders</title>
      <p id="Par9">A more detailed, step-by-step description of the approach to estimate the founder mosaic genotypes outlined in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> is provided below.</p>
      <sec id="Sec4">
        <title>Step 1: Sequencing of F<sub>0</sub> founders and F<sub>2</sub> intercross individuals</title>
        <p id="Par10">Individual-based sequencing libraries were prepared for the F<sub>0</sub> and F<sub>2</sub> individuals. Founder individuals were sequenced to high coverage for SNP calling (15–30× recommended) and intercross individuals to low-coverage (~ 0.5× recommended).</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="Sec5">
        <title>Step 2: Selection of markers informative for line origin in each full-sib family</title>
        <p id="Par11">Using the high-coverage sequence data on the F<sub>0</sub> individuals, markers fixed for alternative alleles in the divergent founders of each full-sib family (within-family informative markers) were identified across the genome. These markers are highlighted as large capital letters in yellow (HWS informative) and blue (LWS informative) in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, and contrasted with the larger number of non-informative markers (small, black letters).</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="Sec6">
        <title>Step 3: Read calling in low-coverage sequenced intercross individuals</title>
        <p id="Par12">A computationally-efficient pipeline was implemented for read calling at the within-family informative markers in the offspring from the low-coverage sequence data (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). First, each individual fastq file was mapped to the reference genome using “bwa mem” with default parameters. Second, the bam file was indexed and filtered using “samtools view –bh –q30 –f 0x02” to include only reads for which both pairs are uniquely mapped to the reference genome. Third, bcftools was used to obtain the number of reference and alternative allele calls using “mpileup -Oz”. Finally, a custom python script was used to reformat the obtained output to VCF format and merge the data from all individuals into a single file. This procedure was implemented in a Python snake make pipeline that is publicly available with our software release (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/CarlborgGenomics/Stripes/blob/master/scripts/fastq2vcf/Snakefile">https://github.com/CarlborgGenomics/Stripes/blob/master/scripts/fastq2vcf/Snakefile</ext-link>).</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="Sec7">
        <title>Step 4: Within-family estimation of the founder mosaic genotypes in F<sub>2</sub> individuals</title>
        <p id="Par13">The founder mosaic genotypes were identified independently for each nuclear full-sib family, including four F<sub>0</sub>, two F<sub>1</sub> and one F<sub>2</sub> individuals, using the polymorphism data obtained by mapping the low-coverage reads from the F<sub>2</sub> (Step 3) to the set of founder-line informative SNPs that were identified for the family (Step 2). Because all of these markers were fixed for alternative alleles in the founder lines, the dataset resembles that of an inbred population. Therefore, the founder-line mosaic genotypes of the intercross individuals in the family can be estimated using existing software developed for such populations (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Our pipeline uses an adapted version of the TIGER software [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] for this task. Full details regarding the model parameters and estimation procedures in TIGER are in Rowan et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], which describes the algorithm and software. In short, the algorithm consists of the following steps: (i) translate the ratio of reads of the alternative alleles at each scored marker into one of six possible genotype states (HH, HU, HL, LL, LU, UU, where H represents one parental line, U represents unknown and L represents another line); (ii) estimate the ratio of reads to the two founders lines by averaging the read scores across 200 (for large chromosomes) or 50 (for small chromosomes) consecutive markers to calculate transmission and emission probabilities; and (iii) run the HMM to impute the genotypes at the markers along the chromosomes and reconstruct the founder mosaic genotypes. Here, we used chromosome-specific HMM, which differed from the original TIGER [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] algorithm in which the same HMM was used for all chromosomes of an individual. This modification was implemented to account for uneven lengths of the chromosomes in chickens and for uneven marker densities in the outbred population.</p>

      <title>Assessment of imputation accuracy</title>
      <p id="Par20">First, individuals with few called SNPs (genome wide average &lt; 5 SNPs/Mb) were removed from the dataset. This was necessary because accurate genome-wide haplotype mosaic reconstruction requires a reasonably high marker density. Nearby double recombination events are biologically unlikely due to crossover interference. Cytological evidence suggests crossover interference to be absolute in regions shorter than 5 Mb on the largest chicken chromosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. The raw TIGER [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] reconstructed haplotype mosaics were filtered to remove double recombination events that were closer than 3 Mb since these are biologically most unlikely.</p>
      <p id="Par21">Sample mix-ups, DNA contaminations, and pedigree errors in the data can lead to inaccurate haplotype mosaic reconstruction and increase the number of inferred genome-wide crossover events in affected individuals. To filter out such individuals, we deleted samples for which the genome-wide genotype call rate decreased to less than 90% after removing short (&lt; 3 Mb) double recombination events. An alternative approach would be to remove individuals that were outliers in the distribution of genome-wide recombination events that were inferred using TIGER [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. This would lead to a very similar final set of individuals (see Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S1).</p>

The markers that were fully informative for founder-line origin were identified in each F<sub>2</sub> family, ranged in number from 101 to 140 between families, and were used in this evaluation. For our approach, the genotypes—high weight homozygous (HH), heterozygous (HL), low weight homozygous (LL)—were extracted from the inferred founder mosaics at a 1-Mb resolution.

At 95.7% of the marker locations, the estimated founder mosaic genotype agreed well with the estimated genotype probabilities in Wahlberg et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. In addition, the sequence-based imputation provided much denser genome coverage (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>a vs. b). As a result, estimates of the locations of recombination breakpoints were better resolved, with 50% of them being identified on segments shorter than 10 kb (one example in Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>c). The higher marker density also allowed imputation of genotypes in regions that were not covered by the set of microsatellite markers selected by Wahlberg et al.

    <title>Discussion</title>
    <p id="Par29">In this paper, we describe an approach and software for estimating founder mosaic genotypes in experimental crosses between outbred (heterozygous) founders from very low-coverage sequencing data. Its properties are illustrated by generating and analysing data from an F<sub>2</sub> population that was produced by crossing chicken lines that were divergently selected for body weight from a common founder population.</p>
    <sec id="Sec19">
      <title>Comparison with another genotype imputation software (STITCH)</title>
      <p id="Par30">We compared our approach with another genotype imputation software, STITCH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The imputed genotypes from STITCH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] (run with n = 2 and K = 10), were relatively consistent with the available individual SNP genotypes (0.88/0.90 agreement for markers/individuals) and similar to those obtained with our approach before removing individuals with biologically unrealistic numbers of double-recombination events (0.90/0.89 agreement for markers/individuals). In addition to imputation accuracy, we evaluated the quality of the reconstructed founder haplotypes. As STITCH was not developed for direct estimation of founder mosaic haplotypes for QTL mapping and linkage analyses, the haplotype mosaic reconstruction was performed using custom scripts, using the single marker genotypes imputed by STITCH. Results showed that mosaics estimated from the STITCH data included an excess of recombination events [for an example (see Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>: Figure S3)]. Thus, although both softwares deliver similar quality of imputed genotypes when pedigree and genotypes of founders are disregarded, when such information is available, our pipeline makes use of it to further improve genotyping quality and to estimate accurate founder mosaic genotypes in the intercross individuals. However, our software does not account for more complex crossbreeding structures that use more than two founder populations (such as MAGIC), thus making STITCH currently the best option for such datasets.</p>

      <title>Improved quality control by using pedigree information</title>
      <p id="Par31">Accounting for available pedigree information allows additional quality control to be performed based on the inferred number of recombination events after the founder mosaic genotypes have been estimated. First, the number of estimated crossover events across the genome should agree with its expectation given the length of the chicken linkage map [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Second, the distances between inferred recombination events should be compatible with expectations regarding crossover interference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Before conducting this quality control, there was good agreement (~ 0.90) between the genotypes inferred by our approach and by STITCH using the low-coverage sequence data, and the individual SNP genotypes of Wahlberg et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Applying filters based on these two expectations increased the level of agreement for our approach from 0.90 to 0.95 at the individual level. In addition, this allowed us to identify individuals (n = 61 or equivalent to 7%) with extremely high estimated recombination frequencies that are likely due to errors in either the recorded pedigree or mix-ups during sample preparation.</p>

    <sec id="Sec21">
      <title>Reconstruction of high-resolution founder mosaic haplotypes using low-coverage sequencing data</title>
      <p id="Par32">Our proposed strategy to reconstruct the founder mosaic haplotype structure using low-coverage sequencing data provides more genotyping information than classical approaches at a considerably lower cost. The founders of the pedigree were sequenced to a high coverage by using standard approaches, while F<sub>2</sub> individuals were processed by a low-cost whole-genome sequencing protocol to facilitate low-coverage sequencing of hundreds of intercross individuals (&lt; 10 €/individual, including library preparation and sequencing). This cost is lower than that of existing strategies for genotyping individuals for a few hundred SNPs, even when accounting for the cost of high-coverage sequencing of the large (n = 56) number of founder birds in our pedigree. In addition to the lower cost, there was a considerable increase in marker density, from a few hundred to several hundred thousands of imputed segregating sites across the genome.</p>
      <p id="Par33">Using pedigree information, founder mosaic genotypes can be efficiently constructed by applying approaches that were previously developed for recombinant inbred populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Compared to methods that were developed for estimating founder mosaics from sparsely genotyped SNPs, such as the Haley and Knott approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>], here, the high-density marker facilitated more precise estimation of recombination breakpoints, resulting in 50% of the recombination breakpoints being estimated to fall within 10-kb windows. Performance of the TIGER software for estimating recombination breakpoints has been thoroughly evaluated for inbred populations in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], using simulations and experimental validation. Rowan et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] reported that the individual recombination breakpoints were, in more than 90% of the cases, resolved down to 2 kb at an even lower sequence coverage than that used in our study (0.1×). Here, we found a lower resolution of the estimated breakpoints because our founders were from an outbred population, which resulted in a lower density of informative markers that were unevenly distributed across the genome. If required, it is possible to increase the resolution of recombination events by (i) also analytically tracing the makers that are fixed in two of the four F<sub>0</sub> founders from one line but segregating in the two F<sub>0</sub> founders from the other line (which here would increase the number of informative markers by ~ 20%), or (ii) deeper sequencing, to obtain reads at a larger proportion of the markers that are informative between the two founder lines (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a) and (see Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S2a). However, in practice the proposed genotyping strategy is for linkage and QTL mapping of experimental crosses between outbred (heterozygous) founders. In this case, the resolution of the QTL mapping and linkage map construction is mainly limited by the actual number of recombination events in the population rather than the precision with which they are estimated, which makes marker coverage less of a concern. However, deeper sequence coverage and analytical strategies that use all types of segregating markers should be useful for future developments in which estimation of recombination events with high precision is important such as, for example, in analyses of deep intercross pedigrees, which include many more recombination events.</p>

      <title>Guidelines for choosing sequencing coverage</title>
      <p id="Par34">There was no obvious increase in the accuracy of the reconstructed founder mosaic genotypes after sequence coverage reached 0.05× (see Additional file <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>: Figure S4). This suggests that sequencing to a lower depth than used here (0.4 ×) would have been sufficient to reach an acceptable accuracy for this population. Thus, costs could be reduced even more, without significant loss in accuracy, by lowering the sequencing coverage. On high yield sequencing platforms this would, for many species, require more unique index combinations than the 398 that are currently available for the Illumina sequencers.</p>
      <p id="Par35">Genetic divergence of the outbred founders is an important factor to be considered for determining sequencing depth. Here, the founders of the F<sub>2</sub> population were from the same base population and, therefore, due to the expected low genomic divergence between these lines (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) and (see Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S2), we opted for a high (~ 30×) coverage to identify most of the SNPs segregating in the populations. We found that 0.03% of all identified SNPs were completely fixed for alternative alleles in the two founder lines and that pairs of F<sub>0</sub> individuals that were mated to generate each nuclear F<sub>0</sub>, F<sub>1</sub> and F<sub>2</sub> family were alternate homozygotes for 10.0 to 13.7% of SNPs. In populations for which the divergence between the founder populations is larger, for example in crosses between wild and domesticated populations, more divergently fixed markers are expected. Obtaining high sequence coverage for the founders is recommended, since it will benefit both the accuracy of the founder mosaics and resolution of the recombination breakpoints by revealing more of the available informative markers.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="Sec23">
      <title>An alternative genotyping strategy based on pooled founder sequencing</title>
      <p id="Par36">In crosses in which the founder populations are highly divergent, an alternative strategy for genotyping can be considered to reduce sequencing costs. Rather than sequencing individual founders to high coverage, libraries from the founders of each line could be pooled. The two pools, each representing one founder population, can then be sequenced to high coverage (~ 30×) to identify markers that are fixed (or nearly so) for alternate alleles in the two lines. In our F<sub>2</sub> population, applying this strategy would have reduced the number of informative SNPs for genotype imputation from 840,160 to 213,946. This number of genome-wide SNPs was sufficient for reconstruction of high-quality founder mosaic genotypes. However, the uneven distribution of the informative markers along the genome would likely result in gaps for poorly covered regions (see Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S1). In this regard, our population likely represents an extreme case, because the two selected lines (F<sub>0</sub>s) were from a common base population founded by crossing seven partially inbred lines of White Polymouth Rock. It is worthwhile noting that while the pooled founder sequencing approach is more efficient for populations with more divergent founders, even in populations with founders from closely-related lines, it is likely still sufficient for the purpose of building high-quality linkage maps and performing genome-wide QTL analyses.</p>

    <title>Acknowledgements</title>
    <p>Genome sequencing of the founders of the chicken pedigree was performed by the SNP&amp;SEQ Technology Platform in Uppsala, which is part of the Science for Life Laboratory at Uppsala University and is supported as a national infrastructure by the Swedish Research Council (VR-RFI). Protein production and purification were performed at the Protein Science Facility at Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm. Leif Andersson provided genotypes and samples for the F<sub>2</sub> population. Special thanks are given to the multitude of students and colleagues involved in the development of these populations and phenotypic data obtained over the decades when the selected, relaxed, and intercross populations were reproduced and maintained at Virginia Tech in Blacksburg, VA. Without them and continuous support from Virginia Tech, the selection program and much of the analyses reported herein would have been impossible.</p>
