      <title>Abstract</title>
      <p>Profiling gametes of an individual enables the construction of personalised haplotypes and meiotic crossover landscapes, now achievable at larger scale than ever through the availability of high-throughput single-cell sequencing technologies. However, high-throughput single-gamete data commonly have low depth of coverage per gamete, which challenges existing gamete-based haplotype phasing methods. In addition, haplotyping a large number of single gametes from high-throughput single-cell DNA sequencing data and constructing meiotic crossover profiles using existing methods requires intensive processing. Here, we introduce efficient software tools for the essential tasks of generating personalised haplotypes and calling crossovers in gametes from single-gamete DNA sequencing data (sgcocaller), and constructing, visualising, and comparing individualised crossover landscapes from single gametes (comapr). With additional data pre-possessing, the tools can also be applied to bulk-sequenced samples. We demonstrate that sgcocaller is able to generate impeccable phasing results for high-coverage datasets, on which it is more accurate and stable than existing methods, and also performs well on low-coverage single-gamete sequencing datasets for which current methods fail. Our tools achieve highly accurate results with user-friendly installation, comprehensive documentation, efficient computation times and minimal memory usage.</p>

    <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
    <p>Meiosis is a process required during sexual reproduction that generates gametes—egg or sperm cells—that contain half of the chromosomes of the parent cell (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Chromosome segregation and meiotic crossovers create abundant genetic diversity in the offspring. Meiotic crossovers are also required for accurate chromosome segregation (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>), and reduced crossover rates are linked to increased risk for trisomy 21 (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>) and infertility (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Past studies have shown that meiotic crossover rates and distributions vary greatly among species, sexes and even individuals (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6–11</xref>). Variation in genetic factors, such as <italic toggle="yes">PRDM9</italic>, changes the distribution of crossover hotspots in human and mouse (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Crossover-regulating genes also limit overall crossover rates (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14–16</xref>). Populations of different demographic backgrounds show differences in recombination landscapes, for example hotspot locations differ in African-American genetic maps compared with those from Europeans and West Africans (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). It has also been shown that meiotic crossovers vary among sexes and crossover hotspots can be sex-specific (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>).</p>
    <p>Single-cell DNA sequencing of gametes collected from an individual can be used to construct personalised meiotic crossover distributions (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). The scalability of modern single-cell assays, especially droplet-based platforms, has made it possible to profile thousands of sperm cells per individual in one experiment (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Assaying gametes from females is substantially more challenging at scale, but nevertheless technological developments will make large-scale single-gamete sequencing more common across sexes and organisms. The standard pre-processing pipeline of a single-cell DNA sequencing dataset generates a BAM (BinaryAlignment/Map) file that contains the mapped and cell-barcoded DNA reads from all single cells. Haplotyping these single-cell genomes with existing tools requires the steps of demultiplexing the single-cell reads according to their cell barcodes into thousands of intermediate files before applying haplotyping methods (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). While processing can be parallelised across cells, there are many opportunities to improve upon the use of methods developed for bulk DNA-seq data when analysing single-cell DNA-seq data by avoiding multiple reading and writing of millions of sequence reads. Even more importantly, there are substantial opportunities to improve on the accuracy of existing methods for haplotype reconstruction and genetic map construction from single-gamete data. Single-gamete DNA sequencing data usually have low depth of coverage across the genome per gamete, especially when generated using high-throughput droplet-based single-cell sequencing protocols. However with a group of gametes sequenced, the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) linkage in the gametes offers enough information for constructing chromosome-level phased haplotypes of the individual.</p>
    <p>Therefore, we here introduce sgcocaller, an efficient command-line toolkit to directly process the large single-cell DNA-sequencing alignment files produced by the current standard pre-processing pipelines for personalised haplotype construction and single-gamete crossover identification. sgcocaller is also applicable to individual gametes sequenced by bulk DNA sequencing methods with minimal dataset pre-processing. We also introduce an associated Bioconductor/R package, comapr, for the construction, visualisation, and statistical analysis of crossover landscapes. Working in the Bioconductor ecosystem enables comapr to integrate seamlessly with other commonly used packages specialised in analysing biological datasets. Our new tools offer substantial improvements in accuracy of haplotype reconstruction from single-gamete sequencing data as well as greatly enhanced computational efficiency. With these tools, an easy-to-apply and end-to-end workflow for personalised haplotype assembly and comparative crossover map analysis has been made possible.</p>

      <title>Overview of sgcocaller and comapr</title>
      <p>We have implemented a toolset for processing large-scale single-cell DNA sequence data from gametes with modules to construct the personalised haplotypes of the individual and to call crossovers for individual gametes. The toolset consists of two components, sgcocaller and comapr (see Data Availability), for complementary tasks. These packages have been implemented using appropriate programming languages (Nim and R) and released in multiple release formats to suit the expected use-case scenarios (Figure <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).</p>

          <p>Overview of sgcocaller and comapr workflow including file and data flows of sgcocaller and comapr, as well as example plots generated by comapr. (<bold>A</bold>) sgcocaller takes the aligned DNA reads from all gametes, the list of hetSNPs (phased or unphased) and the cell barcode list and produces the single-gamete haplotype sequence in sparse matrix. (<bold>B</bold>) The diagram shows the main function of sgcocaller which is to resolve single gametes’ haplotypes from DNA reads using phased hetSNPs obtained from external sources (left) or from applying <italic toggle="yes">sgcocaller phase</italic> (right) by the two demonstrated workflows. (<bold>C</bold>) Output files from sgcocaller can be further processed and analysed by comapr, which identifies the crossover locations and filters false crossovers. It adopts the <italic toggle="yes">RangedSummarizedExperiment</italic> as the main data structure to enable seamless integration with existing Bioconductor packages. (<bold>D</bold>) Alternative allele frequencies plot for binned windows with crossover regions highlighted (vertical bar) from one selected gamete cell.

        <title>sgcocaller: single-gamete crossover caller</title>
        <p>To suit the requirements of processing large alignment files containing DNA sequence read data for hundreds or thousands of individual gametes, sgcocaller has been designed as a command-line tool (CLT) implemented using the programming language Nim (<ext-link xlink:href="https://nim-lang.org/" ext-link-type="uri"><italic toggle="yes">https://nim-lang.org/</italic></ext-link>). The software imports the <italic toggle="yes">hts-nim</italic> library (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>) for fast processing of large DNA alignment files and variant calling files. It also imports the Rmath library (in programming language C from the R-project (R Core Team, 2021)) to use the well-defined distribution functions. To interface with the C-based library, a wrapper package (in Nim) was created and implemented as the <italic toggle="yes">distributions</italic> package that is openly accessible (see Data Availability). In crossover-calling scenarios with known phased haplotypes such as F1 hybrid samples generated by crossing known reference strains of species, and cases in which the haplotypes of donors are provided in an input VCF file, <italic toggle="yes">sgcocaller xo</italic>—the crossover calling module—can be applied directly. It requires three input files to call crossovers: the mapped BAM file with cell-barcoded DNA reads from all gametes, the VCF file of phased heterozygous SNP (hetSNP) markers and the list of cell barcodes (Figure <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">1A</xref>). When the phased haplotype information is not available from external sources, sgcocaller also offers a phasing module, <italic toggle="yes">sgcocaller phase</italic>, that is based on the SNP linkage data inherent in read data from the individual gametes to produce the personalised whole-chromosome haplotypes. To call crossovers using outputs of <italic toggle="yes">sgcocaller phase</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">sgcocaller sxo</italic> is recommended as it uses the intermediate files generated by <italic toggle="yes">sgcocaller phase</italic> including the phased haplotypes and the allele specific read count matrices as inputs, which avoids double handling of BAM/VCF files (Figure <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">1B</xref>). Our tool is engineered to operate directly on the output of common single-cell data processing pipelines such as CellRanger, STARSolo (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>) and similar. With minimal pre-processing, sgcocaller can also work with bulk-sequencing samples as demonstrated in the application example with the mouse single-sperm dataset (see Application of sgcocaller and comapr to public datasets).</p>

      <sec id="SEC2-1-2">
        <title>comapr: crossover analysis for construction of genetic distance maps in R</title>
        <p>The second software component, comapr, serves as a post-processing tool that includes functions for finding crossover positions, quantifying crossover rates across groups, and conducting comparative analyses after the sequences of haplotypes are inferred by <italic toggle="yes">sgcocaller xo</italic> (or <italic toggle="yes">sgcocaller sxo</italic>) for each chromosome in gametes. It is implemented as an open-source Bioconductor/R package, which offers easy integration with other packages in Bioconductor for analysis of biological data and statistical testing. comapr includes functions to directly parse output files generated by <italic toggle="yes">sgcocaller xo</italic> or <italic toggle="yes">sgcocaller sxo</italic> with tunable parameters to systematically filter out potential false positive crossover calls and create structured data objects to represent the crossover information across all cells (Figure <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">1C</xref>). comapr provides quality checking functions and visualisations to understand the features of the underlying dataset and for choosing sensible filtering thresholds. It enables convenient plotting of summary plots such as number of crossovers per sample group, converting crossover rates to genetic distances in units of centiMorgans, and plotting genetic distances over chromosomes or the whole genome (see Application of sgcocaller and comapr to public datasets). comapr integrates with the genomic visualisation package Gviz (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>) and easily generates alternative allele frequency plots with crossover intervals highlighted or with genomic feature tracks overlaid on top of identified crossover tracks (Figure <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">1D</xref>, E). To facilitate easy statistical significance testing for comparisons of crossover rates in gamete groups, such as gametes collected from individuals with different genetic backgrounds or from different experimental groups, comapr implements two re-sampling based methods, bootstrapping and permutation testing.</p>

      <p>Detecting crossovers in the gametes’ genomes requires the haplotypes of the individual’s genome. When the individual’s haplotypes are not available from other sources, sgcocaller offers a module <italic toggle="yes">sgcocaller phase</italic> that is able to produce the phased hetSNPs from unphased hetSNPs using the available single-gamete data (Figure <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">1A</xref>). <italic toggle="yes">sgcocaller phase</italic> uses SNP markers’ co-appearance information across all gametes to generate the chromosome-scale haplotype of the individual from single-gamete data, an idea that has also been applied in a previous study (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>) (Figure <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2A</xref>). Cells in the context of this manuscript are haploid gametes unless otherwise specified.</p>

      <p>To increase the algorithm’s efficiency and fully utilise the known biological mechanisms of meiosis and meiotic crossovers, when phasing each chromosome the phasing algorithm in <italic toggle="yes">sgcocaller phase</italic> first finds a template cell (a cell putatively has not inherited crossovers with respect to the chromosome) and uses the cell’s genotype sequence along the chromosome as the template haplotype for the chromosome (Figure <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2A</xref>; see Supplementary Methods). With respect to each chromosome, genotype sequences of paired cells are compared to find a pair of cells with the same genotype sequences. Such cells are candidates for template cells (see Supplementary Methods). Our approach next fills in the missing SNPs in the template haplotype using SNP linkage information from other gametes to increase the completeness of the phased haplotypes. The inference of missing SNPs is based on the fact that meiotic crossovers are low frequency events across chromosomes and crossover positions are sparse. The SNP linkages in small chromosome regions across all haploid gametes are therefore reliable for reconstructing the donor’s haplotypes (see Supplementary Methods).</p>
      <p>To avoid relying on finding ideal template cells, which may not exist for certain gamete populations, for generating corrected phased haplotypes, we have included a switch error correction module <italic toggle="yes">sgcocaller swphase</italic>. When an ideal template cell is not used for phasing in the previous step, the chosen template cell may have crossovers leading to switching errors in the inferred haplotype. <italic toggle="yes">swphase</italic> produces switch scores (inspired by the block splitting function in HapCUT2 (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>)) for a selected list of SNPs with a higher risk of having switch errors and identifies the switch positions to generate the corrected haplotype (Figure <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2B</xref>; see Supplementary Methods).</p>
      <p>The two modules (<italic toggle="yes">phase</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">swphase</italic>) can be applied in one step by calling <italic toggle="yes">autophase</italic> which runs <italic toggle="yes">phase</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">swphase</italic> subsequently. In application scenarios where ideal template cells are expected, users can choose to run <italic toggle="yes">phase</italic> only and save computational time. <italic toggle="yes">sgcocaller phase</italic> also generates auxiliary files for conveniently plotting diagnostic plots that help to inspect the quality of the inferred haplotypes and check for switch errors (Figure <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2C</xref>). Since crossovers are low frequency events at each site across the gametes, switch errors in the inferred haplotypes can be identified by inspecting the diagnostic plot. When the plotted genotype sequences of all cells show existence of crossovers at the same position, it indicates a ‘crossover’ or switch error has occurred in the inferred haplotype (Figure <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2C</xref>, D).</p>

      <title><italic toggle="yes">sgcocaller xo</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">sgcocaller sxo</italic></title>
      <p>The crossover calling module <italic toggle="yes">sgcocaller xo</italic> infers the haplotype states in the haploid genomes of gametes. Two haplotypes (represented by the list of red or blue alleles on each chromosome in Figure <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">1B</xref>) can be found in the diploid genomes of individuals and the gametes from the individual inherit a combination of the two haplotypes (Figure <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">1B</xref>). Gametes have haploid genomes, therefore theoretically there is only one type of allele that can be observed at each SNP position in each gamete. However, due to technical noise such as mapping artefacts, there can be a substantial number of SNP sites with two types of alleles found but with biased ratio towards the true allele type in the genome. To suppress the potential noise in the dataset, <italic toggle="yes">sgcocaller xo</italic> implements a two-state hidden Markov model (HMM) and adopts binomial distributions for modelling the emission probabilities of the observed allele read counts (Figure <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2E</xref>; see Supplementary Methods).</p>
      <p>With this HMM, the commonly used dynamic programming method, the Viterbi algorithm (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>), is implemented in <italic toggle="yes">sgcocaller xo</italic> to solve for the most probable hidden state sequence for each chromosome in each cell. Since the two hidden states in the HMM represent the haplotype origins of DNA segments (represented by allele types of a list of SNPs) in the gametes’ genomes, the transition from one state to another in the hidden state sequence between two SNP markers corresponds to a crossover detected. As currently designed, sgcocaller is intended to work on data of gametes collected from diploid individuals. The <italic toggle="yes">sgcocaller sxo</italic> module supplements the crossover calling module <italic toggle="yes">sgcocaller xo</italic>. It runs the same core function as <italic toggle="yes">sgcocaller xo</italic> but uses the generated outputs (i.e., allele count matrices and the phased haplotypes) from <italic toggle="yes">sgcocaller phase</italic> instead of the original BAM and VCF files, thus eliminating unnecessary double handling of large DNA sequencing data.</p>
      <p>In addition to applying the HMM to the allele counts and using the Viterbi algorithm for inferring the hidden state sequences, we also included calculation of a crossover confidence score, which is the log-likelihood ratio of the Viterbi state segment. The log-likelihood ratio of a segment is derived by finding the difference between the log-likelihood of the segment given the inferred state and the log-likelihood of the segment given the altered state (log-likelihood of the first path given the data minus the log-likelihood of the second path; Figure <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2F</xref>; see Supplementary Methods).</p>

We released open-access tools for preparing the single-gamete DNA sequencing datasets generated using bulk-like protocols (individual sequencing libraries that generated separate sets of reads for gametes) and provided examples of applying sgcocaller on such datasets (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>) (see Application of sgcocaller and comapr to public datasets).</p>

      <p>We applied <italic toggle="yes">sgcocaller phase</italic> (for generating haplotypes) and <italic toggle="yes">sgcocaller swphase</italic> (for identifying and correcting switch errors in the inferred haplotypes) on an apricot pollen dataset generated (see Materials and Methods) with the 10X scCNV protocol (a droplet-based single-cell DNA sequencing protocol) (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). Although <italic toggle="yes">sgcocaller swphase</italic> can be run selectively and only for cases when switch errors are identified in the inferred haplotype by <italic toggle="yes">sgcocaller phase</italic>, we applied both modules on all chromosomes. We refer to the final phasing results as generated by <italic toggle="yes">sgcocaller phase</italic> although <italic toggle="yes">sgcocaller swphase</italic> has been applied (see Supplementary Methods). The phasing results of <italic toggle="yes">sgcocaller phase</italic> demonstrate very high concordance with the haplotypes from the published assembly from the same study (Figure <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3A</xref>, B). To evaluate performance of the phasing module in sgcocaller, the phasing accuracy was calculated using the fraction of concordant hetSNPs between the haplotype inferred from <italic toggle="yes">sgcocaller phase</italic> and the published haplotype. The hetSNPs were grouped into bins with 100 consecutive SNPs in each bin. The proportion of SNPs matching the published haplotype in 100-SNP bins concentrated at 1.0 across eight chromosomes indicating high phasing accuracy across the genome (Figure <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3A</xref> and <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S1</xref>). We defined the haplotype contradictory alleles as the alleles in the haplotype sequence (e.g., columns in i, <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S2</xref>) supported by fewer DNA reads in each 1000-SNP bin in each gamete, and summarised the haplotype contradictory allele read frequencies (CAF) in 1,000-SNP bins across gametes. With this approach, we found that using the haplotypes generated by <italic toggle="yes">sgcocaller phase|sgcocaller swphase</italic> resulted in more bins with CAF valued at zero than using the published haplotype (Figure <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3B</xref>, C). These results suggest <italic toggle="yes">sgcocaller phase|sgcocaller swphase</italic> generated haplotypes that are more concordant with the single-gamete read data than the published assembly. We note that these results do not directly imply the haplotypes by sgcocaller are more accurate than the published assembly but rather simply that the haplotypes inferred by sgcocaller match the observed single-gamete data better. However, there might be errors in SNP calling in the single gametes due to technical issues (e.g. base calling errors, mapping artefacts) and the low depth of read coverage at each SNP.</p>

        <title>10X scCNV apricot gametes</title>
        <p>We next applied sgcocaller and comapr on the 10X scCNV apricot pollen dataset (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>) after pre-processing (see Materials and Methods; Supplementary Methods) for crossover calling and compared the called crossovers by our toolset with the published results.</p>
        <p>Comparing with the crossover profile constructed from the original study, sgcocaller and comapr have generated a highly concordant crossover profile for the analysed gametes (Figure <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">5C</xref>–<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">E</xref>, Figures S3 and S4). The number of crossovers identified per gamete (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 333 gametes) was consistent with the published number of crossovers for these gametes by using both the published haplotype (sg.xo KnownHaps) and the <italic toggle="yes">sgcocaller phase| swphase</italic> generated haplotype (sg.sxo SgHaps) (Figure <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">5C</xref>). Few chromosomes (2% by sg.xo KnownHaps; 3% by sg.sxo SgHaps) of the 2664 chromosomes studied here exhibited differences in crossover counts (Figure <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">5D</xref>). Out of the chromosomes that were called with different numbers of crossovers, 56% of them were called with fewer crossovers by sg.xo KnownHaps and 68% with fewer crossovers by sg.sxo SgHaps. Therefore, the discrepancy of results from the two methods resulted predominantly from sgcocaller being more conservative and calling fewer crossovers. Inspecting the crossover profile by chromosome regions has also demonstrated consistent genetic distances across the whole genome (Figure <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">5E</xref>).</p>
        <p>It is worth noting that not all cells available in the published study were analysed and included in the application results of sgcocaller due to the cell filtering step included in comapr which filtered out cells with excessive numbers of crossovers called and cells with poor SNP coverage. Chromosomes with excessive numbers of crossovers called are likely due to library preparation artefacts or abnormal chromosome segregation that results in implausibly many heterozygous SNPs in single gametes (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S5</xref>). comapr offers a systematic way of filtering out these cases and can be applied to all gametes. We provide guidelines in false crossover filtering from analysing different datasets (see <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Methods</xref> and <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S6</xref>).</p>

      <title>Simulated datasets with increased crossovers</title>
      <p>To test the performance of calling crossovers from gametes with increased crossovers comparing to the apricot and mouse sperm gametes, we simulated 100 cells each with 6 manually inserted crossovers spanning a 5M genomic region (see Supplementary Methods). We phased the hetSNPs in the 5M region and called crossovers for the 100 cells using sgcocaller. Only 95 hetSNPs (out of 21k hetSNPs) were phased incorrectly and all six crossovers were discovered for the 100 cells (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S7</xref>).</p>

      <title>sgcocaller advances performance and efficiency</title>
      <p>Many studies apply hidden Markov model based approaches for haplotype construction and crossover identification using sequencing or genotyping datasets (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43–46</xref>). The majority of them, however, used customised or in-house scripts for crossover calling (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>). Only a handful of them published reusable software tools or pipelines (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>), but none of them apply in the same scenarios as sgcocaller and comapr, which work directly on large-scale single-cell DNA sequencing datasets. The Hapi method, implemented in an R package, was proposed to construct chromosome-scale haplotypes using data from a small number of single gametes (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). Given a genotype matrix as input, it has functionalities overlapping with <italic toggle="yes">sgcocaller phase</italic> (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). We therefore compared the phasing performance of Hapi and <italic toggle="yes">sgcocaller phase|swphase</italic> on a total of four datasets: the individually sequenced mouse sperm cells (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>), the 11 human sperm cells (the same dataset used in the performance evaluation of Hapi in the original paper (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>), the apricot gamete dataset generated by the 10X scCNV protocol (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>), and lastly the low-coverage mouse sperm dataset that is more comparable to a contemporary droplet-based single-gamete DNA sequencing dataset (Figure <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">6E</xref>) (see Supplementary Methods). To measure uncertainty in method performance, we constructed dataset replicates by dividing the original sets of gametes into ten portions and each time leaving out one portion (10%) of the gametes. Since there were only 11 cells in total in the human sperm cell dataset, 11 dataset replicates were constructed (n = 10 cells each). Ten distinct datasets were constructed from the apricot gametes (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 330 or 331 gametes each), mouse sperm dataset (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 174 or 175 sperm cells), and the low coverage mouse sperm dataset (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 174 or 175 sperm cells). We ran Hapi and <italic toggle="yes">sgcocaller phase|swphase</italic> on these constructed datasets. The phasing accuracy, measured by calculating the fraction of SNPs agreeing with the ground-truth haplotype sequence, and the number of phased SNPs by each approach were compared (Figure <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">6A</xref>–<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">D</xref>).</p>

          <p>Phasing module performance comparison with existing method. The phasing performance of sgcocaller and Hapi were compared on the constructed dataset repeats from four different datasets, msperm_low-coverage, apricot (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>), msperm (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>), and hsperm (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>) (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table S1</xref>). (<bold>A</bold>) The number of phased SNPs and phasing accuracy from running two methods (sgcocaller and Hapi) on 10 constructed datasets from using the msperm_low-coverage sperm cells were compared (10 dataset repeats, each with 174 or 175 cells). msperm_low-coverage dataset was generated by downsampling DNA reads from msperm dataset. (<bold>B</bold>) Same as (A) but for the constructed 10 apricot gamete datasets (each dataset with <italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 330 or 331 gametes). Hapi failed when executing for two chromosomes and did not return values (2 out of 10 × 8 = 80 in total), which were not included in the plot. (<bold>C</bold>, <bold>D</bold>) The number of phased SNPs and phasing accuracy from running two methods on the 11 constructed datasets using 11 human sperm cells (hsperm) , and on the 10 constructed datasets using mouse sperm cells were plotted in boxplots.

(<bold>E</bold>) The characteristics of the four datasets were compared by comparing the SNP coverage rate and cell coverage rate using the first chromosome in each dataset. (<bold>F</bold>, <bold>G</bold>) The running time and memory usage by the two methods for phasing each chromosome using the constructed 10 datasets from the mouse sperm dataset (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>) were compared. Time was reported in format of hour:minute:seconds, and memory was measured in units of mega bytes (MB). Measurements were reported by the ‘benchmark’ function from <monospace>Snakemake</monospace> (<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>).</p>

      </fig>
      <p>On the lower coverage datasets, (the apricot gamete dataset and the low-coverage mouse sperm dataset), the advantage of <italic toggle="yes">sgcocaller phase|swphase</italic> is readily apparent with far more SNPs phased and much higher accuracy. <italic toggle="yes">sgcocaller phase|swphase</italic> generated haplotypes that were concordant with the published haploid genome assembly with lowest accuracy across all chromosomes in all dataset repeats of 97.6% for the apricot dataset. All chromosomes were phased with accuracy above 99.99% for the low-coverage mouse sperm datasets by <italic toggle="yes">sgcocaller phase|swphase</italic> (Figure <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">6A</xref>, B). We also validated that <italic toggle="yes">autophase</italic>, which runs <italic toggle="yes">sgcocaller swphase</italic> automatically after sgcocaller phase, can produce the same output as <italic toggle="yes">sgcocaller phase|swphase</italic> (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S8</xref>). In contrast, Hapi delivered median accuracy below 75% for the apricot datasets and only 50% accuracy (equivalent to random guessing) for the low-coverage mouse sperm datasets. Hapi’s poor accuracy on these datasets makes its results unusable for downstream applications like crossover calling.</p>
      <p>On the high coverage datasets (the mouse sperm dataset and the human sperm dataset), <italic toggle="yes">sgcocaller phase|swphase</italic> achieved equivalent or greater haplotype completeness in terms of the number of phased SNPs compared to Hapi (Figure <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">6C</xref>, D). <italic toggle="yes">sgcocaller phase|swphase</italic> achieved near perfect accuracy for all sperm combinations (all above 0.99), whereas Hapi repeatedly generated unusable phasing results (accuracy &lt;0.6) for chromosome 12, 14, 17, 18 for the mouse sperm datasets (Figure <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">6C</xref>). Hapi did not perform stably for the 11 human sperm datasets, but <italic toggle="yes">sgcocaller phase|swphase</italic> always generated phasing results with accuracy &gt;97% across all chromosomes in all human sperm combinations. (Figure <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">6D</xref>). Hapi also failed for four chromosome runs that triggered errors (out of 242 chromosomes tested across all datasets), which were excluded from the comparison.</p>
      <p>We compared the differences among the four datasets, which showed that the human sperm sequencing dataset and the mouse sperm sequencing data have much higher SNP coverage per cell and cell coverage per SNP compared to the apricot dataset (Figure <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">6E</xref>). The low coverage mouse sperm dataset has coverage distributions that are more comparable to the apricot dataset.</p>
      <p>In summary, <italic toggle="yes">sgcocaller phase|swphase</italic> outperforms Hapi on both high coverage data and low coverage data with <italic toggle="yes">sgcocaller phase|swphase</italic> more dominant in the low coverage datasets.</p>

        <title>Computational efficiency</title>
        <p>We compared the computational efficiency of the two methods (sgcocaller and Hapi) on the large mouse sperm dataset and measured the running time as well as memory usage on each of the ten dataset repeats. The running time required by <italic toggle="yes">sgcocaller phase</italic> plus <italic toggle="yes">sgcocaller swphase</italic> was only 11–38% of the total time taken by Hapi (comparing the median running time of each chromosome). Considering <italic toggle="yes">sgcocaller phase</italic> timing results includes an extra step of parsing the DNA read file (BAM file) and variant file (VCF file), <italic toggle="yes">sgcocaller phase</italic> is even more advantageous in terms of speed than these results indicate. Examining diagnostic plots generated from <italic toggle="yes">sgcocaller phase</italic> can help with identifying switch errors so that <italic toggle="yes">sgcocaller swphase</italic> can be run selectively. Nevertheless, <italic toggle="yes">swphase</italic> was applied to all chromosomes and the total running times were still many-fold shorter than Hapi. In terms of memory usage, since <italic toggle="yes">sgcocaller phase</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">sgcocaller swphase</italic> were run consecutively, the process that used larger memory was regarded as the memory used by sgcocaller. From comparing the reported max_rss (the maximum amount of memory occupied by a process at any time that is held in main memory (RAM)) by <monospace>Snakemake</monospace> (<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>), sgcocaller required only 30–50% of the memory required by Hapi (Figure <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">6F</xref>, G).</p>

      <title>Scalability of sgcocaller</title>
      <p>We tested the scalability of different modules in sgcocaller with input files of varying sizes including different numbers of cells, numbers of DNA reads per cell, and numbers of hetSNPs available. We ran each module and recorded the computational usages by each module on the simulated datasets (See <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Methods</xref> and <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S9A, B</xref>). Across all simulated datasets, all programs can be finished in 6 hours using less than 5GB of memory excluding <italic toggle="yes">sgcocaller sxo</italic>. We observed substantial improvement of processing speed of <italic toggle="yes">sgcocaller sxo</italic> over <italic toggle="yes">sgcocaller xo</italic> but <italic toggle="yes">sgcocaller sxo</italic> also required much more memory for larger datasets. Therefore, we would recommend using <italic toggle="yes">sgcocaller xo</italic> with the generated phased VCF from sgcocaller instead of running <italic toggle="yes">sgcocaller sxo</italic> when processing large datasets (when analysing &gt;1500 cells with &gt;400k SNPs) and memory is not sufficient.</p>
      <p>To characterise the current scale of single-gamete sequencing datasets, we obtained the DNA sequences of sperm cells from donor 1 in a large-scale study (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). We selected the top 3000 cell barcodes with the largest number of DNA reads. We counted the number of hetSNPs and mean number of DNA reads per cell for each chromosome after pre-processing (see Supplementary Methods, and <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S9C</xref>). Lastly we applied sgcocaller phase, swphase and sxo on these sperm cells and measured the running times and memory usages of each program (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S9D, E</xref>). Each program was executed with three repeats and the computational usages were recorded using the benchmark function in <monospace>Snakemake</monospace>(<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>). For all the chromosomes tested, each module was finished in under 2 hours with maximum memory usage under 2.5 Gb (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S9D, E</xref>). In conclusion, sgcocaller can handle current and larger-scale single-gamete datasets.</p>

    <title>DISCUSSION</title>
    <p>We have introduced a toolkit that consists of a command-line tool and a Bioconductor/R package for processing large-scale single-gamete DNA read datasets for individualised haplotype construction, crossover identification, and crossover landscape analysis. Personal haplotype construction is important in population genetics and clinical genetics for interpreting rare and disease-implicated variants (<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>). Genomes of haploid gametes provide information of ‘long-range’ haplotype blocks of the diploid donors and can be revealed via standard short-read sequencing. Single-gamete data generated using low-depth short-read sequencing are sufficient for reconstructing the two personal haplotypes by aggregating linkage information in a group of gametes.</p>
    <p>Existing read-based haplotype construction methods have also been applied on single-gamete sequencing datasets. For example, HapCUT2 (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>) was applied on human sperm datasets for generating individualised haplotypes (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). However, applying HapCUT2 to single-gamete datasets requires extra pre-processing of the aligned DNA reads from gametes for generating the single gamete genotypes, from which a specially formatted fragment file can be constructed (see Supplementary Methods). However, sgcocaller reduces these extensive processing steps and wraps them into one (two) module(s) specifically designed for phasing single-gamete datasets with better phasing performance than HapCUT2 (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S10</xref>).</p>
    <p>Taking advantage of SNP linkage information in single-gamete data, <italic toggle="yes">sgcocaller phase</italic> is able to construct personal haplotypes with standard short-read sequencing methods to near perfect accuracy. Comparisons with other phasing methods demonstrate that <italic toggle="yes">sgcocaller phase</italic> offers better performance on single-cell sequenced gametes in terms of accuracy and efficiency. Crucially, haplotypes constructed with <italic toggle="yes">sgcocaller phase</italic> solely from single-gamete sequencing data are sufficiently accurate to support highly accurate downstream crossover calling with sgcocaller’s crossover calling methods. sgcocaller achieves highly accurate phasing results in settings where competitors fail to generate usable haplotypes for crossover calling. The outputs of sgcocaller can be conveniently imported into R with the comapr package for sophisticated crossover landscape visualisation and analysis.</p>
    <p>The list of hetSNPs can be identified from the pooled DNA reads from all gametes as we demonstrated. The list of hetSNPs can also come from other sources such as whole genome DNA sequencing of the sample. Applying stringent filtering is helpful for obtaining the list of higher quality hetSNP markers. For example, filtering of hetSNPs to remove SNPs in genome regions that may cause problems in alignment and genotyping (e.g. centromeres, highly repetitive regions, paralogous regions) is also beneficial when running sgcocaller phase and crossover calling.</p>
    <p>Our gamete-based haplotype phasing model has limitations. The model uses the hetSNP linkage information in the gametes and assumes the nearby hetSNPs are close and crossovers rarely break the linkages among them. For cases where the density of hetSNPs is low, but evenly distributed along the chromosome region, the phasing model can still produce correctly phased haplotypes with reduced completeness (the number of phased hetSNPs is low; <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S11C</xref>). However, it is more problematic when phasing individuals which have large regions of homozygosity, e.g., F1 samples from two closely related parental strains. The hetSNPs located near the large regions of homozygosity may have been assorted to gametes independently and may presumably violate the linkage assumption. Thus, the phasing model may fail and could potentially generate phased haplotypes with switch errors. Since the power to detect crossovers is closely related to the number of hetSNPs, access only to sparse hetSNPs reduces the ability to detect crossovers and the resolution of the crossovers detected (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S11A, B</xref>).</p>
    <p>Due to the current design of the methods, <italic toggle="yes">sgcocaller|comapr</italic> are limited to the analysis of gametes from diploid organisms. Currently, sgcocaller only supports using multiple threads for decompressing the input BAM file and recommends users to run each chromosome in parallel to reduce computational time. Future work in the development of sgcocaller might include updating the program to include the multi-threading feature by chromosomes internally and supporting analyses for polyploid organisms.</p>
    <p>The application demonstrations of <italic toggle="yes">sgcocaller|comapr</italic> on public datasets show that <italic toggle="yes">sgcocaller|comapr</italic> are able to produce stable and higher accuracy results than other methods with greater convenience and computational efficiency for large datasets. Although <italic toggle="yes">sgcocaller|comapr</italic> are optimised to work with cell-barcoded DNA reads, we also demonstrated and showed examples of how our tools can be applied on bulk-sequenced individual gametes. Using the modern programming language Nim and building on top of C-based libraries, sgcocaller processes the large genomic datasets efficiently. The multiple release formats of sgcocaller enable it to be more accessible to the community.</p>
    <p>We demonstrated the application of our models to datasets generated using the 10X single-cell CNV protocols. Datasets generated using protocols such as single-cell ATAC-seq offer a promising alternative approach and we predict that our models will work well on such datasets. However, different technologies generate datasets with different genome coverages and single-cell ATAC-seq datasets are likely to have less genome coverage than datasets produced with the single-cell CNV method. Therefore, the number of crossovers detected from single-cell ATAC-seq datasets is likely to be slightly lower. We are less optimistic on single sperm datasets generated using 10X single-cell RNA-seq methods for crossover identification due to the possible transcript sharing among gametes via cytoplasmic bridges (<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>). Although the sharing of transcripts may be biased towards the underlying haplotypes of the gamete, which may be used for inferring haplotypes of the gametes’ genomes for crossover identification (<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>), the low depth of coverage in 10X single-cell RNA-seq data makes it challenging. In settings that are not subject to transcript sharing among individual gametes, we expect our methods to perform well on single-cell RNA-seq data.</p>
    <p>Advances in single-cell DNA sequencing technologies that generate larger-scale and higher-quality datasets enable exciting opportunities for research using personalised meiotic crossover landscapes (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Abnormal meiotic crossovers are often associated with infertility (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Therefore, characterising individual meiotic crossover profiles and studying crossovers as a phenotype using single-cell techniques has application in reproduction clinics. Fundamental mechanisms and factors affecting meiotic crossovers remain active research topics. Using single-gamete methods for generating and comparing crossover profiles of individuals with different conditions has many advantages over traditional approaches that require recruiting large sample sizes (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Our software serves as a complete toolkit for the first step of studies to inspect the single gamete data of an individual for understanding individual-level variations in meiotic crossovers.</p>

    <title>CONCLUSION</title>
    <p>Available in multiple release formats (nimble package, static binary, docker image, bioconda package), sgcocaller fills the gap of a highly accurate and efficient tool with simple installation for constructing personalised haplotypes and calling crossovers in single gametes from single-cell and bulk DNA sequenced gametes. The availability of the companion Bioconductor/R package comapr enables the downstream statistical analysis of crossovers in the cells and among individuals, integrating well with existing R packages for various visualisation and exploratory analysis tasks. In concert, these packages represent a comprehensive, user-friendly toolkit for the construction and analysis of personalised crossover landscapes from single-gamete sequencing data.</p>
