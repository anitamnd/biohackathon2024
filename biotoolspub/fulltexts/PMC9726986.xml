      <p id="Par1">Alternative splicing (AS) is a post-transcriptional regulation that leads to the complexity of the transcriptome. Despite the growing importance of AS in cancer research, the role of AS has not been systematically studied, especially in understanding cancer molecular classification. Herein, we analyzed the molecular subtype-specific regulation of AS using The Cancer Genome Atlas data and constructed a web-based database, named Alternative Splicing for Cancer Molecular Classification (AS-CMC). Our system harbors three analysis modules for exploring subtype-specific AS events, evaluating their phenotype association, and performing pan-cancer comparison. The number of subtype-specific AS events was found to be diverse across cancer types, and some differentially regulated AS events were recurrently found in multiple cancer types. We analyzed a subtype-specific AS in exon 11 of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 7 (<italic>MAP3K7</italic>) as an example of a pan-cancer AS biomarker. This AS marker showed significant association with the survival of patients with stomach adenocarcinoma. Our analysis revealed AS as an important determinant for cancer molecular classification. AS-CMC is the first web-based resource that provides a comprehensive tool to explore the biological implications of AS events, facilitating the discovery of novel AS biomarkers.</p>

    <title>Introduction</title>
    <p id="Par2">Integrated clustering of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) has identified distinct molecular subtypes of diverse human cancers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. The molecular subtypes are known to be associated with distinct drug responses and prognosis of cancers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Therefore, precise molecular classification is important for better understanding of tumorigenesis as well as improving treatment outcomes for patients with cancer. The molecular subtypes have been mainly established based on DNA methylation, copy number alteration, mRNA, and microRNA genomics data. However, the role of post-transcriptional regulation in these molecular classifications has not been extensively studied due to the technical constraints encountered during the analysis and interpretation of post-transcriptional processes.</p>
    <p id="Par3">Alternative splicing (AS) is an important post-transcriptional process that generates RNA isoforms, leading to transcriptome diversity. AS refers to alternative usage of exons and introns, thus consequently altering the protein structure or abundance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. The role of AS in organ development and tumorigenesis has been increasingly realized with the recent advances in RNA-sequencing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Previous AS-related studies in cancer have identified cancer-specific and clinically relevant AS events<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Indeed, a number of AS events have been reported to be associated with the prognosis of diverse cancers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>, suggesting their clinical implications. Recently, cancer-specific AS events have emerged as a source of neoantigens, thus raising the possibility of using AS in clinical settings<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Studies have shown that pharmacological splicing modulation can generate neoantigens, which can be effectively employed in immunotherapy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>.</p>
    <p id="Par4">With the growing interest in the role of AS in cancer, several splicing-related databases have been developed using TCGA RNA-sequencing data. TCGASpliceSeq has provided percent spliced in (PSI) values for AS events, which has allowed users to compare changes in AS across cancer types<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. ExonSkipDB database can be used to understand AS events in the context of mutation and epigenetic background<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. The recently updated OncoSplicing database focuses on identifying clinically relevant AS events in cancer development by conducting survival and differential analyses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. ASPN, a splicing-derived neoepitope database, has compiled a list of potential AS-derived neoepitopes found in 16 types of cancers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. However, these databases have focused on identifying cancer-specific alterations in AS, and the role of AS in cancer classification has not been systematically explored to date.</p>
    <p id="Par5">To expand the molecular determinants for cancer classification, herein we have analyzed differentially regulated AS events in molecular subtypes of cancer using TCGA data. To promote the discovery of AS events as biomarkers, we have developed a pan-cancer database named AS-CMC (Alternative Splicing for Cancer Molecular Classification). This is a novel database for allowing users to browse subtype-specific changes in AS along with phenotypic associations for each cancer type as well as compare the regulation pattern across diverse cancer types. As an example, we have provided a potential AS event as a pan-cancer biomarker that can distinguish among molecular subtypes.</p>

      <title>AS-CMC analysis modules</title>
      <p id="Par6">AS-CMC is comprised of the following three analysis modules: “Subtype-specific AS,” “Phenotype association,” and “Pan-cancer comparison” (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The “Subtype-specific AS” module allows users to identify AS events with significant differences between molecular subtypes in each cancer type. The “Phenotype association” module enables prioritization of AS events by relevance in terms of clinical outcomes (patient-level), cancer microenvironment scores (tissue-level), and gene expression levels (gene-level). The “Pan-cancer comparison” module can be used to compare the statistical significance of an AS event across cancer types.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>AS-CMC workflow. AS-CMC provides three analysis modules. In the “Subtype-specific AS” module (top left), differential regulation of AS PSI values was tested among molecular subtypes provided by TCGAbiolinks. We used AS events in five splice types (ES, RI, AA, AD, and ME). In the “Phenotype association” module (bottom left), each AS event was evaluated in association with patient-level (clinical outcomes), tissue-level (microenvironment), and gene-level (gene-expression) data. In the “Pan-cancer comparison” module (right), the analyzed data pertaining to each AS event is displayed in a panoramic view across cancer types. In the pan-cancer view, users can access plots summarizing subtype-specificity, clinical implications, and correlations with gene expression. The figure was created with BioRender.com.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="41598_2022_25584_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p>
      <p id="Par7">For constructing the “Subtype-specific AS” module, we used PSI values of AS events based on TCGASpliceSeq<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup> and molecular subtype information provided by TCGA marker papers (Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>) through the TCGAbiolinks R package<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. We performed analysis of variance (ANOVA) and selected subtype-specific AS events if they had <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001 and could explain at least 10% of the variation (adjusted R<sup>2</sup>). AS events were categorized into the following five types: exon skip (ES), retained intron (RI), alternate acceptor sites (AA), alternate donor sites (AD), and mutually exclusive exons (ME).</p>
      <p id="Par8">For the “Phenotype association” module, we utilized patient clinical data, molecular scores reflecting the cancer microenvironment, and gene-level expression data. For assessing the association with patient survival, users can compare patient survival rates between high- and low-PSI groups for a given AS. In the cancer microenvironment part, users can investigate the correlations between the changes in AS and predefined scores indicating the status of immune and stromal cells, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and hypoxia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. Users can also examine the correlations of each AS event with expression levels of all genes. The gene expression levels correlated with AS PSI values enables determination of biological pathways underlying AS changes. The relationship of the host gene with AS helps in assessing the dependency of the AS event on transcriptional regulation. If the AS is independent of gene expression, it is likely regulated solely by splicing machinery.</p>
      <p id="Par9">“Pan-cancer comparison” module can be used to determine whether the subtype-specific AS regulation is cancer-specific. The module provides panoramic views summarizing the analysis results across cancer types. Users can check whether the biological and clinical association of an AS event is observed in multiple cancer types, which can promote the discovery of pan-cancer AS markers.</p>

    <sec id="Sec4">
      <title>Landscape of subtype-specific AS in TCGA</title>
      <p id="Par10">We focused on 24 TCGA cancer types with available molecular subtype information among 33 types (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a). The sample size for each cancer type varied from 57 to 1094. Details of the molecular subtypes of the selected 24 cancers are listed in Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref>. Of the five AS types, ES was observed to be the most common event, followed by RI (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b). We found that the number of subtype-specific AS events are diverse across cancers. Kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC) was observed to have the highest number of subtype-specific AS events (n = 1838), and 74% of them were found to be associated with patient survival (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b,c; Tables <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S3</xref> and <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S4</xref>; average <italic>p</italic>-value of three survival tests &lt; 0.05). Skin cutaneous melanoma (SKCM) showed the lowest number (n = 24) of subtype-specific AS events, and none of them were found to be associated with survival. Since the difference in sample size can affect the selection of subtype-specific AS event, we checked the relationship between the number of samples and the number of significant AS events (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). The degree of correlation was generally not high but varies in cancer types or splicing types. Users should be aware that some cancer types with small sample size may have fewer AS events than they actually do.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Landscape of subtype-specific AS in TCGA. <bold>(a)</bold> The 24 cancer types included in AS-CMC and number of samples in each cancer type.

      <title>AS-CMC user interface</title>
      <p id="Par11">AS-CMC has a user-friendly interface that allows researchers to explore AS events in TCGA molecular subtypes. The brief introduction and summary statistics are shown on the home page (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.pmrc.re.kr/ASCMC/">https://www.pmrc.re.kr/ASCMC/</ext-link>). Our web service consists of two parts, viz., “Single-cancer AS” and “Pan-cancer AS.” In the “Single-cancer AS” part, users can browse subtype-specific AS events for each cancer type (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a). Users can get basic statistics from ANOVA and correlation analysis in tabular form. The subtype-specific regulation and relationship with phenotypes can be visualized in a pop-up window (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>b). In the survival plot section, AS-CMC provides three plots representing the survival difference between the groups for an AS event according to the following PSI cut-offs: 50% (upper 50% vs. lower 50%), 25% (upper 25% vs. lower 25%), and 10% (upper 10% vs. lower 10%); for example, the survival difference between the groups with an upper 25% PSI value and the ones with a lower 25% PSI value is provided. The log rank <italic>p</italic>-value is shown for each plot. At the tissue level, AS-CMC provides the following plots showing the relevance of the cancer microenvironment: association with immune infiltration, hypoxia, and EMT scores. AS-CMC provides the distribution plot of AS PSI values and gene expression levels among molecular subtypes, and the correlation coefficient plot of the AS event with all genes in a cancer type is also provided.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>An example of “Single-cancer AS” part in AS-CMC. <bold>(a)</bold> List of subtype-specific AS events for a selected cancer type. Once a cancer type is selected, the subtype-specific AS events are shown with relevant statistics displayed in a tabular form.

      <p id="Par12">The other part, viz., “Pan-cancer AS”, provides pan-cancer views for a selected AS event (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>a). For the queried AS event, users can compare subtype-specificity, clinical association, and correlation with genes in a heatmap. Users can prioritize AS events by choosing the AS event type, the minimum <italic>p</italic>-value across cancer types, or relevant biological pathways. Each AS event is displayed with cancer types showing subtype-specificity. Pan-cancer plot for subtype-specificity shows both ANOVA <italic>p</italic>-values and adjusted R<sup>2</sup> values across cancer types (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>b). In the pan-cancer survival plot, each cancer type is allotted three data points, which are derived from three survival tests based on PSI cutoff in creating patient groups (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>c). The correlations between the AS event and host gene expression can be compared in a heatmap (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>d). The correlations between the AS event and all genes can also be visualized using a heatmap (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>e). Users can download the analyzed data.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>“Pan-cancer comparison” using AS-CMC. <bold>(a)</bold> Selection panel for AS events.

An ES event in exon 11 of <italic>MAP3K7</italic> (mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase 7) gene (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>a) was chosen as this marker showed significant subtype-specificity in 10 cancer types (marked by red on x-axis in Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>b). In the survival analysis, the skipping of the exon was found to be strongly associated with poor clinical outcome in stomach adenocarcinoma (STAD), which was the most significant across all cancer types (log-rank <italic>p</italic> = 0.0002 between upper 10% and lower 10% groups) (marked by the darkest red in Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>c). The survival difference was found to be the largest in the most stringent cut-off (upper 10% vs lower 10%) (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>d). This AS was observed to be likely independent of the transcriptional regulation based on the correlation with the <italic>MAP3K7</italic> gene (|r|&lt; 0.25) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>d). Notably, the PSI values were correlated with the expression levels of many genes encoding EMT markers (VIM, ZEB1, and ZEB2) and EMT-related RNA binding proteins (QKI, RBFOX2, RBM47, and ESRP1) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>e). Intriguingly, 17 out of 24 cancer types shared the correlation pattern, indicating that they have a common mechanism underlying the AS of <italic>MAP3K7</italic>.</p>
      <p id="Par14"><italic>MAP3K7</italic> AS was analyzed in depth in STAD due to its significant association with survival (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>c). Among the five molecular subtypes of STAD, only GI.GS subtype showed significant distribution of PSI values compared to the other subtypes (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>b). The PSI values were correlated with the molecular scores related to EMT scores (r = − 0.71) (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>c). Taken together, these data support that an ES event in exon 11 of <italic>MAP3K7</italic> may play a role in regulating subtypes across diverse cancers, and that this event may particularly play a crucial role in STAD, where its function has not been reported earlier.</p>

    <title>Discussion</title>
    <p id="Par15">Molecular classification of cancer is important for precision medicine as it represents the pathophysiology of cancers and can have prognostic value. In recent years, large-scale genomic studies have aided the molecular classification of cancers. Since 2011, the TCGA network has published marker papers providing molecular subtypes for 24 cancer types based on the integrated analysis of the multi-omics data<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. However, the role of AS in defining molecular subtypes and predicting progression of cancers has not been extensively studied.</p>
    <p id="Par16">AS enhances proteomic diversity by altering protein composition or abundance, which can provide a basis for studying underlying mechanisms of human diseases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. In this study, we focused on AS events involved in the molecular classification of cancer that can serve as cancer biomarkers for understanding the pathophysiology of cancers and prediction of the prognosis. Through a comprehensive analysis of AS events in 24 TCGA cancer types, we developed AS-CMC platform to evaluate each AS in association with clinical outcomes, cancer microenvironment, and gene expression.</p>
    <p id="Par17">Compared to other AS databases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>, AS-CMC has distinct advantages. First, it enables the evaluation of the functionality of AS events by incorporating various molecular scores reflecting cancer microenvironment. Cancer microenvironment changes dynamically and contributes to the dynamic nature of events associated with tumor progression such as angiogenesis and metastasis. We collected various molecular scores from published data<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. Extensive immunogenomic analyses provided cellular fraction estimates important for exploring immunogenicity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. EMT, a biological process that promotes cancer metastasis, was measured in a cancer sample using gene expression profiles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. Recent studies have developed hypoxia-associated signature to infer the level of molecular oxygen in tumor tissues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>.</p>
    <p id="Par18">Another advantage of AS-CMC is that it can be used to assess the utility of pan-cancer AS biomarkers by providing a pan-cancer view of their biological and clinical associations. It allows testing whether the subtype-specific regulation is recurrent across diverse cancers. The ES event in <italic>MAP3K7</italic> gene (exon 11) was represented in this study as a potential pan-cancer AS biomarker capable of discriminating molecular subtypes in 10 cancer types. Exon 11 is 81 bp in size, and encodes 27 amino acids between the kinase and regulatory domains<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. The function of this AS has been mainly reported in breast cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. Our study has suggested a potential role of <italic>MAP3K7</italic> AS in STAD due to its significant association with patient survival. The protein expression of <italic>MAP3K7</italic> gene was reported to be involved in gastric cancer progression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>; however, the role of AS is unknown. We also suggest a potential function of <italic>MAP3K7</italic> AS in EMT based on the coexpression pattern of genes with <italic>MAP3K7</italic> AS. EMT marker genes were found to be consistently correlated with <italic>MAP3K7</italic> AS across 17 cancer types (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>e), indicating that the regulation mechanism is common beyond breast cancer.</p>
    <p id="Par19">Despite the growing interest in AS in association with cancer, the functional investigation of AS events for biomarker development has not been completely explored due to insufficient data and analysis tools. AS-CMC can prove to be a valuable resource to identify and prioritize AS events for cancer classification. In the future, we continue to update the AS-CMC by including more phenotype association data and using other AS tools to calculate PSI values differently.</p>

      <title>Data</title>
      <p id="Par20">For TCGA data analysis, the information pertaining to cancer molecular subtypes was obtained from the TCGAbiolinks R package<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. We used the most prominent subtype classification for a given tumor, which was found in the column called “Selected subtype” (Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>). TCGAbiolinks provided gene expression and patient survival data as well. For AS in TCGA samples, we used the per-cent-spliced-in index (PSI) value from the TCGASpliceSeq database<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Even though seven AS types exist in the database, we selected the following five AS types: ES, RI, AA, AD, and ME. Alternative promoter and alternative termination types were excluded because they are regulated by transcription initiation and termination in addition to splicing.</p>

      <title>Collection of tissue-level molecular scores using TCGA data</title>
      <p id="Par21">We used various predefined scores to estimate the phenotype of cancer tissues in TCGA data. For immune cell infiltration, the fraction of leukocytes and CIBERSORT immune cells were downloaded from an immunogenomics analysis (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://gdc.cancer.gov/about-data/publications/panimmune">https://gdc.cancer.gov/about-data/publications/panimmune</ext-link>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. We also used molecular scores indicating immune and stemness signatures based on the expression levels of their marker genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. For EMT, we used two scores based on the mRNA expression of EMT marker genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>, which were obtained from a previous report<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. For the level of molecular oxygen in tumor samples, we used 8 types of hypoxia scores (Buffa, Winter, Ragnum, West, Sorensen, Elvidge, Hu, and Seigneuric) in 19 cancer types in TCGA data<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="Sec11">
      <title>Statistical analysis</title>
      <p id="Par22">We selected subtype-specific AS events by analysis of variance (ANOVA) (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001 and adjusted R<sup>2</sup> &gt; 0.1) for each cancer type. To evaluate whether AS is related with transcriptional regulation, we calculated the correlation coefficient of the PSI values with the expression level of the host gene containing an AS event. For clinical association, we performed survival analysis between high- and low-PSI groups. The threshold to separate the two groups was defined as 10%, 25%, and 50% in the PSI value distribution. The significance of differential survival rates was evaluated by log rank test. Hazard ratio was calculated based on the Cox regression test. For each AS event, correlation analysis for various molecular scores was performed by calculating Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient in R.</p>

      <title>Construction of web-based database</title>
      <p id="Par23">The web interface was written in the R programming language using the shiny package. The Plotly R graphing library was used to generate interactive visualization. Our analyzed data can be accessed in two ways: “Single-cancer AS” and “Pan-cancer AS.” In the “Single-cancer AS,” users can select the cancer type first and get the list of AS events with the statistical analysis results. In the “Pan-cancer AS,” users can obtain pan-cancer views for a selected AS event. The result table can be sorted by clicking the column names of the table and can be filtered by selecting one of the predefined criteria.</p>
