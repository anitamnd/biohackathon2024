      <p>With the exponential growth of sequence information stored over the last decade, including that of <italic toggle="yes">de novo</italic> assembled contigs from RNA-Seq experiments, quantification of chimeric sequences has become essential when assembling read data. In transcriptomics, <italic toggle="yes">de novo</italic> assembled chimeras can closely resemble underlying transcripts, but patterns such as those seen between co-evolving sites, or mapped read counts, become obscured. We have created a de Bruijn based <italic toggle="yes">de novo</italic> assembler for RNA-Seq data that utilizes a classification system to describe the complexity of underlying graphs from which contigs are created. Each contig is labelled with one of three levels, indicating whether or not ambiguous paths exist. A by-product of this is information on the range of complexity of the underlying gene families present. As a demonstration of CStones ability to assemble high-quality contigs, and to label them in this manner, both simulated and real data were used. For simulated data, ten million read pairs were generated from cDNA libraries representing four species, <italic toggle="yes">Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Panthera pardus</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Rattus norvegicus</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">Serinus canaria</italic>. These were assembled using CStone, Trinity and rnaSPAdes; the latter two being high-quality, well established, <italic toggle="yes">de novo</italic> assembers. For real data, two RNA-Seq datasets, each consisting of ≈30 million read pairs, representing two adult <italic toggle="yes">D</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">melanogaster</italic> whole-body samples were used. The contigs that CStone produced were comparable in quality to those of Trinity and rnaSPAdes in terms of length, sequence identity of aligned regions and the range of cDNA transcripts represented, whilst providing additional information on chimerism. Here we describe the details of CStones assembly and classification process, and propose that similar classification systems can be incorporated into other <italic toggle="yes">de novo</italic> assembly tools. Within a related side study, we explore the effects that chimera’s within reference sets have on the identification of differentially expression genes.

      <p>Within transcriptome reference sets, non-chimeric sequences are representations of transcribed genes, while artificially generated chimeric ones are mosaics of two or more pieces of DNA incorrectly pieced together. One area where such sets are utilized is in the quantification of gene expression patterns; where RNA-Seq reads are mapped to the sequences within, and subsequent count values reflect expression levels. Artificial chimeras can have a negative impact on count values by erroneously increasing variation in relation to the reads being mapped. Reference sets can be created from <italic toggle="yes">de novo</italic> assembled contigs, but chimeras can be introduced during the assembly process via the required traversal of graphs, representing gene families, constructed from the RNA-Seq data. Graph complexity determines how likely chimeras will arise. We have created CStone, a <italic toggle="yes">de novo</italic> assembler that utilizes a classification system to describe such complexity. Contigs created by CStone are labelled in a manner that indicates whether or not they are non-chimeric. This encourages contig dependent results to be presented with increased objectivity by maintaining the context of ambiguity associated with the assembly process. CStone has been tested extensively. Additionally, we have quantified the relationship between chimeras within reference sets and the identification of differentially expressed genes.</p>

    <title>Introduction</title>
    <p>In the field of transcriptomics, awareness of chimeric sequences has been present for many years [<xref rid="pcbi.1009631.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1009631.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], but with the expansion of short-read sequencing technologies [<xref rid="pcbi.1009631.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], and the associated exponential growth of sequence information stored [<xref rid="pcbi.1009631.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], chimera quantification has become essential. Within transcriptome reference sets, such as the cDNA databases available from Ensembl representing various species [<xref rid="pcbi.1009631.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], or those that are <italic toggle="yes">de novo</italic> assembled from short-read RNA-Seq data, non-chimeric sequences are direct representations of transcribed genes, while artificially generated chimeric ones are mosaics of two or more pieces of DNA incorrectly pieced together. The latter occurring during library preparation [<xref rid="pcbi.1009631.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1009631.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], or during the <italic toggle="yes">de novo</italic> assembly process [<xref rid="pcbi.1009631.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1009631.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], where there is a requirement to traverse paths across graphs constructed from read data that ranges in complexity depending on the nature of the gene families being represented [<xref rid="pcbi.1009631.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>–<xref rid="pcbi.1009631.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Chimeras also occur at a genomic level during <italic toggle="yes">de novo</italic> assembly, such as when inferring haplotypes [<xref rid="pcbi.1009631.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1009631.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], but the causes, and consequences, at a genomic level are different [<xref rid="pcbi.1009631.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>–<xref rid="pcbi.1009631.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In genomic assembly the aim is to reconstruct fewer large contigs that represent chromosomes [<xref rid="pcbi.1009631.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1009631.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Contigs produced by genomic assemblers are often utilized within the scope of population studies, in conjunction with mapping of whole genome read data, in order quantify and compare nucleotide variation or to annotate coding regions [<xref rid="pcbi.1009631.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1009631.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. In transcriptomics, the goal is to quantify tens of thousands of expressed genes, and gene isoforms, that differ in length and expression pattern [<xref rid="pcbi.1009631.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1009631.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Differences such as these have lead to a distinction in how algorithms, and data structures, are optimized for either genomic or transcriptomic level assembly. In the absence of an available transcriptome reference, there are many RNA-Seq short-read assemblers available including, ABySS [<xref rid="pcbi.1009631.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], Trinity [<xref rid="pcbi.1009631.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], BinPacker [<xref rid="pcbi.1009631.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] and rnaSPAdes [<xref rid="pcbi.1009631.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Approaches, such as that implemented within the more recent Stringtie2 [<xref rid="pcbi.1009631.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], that combine short-reads with the longer ones produced by single-molecule mRNA sequencing techniques [<xref rid="pcbi.1009631.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], developed by companies including Pacific Biosciences and Oxford Nanopore Technology, have demonstrated high reliability; and are likely to greatly reduce chimera content once such data becomes routine [<xref rid="pcbi.1009631.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>–<xref rid="pcbi.1009631.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. In addition to <italic toggle="yes">de novo</italic> approaches, pipelines that combine genomic references with usage of splice aligners, such as Tophat2 [<xref rid="pcbi.1009631.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], HISAT2 [<xref rid="pcbi.1009631.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] and SOAPsplice [<xref rid="pcbi.1009631.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], in order to map RNA-Seq reads, estimate exons, splice-sites and subsequent transcripts, are also available [<xref rid="pcbi.1009631.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1009631.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. The fundamental role that these tools play in RNA-Seq data analyse is reflected in the range of approaches developed as well as in the many reviews and benchmarking studies published [<xref rid="pcbi.1009631.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1009631.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>–<xref rid="pcbi.1009631.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>].</p>
    <p>Chimeric contigs can closely resemble expressed transcripts, but patterns such as those between co-evolving sites [<xref rid="pcbi.1009631.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], remapped read counts [<xref rid="pcbi.1009631.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1009631.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] and polymorphisms [<xref rid="pcbi.1009631.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1009631.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] become obscured, and chimera presence has a poorly quantified impact on data analysis [<xref rid="pcbi.1009631.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1009631.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1009631.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. In relation to transcriptomics, included within data analysis is at times the characterization of gene differential expression patterns, where the primary signal utilized are the differences in mapped read counts, across datasets allocated to differing conditions, relative to sequences within a reference [<xref rid="pcbi.1009631.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Increasing levels of variation between reference sequences and the reads being mapped decreases mapping accuracy [<xref rid="pcbi.1009631.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>], and artificially generated chimeras created during <italic toggle="yes">de novo</italic> assembly increase such variation by: (i) erroneously swapping parts of expressed transcripts with others, (ii) introducing sequencing variation at breakpoints within chimeric paths and (iii) over extension of contigs. It is therefore advantageous to know whether or not <italic toggle="yes">de novo</italic> assembled reference contigs have the possibility of being chimeric, so that care can be taken when finalizing conclusions following data analysis. A crucial part of <italic toggle="yes">de novo</italic> transcriptome assembly of short-read data is the arrangement of information present within reads into structures that represent full or partial gene families. These take the form of graphs, mostly de Bruijn [<xref rid="pcbi.1009631.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1009631.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], but may also be created from overlap consensus approaches [<xref rid="pcbi.1009631.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1009631.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. In the de Bruijn based approach millions of fragments of specified length, termed kmers, are extracted from reads and used as nodes. Edges are placed where kmers match with the exception of one over-hanging nucleotide. The sought after outcome is a one-to-one relationship between gene families and graphs created [<xref rid="pcbi.1009631.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Despite kmer efficiency at representing sequence data [<xref rid="pcbi.1009631.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>–<xref rid="pcbi.1009631.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>], the graphs ability to represent complete biological complexity has not been fully determined [<xref rid="pcbi.1009631.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1009631.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>], but to date, the approach is state-of-the-art in dealing with the vast quantities of short-read RNA-Seq data produced. Complexity and size of the transcriptome [<xref rid="pcbi.1009631.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>], read coverage [<xref rid="pcbi.1009631.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>], gene expression levels [<xref rid="pcbi.1009631.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>] and sequencing error [<xref rid="pcbi.1009631.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>] are some of the factors that influence the number and nature of the graphs produced. It is the complexity of individual graphs, as represented by the number of possible start and end nodes, along with the number of internal junctions and cycles, that determine the extent of path choice during contig construction. Based on this we have developed a short-read RNA-Seq <italic toggle="yes">de novo</italic> assembler, CStone, that labels each contig created in accordance to one of three levels of complexity reflecting the nature of the graph from which it was derived: (i) a single start node and a single end node along with no internal junctions, (ii) a single start node and multiple end nodes along with internal junctions but no cycles, and (iii) a single, or multiple, start node(s) and a single, or multiple, end node(s) with or without internal cycles, i.e. everything else. Our classifications are no more than a description of the pre-existing structure of the de Bruijn based graphs. Paths from the first two cannot be chimeric, the first being a graph possessing a single path, while the second being one where each path has a unique end point and no alternative routes. For graphs of the third type, CStone, similar to other graph-based assemblers, uses the metric of read coverage to aid in path selection, but this does not guarantee complete non-chimerism, although high-quality representations of underlying transcripts are achieved.</p>
    <p>Reference contigs labelled in this manner encourage dependent results to be presented with increased objectivity by maintaining the context of complexity, and ambiguity, present during construction. For example, the identification of a differentially expressed gene associated with a level (iii<italic toggle="yes">)</italic> contig can be considered more speculatively, whilst for a level (i) contig, more certainty can be assumed. Our approach is not solving the problem of <italic toggle="yes">de novo</italic> assembled chimeras, but it is improving the interface between assembly software and result interpretation. Additionally, the approach, or similar ones, is readily implementable within any graph-based assembler. As a demonstration of CStones ability to assemble data we compare contigs produced by CStone to those produced by two well-established assemblers, Trinity [<xref rid="pcbi.1009631.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], and rnaSPAdes [<xref rid="pcbi.1009631.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], using both simulated data from four species, <italic toggle="yes">Drosophila melanogaster</italic> (fruit fly), <italic toggle="yes">Panthera pardus</italic> (leopard), <italic toggle="yes">Rattus norvegicus</italic> (brown rat) and <italic toggle="yes">Serinus canaria</italic> (canary), as well as real data obtained from a study on alternative splicing in <italic toggle="yes">D</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">melanogaster</italic> [<xref rid="pcbi.1009631.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. Our results indicate that all three assemblers perform well, and that the increased information that CStone adds on chimerism can be of value. Finally, to further highlight the poorly quantified issue of chimeric contigs, we demonstrate the effects of chimeric content within reference sets on the detection of differentially expressed genes using DESeq2 [<xref rid="pcbi.1009631.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]; thus further highlighting the need for current assemblers to incorporate information on graph complexity into their outputs.</p>

        <p>Kmers of length 40 nt, along with frequency of occurrence, are extracted from reads and stored in descending order, Those of low complexity, where a single nucleotide type makes up more than 80%, are removed. Each remaining kmer is placed into a node data structure. Nodes whose kmers overlap by 39 identical nucleotides are merged into a composite node, the kmer of higher frequency being maintained. A default kmer length of 40 nt was chosen to minimize kmers being identical by chance, <xref rid="pcbi.1009631.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig</xref>, and because 40 falls between the default kmer lengths of the already established graph based assemblers that we tested CStone against. This value can be altered by using the–k parameter. Edges are placed between nodes were kmers are identical with the exception of up to 5 overhanging nucleotides. Unconnected graphs, i.e. groups of connected nodes, are then extracted and stored (<xref rid="pcbi.1009631.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Fig</xref>).</p>
        <p>For each graph, local cycles between adjacent nodes are removed, while non-localized paths between junctions are maintained. This is done by merging pairs of siblings that have a valid connecting edge between them. During the merge process, all incoming and outgoing edges, as well as the kmer of higher frequency, are maintained. Edge validity is checked because as merges proceed some edges may begin to reflect distances that were larger than the initial edge connecting criteria. Following refinement, for a given graph (<xref rid="pcbi.1009631.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>), all nodes with a single connecting edge, i.e. those on the periphery, belong to set E; these either initiate or terminate paths. Nodes with more than two connecting edges, i.e. junctions, belong to set J. All other nodes belong to set I. The sum of the contents of E, J and I is equal to the total number of nodes on the network.</p>

        <p>For each graph, in order to orientate paths, the node from set I with the highest kmer frequency, and no circumventing paths is selected. Two sets, E1 and E2, are then populated with nodes that represent the starts and ends of potential paths. To achieve this, nodes within set I are sorted in descending order of kmer frequency. This ensures that nodes on the top of the list are those through which the highest numbers, or the most expressed, transcripts pass; kmer frequency being derived from read coverage that reflects both expression and regions of shared identity between transcripts. Starting at the top, nodes are selected in turn (<xref rid="pcbi.1009631.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>, step i) and temporarily removed from the graph (<xref rid="pcbi.1009631.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>, step ii), along with all connecting edges. If two unconnected sub-graphs do not result, i.e. paths exist around the removed node, then the node, along with all its previous connecting edges, are placed back into the graph and the next node in the list is tested (<xref rid="pcbi.1009631.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>, step iii). If two unconnected sub-graphs do result, all external nodes from one of these are placed into one set, and those of the other into a second (<xref rid="pcbi.1009631.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>, step iv). The smaller of these is labelled E1 and the larger E2. If they are the same size the choice of E1 and E2 labels is arbitrary. The removed node, along with its previous edges, is then put back and it is considered the cornerstone node of the graph, <xref rid="pcbi.1009631.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>, step v. CStone got its title based on this node.</p>

        <p>Using paths that start in E1, end in E2, and that traverse the cornerstone node, we have defined three levels of classification, one of which will be associated with each graph: (i) no internal cycles, sets E1 and E2 each contain one node, resulting in a single non-chimeric path between E1 and E2 (<xref rid="pcbi.1009631.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A</xref>), (ii) no internal cycles, set E1 contains one node, set E2 contains two or more nodes, resulting in a number of distinct paths equal to that of the number of nodes within E2, each of which is non-chimeric as no alternatives routes exist (<xref rid="pcbi.1009631.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3B</xref>) and (iii) all other cases, i.e. set E1 contains one or more nodes, set E2 contains one or more nodes and the graph may or may not contain internal cycles (<xref rid="pcbi.1009631.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3C</xref>). Cycles are identified within graphs by tracing all paths starting at E1 and identifying whether or not they can eventually double back on themselves. Contigs are created in a manner that depends on the associated classification level. For level (i), a reconstruction of the kmers contained within each connected node on the single path is outputted as the contig. For levels (ii) and (iii), the first ten paths from each E1 starting node, level (ii) only having one node within E1, are sorted by mean read coverage and the top three are used to construct contigs in a similar manner to that done for level (i). The default value of three can be altered to a maximum value of five. All contigs produced are titled with a unique integer id as well as the graph classification level from which they were created. The latter is selected from LVL_1_NO_CYCLES_ONE_TO_ONE, LVL_2_NO_CYCLES_ONE_TO_MANY or LVL_3_COMPLEX.</p>

            <p>Panels A to C display examples of graphs identified with classification levels 1 to 3 in order. The largest node indicates the cornerstone node whilst the number inside this indicates the number of possible paths passing through. In panel C one path (inset), of the possible 12, is shown. In the absence of read coverage information, as in this example, the path is most likely chimeric as it turns away from the nearest exit node and follows a more winding route. However, within real graphs coverage information could provide a justification for such a route. Panels D and (e) highlight two additional examples of graphs within classification level (iii). For the latter the four paths traversing the graph containing two cycles in sequence are shown, only two of which are required to reconstruct the original graph (paths 1 and 3) or (paths 2 and 4), leaving two possible chimeric ones.</p>

        <p>Specifying the number of contigs per graph is necessary as it is not feasible to output all “possibly viable” paths from every graph. For some graphs there could be tens to hundreds of paths. We opted for outputting the top three best paths (by default), based on maximized coverage, in order to provide a reliable representation of gene families; in a way that could provide insight to contig non-chimerism. This strategy covers areas of analysis where obtaining reference sequences maintaining exact evolutionary relationships between sites is important, for example, when looking at co-evolving sites, geno-to-pheno altering polymorphisms or recombinant-breakpoints. It also applies to differential experiments where the reliability of read counts at a gene family level out-weighs that of identifying ambiguous isoforms, many of which are artefacts of the short-read assembly graph traversal process. Limiting paths is less optimal if attempting to characterize all “true” isoforms from complex families; although given the advent of long-read sequencing technologies, the sole use of short-read data in conjunction with heuristic short-read <italic toggle="yes">de novo</italic> assemblers should be avoided. It should be noted here that the default top three paths per graph outputted by CStone are relative to each individual graph created. The manner in which graphs representing gene families are constructed is independent of read cover. As long as a gene family is represented by reads, a graph can be constructed. If on that graph there are many paths, it is the top thee, based on coverage, that are used. Importantly, this means that gene families associated with low expression will still be represented within the output.</p>

For each ≈10 million read pairs, of length 200 nt, insert size 300 nt and containing no read error, were generated from transcripts that ranged in length from 300 to 5000 nt using CSReadGen [<xref rid="pcbi.1009631.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. These datasets are available on the open-access repository Zendo and are associated with the url <ext-link xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5589533" ext-link-type="uri">https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5589533</ext-link> [<xref rid="pcbi.1009631.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. The minor variation in final counts is due to reads being simulated in a manner that distributes them evenly over the reference transcripts, reflecting uniform coverage. Use of simulated data allows for the comparison of the assembled contigs to the sequences from which the reads were derived, while excluding the effects of unknown variation; including that of sequencing error and poor coverage. Additionally, with uniform coverage, for correctly assembled contigs the numbers of reads mapping back to them would be expected to correlate with length; reflecting that seen in <xref rid="pcbi.1009631.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Fig</xref>.</p>

        <p>For each species reads were assembled using CStone, Trinity (v2.12.0, kmer length of 25), and rnaSPAdes (v3.11.1, kmer length of 55). To assess assembly quality: (i) contig lengths were compared to cDNA reference transcripts. (ii) Bowtie2 [<xref rid="pcbi.1009631.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>] was used to map reads to each set of assembled contigs, after which read counts, obtained using the pileup.sh script of the bbmap package [<xref rid="pcbi.1009631.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>], were plotted against contig lengths. (iii) The megablast option [<xref rid="pcbi.1009631.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>], of the BLAST+ package [<xref rid="pcbi.1009631.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>], was used to identify how many of cDNA reference transcripts matched contigs produced by each assembler, as well as to assess the quality and the length of the matched regions. For each species-specific reference transcript the top 20 hits, within the contig file produced by each assembler, were examined. In each case, the matches producing the longest aligned regions were used to create plots of transcript length versus contig length, as well as contig length versus aligned region length. Plots were created using the R package [<xref rid="pcbi.1009631.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. A summary table of the percentage identities associated with the longest-match alignments, along with the number of unique reference transcripts finding a match, was also prepared. For CStone, species-specific bar charts were produced displaying the number of contigs generated from each of the three graph classification levels.</p>

For each set of contigs the median length falls within the interquartile range of the reference transcripts. CStone produces some contigs beyond the length of the longest reference used, indicating some overextension, but the numbers of these are relatively low. For fruit fly, leopard, rat and canary, the overall numbers of contigs produced by CStone fall between those of rnaSPAdes and Trinity, the latter producing the highest numbers. In <xref rid="pcbi.1009631.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> it is observed that for CStone contig numbers were 20939 (fruit fly), 29778 (leopard), 26703 (rat) and 21811 (canary). These were produced from 18520, 29465, 25550 and 21517 underlying graphs respectively (<xref rid="pcbi.1009631.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Fig</xref>). For Trinity the numbers of contigs created were 24947 (fruit fly), 33709 (leopard), 36327 (rat) and 29399 (canary), and were produced from 15136, 22181, 24077 and 16678 underlying graphs, as derived from the output contig files. These numbers indicate that CStone, although creating fewer contigs relative to Trinity, does not represent fewer networks, where networks are striving to have a one-to-one representation of gene families.</p>

        <p>When the reads from each species are mapped against contigs, and the length of contig versus read count plotted, <xref rid="pcbi.1009631.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref>, CStone achieves comparable R<sup>2</sup> values to those of both Trinity and rnaSPAdes. For the Trinity assemblies of fruit fly and canary it is likely that a few contigs are lowering the R<sup>2</sup> value, for example, for fruit fly there is a single contig of length 4895 nt with 30,481 reads mapping to it that, when removed, increases the R<sup>2</sup> value from 0.5829 to 0.5944. In all cases, including that of the latter, there is a significant correlation, with all p-values below 2.2e-16, suggesting that the contig read counts are reflecting the nature in which the reads were simulated (<xref rid="pcbi.1009631.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Fig</xref>).</p>

        <p>For CStone the numbers of contigs associated with each of the three graph classification levels are displayed in <xref rid="pcbi.1009631.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6</xref>. Across the four species, for these datasets, an average of 58% and 11% of contigs come from graphs categorized as levels (i) and (ii). These are graphs that have structures that do not produce chimeric paths. Even when a contig from such graphs may not be complete, for example due to poor coverage, the proportion constructed is non-chimeric. To date, contigs produced by such graphs have been treated in an identical manner to those produced from the more ambiguous graphs classified as level (iii). CStone allows the user to make this distinction and discuss results related to such contigs in the context of the underlying graph complexity.</p>

        <p>For each set of contigs, when the lengths of the reference transcripts are compared to the lengths of the best matching contigs, based on the longest aligned region as identified using megablast, <xref rid="pcbi.1009631.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7</xref>, a linear relationship is observed in all cases (p-values below 2.2e-16), indicating that reference transcript lengths are being reflected by the assembled contigs. For each contig, when the length of the aligned regions are compared to the contig length, (<xref rid="pcbi.1009631.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig 8</xref>), a significant correlation is also present in all cases (p-values below 2.2e-16), confirming that the contigs are generally aligning over the majority of their lengths to the references to which they matched. The percent identities achieved within the aligned regions along with the number of different references being aligned to, are summarized in <xref rid="pcbi.1009631.t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref> and <xref rid="pcbi.1009631.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4 Fig</xref>, and in both cases all values are high. Note: within <xref rid="pcbi.1009631.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4 Fig</xref> although the range of identity values for CStone is generally wider, the means achieved for the four species are 99.80%, 99.25, 98.65 and 99.58%, and the four medians are 100%.

        <p>The numbers of cDNA reference transcripts uniquely matching contigs produced by a single assembler, and those that match contigs produced by each of the different assemblers are presented in <xref rid="pcbi.1009631.g009" ref-type="fig">Fig 9</xref>. The majority of cDNA reference transcripts are represented by contigs produced by all three assemblers, indicating good agreement in overall transcriptome representation following assembly. Combined these results suggest that the contigs produced by the established assemblers Trinity and rnaSPAdes are of reasonable quality, and importantly, that those produced by CStone are of sufficient quality for demonstrating our approach to the inclusion of a graph-based metric indicating the extent of non-chimeric contig formation.</p>

The mean contig lengths of rnaSPAdes and Trinity are higher, but the CStone median contig lengths fall between both the latter. For Trinity and rnaSPAdes the means are strongly influenced by the large number of transcripts above 5000 nt in length. Given that the lengths of transcribed genes are largely expected to be within the range of 300 to 5000 nt [<xref rid="pcbi.1009631.ref072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>], such an increase in means, relative to the medians is more likely to be an indication of contig overextension rather than contig correctness.</p>

        <p>The large portion of cDNA reference transcripts that matched contigs, <xref rid="pcbi.1009631.t006" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref>, allowed for quantification of contig quality in terms of the length of matching regions versus over all contig length, <xref rid="pcbi.1009631.g011" ref-type="fig">Fig 11</xref> and <xref rid="pcbi.1009631.t006" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref>. CStone achieved notably strong correlations indicating assembly success, but the number of cDNA reference transcripts matched are on average 13% lower. This is likely due to the absence of overly large contigs above 5000 nt in length; where internal regions match many different reference transcripts. The largest contigs produced by CStone for whole-adult 1 and whole-adult 2 were 7,483 and 6,492 nt, while for Trinity and rnaSPAdes these numbers were 20,628 and 26,446 nt as well as 19,131 and 20,865 nt. CStone produced 19 such contigs for whole-adult 1 and 29 for whole-adult 2, while for Trinity the numbers were 3,666 and 7,742 and for rnaSPAdes they were 1,543 and 1,471.</p>

        <p>To investigate what proportion of contigs greater than 5000 nt in length were due to viral contamination, all viral reference genomes (≈10,000) from NCBI were downloaded (<ext-link xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/virus/" ext-link-type="uri">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/virus/</ext-link>). For whole-adult 1, out of the 1,543 and 3,666 contigs from rnaSPAdes and Trinity, a single match to a Nora virus genome, identified using megablast, was observed (<xref rid="pcbi.1009631.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Table</xref>). Out of the 19 contigs from CStone no match occurred. For contigs below, or equal to, 5000 nt in length, each assembler produced just three matches, where the length of the matching region was above 200 nt. For CStone two of these being to the Nora virus previously identified. These results indicate that for whole-adult 1 contamination by virus genomes was minimum. For whole-adult 2 a similar outcome was seen (<xref rid="pcbi.1009631.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Table</xref>).</p>
        <p>For contigs greater than 5000 nt in length, the proportion of aligned regions, relative to contig length, are lower and have an increased range (<xref rid="pcbi.1009631.g012" ref-type="fig">Fig 12</xref>). This is likely due to contigs being overly extended relative to their best cDNA reference transcript match and/or having internal regions that do not align. Importantly for all assemblers, contigs below or equal to 5000 nt in length, produced far higher portions of aligned regions indicating completeness relative to matching cDNA references; those from CStone possessing the narrowest range of high values.</p>

      <title>(3) Effects of chimerism on differential expression</title>
      <p>As the level of chimerism is increased within the reference set used, whilst the ten read datasets remain constant, the number of differentially expressed transcripts identified between conditions A and B varies (<xref rid="pcbi.1009631.g014" ref-type="fig">Fig 14</xref>); demonstrating that chimera presence is having an effect on their identification. Within the first Venn diagram, following just a 5% increase in chimeras relative to the non-chimeric reference set, there are 216 transcripts no longer detected as being differentially expressed (light grey), whilst there are 225 transcripts that are differentially expressed but that were not previously (dark grey). This trend continues up to the Venn diagram that compares the list of differentially expressed genes obtained using the 50% chimeric reference set. In this case there were many overly expressed transcripts due to the way in which background variation, and over expression, was applied. In non-simulated cases, where there is potential for few, to hundreds, of <italic toggle="yes">de novo</italic> assembled contigs being differentially expressed, it is important to be aware of the possibility of chimerism within each contig for two reasons. Firstly, individual chimeric contigs called as being differentially expressed are less than reliable having had their read counts altered erroneously during mapping and secondly, the presence of chimerism within the reference dataset as a whole has consequences for the count distributions used when calling differentially expressed contigs [<xref rid="pcbi.1009631.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>], whether those individual contigs are chimeric or not.</p>

    <title>Conclusion</title>
    <p>CStone produces contigs of comparable quality to the two well-established assemblers that it was tested against. More importantly, it adds additional information to the output in relation to chimerism that: (i) can benefit the user, and research community as a whole, during the presentation and discussion of results, by maintaining the context of the ambiguities associated with chimerism when relevant and, (ii) is adaptable to the output of any <italic toggle="yes">de novo</italic> assembly tool implementing a graph-based approach. Additionally, we have demonstrated that the existence of chimeras within reference sets used for differential expression experiments has an effect on the detection of differentially expressed genes, thus highlighting the need to develop bioinformatics tools that aid in the quantification of such chimeras during <italic toggle="yes">de novo</italic> assembly.</p>

    <title>Future directions</title>
    <p>Areas of ongoing work include: (i) the incorporating of specialized data transformation and compression algorithms [<xref rid="pcbi.1009631.ref073" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>] into CStone in order to decrease assembly times and memory requirements. (ii) The sub-division of the level three graph classification category in order to associate each contig derived from such graphs with a likelihood score describing the extent of chimerism; such a score being dependent on the number of starting and end nodes as well as the number and types of cycles present and (iii) on going maintenance and development of the tool to further enhance the quality of contigs produced based on user feedback.

        <title>Unique kmer counts (y-axis) of specified length (x-axis) extracted from simulated reads.</title>
        <p>Reads were simulated from the four species (indicated on right) as described under the “Demonstration” heading of the Design and Implementation section of the manuscript. Above kmer size of 18 little difference is observed in the number of unique kmers extracted. Kmer sizes from 1 to 18 show a marked increase as kmer frequency as size is incremented in steps of 1. This indicates that for these small kmers, shared kmers by chance (or kmer collisions) between different gene families and gene regions are more likely. For example, for kmer sizes of 4 there are only 256 unique permutations to describe the entire read dataset. Assemblies using kmers of this size would produce spurious sets of contigs that are highly chimeric. The three assemblers used in this study were Trinity, CStone and rnaSPAdes and have default kmer sizes of 25, 40 and 55 respectively, as indicated with the dashed vertical lines.</p>

    <p>Reviewer #1: Linheiro and John Archer presented a computational approach to de novo transcriptome assembly with an emphasis on identifying chimeric contigs. The concept is important for the field and the paper was written clearly. CStone seems to be easily implemented across operating systems, and can also be incorporated into existing tools. But the concept needs to be developed further to warrant publication in PLoS Computational Biology.</p>
    <p>The primary concern with this tool is that ~30% of all contigs assembled were identified as 'chimeric,' which are claimed to affect downstream analysis such as differential gene expression. If this is indeed true and accurate, it would have large ramification for the entire field. If the authors could test out this concept further, how do these chimeric contigs affect differential expression, what's the scope of this issue, how can the identification of the chimeric contigs improve DE analysis, etc., it would help the reviewers to more accurately assess this approach and the conclusion that this tool can 'greatly benefit the user.'</p>
    <p>Another issue that needs to be addressed is that especially when using real data, contigs generated by CStone have a wider spread towards shorter contigs, compared with Trinity and SPADES (Figure S4). Also, the contigs generated by CStone seem to have lower percent identity overall (Table 6). Could these factors increase the possibility of identifying chimeric contigs, which could be potential not chimeric? This would further cast doubt on the capability of CStone to improve downstream analysis.</p>
    <p>Minor comments:</p>
    <p>Adding line numbers will help the reviewers to navigate the manuscript much more easily.</p>
    <p>This might be writing preference, but it would help to sometimes add a comma to aid the reading of the sentences. For example, at the beginning of the third paragraph in Design and Implementation, "For each graph, local cycles ..." would seem more readable. And there are many examples throughout the manuscript. Even if not at all places, some commas would still aid the reading of the sentences, which might otherwise be confusing.</p>
    <p>Second paragraph of the Introduction, approach's -&gt; approaches, effects -&gt; affects</p>
    <p>Reviewer #2: De novo transcriptome assembly of short RNA-Seq reads is still a challenging problem although tackled but not fully solved by various methods and tools over the last decade. One particular problem lies in the reconstruction of chimeric contigs representing falsely assembled transcripts. This can happen because reads are first reduced to shorter kmers of specific lengths and put into a graph structure that is then traversed to find connected paths finally representing contigs and thus transcripts. However, junctions in the graph structure can result in chimeric contigs that mix up different transcript sequences that biologically dont belong together.</p>
    <p>Here, Raquel Linheiro and John Archer present CStone, a basic de novo assembly tool that utilizes kmers and a de Brujin-like graph structure to not only assemble contigs but to further classify them according to their chimeric potential. Thus, each contig gets categorized based on its original representation in the graph, helping to decide if the contig might be chimeric and thus needs further investigation or should be considered carefully in downstream analyses.</p>
    <p>CStone, written in Java, is compared against two other state-of-the-art assemblers on simulated and real RNA-Seq data and shows similar performance but, more importantly, adds the functionality to evaluate the chimeric level of resulting contigs. I think that the presented method to categorize contigs according to their chimeric potential is an interesting and important feature that could be added also to other transcriptome (and genome?) assembly tools to further guide researchers on their way of interpreting assembled contig data.</p>
    <p>The code together with example data and a manual is publicly available on Sourceforge and I was able to execute the tool on a MacBook Air.</p>
    <p>Below, I have some comments and suggestions. The Figures are generally nice and help to understand the approach, however, the manuscript could need some English language editing to be more precise and clear.</p>
    <p>[1] Title</p>
    <p>… a de novo [transcriptome] assembler … ?</p>
    <p>In general, you could be more precise about the transcriptomic field your tool is developed for. Also, your paper is about RNA-Seq data and transcriptome de novo assembly and not DNA and genome assembly. While one could assume that based on the abstract and introduction, that might be not always clear to the reader. E.g. consider changing sentences like “A crucial part of the de novo assembly process...” into “A crucial part of the transcriptome de novo assembly process...”</p>
    <p>Actually, from your sourceforge page this is a good sentence to introduce the tool and its scope that I miss in the abstract/paper: “CStone is a [de novo] short-read assembler for RNA-Seq transcriptomic data based on a de Bruijn like approach.”</p>
    <p>Besides, do you think that your tool can also detect and classify chimeric contigs from a DNA assembly graph? Maybe as an future extension?</p>
    <p>[2] Language</p>
    <p>Please check language carefully, there are several minor things such as</p>
    <p>high quality → high-quality</p>
    <p>whole body → whole-body</p>
    <p>etc..</p>
    <p>Please pay attention to commas.</p>
    <p>“Over extension of contigs, a form of chimera, has also been shown to have a negative impact on differential expression studies”</p>
    <p>suggestion →</p>
    <p>“Overexpansion/Overextension of contigs, a form of chimera, has also been shown to negatively impact differential expression studies.”</p>
    <p>I have the feeling that in general writing “overextension” as one word might be better - but I’m not a native speaker.</p>
    <p>“ is the arrangement information present”</p>
    <p>→ do you mean</p>
    <p>“ is the arrangement of information present”</p>
    <p>“state-of-the art” → “state-of-the-art”</p>
    <p>“For graphs of the third type, CStone similarly to other graph based assemblers, uses the metric of read coverage to aid in path choice, but this does not guarantee complete nonchimerism, although high quality representations of underlying transcripts are achieved.”</p>
    <p>→ suggestion (and as an example, I think your paper could benefit from some general language editing)</p>
    <p>“For graphs of the third type, CStone, similar to other graph-based assemblers, uses the metric of read coverage to support path selection, but this does not guarantee complete chimera freedom, although high-quality representations of the underlying transcripts are achieved.”</p>
    <p>“For each graph local cycles between close neighbouring nodes are removed whilst maintaining non-localized paths between junctions”</p>
    <p>→</p>
    <p>“For each graph, local cycles between adjacent nodes are removed, while non-localized paths between junctions (intersections?) are retained.”</p>
    <p>“During merger...” ? During the merge process? What does “merger” mean? Please check the paragraph.</p>
    <p>“ For a given graph following refinement, figure 1, on any partial path, before, after or between neighbouring junction nodes, with the exception of external nodes, each node will have two outgoing edges that link to its nearest neighbours, one parent (incoming) and one descendent (outgoing), depending on the direction of traversal.”</p>
    <p>→ a complicated sentence, hard to follow. But your Figures are really nice and much easier to understand than the text description. Suggestion: reference your figures more often explaining the graph structure and classification process.</p>
    <p>“ thus talking a small step” → “ thus taking a small step”</p>
    <p>“ established assemblers coul​​d incorporated” → “ established assemblers can incorporate”</p>
    <p>“CStone derived its title after this node.” → “CStone got its title based on this node.”</p>
    <p>Figure 2 caption: please check the caption, the sentence is hard to follow/unclear language.</p>
    <p>“Trimomatic” → “Trimmomatic”</p>
    <p>“above 5000 in length” → “above 5000 nt in length”, in general add values</p>
    <p>[3] Be more precise about DNA or RNA.</p>
    <p>For example from the abstract: “For real data two datasets, each consisting of ≈30 million read pairs, representing two adult D. melanogaster whole body samples were used.” I guess you mean “whole-body transcriptome samples”?</p>
    <p>[4]</p>
    <p>“Where no reference exists reads can be assembled de novo to create one. “</p>
    <p>This is not precise. When no genome reference exists you can also not use RNA-Seq reads to assemble one de novo. Or you mean “Where no transcriptome reference exists, ...” Or maybe better rephrase:</p>
    <p>“Where no genome reference exists, RNA-Seq reads can be still assembled de novo to create transcripts. For this specific task, many assemblers are available including ...”</p>
    <p>[5]</p>
    <p>“In addition, hybrid approaches that rely on the existence of a reference genome ...”</p>
    <p>I think “hybrid approach” is not a good term here because it’s mainly understood in the community when you combine short- and long-read data for assembly. Also, better than citing TopHat2 (or mapping tools in general) here you could mention tools such as Stringtie2 that actually perform reference-based transcript assembly.</p>
    <p>[6] short vs long-read transcriptome assembly and impact on chimeric contigs</p>
    <p>In the whole manuscript, you never mention that CStone was developed (I assume) for the assembly of short-read RNA-Seq data. I think that’s important having long-read technologies on the rise that might solve such chimeric problems due to short kmers quite easily (“no assembly required”). Of course, your method is still important because of the vast amount of short-read RNA-Seq data out there. Nevertheless, mentioning the impact of longer reads potentially representing full transcript isoforms could be mentioned as well.</p>
    <p>[7] kmer length</p>
    <p>You are using a fixed kmer size of 40 for CStone. Is it possible to use other kmer sizes? Did you test other sizes? Edit: I just read at Sourceforge that you actually can adjust the kmer size, so you could mention that briefly in the manuscript as well.</p>
    <p>[8] Figure 3</p>
    <p>“In panel (c) one path (most likely chimeric), of the possible 12, is shown (inset).”</p>
    <p>On what is your assumption based that this path likely results in a chimeric contig? Because the number of possible paths traversing the cornerstone node is high?</p>
    <p>[9] Reconstruction of lowly expressed transcripts</p>
    <p>“For levels 2 and 3 the first 10 paths from each E1 starting node, level 2 only having one node within E1, are sorted by mean read coverage and the top three are used to construct contigs in a similar manner to that done for level 1.”</p>
    <p>→ Does this mean that your approach might miss transcripts that are lowly expressed? E.g. a specific transcript isoform that is just rare and thus lower expressed as others?</p>
    <p>[10]</p>
    <p>“Reads were assembled using CStone, Trinity, and rnaSPAdes”</p>
    <p>Parameters and version numbers for Trinity and rnaSPAdes are missing.</p>
    <p>[11]</p>
    <p>Windows and Ubuntu specs: I think it’s enough to have the detailed specifications written once (either in the text or Table 2 caption).</p>
    <p>[12]</p>
    <p>Can you somehow distinguish a) chimeric contigs due to mis-assembly and b) chimeric contigs that are actually derived from alternative splicing? For example, roughly one-third of your contigs from simulated data fall into category 3 that indicates chimeric contigs (Figure 6). Thus, if I get this information now from CStone I can still not tell if these are “real” transcripts or assembly artifacts, or? Or is the goal mainly to distinguish contigs that are clearly non-chimeric (categories 1 and 2)?</p>
    <p>[13]</p>
    <p>“while for Trinity and rnaSPAdes these numbers were 20,628 and 26,446 as well as 19,131 and 20,865 respectively, table 5”</p>
    <p>→ Did you check these exceptionally long contigs for the real data set? Can they be annotated or are they even representing some contamination (virus, ...)?</p>
    <p>[14]</p>
    <p>“​​Additionally, CStone is small in size with minimum code and no dependencies, simplifying modification and incorporation into other bioinformatics tools, packages and pipelines”</p>
    <p>→ I generally agree but I think CStone written in Java might not be able to be integrated that easily into existing tools that are mainly Python-based? At least, while Java developers will be happy about that others might not :) However, the method idea itself can surely be re-written as an extension for existing and well-established assembly tools. By saying that, I’m afraid that sourceforge might not be the best code base for the idea of presenting code that should be re-used and integrated/adjusted. Most developers are used to GitHub or GitLab where you can also easily write and open issues along with referencing the code and sending merge requests or forking the whole project. Actually, that would really allow re-using your codebase. I’m not so experienced with sourceforge but for me, it seems like the platform is not so developer-friendly. Thus, you might want to consider moving your code to Git{Hub,Lab}? Don’t get me wrong, you already did a great job in documenting your code and writing manuals but I have the feeling your work could benefit from such a transition.</p>
    <p>[15]</p>
    <p>Sourceforge manual: “Each time the software is run, this directory will be deleated and recreated, so it is best to copy it somewhere else (or rename it) between usages. This was done to protect the user from accidentally deleting directories.”</p>
    <p>→ I dont agree that this is good behavior. It would be better if the output directory gets a timestamp or unique name assigned or the user is warned if the output directory already exists instead of just deleting results the user might run hours or days for.</p>

    <p>Reviewer's Responses to Questions</p>
    <p>
      <bold>Comments to the Authors:</bold>
    </p>
    <p>
      <bold>Please note here if the review is uploaded as an attachment.</bold>
    </p>
    <p>Reviewer #1: The authors have addressed my comments and the revised manuscript is deemed adequate for publication.</p>
    <p>Reviewer #2: Dear authors,</p>
    <p>thank you very much for carefully answering my questions and especially for the additional analyses and effort you put into the manuscript. I think the manuscript significantly improved from the first version, not at least due to the language editing and the more precise wording (RNA-Seq, ...). Good job!</p>
    <p>I'm also ok with your code living on SourceForge. However, the point that GitHub does not have enough space is not entirely valid for me. Someone that wants to use your code does anyway not expect to download 2GB of data from a repository. Thus, my preferred way would be to put code and light-weight content on a code repository and example data/large files on another resource such as Zenodo or OSF (Open Science Framework). Then, such data resources could be referenced from the code repository. However, I also agree that this is a matter of taste and you justified why you want to keep your code on SourceForge and I'm fine with that.</p>
    <p>Also, thanks for the detailed explanation regarding the application for DNA graphs. You're right and after your detailed explanation, I think it is good that you clearly focus on this chimeric problem in the context of short-read RNA-Seq data.</p>
    <p>Regarding</p>
    <p>[9] Reconstruction of lowly expressed transcript</p>
    <p>Thanks for the explanation, this makes it more clear. I also better understand now why you are limiting the number of contigs derived from the graph and thus focusing on the paths with higher coverage as a priority. However, this still implies that low-coverage transcripts might be just missed by your approach, or? Did you look into that? E.g. in your simulated data did you also had low-coverage contigs and how do rnaSPAdes, Trinity, and CStone perform then? I dont want to produce too much extra work here that might be out of the main scope of the paper, especially bc/ you nicely wrap the topic up via:</p>
    <p>"Here we are effectively saying that we are not solving thegeneral short-read assembler problem, but ratherwe arehighlighting it and attempting to give the user some intuitive access to the contigs in the context of theproblem;while at the same timeoutputting what we believe are the most reliable contigs from each family present."</p>
    <p>in your p2p letter. Thus, I'm also fine with a discussion of this topic and making the reader/user aware of this, if further needed.</p>
    <p>Besides, this very long and encapsulated paragraph you newly proposed could be simplified bc/ it is hard to follow:</p>
    <p>"This covers many bioinformatic needs, including: (i) that of obtaining reliable references from gene families,where information on chimerism is relevant, such as when looking at co-evolvingsites, geno-to-pheno alteringpolymorphisms or recombinant breakpoint and (ii) many differential expression experiments where the advantage of having information on the reliability of read counts, see method S1 from subsection (3), out-weighs that of obtaining large lists of differentially expressed transcripts based on annotating and mapping to potentially hundreds of thousands of poorly supported contigs."</p>
    <p>Also, I think:</p>
    <p>" ... or recombinant breakpoint[s]..."</p>
    <p>and</p>
    <p>"... long-read sequencing " (missing the dash)</p>
    <p>also</p>
    <p>"... short-read data would be a poor choice for this" --&gt; maybe better "... which are anyway difficult to fully reconstruct from short reads alone" (or something like that)</p>
    <p>Thank you very much for all the work</p>

    <p>Dear Dr Archer,</p>
    <p>We are pleased to inform you that your manuscript 'CStone: A de novo transcriptome assembler for short-read data that identifies non-chimeric contigs based on underlying graph structure.' has been provisionally accepted for publication in PLOS Computational Biology.</p>
    <p>Before your manuscript can be formally accepted you will need to complete some formatting changes, which you will receive in a follow up email. A member of our team will be in touch with a set of requests.</p>
    <p>Please note that your manuscript will not be scheduled for publication until you have made the required changes, so a swift response is appreciated.</p>
    <p>IMPORTANT: The editorial review process is now complete. PLOS will only permit corrections to spelling, formatting or significant scientific errors from this point onwards. Requests for major changes, or any which affect the scientific understanding of your work, will cause delays to the publication date of your manuscript.</p>
    <p>Should you, your institution's press office or the journal office choose to press release your paper, you will automatically be opted out of early publication. We ask that you notify us now if you or your institution is planning to press release the article. All press must be co-ordinated with PLOS.</p>
