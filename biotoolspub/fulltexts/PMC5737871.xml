      <title>Abstract</title>
      <p>The increasing number of metagenomic and genomic sequences has dramatically improved our understanding of microbial diversity, yet our ability to infer metabolic capabilities in such datasets remains challenging. We describe the Multigenomic Entropy Based Score pipeline (MEBS), a software platform designed to evaluate, compare, and infer complex metabolic pathways in large “omic” datasets, including entire biogeochemical cycles. MEBS is open source and available through <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/eead-csic-compbio/metagenome_Pfam_score">https://github.com/eead-csic-compbio/metagenome_Pfam_score</ext-link>. To demonstrate its use, we modeled the sulfur cycle by exhaustively curating the molecular and ecological elements involved (compounds, genes, metabolic pathways, and microbial taxa). This information was reduced to a collection of 112 characteristic Pfam protein domains and a list of complete-sequenced sulfur genomes. Using the mathematical framework of relative entropy (<italic>H<sup>΄</sup></italic>), we quantitatively measured the enrichment of these domains among sulfur genomes. The entropy of each domain was used both to build up a final score that indicates whether a (meta)genomic sample contains the metabolic machinery of interest and to propose marker domains in metagenomic sequences such as DsrC (PF04358). MEBS was benchmarked with a dataset of 2107 non-redundant microbial genomes from RefSeq and 935 metagenomes from MG-RAST. Its performance, reproducibility, and robustness were evaluated using several approaches, including random sampling, linear regression models, receiver operator characteristic plots, and the area under the curve metric (AUC). Our results support the broad applicability of this algorithm to accurately classify (AUC = 0.985) hard-to-culture genomes (e.g., <italic>Candidatus Desulforudis audaxviator</italic>), previously characterized ones, and metagenomic environments such as hydrothermal vents, or deep-sea sediment. Our benchmark indicates that an entropy-based score can capture the metabolic machinery of interest and can be used to efficiently classify large genomic and metagenomic datasets, including uncultivated/unexplored taxa.</p>

    <title>Background</title>
    <p>Over the last 15 years, the enormous advances in high-throughput sequencing technologies have revolutionized the field of microbial ecology, dramatically improving our understanding of life's microbial diversity to an unprecedented level of detail [<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>–<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p>
    <p>Nowadays, accessing the total repertoire of genomes within complex communities by means of metagenomics is becoming a standard and routine procedure in order to attain the full insight of the diversity, ecology, evolution, and functional makeup of the microbial world [<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Furthermore, the accurate reconstruction of microbial genomes and draft-populations from environmental metagenomic studies has been shown to be a powerful approach [<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>–<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], providing clues about the potential metabolic strategies of hard-to-culture microbial lineages by linking the functional mechanisms that support specific metabolisms with taxonomic, systematic, and ecological contexts of that lineage [<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p>
    <p>Despite the accelerated accumulation of large collections of metagenomic and genomic sequences, our ability to analyze, evaluate, and compare complex metabolic capabilities in large-scale “omic” datasets remains biologically and computationally challenging [<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Predicting the metabolic potential is a key step in describing the relationship between a microbial community and its ecosystem function. This is largely performed by mapping the protein coding genes of “omic” data onto reference pathway databases such as MetaCyc [<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] or KEGG [<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] based on their homology to previously characterized genes [<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The currently available methods for metabolic pathway prediction or reconstruction rely on the use of several metrics to infer the overall repertoire of metabolic pathways present in a given metagenomic dataset (e.g., MinPath [<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], HUMAnN [<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], PRMT [<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], MetaPathways [<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]).</p>
    <p>However, due to the challenges involved in testing meaningful biological hypotheses with complex data, only a small proportion of the metabolic information derived from these datasets is eventually used to draw ecologically relevant conclusions. In this regard, most of the microbial ecology-derived “omic” studies have been mainly focused on either: (i) developing a broad description of the metabolic pathways within a certain environment [<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]; (ii) analyzing the relative abundance of marker genes involved in several metabolic processes and in certain ecosystems (e.g., primary productivity, decomposition, biogeochemical cycling) [<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>–<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]; or (iii) discovering differentially abundant, shared or unique functional units (genes, proteins, or metabolic pathways) across several environmental metagenomic samples [<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>–<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].</p>
    <p>Therefore, in order to integrate all available omics data, we propose a novel approach to reduce the complexity of targeted metabolic pathways involved in several integral ecosystem processes—such as entire biogeochemical cycles—into a single informative score, called the Multigenomic Entropy-Based Score (MEBS). This approach is based on the mathematical rationalization of Kullback-Leibler divergence, also known as relative entropy <italic>H<sup>΄</sup></italic> [<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Relative entropy has been widely applied in physics, communication theory, and statistical inference, and it is interpreted as a measure of disorder, information, and uncertainty, respectively [<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Here we use the communication theory concept of <italic>H<sup>΄</sup></italic> to summarize the information derived from the metabolic machinery encoded by the protein coding genes of “omic” datasets. The application of this metric in biology was originally developed by Stormo and colleagues, who identified binding sites that regulate gene transcription [<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].</p>
    <p>In order to evaluate the performance of our approach, we selected the sulfur cycle (from now on, S-cycle) because this is one of the most metabolically and ecologically complex biogeochemical cycles, but there are few studies analyzing the complete repertoire (genes, proteins, or metabolic pathways) involved in the mobilization of inorganic-organic sulfur compounds through microbial-catalyzed reactions at a planetary scale [<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>–<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].</p>

        <p>Schematic representation of the 4 stages of the MEBS algorithm focusing on the S-cycle. The first step consists of the systematic curation of a database containing the metabolic information of the S-cycle, which is reduced to a FASTA file of proteins involved (Sucy) and a list of 161 related microorganisms (Suli). A thousand lists of 161 random-sampled genomes were used as negative control (Rlist). The training dataset comprises 2107 genomes (Gen), which were fragmented in different sizes by considering the mean size length (MSL) of 935 metagenomes (Met). In the second stage, the domain composition of Sucy proteins is obtained by scanning Pfam-A, resulting in the Pfam-Sucy database. Then, the relative entropy (<italic>H<sup>΄</sup></italic>) of each Sucy-Pfam domain is obtained in the third stage. Finally, the precomputed entropies in Gen and GenF are used to evaluate full-length genomic sequences (real) and metagenomic sequences of variable MSL (in this example A, B, and C).</p>

      <title>Stage 1: manual curation of Sulfur cycle and “omic” datasets</title>
      <sec id="sec2-1-1">
        <title>Sulfur taxonomic representatives</title>
        <p>A dataset comprehensively covering the currently known representatives of the S-cycle was obtained from primary literature and the MetaCyc database [<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Each taxonomic representative (at the genus or species level) was selected under the criteria of having evidence suggesting their physiological and biochemical involvement in the degradation, reduction, oxidation, or disproportionation of sulfur compounds. Then, each taxonomic representative was scanned against our genomic dataset (see further details below) in order to obtain a list containing the completely sequenced and non-redundant genomes of the S-cycle. The resulting <underline>Su</underline>lfur <underline>li</underline>st (or “Suli”) currently contains 161 curated genomes and was used as the first input of the pipeline. Both the manually curated taxonomic representatives and Suli can be found in Table S1.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec2-1-2">
        <title>Random taxonomic representatives (Rlist)</title>
        <p>As a negative control, we generated 1000 lists of genomes that are not particularly enriched on sulfur metabolic preferences. Each list contains 161 random genomes, the same number of microorganisms included in Suli. These lists were obtained by randomly subtracting from the genomic dataset (see below) 161 Refseq accession numbers and their corresponding names.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec2-1-3">
        <title>Metabolic pathways and genes</title>
        <p>We gathered and classified the metabolic pathways involved in the S-cycle from the primary literature and 2 experimentally validated curated databases: KEGG (KEGG, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/RRID:SCR_012773">RRID:SCR_012773</ext-link>) [<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and MetaCyc (MetaCyc, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/RRID:SCR_007778">RRID:SCR_007778</ext-link>) [<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. All the molecular information was then combined into a single database named Sucy (for <underline>s</underline><underline>u</underline>lfur <underline>cy</underline>cle). Sucy currently contains 152 genes and 48 enzyme classification numbers annotated in the Enzyme classification [<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] (Table S2). The 152 FASTA sequences of the proteins encoded by these genes were downloaded from UniProt [<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] and used as the second input of the pipeline.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec2-1-4">
        <title>Genomic dataset (Gen)</title>
        <p>At the time of the analysis (December 21, 2016), a total of 4158 genomes were available from RefSeq database [<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. For comparative genomic purposes, we removed redundancy in this large dataset by using the Web interface [<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>, <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. As a phylogenomic distance measure, we used a modified version of the Genomic Similarity Score (GSSb) [<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]; we selected the most tolerant threshold of 0.95 (so as not to drop many sequenced genomes) and default parameters, resulting in 2107 clusters containing similar genomes, ordered by size (largest to smallest). Then, the largest genome representative for each group was searched in the NCBI genome assembly summary file [<xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] and downloaded from the NCBI FTP site [<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>].</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec2-1-5">
        <title>Metagenomic dataset (Met)</title>
        <p>We used the Meta Genome Rapid Annotation using Sub-system Technology server (MG-RAST, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/RRID:SCR_004814">RRID:SCR_004814</ext-link>) [<xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] to download metagenomes that: (i) were publicly available; (ii) contained associated metadata; and (iii) had been isolated from well-defined environments (i.e., rivers, soil, biofilms), discarding host-associated microbiome sequences (i.e., human, cow, chicken). In addition, we included 35 unpublished metagenomes derived from sediment, water, and microbial mats from Cuatro Ciénegas, Coahuila (CCC), Mexico. The latter were also submitted and annotated in the MG-RAST server and will be described in depth elsewhere. The resulting collection of 935 FASTA files (≈500 GB), containing gene-called protein sequences (MG-RAST stage 350), were downloaded from the RESTful MG-RAST API [<xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. While these metagenomes were evaluated and scored in STAGE 4, they were also analyzed to estimate their mean sequence length, considering that the fragmented nature of metagenomic sequences would have an impact on homology detection, depending on the length of the reads [<xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>, <xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Therefore, we measured the mean size length (MSL) of the peptide sequences of the 935 metagenomes in Met and the 152 curated proteins in Sucy, which are summarized in Fig. S1. It was observed that the MSL of Met varies broadly, with a majority of metagenomic peptides with MSL ≤ 30 aa, and that Sucy proteins range from 49 to 1020 aa, with MSL = 349 aa. According to this distribution, the metagenomes in Met were grouped into 7 well-defined categories: MSL ≤30, ≤60, ≤100, ≤150, ≤200, ≤250, ≤300 aa.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec2-1-6">
        <title>Fragmented genomic dataset (GenF)</title>
        <p>In order to simulate the observed variability of MSL across metagenomes, protein sequences encoded in the genomic dataset (Gen, containing 2107 genomes) were <italic>in silico</italic> sheared with Perl script <italic>get_protein_fragments.pl</italic> into the 7 MSL categories defined above (30 to 300). This produced the GenF dataset, which currently requires up to 104 GB of disk space.</p>

    </sec>
    <sec id="sec2-2">
      <title>Stage 2: domain composition of the input proteins</title>
      <p>The annotation of protein domains in Sucy was conducted using Interproscan 5.21–60.0 [<xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>] against databases Pfam-A v30 (Pfam, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/RRID:SCR_004726">RRID:SCR_004726</ext-link>) [<xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>], TIGRFAM v13 (JCVI TIGRFAMS, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/RRID:SCR_005493">RRID:SCR_005493</ext-link>) [<xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>], and Superfamily v1.75 (SUPERFAMILY, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/RRID:SCR_007952">RRID:SCR_007952</ext-link>) [<xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Then, the Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) from matched Pfam domains (n = 112) were extracted from Pfam-A using script <italic>extract_hmms.pl</italic>. These selected HMMs were subsequently scanned against the Genomic, Genomic Fragmented, and Metagenomic datasets (from now on, “omic” datasets, see subsequent stages) using HMMER 3.0, the <italic>hmmsearch</italic> –cut_ga option [<xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>].</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec2-3">
      <title>Stage 3: relative entropy and its use in detecting informative domains</title>
      <p>In order to detect protein domains enriched among sulfur-based microorganisms (Suli), we used a derivative of the Kullback-Leibler divergence [<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]—also known as relative entropy <italic>H<sup>΄</sup>(i)</italic>—to measure the difference between probabilities <italic>P</italic> and <italic>Q</italic> (see Equation (1) below). In this context, <italic>P(i)</italic> represents the frequency of protein domain <italic>i</italic> in the 161 Suli genomes (observed frequency), while <italic>Q(i)</italic> represents its frequency in the 2107 genomes in Gen (expected frequency). The script to compute the entropy (<italic>entropy.pl</italic>) requires the list of the genomes of interest (Suli) and the tabular output file obtained from the scanning of Gen and GenF against the Pfam-Sucy database. The obtained values of <italic>H<sup>΄</sup></italic> (in bits) capture to what extent a given Pfam domain informs about the metabolism of interest. In this case, domains with <italic>H<sup>΄</sup></italic> values close to or greater than 1 correspond to the most informative Pfam domains (enriched among S-based genomes),</p>
      <p>whereas low <italic>H<sup>΄</sup></italic> values (close to 0) indicate non-informative ones. Negative values correspond to those observed less than expected.</p>

      <p>As a negative control, the <italic>H<sup>΄</sup></italic> of the 112 Pfam domains were recalculated in both the Gen and GenF datasets, but replacing Suli with 1000 equally sized lists of random-sampled genomes (Rlist).</p>
      <p>We evaluated the impact of the MSL in the computed entropy values using Gen and GenF. First, we focused on detecting informative Pfam domains that could be used as possible molecular marker genes in variable-length metagenomic sequences. Specifically, we looked for domains displaying stable <italic>H<sup>΄</sup></italic> values across both Gen and GenF by using the script <italic>plot_cluster_comparison.py</italic>, which implements the following methods: K-Means, Affinity propagation, Mean-shift Spectral, Ward hierarchical, Agglomerative, DBSCAN, and Birch. All of these are part of the scikit-learn Machine Learning Python module [<xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>].</p>

      <title>Stage 4: final score, interpretation, properties, and benchmark</title>
      <p>Peptide sequences from a given genome or metagenome of interest are evaluated by first scanning their Pfam domains and then producing a final score, defined as the sum of the precomputed entropies of matched S-related Pfam domains (see Equation (2)). This score (Sulfur Score [<italic>SS</italic>] in our case) summarizes the information content of the metabolic machinery of interest. In this context, informative sulfur protein domains would contribute to higher <italic>SS</italic>, whereas non-informative ones would decrease it. This is an extension of procedures originally developed for the alignment of DNA and protein motifs, in which individual positions are independent and additive and can be simply summed up to obtain the total weight or information content [<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Instead of aligning sequences, in our context we added up the entropy values of the Pfam domains matched in a given “omic” sample (resulting from scanning the sample of interest against Pfam-Sucy), from which a total weight (<italic>SS</italic>) is computed by using script <italic>pfam_score.pl.</italic><disp-formula><label>(2)</label><tex-math id="M2">\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

      <p>Datasets in which the majority of informative S-cycle protein domains are represented will yield a high <italic>SS</italic>; in contrast, low <italic>SS</italic> values should be expected if proteins involved in the S-cycle are not particularly enriched.</p>

        <title>MSL</title>
        <p>As the calculation of the <italic>SS</italic> depends on the MSL of the omic sample of interest, script <italic>pfam_score.pl</italic> supports option –size in amino acid residues (aa). In this way, appropriate precomputed <italic>H<sup>΄</sup></italic> values for Pfam domains can be selected to produce the final score.

        <title>Metabolic pathway completeness and KEGG visualization</title>
        <p>The presence-absence patterns of Pfam domains belonging to particular pathways can be exploited to compute metabolic completeness. This optional task is invoked with parameter –keggmap and a TAB-separated file mapping Pfam identifiers to KEGG Orthology entries (KO numbers) and the corresponding pathway in Sucy (see Table S3). To compute completeness, the total number of domains involved in a given pathway (i.e., sulfate reduction, sulfide oxidation) must be retrieved from the Sucy database (See Table S2). Then, the protein domains currently present in any given sample are divided by the total number of domains in the pre-defined pathway. The script produces: (i) a detailed report of the metabolic pathways of interest and (ii) a list of KO numbers with Hex color codes, corresponding to KO matches in the omic sample, which can be exported to the KEGG Mapper–Search &amp; Color Pathway tool (see Fig. S2) [<xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>].</p>

      <sec id="sec2-4-3">
        <title>Properties and performance of SS</title>
        <p>Since the outcome of the final score (<italic>SS</italic>) largely depends on the list of microorganisms involved in the metabolism of interest (in our case, Suli) and the Pfam domains found in the input protein sequences (n = 112), we evaluated its robustness and reproducibility with several approaches. First, we compared our results with a benchmark performed 3 years ago in which we used Pfam-A v27 (instead of version 30), a genomic dataset containing 1528 non-redundant genomes (579 fewer genomes than our current Genomic dataset), and an input list of 156 genomes of interest (5 fewer that our current Suli). Second, <italic>SS</italic> estimates were compared with scores obtained by randomly selecting ≈50% of the 112 Pfam domains with both Gen and Met. This analysis was performed a thousand times with <italic>pfam_score.pl</italic> –random. Third, we benchmarked the predictive capacity of the <italic>SS</italic> in order to accurately classify genomes of S-related organisms (Suli, n = 161, positive instances), in contrast with a larger set of non-redundant genomes (Gen–Suli, n = 1.946, negative instances). Therefore, we computed the true positive rates (TPR), false positive rates (FPR), receiver operating characteristic (ROC) plots, and the resulting area under the curve (AUC) using the scikit-learn module [<xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>].</p>

    <title>Results and Discussion</title>
    <p>We present MEBS, a new open source software to evaluate, quantify, compare, and predict the metabolic machinery of interest in large “omic” datasets. The pipeline includes 4 stages. The first one consists of the systematic and targeted acquisition of the molecular and ecological information describing the metabolism of interest, represented by a list of curated microorganisms and a FASTA file of proteins involved in that metabolic network. In the second stage, the domain composition of the curated proteins is evaluated. Then, the domains enriched among the microorganisms of interest are identified by using the mathematical framework of the relative entropy (<italic>H</italic>’, third stage). Finally, the summation of the entropy of individual Pfam domains in a given genome or metagenomic dataset yields the final score (see Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">1</xref>).</p>
    <p>To test the applicability of this approach, we evaluated the metabolic machinery of the S-cycle. Due to its multiple redox states and its consequences on microbiological and geochemical transformations, S-metabolism can be observed as a complex metabolic machinery, involving a myriad of genes, enzymes, organic substrates, and electron carriers, which largely depend on the surrounding geochemical and ecological conditions. For these reasons, the complete repertory involved in the metabolic machinery of the S-cycle has remained underexplored despite the massive data produced in “omic” experiments. Here, we performed an integral curation effort to describe all the elements involved in the S-cycle and then used, as explained in the following sections, to score genomic and metagenomic datasets in terms of their sulfur relevance.</p>
    <sec id="sec3-1">
      <title>Manual curation: the complex metabolic machinery of the sulfur cycle</title>
      <p>In order to integrate the complete biogeochemical S-cycle, we manually curated and modeled the major processes involved in the mobilization and use of S-compounds through Earth’s biosphere. This effort resulted in 2 comprehensive databases. The first one includes most of the known microorganisms (with and without complete genomes) described in the literature to be closely involved in the S-cycle (Table S1). In this database, we included representative taxa from the following metabolic sulfur guilds: (i) chemolithotrophic, colorless sulfur bacteria (CLSB: 24 genera); (ii) anaerobic phototrophs, purple sulfur bacteria (PSB: 25 genera), and green sulfur bacteria (GSB: 9 genera); (iii) sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB: 40 genera); and (iv) deep-branch sulfur hyperthermophilic microorganisms, such as elemental sulfur–reducing (SRM: 19 genera) and oxidizers (SO: 4 genera). From all the microorganisms described to be involved in the S-cycle, at the time of the analysis, a total of 161 were found to be completely sequenced and non-redundant genomes, and these were used as the first input of the pipeline (Suli).</p>
      <p>The second database (Sucy) contains genes, proteins, and pathways with experimental evidence linking them to the S-cycle. To compile this database, we first gathered the most important S-compounds derived from biogeochemical processes and biological catalyzed reactions. Then we classified each S-compound according to its chemical and thermodynamic nature (Gibbs free energy of formation). Finally, we classified whether each compound can be used as a source of carbon, nitrogen, energy, or as an electron donor, fermentative substrate, or terminal electron acceptor in respiratory microbial processes. The schematic representation of the manually curated effort summarizing the complexity of the sulfur biogeochemical cycle in a global scale is shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>.</p>

The most important organic and inorganic S-compounds derived from biogeochemical processes are arranged according to the Standard Gibbs free energy of formation described in Caspi et al. [<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The left column indicates whether specific microorganisms are able to use those S-compounds as a source of carbon (C), nitrogen (N), energy (E), or electron donors (°). Double asterisks indicate whether the S-compound is used as sole source of C, N, or E. The corresponding electron acceptors in redox-coupled reactions using the S-compound as electron donor are not shown. The right column indicates whether the S-compound is used as fermentative substrate (F) or terminal electron acceptor in respiratory processes (R). Colored boxes summarize the metabolic guilds involved in the metabolism of S-compounds in oxidation (i.e., CLSB, SOM, PSB, and GSB) or reduction (SR, SRB) processes. The complete list of S-based microorganisms (Suli) is found in Table S1. Figure based on annotations from MetaCyc [<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p>

      <p>Once we selected the microorganisms, genes, and biogeochemical processes involved, we systematically divided the metabolic machinery of the S-cycle into 28 major metabolic pathways described in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">1</xref>. In general terms, we included pathways involved in: (i) the oxidation/reduction of inorganic S-compounds, used as source of energy, electron donor or acceptor (P1-P7, P11 and P20 and P21); (ii) the degradation of organic S-compounds, such as aliphatic sulfonates, sulfur amino acids, and organosulfonates (P8-P10, P12-P19, P22, P23, P27); (iii) the methanogenesis from methylated thiols, such as dimethyl sulfide DMS (P24), metylthio-propanoate (P25), and methanethiol (P26), which are generated in nature by different biogeochemical processes [<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]; and finally, (iv) the biosynthesis of sulfolipids (SQDG) (P28), because it has been observed that some bacteria living in S-rich and P-lacking environments are able to synthetize sulfolipids, instead of phospholipids, in the membrane as an adaptation to the selective pressures of these particular environments [<xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. The synthetic pathway P29 is explained in further detail in the next sections (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">1</xref>).</p>

The latter representation also highlights the interconnection of pathways in terms of energy flow and the interplay of the redox gradient (organic/inorganic) of the intermediate compounds that act as key axes of organic and inorganic reactions (e.g., sulfite).</p>

The 28 molecular pathways involved in the metabolism of sulfur compounds described in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">1</xref> are included. The enzymatic steps are depicted as rectangles, followed by arrows indicating the direction of the reaction. Green hexagons represent metabolic links to other metabolisms. Bold dashed arrows indicate bidirectional reactions. Inorganic S-compounds have been arranged according to their reduction potential, from the most oxidized (yellow) to the most reduced (red) compounds. Gray rectangles indicate enzymes acting in disproportionation processes in which a reactant is both oxidized and reduced in the same chemical reaction, forming 2 separate compounds. Input biogeochemical S-compounds are shown outside and connected with bold arrows. Dashed arrows indicate S-compounds excreted out of the cell. The upper half of the modeled cell depicts the processes involved in the use of organic S-compounds (orange circles) found in natural environments and used as source of carbon, sulfur, and/or energy in several aerobic/anaerobic strains, described in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>.</p>

      <title>Annotation of Pfam domains within sulfur proteins</title>
      <p>Our approach requires the detection of structural and evolutionary units, also known as domains, in the curated list of protein sequences involved in the metabolism of interest (S-cycle in this case). The annotation of protein domains against the Pfam-A database resulted in a total of 112 domains identified in 147 proteins (out of 152). These 112 domains constitute the Pfam-Sucy database and represent all the pathways listed in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">1</xref>. Two other protein family databases were tested (TGRFAM and Superfamily), but the number of proteins with positive matches was lower than with Pfam (57 and 137, respectively), and thus the other protein family databases were not further considered.</p>

      <title>Preparation of omic datasets: Gen, GenF, and Met</title>
      <p>The genomic dataset required for computing domain entropies (Gen) was obtained from public databases, as explained above in “MEBS Description.” A fragmented version of Gen, called GenF, was generated by considering the MSL distribution of metagenomic sequences (Fig. S1).</p>
      <p>In order to benchmark MEBS with real environmental metagenomic samples, a collection of 900 public metagenomes was obtained from MG-RAST, to which we added 35 metagenomes sampled from an ultra-oligotrophic shallow lake in México (CCC). Altogether, these 935 metagenomes set up the Met dataset.</p>

    <sec id="sec3-4">
      <title>Using the relative entropy to recognize S-cycle domains and candidate markers</title>
      <p>The next stage consists of the quantitative detection of informative domains (enriched among organisms in Suli) by computing their relative entropy (<italic>H<sup>΄</sup></italic>) using Equation (1). The occurrences of each of the 112 Pfam domains in Suli and the genomic datasets were taken as observed and expected frequencies, respectively. Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>A summarizes the computed <italic>H<sup>΄</sup></italic> values in real (Gen) and fragmented genomic sequences of increasing size (GenF). The results indicate that only a few Pfam domains are equally informative, regardless of the length of sequences. When <italic>H<sup>΄</sup></italic> values inferred from real, full-length proteins are compared to those of fragmented sequences, it can be seen that shorter sequences (MSL 30 and 60 aa) yield larger entropy differences than sequences of length &gt;100 aa (see in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>B). Therefore, in order to shortlist candidate marker genes, we selected those Pfam domains displaying constant, high mean <italic>H<sup>΄</sup></italic> values in Gen and GenF, low <italic>H<sup>΄</sup></italic> standard deviation (std), and a clear separation from the random distribution.</p>

Clustering of the Pfam relative entropies obtained in Gen and GenF was produced with the Ward method. Log frequency of the entropy values computed in the random test is colored in purple (see scale bar). Cluster 0 (blue) groups protein domains with low relative entropy that overlap with the random distribution. Cluster 1 (green) includes the Pfam domains that fulfill the requirements to be used as molecular markers (high <italic>H<sup>΄</sup></italic> and low standard deviation [std]). Red dots (cluster 2) correspond to Pfam domains with high <italic>H<sup>΄</sup></italic> and std. The cluster was produced with script <italic>F_meanVSstd.py</italic>.</p>

        <graphic xlink:href="gix096fig4"/>
      </fig>
      <p>We tested several clustering methods, summarized in Fig. S3, with Ward and Birch performing best in grouping together informative protein domains with low std. However, the Ward classification was eventually selected as Birch failed to include a few Pfam domains relevant in the S-cycle (see Fig. S4). By using the Ward method, 3 well-defined clusters of Pfam domains were generated, as observed in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>C. Cluster 0 included 94 domains containing <italic>H<sup>΄</sup></italic> values ranging from –0.4 to 0.4 and overlapping with the values obtained in the negative control explained in the next section. Cluster 1 consistently grouped together 12 Pfam domains, listed in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">2</xref>, with high entropy and low std, and can therefore be proposed as molecular markers in metagenomic sequences of variable length. Among the proposed marker domains are APS-Reductase (PF12139: <italic>H<sup>΄</sup></italic> = 1.2), ATP-sulfurilase (PF01747: <italic>H<sup>΄</sup></italic> = 1.03), and DsrC (PF04358: <italic>H<sup>΄</sup></italic> = 0.52), key protein families in metabolic pathways involved in both sulfur oxidation/reduction processes. Finally, cluster 2 includes Pfam domains displaying high entropy values and high std, such as the PUA-like domain (PF14306: <italic>H<sup>΄</sup></italic> = 1). We presume that domains within this cluster are also key players in S-metabolism; however, their high std makes them unsuitable for markers, particularly with metagenomic sequences of variable MSL. We suggest that further analyses will be required to test the implication in S-energy conservation processes of proteins containing domains such as PF03916, PF02665, or PF14697 (see the complete list in Table S4).</p>

As expected, there was a clear difference between both <italic>H<sup>΄</sup></italic> estimates (see Fig. S5).

      <title>Sulfur Score and its predictive capacity to detect S-microbial players in a large genomic dataset</title>
      <p>To test whether Pfam entropies can be combined to capture the S-metabolic machinery in “omic” samples, we calculated the final MEBS score, called, in this case, Sulfur Score. We computed the <italic>SS</italic> on each of the 2107 non-redundant genomes in Gen with the script <italic>score_genomes.sh.</italic> The individual genomes, along with their corresponding <italic>SS</italic> values and taxonomy according to NCBI, are found in Table S6.</p>
      <p>For evaluation purposes, we classified and manually annotated all the genomes in Gen according to their metabolic capabilities. First, we identified the 161 curated genomes belonging to Suli. Then, we focused on the remaining genomes. A set of 192 genomes with <italic>SS</italic> &gt; 4 were labeled <underline>S</underline>ulfur <underline>u</underline>nconsidered or <underline>r</underline>elated microorganisms (Sur). Finally, the rest of genomes in Gen were classified as NS (Non-Sulfur = Gen–(Suli + Sur)), including 1754 genomes. The boxplots in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>A summarize the scores obtained in these 3 subsets.</p>

      <p>To double-check whether the Sur genomes—selected due to their <italic>SS</italic>—might be involved in the S-cycle, we manually annotated all of them, focusing on relevant genomic, biochemical, physiological, and environmental information that we might have missed since Suli was first curated (Table S7). Out of 192 genomes, 68 are reported to metabolize S-compounds under culture conditions in the literature. For instance, <italic>Sideroxydans lithotrophicus ES-</italic>1, a microaerophilic Fe-oxidizing bacterium, has been observed to also grow in thiosulfate as an energy source [<xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Another 59 Sur organisms have been isolated from Sulfur-rich environments, such as hot springs or solfataric muds. Remarkably, some of this species include hard-to culture genomes reconstructed from metagenomic sequences such as <italic>Candidatus Desulforudis audaxviator MP104C</italic> isolated from basalt-hosted fluids of the deep subsea floor [<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], an unnamed endosymbiont of a scaly snail from a black smoker chimney [<xref rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>], and archaeon <italic>Geoglobus ahangari</italic>, sampled from a 2000-meter-deep hydrothermal vent [<xref rid="bib58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. Furthermore, we also confirmed within Sur the implication of S-cycle of 20 species of the genus <italic>Campylobacter.</italic> These results are consistent with the ecological role of the involved taxa, that along with SRB and methanogens inhabiting host-gastrointestinal and low-oxygen environments, where several inorganic (e.g., sulfates, sulfites) or organic (e.g., dietary amino acids and host mucins) are highly metabolized by these metabolic guilds [<xref rid="bib59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. The implication of <italic>Campylobacter</italic> species in the S-cycle is also supported by the fact that some of them have been isolated from deep sea hydrothermal vents [<xref rid="bib60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. The remaining species in Sur were classified into different categories, including bioremediation (7), Fe-environment (2), marine (2), peat lands (2) and other environments (32) (see Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>B).</p>
      <p>When the <italic>SS</italic> values of genomes in Sur are compared to the S-metabolic guilds represented in Suli (e.g., PSB, SRB, GSB), it can be seen that they are indeed similar and clearly separated from the rest of the NS genomes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>C). This strongly suggests that high-scoring genomes are indeed ecologically and metabolically implicated in the S-cycle.</p>
      <p>Finally, in order to quantify the capacity of the <italic>SS</italic> to accurately classify S-related microorganisms, we computed a ROC curve (for a detailed description of ROC curves, see [<xref rid="bib61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]). We thus defined genomes annotated in Suli as positive instances, and the rest as negative ones. The results are shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>D, with an estimated area under the curve (AUC) of 0.985, and the corresponding cut-off values of <italic>SS</italic> for several false positive rates (FPR). According to this test, an <italic>SS</italic> value of 8.705 is required to rule out all false positives in Gen, while <italic>SS</italic> = 5.231 is sufficient to achieve an FPR &lt; 0.05.</p>
      <p>Overall, these results indicate that MEBS is a powerful and broadly applicable approach to predict and classify microorganisms closely involved in the sulfur cycle, even in hard-to-culture microbial lineages.</p>

      <title>Sulfur Score and its predictive capacity to detect S-related environments in a large metagenomic collection</title>
      <p>The <italic>SS</italic> was also computed for each metagenome in Met, using their corresponding MSL to choose the appropriate entropies previously calculated in dataset GenF (Table S8). In order to test whether <italic>SS</italic> values can be used to identify S-related environments, we performed the following analyses. First, we used the geographical metadata associated with each metagenome to map the global distribution of <italic>SS</italic>. In Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>A, <italic>SS</italic> values are colored from yellow to red. The most informative S-environments (displaying <italic>SS</italic> values equal to or greater than the 95th percentile of each MSL category) are shown in blue.</p>

        <graphic xlink:href="gix096fig6"/>
      </fig>
      <p>Then, we sorted the metagenomes according to their environmental features, as proposed by the Genomic Standards Consortium (GSC) and implemented in MG-RAST. Each feature corresponds to 1 of 13 environmental packages (EPs) that standardize metadata describing particular habitats that are applicable across all GSC checklists and beyond [<xref rid="bib62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. Therefore, each EP represents a broad and general classification containing particular features. For example, the “water” EP includes 330 metagenomes from our dataset, belonging to several features such as freshwater, lakes, estuarine, marine, hydrothermal vents, etc. As each of these features has different ecological capabilities in terms of biogeochemical cycles, we can expect different behaviors among <italic>SS</italic> values, as shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>B. In general, all the metagenomes derived from hydrothermal vents (2), marine benthic (6), intertidal (8), and our unpublished CCC microbial mats had <italic>SS</italic> values above the 95th percentile, highlighting the importance of the S-cycle in these environments. In contrast, the metagenomes belonging to features such as sub-terrestrial habitat (7), saline evaporation pond (24), or organisms-associated habitat (7) displayed consistently low or even negative <italic>SS</italic> values, indicating a negligible presence of S-metabolic pathways in those environments. The remaining features have intermediate median <italic>SS</italic> values and contain occasionally individual metagenomes with <italic>SS</italic> values above the 95th percentile, such as freshwater, marine, ocean, or biofilm environments.</p>
      <p>To validate the list of 50 high-scoring metagenomes (above the 95th percentile), we double-checked their annotations. According to the literature and associated metadata, all these environments are closely involved in the mineralization, uptake, and recycling processes of S-compounds, e.g., environmental sequences derived from the coastal Oligochaete worm <italic>Olavius algarvensis</italic>, hydrothermal vents, and marine deep-sea surface sediments around the Deep-Water Horizon spill in the Gulf of Mexico. The complete list of annotated metagenomes, along with their ecological capabilities, is found in Table S9.</p>

    <sec id="sec3-8">
      <title>Evaluating the robustness of the sulfur score</title>
      <p>To test the reproducibility and robustness of the MEBS final score (<italic>SS</italic>), we conducted 2 further analyses. In the first, we compared <italic>SS</italic> estimates derived from the Met dataset, computed with Pfam entropies obtained in the first MEBS benchmark performed 3 years ago (2014) with the current data described in this article (2017). Despite the changes of both databases (Pfam database version and the Suli list), we found a strong correlation (<italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.912) between the <italic>SS</italic> outcomes (Fig. S6 A). A kernel density analysis of the latter comparison suggests a different behavior of low and high <italic>SS</italic> scores, with the latter being more reproducible (see Fig. S6B).</p>
      <p>In the second analysis, we quantitatively tested to what extent the entropy estimates of the 112 Pfam domains directly affect the outcome of the <italic>SS</italic> in Gen and Met. We randomly subsampled ≈50% of those domains to compute the <italic>SS</italic> a thousand times for each genome and metagenome in Gen and Met, respectively. The results, summarized in Table S10, confirm that <italic>SS</italic> values computed with random subsets of Pfam domains are generally lower than <italic>SS</italic> derived from the full list (n = 112) of Sucy-Pfam domains. To further inspect the distribution of <italic>SS</italic> values produced with random subsets of domains (random <italic>SS</italic>), we focused on the particular case of the metagenomes belonging to the category MSL = 60. As expected, the distribution of random <italic>SS</italic> oscillates between negative and positive values. Interestingly, metagenomes exhibiting only positive random <italic>SS</italic> are ranked above the 95th percentile according to their real <italic>SS</italic> values (see Fig. S7A). The latter indicates that even a random subset of Pfam domains used to compute the score is more likely to highly rank metagenomes containing the sulfur metabolic machinery (large number of high-entropy Pfam domains), than those lacking the sulfur metabolism or displaying a large number of non-informative Pfam domains. Furthermore, by comparing the median of random <italic>SS</italic> with the real scores, we observe a clear separation between those distributions (see Fig. S7B and Table S10).</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec3-9">
      <title>Completeness of S-metabolic pathways</title>
      <p>As we described above, the MEBS pipeline models a metabolic network as an array of S-related protein domains (Sucy-Pfam) to ultimately use their entropies to produce the final score (<italic>SS</italic>). For a closer look, we also dissected the total contribution of independent domains at the network level in order to assess whether <italic>SS</italic> depends on the partial or complete detection of S-pathways. Consequently, we evaluated the pathway completeness in both genomic (Gen) and metagenomic (Met) datasets (see Tables S11 and S12, respectively). Since the number of Pfam domains per pathway goes from 1 to 29 (see Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">1</xref> and Table S2), we suspect that pathways represented by a single domain might not reflect their complete metabolic function. For example, the pathways involved in the methanogenesis of compounds such as dimethylsulfide (DMS, P24), methyl-thiolpropanoate (MTPA, P25), and methanethiol (MeSH, P26) are represented by the same protein (MtsA, PF01208) in our Sucy database, as well as in Metacyc [<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Therefore, we expect that pathways P24–26 will have identical presence-absence patterns in Gen and Met.</p>
      <p>The boxplots in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>A and B summarize the distribution of completeness for each S-metabolic pathway, including the synthetic pathway (P29) composed by 12 candidate markers as described in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">2</xref>. As expected, the observed completeness per pathway was higher in Met than in Gen, since microbial communities harbor a wider repertory of metabolic functions than single genomes. In the case of genomes, we noted that a few pathways were complete in most genomes, the majority being involved in the usage of organic sulfur compounds such as alkanesulfonates (P9), sulfoacetate (P14), and biosynthesis of sulfolipids (SQDG) and the single domain pathways P24–26. Remarkably, we also detected a few organisms displaying the highest levels of metabolic completeness in some S-energy based pathways. For example, we found that <italic>Desulfosporosinus acidiphilus SJ4</italic> (<italic>SS</italic> = 8.91) was the only genome harboring the complete repertory of Pfam domains described in Sucy for the sulfite oxidation (P1), strongly suggesting that it may oxidize sulfite. However, this activity remains to be tested in culture [<xref rid="bib63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. In the case of thiosulfate oxidation (P3), we detected 3 genomes displaying the highest levels of completeness, in agreement with their ecological features: <italic>Hydrogenobaculum</italic> sp. <italic>Y04AAS1</italic> (<italic>SS</italic> = 9.319) [<xref rid="bib64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>] and the CLSB: <italic>Acidithiobacillus caldus ATCC 51756</italic> (<italic>SS</italic> = 6.525) [<xref rid="bib65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>] and <italic>Acidithiobacillus ferrivorans</italic> (<italic>SS</italic> = 7.436) [<xref rid="bib66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. For the sulfate reduction dissimilative pathway (P5), out of 55 genomes displaying the higher completeness levels, 67% are actually SRB, 12% are Sur genomes, and the rest are sulfur oxidation microorganisms. Furthermore, the PSB <italic>Thioflavicoccus mobilis 8321</italic> (<italic>SS</italic> = 9.756), isolated from a microbial mat [<xref rid="bib67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>], was the genome displaying the most complete sulfide oxidation pathway (P11). Elemental sulfur disproportionation (P21) is represented by a single non-informative domain (PF07682, <italic>H<sup>΄</sup></italic> = 0.172) that remarkably is found in 14 sulfur respiring or related genomes such as <italic>Sulfolobus tokodaii str. 7</italic> (<italic>SS</italic> = 5.341) and <italic>Acidianus hospitalis W1</italic> (<italic>SS</italic> = 3.88). Finally, we identified 6 genomes encoding all 12 proposed markers. Among them, 3 were GSB (<italic>Pelodictyon phaeoclathratiforme BU-1</italic>, <italic>SS</italic> = 11.836, <italic>Chlorobium chlorochromatii CaD3</italic>, <italic>SS</italic> = 11.625, and <italic>Chlorobium tepidum TLS</italic>, <italic>SS</italic> = 11.354), 1 CLSB (Thiobacillus denitrificans ATCC 25259 <italic>SS</italic> = 11.61), another 1 PSB (<italic>Thiocystis violascens DSM 198</italic>, <italic>SS</italic> = 10.633), and finally 1 Sur (<italic>Sedimenticola thiotaurini SS</italic> = 10.109).

      <p>A global view of metabolic completeness was obtained by bulking the data from all pathways. Linear regression models between mean completeness and <italic>SS</italic> that were computed confirm the yielding <italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup> values of 0.003 and 0.627 for Gen and Met, respectively (See Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>C and D). Moreover, we also assessed the relationship between the mean completeness of the synthetic pathway of candidate markers (P29) and the <italic>SS</italic>. As expected, significant correlations were obtained in both datasets (<italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.645 and <italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.881 for Gen and Met, respectively) (see Fig. S8).</p>
      <p>To get a more detailed insight into the completeness, we selected a few genomes and metagenomes displaying high and low <italic>SS</italic> values. Specifically, from the Gen dataset, we selected 1 representative from the main S-guilds, 1 Sur genome, and 2 genomes with low <italic>SS</italic> values (NS). As observed in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>, the low-scoring genomes <italic>Enterococcus durans</italic> (<italic>SS</italic> = −0.194), <italic>Micrococcus luteus NCTC_2665</italic> (<italic>SS</italic> = −3.588), <italic>and Ruegeria pomeroyi DSS-3</italic> (<italic>SS</italic> = 2.707) display unrelated patterns of sulfur metabolic completeness compared with the rest of the genomes and therefore are separated. In contrast, high-scoring S-respiring microorganisms <italic>Desulfovibrio vulgaris DP4</italic> (<italic>SS</italic> = 11.442), <italic>Sulfolobus acidocaldarius DSM 639</italic> (<italic>SS</italic> = 5.457), and <italic>Ammonifex degensii KC4</italic> (<italic>SS</italic> = 12.508) are clustered together. We also observed that mat-isolated cyanobacteria <italic>Synechococcus</italic> sp. <italic>JA-2–3Ba 2–13</italic>, classified as NS with <italic>SS</italic> = 3.704, was clustered together with other high-scoring genomes, in agreement with the lack of correlation reported above.</p>
      <p>In the case of metagenomes (see Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>E), we observed a clear correlation between <italic>SS</italic> and completeness. For example, metagenomes 4440320.3 and 4489656.3, with the lowest scores (<italic>SS</italic> = 0.1 and <italic>SS</italic> = −2.649, respectively), also exhibit the largest number of incomplete pathways. Similarly, high-scoring metagenomes derived from black smoker or marine sediment are grouped together in terms of completeness.</p>

    <title>Conclusions</title>
    <p>Our study represents the first exploration of the Sulfur biogeochemical cycle in a large collection of genomes and metagenomes. The manually curated effort resulted in an inventory of the compounds, genes, proteins, molecular pathways, and microorganisms involved. This complex universe of articulated data was reduced to a list of microorganisms and Pfam domains encoded in the proteins that take part in that network. These domains were first ranked in terms of relative entropy, and then summed to produce a single S-score representing the relevance of a given genomic or metagenomic sample in terms of sulfur metabolic machinery. We took advantage of the mathematical framework of information theory, which has been widely used in computational biology.</p>
    <p>The performance of the MEBS pipeline (designed for the above-mentioned tasks) was benchmarked on large genomic and metagenomic sets. Our results support the broad applicability of this algorithm in order to classify annotated genomes as well as newly sequenced environmental samples without prior culture. We also assessed to what extent the final score depended on the partial or complete detection of pathways and observed a higher completeness per pathway in metagenomic sequences than in individual genomes.</p>
    <p>We demonstrated that a measurable score can be applied to evaluate any given metabolic machinery or biogeochemical cycle in large (meta)genomic scale, holding the potential to dramatically change the current view of inferring metabolic capabilities in the present “omic” era.</p>

    <title>Endnotes</title>
    <p>We are currently finishing the analyses to demonstrate the applicability of this approach to other biogeochemical cycles (C, N, O, Fe, P). Thereby, we hope that the pipeline MEBS will facilitate analysis of biogeochemical cycles or complex metabolic networks carried out by specific prokaryotic guilds, such as bioremediation processes (i.e., degradation of hydrocarbons, toxic aromatic compounds, heavy metals, etc.). We look forward to collaborating with and helping other researchers by integrating comprehensive databases that might be helpful to the scientific community. Furthermore, we are currently working to improve the algorithm by using only a list of sequenced genomes involved in the metabolism of interest in order to reduce the manual curation effort. We are also considering taking <italic>k-mers</italic> instead of peptide Hidden Markov Models to increase the speed of the pipeline. We anticipate that our platform will stimulate interest and involvement among the scientific community to explore uncultured genomes derived from large metagenomic sequences.</p>
