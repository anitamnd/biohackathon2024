        <title>Background</title>
        <p>Proteins with low complexity regions (LCRs) have atypical sequence and structural features. Their amino acid composition varies from the expected, determined proteome-wise, and they do not follow the rules of structural folding that prevail in globular regions. One way to characterize these regions is by assessing the repeatability of a sequence, that is, calculating the local propensity of a region to be part of a repeat.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec002">
        <title>Results</title>
        <p>We combine two local measures of low complexity, repeatability (using the RES algorithm) and fraction of the most frequent amino acid, to evaluate different proteomes, datasets of protein regions with specific features, and individual cases of proteins with extreme compositions. We apply a representation called ‘low complexity triangle’ as a proof-of-concept to represent the low complexity measured values. Results show that proteomes have distinct signatures in the low complexity triangle, and that these signatures are associated to complexity features of the sequences. We developed a web tool called LCT (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://cbdm-01.zdv.uni-mainz.de/~munoz/lct/">http://cbdm-01.zdv.uni-mainz.de/~munoz/lct/</ext-link>) to allow users to calculate the low complexity triangle of a given protein or region of interest.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec003">
        <title>Conclusions</title>
        <p>The low complexity triangle proves to be a suitable procedure to represent the general low complexity of a sequence or protein dataset. Homorepeats, direpeats, compositionally biased regions and globular regions occupy characteristic positions in the triangle. The described pipeline can be used to characterize LCRs and may help in quantifying the content of degenerated tandem repeats in proteins and proteomes.</p>

    <title>Introduction</title>
    <p>Amino acids are not part of proteins in equal proportions, as they do differ from the theoretical 5% usage that one would expect. The prevalence of the different amino acids in a proteome is taxonomically-dependent, yielding species-specific amino acid frequencies. However, about 20% of eukaryotic and 8% of prokaryotic residues are part of regions that do not follow the expected amino acid frequencies given by the full proteomes but contain fewer amino acid types <bold>[<xref rid="pone.0239154.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</bold>. These are known as low complexity regions (LCRs). They can be found in the form of consecutive runs of a single (homorepeat) or two ordered different residues (direpeats) <bold>[<xref rid="pone.0239154.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</bold>, of multiple adjacent residue patterns (tandem repeats, <bold>[<xref rid="pone.0239154.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</bold>) and of scrambled arrangements of repetitive motifs (cryptic repeats, <bold>[<xref rid="pone.0239154.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</bold>). Because these regions are enriched in a few amino acid types they are also known as compositionally biased regions (CBRs) <bold>[<xref rid="pone.0239154.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</bold>.</p>
    <p>Low complexity regions are often functional <bold>[<xref rid="pone.0239154.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0239154.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</bold> and do not follow the guidelines of structural folding that rule in globular regions <bold>[<xref rid="pone.0239154.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</bold>. This is because they usually overlap with protein disorder <bold>[<xref rid="pone.0239154.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0239154.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</bold>. Sequence alterations in some of them have been associated with diseases <bold>[<xref rid="pone.0239154.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0239154.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</bold>. There are many available computational tools to locate LCRs (e.g. <bold>[<xref rid="pone.0239154.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0239154.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</bold>), but they are usually focused on one or a few types of low complexity classes. Efforts to integrate some of these tools into comprehensive low complexity tool platforms have also been made <bold>[<xref rid="pone.0239154.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0239154.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</bold>. Similarly, there are dedicated databases of tandem repeats <bold>[<xref rid="pone.0239154.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</bold>, disorder proteins <bold>[<xref rid="pone.0239154.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0239154.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]</bold>, and other low complexity regions <bold>[<xref rid="pone.0239154.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0239154.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]</bold>.</p>
    <p>The low complexity diagram, or low complexity triangle, is a 2D representation useful to compare amino acid sequences of various degrees of complexity <bold>[<xref rid="pone.0239154.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</bold>. It represents the complexity composition of a sequence combining two local measurements: repeatability <bold>[<xref rid="pone.0239154.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]</bold> and local fraction of the most frequent amino acid <bold>[<xref rid="pone.0239154.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</bold>. Similar to the use of the Ramachandran plot to visualize the values of backbone dihedral angles in protein structures <bold>[<xref rid="pone.0239154.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]</bold>, in the low complexity triangle the distribution of pairs of repeatability and amino acid frequency values found for a given sequence or dataset would be depicted, and a unique low complexity cloud or signature would emerge.</p>
    <p>For a given sequence, to calculate its low complexity triangle one must first split it in overlapping windows, and then calculate two parameters for each window: the minimum number of mutations to perfect repeats (MMPR) and the fraction of the most frequent amino acid. The x-axis of the diagram shows the MMPR in the range from 0 to half of the window length. The y-axis represents the fraction of the most frequent amino acid in the current window, in the range from 1/window_length to 1. The prevalence distribution of the windows in the triangle would help in the assessment of the low complexity of the analyzed sequence, with regions of variable degrees of amino acid frequency (y-axis) and repetition (x-axis). Higher values in the y-axis force lower values in the x-axis, thus imposing the low complexity diagram to be drawn as a triangle <bold>[<xref rid="pone.0239154.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</bold>.</p>
    <p>Here we use the low complexity triangle as a proof-of-concept and study how it reflects low complexity features of protein sequences. We test it with several proteomes, datasets of protein regions with diverse complexity features, and some proteins with extreme compositions, and check that they have distinct signatures in the low complexity triangle depending on their profile. We developed the LCT tool to allow any user to submit their own protein of interest and calculate its associated triangle.</p>

A total of 4391, 12739, 6049, 13790 and 20605 proteins were downloaded, respectively.</p>
      <p>The complete SwissProt release 2019_11 (561568 proteins) was also retrieved from the UniProtKB database. Positional annotations from all proteins of that release were parsed out and several datasets covering different sequence features were generated; considered features were: domains, transmembrane regions, coiled coil regions and compositional bias. Per feature, only the amino acid positions of the specific annotated region were kept. Sequence features shorter than 20 amino acids were not considered, as this is the default window length for the repeatability analysis. As a result, we obtained 200406 domains (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0239154.s003">S1 File</xref></bold>), 372581 transmembrane regions (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0239154.s004">S2 File</xref></bold>), 22110 coiled coil regions (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0239154.s005">S3 File</xref></bold>) and 59176 regions annotated as compositionally biased (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0239154.s006">S4 File</xref></bold>).</p>
      <p>To obtain a dataset of globular sequences, we downloaded all protein sequences from the PDB database <bold>[<xref rid="pone.0239154.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]</bold>, and randomly selected 1000 sequences to carry out the analysis (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0239154.s007">S5 File</xref></bold>). A dataset of 100 manually-curated proteins containing low complexity regions was obtained from <bold>[<xref rid="pone.0239154.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</bold> (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0239154.s008">S6 File</xref></bold>). From the database DisProt release 2020_06 <bold>[<xref rid="pone.0239154.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]</bold>, we retrieved a dataset of 6656 manually-curated disordered regions (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0239154.s009">S7 File</xref></bold>).</p>

      <title>Low complexity assessment</title>
      <p>Given a protein sequence, we first divided it in overlapping windows of 20 amino acids (default), with a step of one amino acid. Windows shorter than 20 amino acids (at the N- and C-terminal of the protein sequences) were discarded. Each window was then analyzed with the RES tool <bold>[<xref rid="pone.0239154.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]</bold>, which calculates the minimum number of mutations to perfect repeats (MMPR), <italic>x</italic>. RES is a simple and linearly complex tool useful to detect protein sequences approximate to short tandem repeats. It assesses the repeatability of an input sequence by quantifying how far it is from a perfect repeat. We used as input for RES all protein windows, one at a time, and received the resulting MMPR.</p>
      <p>We also computed the fraction of the most frequent amino acid in the window, <italic>y</italic>. Once the complete set of windows was analyzed, we plotted the x/y values in a low complexity triangle. When dealing with a dataset of more than one protein, we divide each of them in windows and then analyze all windows. This is done to calculate the total amount of windows in the dataset that occupies each coordinate in the low complexity triangle, irrespective of protein length.</p>
      <p>To ease the comparison between the distribution of the windows’ results in the different low complexity triangles, we define three overlapping regions outlined with different colors: (x &gt; 8.5, y &lt; 0.275), in red; (x &gt; 7.5, y &lt; 0.325), in green; and (x &gt; 6.5, y &lt; 0.375), in orange.</p>

As mandatory input, LCT needs a protein sequence in FASTA format, either pasted or uploaded (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0239154.g001">Fig 1A</xref></bold>). The default window length (WL) is 20 amino acids, but the user can modify it to 10, 15, 25 or 30 amino acids. Smaller values of the window length would result in a shortened triangle’s grid (i.e. for WL = 10, MMPR = [0–5]), and thus the resolution of the results would be poorer, but would allow the unequivocal identification of shorter fragments with repeats (top-left corner in the triangle). On the other hand, larger values of the window length would be useful to study the general complexity of a sequence and to uncover long tandem repeats, which would be placed closer to the bottom-left corner in the low complexity triangle.</p>

      <title>Proteomes have distinct signatures in the low complexity triangle</title>
      <p>The low complexity triangle is a plot meant to characterize and represent the low complexity content of a given sequence, region or dataset. Once the query is decomposed in overlapping windows, two distinct parameters related to its low complexity are calculated per window: repeatability and fraction of most frequent amino acid (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec005">Methods</xref>). The distribution of the pairs of values measured is displayed in a cartesian heatmap. Here we use as dataset the complete proteomes from several model organisms.</p>
      <p>We used the 4391 proteins of the bacteria <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> as input and calculated the low complexity triangle for its complete proteome (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0239154.g002">Fig 2A</xref></bold>). Their signal cloud (region where most of the windows are placed) is located at the bottom-right corner of the triangle. It means that, per window, a high number of residues would have to be mutated to obtain a perfect repeat (high x-axis values), and that amino acid proportions are close to random (low y-axis values). This result is in line with the reported low compositional bias of bacterial genomes <bold>[<xref rid="pone.0239154.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0239154.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]</bold>.</p>

      <p>The analysis of the amoeba <italic>Dictyostelium discoideum</italic> provides very different results. Its proteome is rich in repeats <bold>[<xref rid="pone.0239154.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]</bold>, showing a window frequency spread irradiating from the general unbiased bottom-right corner. Low x-axis values and/or high y-axis values represent low complexity regions of some sort. For example, the signal at y = 0.5, although weak, means that a part of the proteome is composed of direpeats, whereas the stronger y = 1 signal corresponds to homorepeat regions, also frequent in this proteome <bold>[<xref rid="pone.0239154.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]</bold>.</p>
      <p>Three distinct species, <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> and <italic>Homo sapiens</italic> have surprisingly similar low complexity triangles (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0239154.g002">Fig 2C–2E</xref></bold>). However, the proportion of repetitive regions (x &lt; = 3) is slightly higher in the proteome of the fruit fly and practically absent in the yeast proteome.</p>
      <p>The numerical comparison of the previous low complexity triangles was done by studying how many windows cluster in the bottom-right corner of each plot. We calculated this value for three overlapping coordinate regions (orange, green and red; see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec005">Methods</xref>), obtained from <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0239154.g002">Fig 2A–2E</xref></bold>. <italic>D</italic>. <italic>discoideum</italic> has the lower amount of windows in these three regions (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0239154.g002">Fig 2F</xref></bold>), and 12% of them are distributed in the plot outside the orange region, meaning more compositional bias and less globular regions. On the other hand, only 0.8% of the windows of <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> are outside the orange region, indicating very little low complexity content. Results for <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic>, <italic>D</italic>. <italic>melanogaster</italic> and <italic>H</italic>. <italic>sapiens</italic> are relatively similar, having 2.3%, 4.4%, and 3.2% of their windows outside the orange region, respectively.</p>

      <title>Regions in the low complexity triangle are associated to sequence features</title>
      <p>In general, as we have seen in the examples above, most proteins in proteomes are composed of globular regions. Their signature as a whole in the low complexity triangle is therefore mostly biased towards the bottom-right corner, where the globular regions are located. To show the power of the low complexity triangle to represent more diverse signatures of low complexity, we repeated the analysis done above with five different datasets: the complete SwissProt version 2019_11 and four datasets with protein regions corresponding to specific features annotated in SwissProt (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec005">Methods</xref>).</p>
      <p>The SwissProt database contains mainly globular proteins, therefore it could be taken as a proxy for a meta-proteome. We analyzed a complete SwissProt protein dataset and confirmed that their cloud signature (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0239154.g003">Fig 3A</xref></bold>) is mostly similar to that of just protein domains (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0239154.g003">Fig 3B</xref></bold>), plus weak signals for both direpeats (y = 0.5) and homorepeats (y = 1). Results for domain regions are exclusively limited to the bottom-right corner of the triangle, as expected, and are indeed confined to the orange region (99.3% of windows).</p>

      <p>Transmembrane regions are hydrophobic sequences that span across the cell membrane. Although they are structured, their amino acid composition is largely biased towards hydrophobic residues. Their low complexity triangle resembles the one from globular domains, as expected, but there is one major difference: many windows are clustered in the orange region but not in the green one, and similarly in the green region but outside the red region (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0239154.g003">Fig 3C</xref></bold>). Windows are distributed as 95.17%, 83.31% and 52.96% for transmembrane regions in the orange, green and red regions, respectively, comparatively lower than the 99.30%, 96.13% and 80.16% for domain regions. The reason for this contrast is that hydrophobic residues are more frequent in transmembrane regions <bold>[<xref rid="pone.0239154.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]</bold>, thus making these regions more compositionally biased, albeit not repeated, than other domains.</p>
      <p>A similar case is that of coiled coil regions. They are heptad repeats of hydrophobic (h) and charged (c) amino acid residues following the pattern <italic>hxxhcxc</italic>
<bold>[<xref rid="pone.0239154.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]</bold>. Their overall values in the low complexity triangle are highly comparable to the ones from transmembrane regions, although some of them have repeats (x &lt; = 3) (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0239154.g003">Fig 3D</xref></bold>). This does not necessarily have to be the case, as the repeated unit is the pattern of amino acid properties and not the amino acids themselves. The repeat signal is probably due to regions with repeats wrongly annotated as being coiled coils, even though we are limiting our study to SwissProt entries to minimize such annotation errors. One example is the annotated coiled coil region in protein DDB_G0281095 from <italic>D</italic>. <italic>discoideum</italic> (UniProt:Q54UG3, positions 329–521). This region is highly glutamine-rich (146 glutamine residues in the 193-amino acid region) and contains long glutamine homorepeats (up to 58 consecutive glutamines). Glutamine homorepeats can adopt helical structure but this is position and context dependent <bold>[<xref rid="pone.0239154.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]</bold>.</p>
      <p>In the last place we examined regions annotated as compositionally biased. In this case, there are windows occupying almost all of the possible places in the low complexity triangle (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0239154.g003">Fig 3E</xref></bold>), with a clear shift in the distribution of the windows to the outside of the three colored regions. Only 30.19% of the windows analyzed in this dataset are in the red region (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0239154.g003">Fig 3F</xref></bold>), and more than 31% of them populate coordinates outside the orange region. Signals for both direpeats (y = 0.5) and perfect homorepeats (y = 1) can also be distinguished.</p>
      <p>We complemented this study analyzing with the low complexity triangle three manually-curated datasets from globular proteins, proteins with low complexity regions, and intrinsically disordered regions (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0239154.s001">S1 Fig</xref></bold>). Values within the orange, green and red regions are highly similar between the set of globular proteins (98.19%, 94.52% and 78.27, respectively) and the domains obtained from SwissProt (99.30%, 96.13% and 80.16%; <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0239154.g001">Fig 1A</xref></bold>). The dataset of low complexity proteins yields the most sparse triangle, with 83.32%, 73.64% and 53.99% windows in the orange, green and red region, respectively. Even though disorder usually overlaps with low complexity, this is not always the case. As a result, windows analyzed from disorder regions are more scattered in the low complexity triangle than those from globular proteins, but less than pure low complexity regions.</p>

    <sec id="sec012">
      <title>Applying the low complexity triangle to extreme protein regions</title>
      <p>The low complexity triangle may also be applied to individual proteins or protein regions in them. Here we focus on three different examples covering the broad spectrum of signals the low complexity triangle can yield. We use specific regions from these proteins to show the signal clouds placed in the triangle associated directly to them, without any noise from the rest of the protein.</p>
      <p>First, we focus on the simplest case, the expected outcome when analyzing the low complexity of a protein domain. Human SMN1 (UniProt:Q16637; SMN_HUMAN) is a nuclear protein involved in the splicing of cellular pre-mRNAs with a central Tudor domain. This domain (at amino acid positions 91–151) is structurally characterized (PDB:1MHN) and is a strongly bent anti-parallel beta-sheet consisting of five beta-strands with a barrel-like fold <bold>[<xref rid="pone.0239154.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]</bold>. It is a globular domain that does not contain any repetitive element in its protein sequence, and thus the most frequent amino acid per window of length 20 is close to random (y &lt; = 0.2) and the minimum number of mutations to perfect repeats is close to the maximum (x &gt; = 9) (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0239154.g004">Fig 4A</xref></bold>). The bottom right corner of the low complexity triangle is populated as expected, an extreme result similar to the one obtained for the complete set of domains (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0239154.g004">Fig 4B</xref></bold>).</p>
      <fig id="pone.0239154.g004" orientation="portrait" position="float">

      </fig>
      <p>The alpha-1(VII) chain of the human collagen (UniProt:Q02388; CO7A1_HUMAN) is a structural constituent of the extracellular matrix. It is a long protein (2928 amino acids) with nine Fibronectin type III domains followed by a long triple helical region (positions 1254–2784). The latter is composed of a tripeptide repeating unit Gly-X-Y. When placed in the low complexity triangle, we see that results in the y-axis are mostly in the range 0.3–0.4 (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0239154.g004">Fig 4B</xref></bold>). This is given by the glycine in the first position of the repeating unit. As the second and the third positions are variable, the values in the x-axis depend on them. As a result, the signal cloud for this query region is flat but spread. Results for tandem repeats will accumulate in the central part of the triangle.</p>
      <p>Last we analyzed human ataxin-1 (UniProt:P54253; ATX1_HUMAN). It is a chromatin-binding factor mainly known and studied for being associated with human neurodegenerative disease spinocerebellar ataxia 1 (SCA1) <bold>[<xref rid="pone.0239154.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]</bold>. SCA1 is caused by the abnormal expansion of a polyglutamine (polyQ) region in positions 197–225, which leads to aggregation-induced neuronal toxicity. The wild-type polyQ contains 27 glutamines and two inserted histidine residues, [Q]<sub>12</sub>HQH[Q]<sub>14</sub>. To analyze this region with the low complexity triangle, we used window length = 10, as it is a relatively short region. The signal cloud is limited to the top-left corner of the triangle (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0239154.g004">Fig 4C</xref></bold>). Values in the x-axis vary from 0, when the window is all glutamines, to 2, when the histidine residues are in the window, both of which should be mutated to glutamines to achieve a perfect repeat.</p>
      <p>The repeatability of the previous examples is trivial. Globular domains do not usually contain repetitive regions, amino acid rich regions are compositionally biased, and homorepeats are repeats by definition. However, in many low complexity regions this is not the case. Either when facing a protein of unknown structure or to uncover degenerated tandem repeats, the low complexity assessment of a protein or protein region can be easily performed using the low complexity triangle.</p>

      <title>Using the LCT server</title>
      <p>We have implemented a web server, LCT (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://cbdm-01.zdv.uni-mainz.de/~munoz/lct/">http://cbdm-01.zdv.uni-mainz.de/~munoz/lct/</ext-link>), to host the code used in the analyses carried out in the previous section. We illustrate how the LCT server could be used to characterize low complexity in a query protein sequence. The human SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus) nucleocapsid protein N (UniProt:P59595; NCAP_CVHSA) is a 422 amino acid long protein with two regions of known structure flanking a region annotated as serine-rich (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0239154.g005">Fig 5A</xref></bold>). The LCT of the complete sequence suggests the existence of low complexity due to bias but without repeatability (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0239154.g005">Fig 5B</xref></bold>). Separate analyses of the protein in three regions consisting of the N-terminal domain, the middle part, and the dimerizing C-terminal domain reveal that the low complexity resides mostly in the middle region (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0239154.g005">Fig 5C</xref></bold>). This region is serine- and arginine-rich and was found to be responsible of the interaction of protein N with replicase subunit, nonstructural protein 3 (nsp3) in the related coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) <bold>[<xref rid="pone.0239154.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]</bold>.</p>

    <p>The low complexity triangle was described to visualize the types of low complexity present in protein sequences <bold>[<xref rid="pone.0239154.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</bold>. It takes into account two local sequence properties related to low complexity: The periodicity of the sequence and the fraction of the most frequent amino acid. The former is computed using a method called RES <bold>[<xref rid="pone.0239154.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]</bold> to calculate sequence periodicity in terms of minimum number of mutations to perfect repeats (MMPR).</p>
    <p>This visualization can be applied with, the fast and easy-to-use LCT server, which allows to analyze any given protein of interest with a customizable window length. A standalone version of the code is available to download to study a larger dataset or proteome (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0239154.s010">S8 File</xref></bold>).</p>
    <p>The low complexity triangle provides a quick and simple visual overview of the amount of low complexity in a protein, while indicating if this is including sequences with small repeats, which are often found in such regions. The presence of such sequences can aid in the interpretation of the structural and functional properties of proteins. In addition to the application of the low complexity triangle to whole proteins, this can be easily applied to regions in proteins as a means to locate various types of low complexity regions. Moreover, the application of the low complexity triangle to sets of proteins, allows identifying properties of low complexity regions specific to the set. Here we have shown that if a proteome is analyzed, a species’ usage of low complexity can be characterized; we suggest that it could as well be used to analyze other sets of proteins, for example those coded by differentially expressed genes in the study of an experiment following gene differential expression, or from a proteomics study.</p>
    <p>We believe this is a step in the right direction for a quick and straightforward analysis that has the potential to uncover and characterize low complexity content in proteomes and proteins, thus aiding in the characterization of protein function and structure.</p>

    <p>Assessing the low complexity of protein sequences via the low complexity triangle</p>
    <p>PLOS ONE</p>
    <p>Dear Dr. Mier,</p>
    <p>Thank you for submitting your manuscript to PLOS ONE. After careful consideration, we feel that it has merit but does not fully meet PLOS ONE’s publication criteria as it currently stands. Therefore, we invite you to submit a revised version of the manuscript that addresses the points raised during the review process.</p>
    <p>Please submit your revised manuscript by Jul 20 2020 11:59PM. If you will need more time than this to complete your revisions, please reply to this message or contact the journal office at <email>plosone@plos.org</email>. When you're ready to submit your revision, log on to <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.editorialmanager.com/pone/">https://www.editorialmanager.com/pone/</ext-link> and select the 'Submissions Needing Revision' folder to locate your manuscript file.</p>
    <p>Please include the following items when submitting your revised manuscript:</p>
    <p>
      <list list-type="bullet">
        <list-item>
          <p>A rebuttal letter that responds to each point raised by the academic editor and reviewer(s). You should upload this letter as a separate file labeled 'Response to Reviewers'.</p>
        </list-item>
        <list-item>
          <p>A marked-up copy of your manuscript that highlights changes made to the original version. You should upload this as a separate file labeled 'Revised Manuscript with Track Changes'.</p>
        </list-item>
        <list-item>
          <p>An unmarked version of your revised paper without tracked changes. You should upload this as a separate file labeled 'Manuscript'.</p>
        </list-item>
      </list>
    </p>
    <p>If you would like to make changes to your financial disclosure, please include your updated statement in your cover letter. Guidelines for resubmitting your figure files are available below the reviewer comments at the end of this letter.</p>
    <p>If applicable, we recommend that you deposit your laboratory protocols in protocols.io to enhance the reproducibility of your results. Protocols.io assigns your protocol its own identifier (DOI) so that it can be cited independently in the future. For instructions see: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/submission-guidelines#loc-laboratory-protocols">http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/submission-guidelines#loc-laboratory-protocols</ext-link></p>
    <p>We look forward to receiving your revised manuscript.</p>

    <p>Reviewer #1: This is an interesting and important study that adds significantly to the field and will have a noticeable impact. The manuscript is well-written and concise. It adds significantly to the field and will have a noticeable impact. The developed tool will be a useful addition to the repertoire of modern computational biology. However, there are several.</p>
    <p>1) I was surprised by not finding any references to the work conducted by Dr. Kajava, who developed several databases of protein repeats (e.g., RepeatsDB: a database of tandem repeat protein structures; PRDB: Protein Repeat DataBase) and several computational tools for ab initio identification of the tandem repeats (e.g., T-REKS: Tandem REpeats in sequences with a K-meanS based algorithm; TAPO: A combined method for the identification of tandem repeats in protein structures; Tally: a scoring tool for boundary determination between repetitive and non-repetitive protein sequences; and Tally-2.0: upgraded validator of tandem repeat detection in protein sequences).</p>
    <p>2) A brief discussion should be added of the fact that the presence of protein repeats is often correlated with the presence of intrinsic disorder.</p>
    <p>3) The authors should clearly define the meaning of the “Low complexity triangle”. A succinct explanation should be provided of this type of diagram and why it is called a triangle.</p>
    <p>Reviewer #2: The manuscript details a new method for assessing the low complexity regions via the low complexity triangle.</p>
    <p>It describes the method based on two metrics - repeatability and fraction of the most frequent amino acid in proteins</p>
    <p>divided into sliding windows of specific length. Proposed method is applied on five different proteomes and proteins grouped according different features. Manuscript describes tool developed for presentation of low complexity triangle based on protein repeatability.</p>
    <p>The manuscript does appear to have some scientific merit, although it is</p>
    <p>hard to discern. It presents idea of using developed tool for assess which (part of) protein can be low complexity, but miss detail description of method. Also, the main part of manuscript (Results &amp; discussion) in some parts seem a bit confusing. Comparisons of results obtained with proposed method and other related tools is missing.</p>
    <p>The following are list of errors that need to be addressed before a full conclusion can be made:</p>
    <p>1) Because the main part of assessing low complexity regions (LCR) is low complexity triangle and LCT tool, detail description of other available tools for location of LCR is necessary to include in manuscript: what are differences, capabilities, etc. This is cover by only one sentence in the manuscript. It will be better to make separate section and list some tools and their characteristics. This can be used in comparison of results obtained by proposed LCT server and some other tools - it is necessary to show that new method proposed by authors gives comparable or better results (than results obtained with already existing tools and methods).</p>
    <p>2) Section 2. Methods include very few sentences about method used for assessing of protein low complexity. On the other side, LCT server description is put on section Results, which is inappropriate. LCT server can not be RESULT of "assessing the low complexity...." - topic mentioned int the manuscript title. If authors describe method, it is normally that description of server that implement/used for visualization of method results is put together.</p>
    <p>3) In current version of manuscript larger part of section 2 is occupied with text related to data used in examples. It t is usually that section title will be "Material and methods" or similar.</p>
    <p>Data retrieved from UniProtKB should be more precisely characterized. For example, there are many Escherichia coli genomes. Which one was used (K12 - which strain, O127H6, CFT073,....? It is necessary to specify organism identification. Also, it is necessary to include somewhere information about positional annotations of proteins related to the extracted groups (domains, transmembrane regions, ....). This is important if reader wants to repeat experiment and possibly compare results with results obtained from some other tool/method.</p>
    <p>4) Method must be described in more detail. For example:</p>
    <p>- Authors mentioned that divided windows are overlapped, but did not mentioned step in overlapping. Are windows just overlap without sliding or window of selected length slide across sequence?</p>
    <p>- If input file includes more than one protein how calculation looks like? Does final results represent some kind average values of single proteins (related to overlapping or sliding windows) or all sequence are concatenated to big one which act as an input?</p>
    <p>If user put the whole protein in one file (proteins placed consecutively one by one in fasta format) on which way such file is processed?</p>
    <p>- Using different window length produce different results. What are differences among these results? Is there any benefit if default length is 20? And, why maximal length is restricted to 30?</p>
    <p>5) In Method section, part 2.2 Low complexity assessment, last sentence in the paragraph:</p>
    <p>"To ease the comparison between the distribution of the windows’ results in the different low complexity triangles, we draw three overlapping boxes in different colors in coordinates: (x &gt; 8, y &lt; 0.3), in red; (x &gt; 7, y &lt; 0.35), in green; and (x &gt; 6, y &lt;0.4), in orange."</p>
    <p>There is not explanation why why exactly those boundaries are used. Also, on the figures orange, green and red lines are draw on different coordinates: red - (x&gt;8.5, y&gt;2.75), green (x&gt;7.5, y&gt;3.25) and orange (x&gt;6.5, y&gt;3.75)?!</p>
    <p>6) About LCT server: authors offer possibility for download offline version, which is commendable. But, missing file with short description of package and list of prerequisites for installations (for example, on installation in Linux it is necessary to install biopython, ggplot, etc.)</p>
    <p>On LCT server exists in-advance unknown/unpublished restriction. For example, if protein length is 21, default length is 20, server refused input with error message "The query sequence needs to be at least 5 amino acids longer than the selected window length. Try again." .</p>
    <p>This message appear even if such protein exists in file together with bunch of other proteins (for example, for proteome taken as input)</p>
    <p>All such restriction should be documented.</p>
    <p>7) Section "Results &amp; Discussion" is confusing in some parts. The principle of applying method on complete proteome if results are presented with average values is for discussion because each proteome consists of proteins with (very) different length and characteristics. What kind of normalization is taken into account? Does larger proteins influence in final results with higher weight? Or does the proteins with higher degree of low complexity "masks" proteins with lower level? Etc...</p>
    <p>&gt; "The numerical comparison of the previous low complexity triangles was done by studying how many windows cluster in the bottom-right corner of each plot."</p>
    <p>It can not be seen precisely from the figures. LCT web server produce figures with numerical values (percent of windows) which does not exists on figures in the manuscript (why?). Missing numerical numbers prevent checking numbers presented in the manuscript.</p>
    <p>From sentence "On the other hand, 99% of the windows of E. coli are within the orange region and therefore are mostly globular."</p>
    <p>one can conclude that if large percent of widows fall into orange region than this protein (proteomes, ...) is globular. But from figure 2.d (coiled coils) visually it can be seen that most of windows also fall into orange region, but coiled coil proteins not preferred to be globular.</p>
    <p>Also, material is taken from UniProtKb which contains mainly globular proteins(as mentioned in manuscript), so discussion that method discovered that they are mainly globular is strange.</p>
    <p>As an example (in proof-of-concept) one protein or group of proteins) which are non-globular should be taken, and then compared results of globular/non-globular groups (orange, green, red lines, etc.). Also and more important it is necessary to take some proteins that can not be characterized as low complexity and analyze results and graphics. The manuscript proposed method for assessing low complexity proteins, so it is normal to show how method works on both low complexity proteins and opposite group.</p>
    <p>8) Comparison of results obtained with some other tools that locate LCR should be included.</p>
    <p>9) Conclusion should include concrete sentences about possible use of this method and site - who, why and what are the advantages of using this method for locating LCR</p>

    <p>###############</p>
    <p>Reviewer #2:</p>
    <p>The manuscript details a new method for assessing the low complexity regions via the low complexity triangle. It describes the method based on two metrics - repeatability and fraction of the most frequent amino acid in proteins divided into sliding windows of specific length. Proposed method is applied on five different proteomes and proteins grouped according different features. Manuscript describes tool developed for presentation of low complexity triangle based on protein repeatabilty. The manuscript does appear to have some scientific merit, although it is hard to discern. It presents idea of using developed tool for assess which (part of) protein can be low complexity, but miss detail description of method. Also, the main part of manuscript (Results &amp; discussion) in some parts seem a bit confusing. Comparisons of results obtained with proposed method and other related tools is missing. The following are list of errors that need to be addressed before a full conclusion can be made:</p>
    <p>1) Because the main part of assessing low complexity regions (LCR) is low complexity triangle and LCT tool, detail description of other available tools for location of LCR is necessary to include in manuscript: what are differences, capabilities, etc. This is cover by only one sentence in the manuscript. It will be better to make separate section and list some tools and their characteristics. This can be used in comparison of results obtained by proposed LCT server and some other tools - it is necessary to show that new method proposed by authors gives comparable or better results (than results obtained with already existing tools and methods).</p>
    <p>We have included an additional analysis in Results section “LCT server”. Now we also analyze the NCAP_CVHSA protein with the PlaToLoCo webserver, which allows us to compare the results from the LCT algorithm to those from many other tools for finding low complexity regions (SEG, CAST, fLPS, SIMPLE and GBSC).</p>
    <p>2) Section 2. Methods include very few sentences about method used for assessing of protein low complexity. </p>
    <p>We have included further explanations on RES in the revised manuscript, Methods section “Low complexity assessment”.</p>
    <p>*) On the other side, LCT server description is put on section Results, which is inappropriate. LCT server can not be RESULT of "assessing the low complexity...." - topic mentioned int the manuscript title. If authors describe method, it is normally that description of server that implement/used for visualization of method results is put together.</p>
    <p>Following the suggestion of the reviewer, we have relocated the LCR server explanation to a new Methods section “LCR server”. </p>
    <p>3) In current version of manuscript larger part of section 2 is occupied with text related to data used in examples. It t is usually that section title will be "Material and methods" or similar.</p>
    <p>We believe that this text, 1-2 sentences per dataset explaining its features, is important to understand the results obtained in the analysis and should remain in the Results section.</p>
    <p>*) Data retrieved from UniProtKB should be more precisely characterized. For example, there are many Escherichia coli genomes. Which one was used (K12 - which strain, O127H6, CFT073,....? It is necessary to specify organism identification. Also, it is necessary to include somewhere information about positional annotations of proteins related to the extracted groups (domains, transmembrane regions, ....). This is important if reader wants to repeat experiment and possibly compare results with results obtained from some other tool/method.</p>
    <p>To unequivocally identify the species used in the analysis, the taxonomic identifier of each of them was added to its description in Methods section “Data retrieval”.</p>
    <p>We also included as Supplementary Files 1-4 the set of domains, transmembrane, coiled coil and compositionally biased regions parsed out from the SwissProt release 2019_11 used in the analysis. </p>
    <p>4) Method must be described in more detail. For example:</p>
    <p>- Authors mentioned that divided windows are overlapped, but did not mentioned step in overlapping. Are windows just overlap without sliding or window of selected length slide across sequence?</p>
    <p>- If input file includes more than one protein how calculation looks like? Does final results represent some kind average values of single proteins (related to overlapping or sliding windows) or all sequence are concatenated to big one which act as an input?</p>
    <p>If user put the whole protein in one file (proteins placed consecutively one by one in fasta format) on which way such file is processed?</p>
    <p>We have extended the Methods section “Low complexity assessment” to include further clarification on all aspects suggested by the reviewer.</p>
    <p>- Using different window length produce different results. What are differences among these results? Is there any benefit if default length is 20? And, why maximal length is restricted to 30?</p>
    <p>This point is already discussed in the manuscript, in Methods section “LCT server”. The text reads: “The default window length (WL) is 20 amino acids, but the user can modify it to 10, 15, 25 or 30 amino acids. Smaller values of the window length would result in a shortened triangle’s grid (i.e. for WL = 10, MMPR = [0-5]), and thus the resolution of the results would be poorer, but would allow the unequivocal identification of shorter fragments with repeats (top-left corner in the triangle). On the other hand, larger values of the window length would be useful to study the general complexity of a sequence and to uncover long tandem repeats, which would be placed closer to the bottom-left corner in the low complexity triangle.”</p>
    <p>5) In Method section, part 2.2 Low complexity assessment, last sentence in the paragraph:</p>
    <p>"To ease the comparison between the distribution of the windows’ results in the different low complexity triangles, we draw three overlapping boxes in different colors in coordinates: (x &gt; 8, y &lt; 0.3), in red; (x &gt; 7, y &lt; 0.35), in green; and (x &gt; 6, y &lt;0.4), in orange.". There is not explanation why why exactly those boundaries are used. Also, on the figures orange, green and red lines are draw on different coordinates: red - (x&gt;8.5, y&gt;2.75), green (x&gt;7.5, y&gt;3.25) and orange (x&gt;6.5, y&gt;3.75)?!</p>
    <p>We have clarified this description accordingly in the Methods section of the manuscript as follows: “we define three overlapping regions outlined with different colors: (x &gt; 8.5, y &lt; 0.275), in red; (x &gt; 7.5, y &lt; 0.325), in green; and (x &gt; 6.5, y &lt; 0.375), in orange.” We also changed all uses of the word “box” to “region”.</p>
    <p>6) About LCT server: authors offer possibility for download offline version, which is commendable. But, missing file with short description of package and list of prerequisites for installations (for example, on installation in Linux it is necessary to install biopython, ggplot, etc.).</p>
    <p>On LCT server exists in-advance unknown/unpublished restriction. For example, if protein length is 21, default length is 20, server refused input with error message "The query sequence needs to be at least 5 amino acids longer than the selected window length. Try again.". This message appear even if such protein exists in file together with bunch of other proteins (for example, for proteome taken as input).</p>
    <p>All such restriction should be documented.</p>
    <p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out both issues. We have improved the already available README file within the downloadable package with information about: Description, Dependencies, Usage, Example, Output. Also, the reviewer is completely right in that input restrictions in the server were not properly documented in the manuscript. We have included them both in the revised manuscript (Methods section “LCT server”) and in the server.</p>
    <p>7) Section "Results &amp; Discussion" is confusing in some parts. The principle of applying method on complete proteome if results are presented with average values is for discussion because each proteome consists of proteins with (very) different length and characteristics. What kind of normalization is taken into account? Does larger proteins influence in final results with higher weight? Or does the proteins with higher degree of low complexity "masks" proteins with lower level? Etc…</p>
    <p>Per protein, we divide it in overlapping windows of the given window length. This is done for all proteins in a proteome or dataset. Then, for each window (irrespective of its protein of origin) we calculate parameters x (minimum number of mutations to perfect repeats) and y (fraction of the most frequent amino acid in the window). With this procedure we can calculate the total amount of windows in the dataset that occupies each coordinate in the low complexity triangle. We have included a clarification on this matter in Methods section “Low complexity assessment”.</p>
    <p>*) "The numerical comparison of the previous low complexity triangles was done by studying how many windows cluster in the bottom-right corner of each plot.". It can not be seen precisely from the figures. LCT web server produce figures with numerical values (percent of windows) which does not exists on figures in the manuscript (why?). Missing numerical numbers prevent checking numbers presented in the manuscript.</p>
    <p>Originally, we left the numbers out of the figures because they are too small to be read; we thought the color code would be enough. The revised Figures 2 and 3 now contain these numbers. </p>
    <p>*) From sentence "On the other hand, 99% of the windows of E. coli are within the orange region and therefore are mostly globular.", one can conclude that if large percent of widows fall into orange region than this protein (proteomes, ...) is globular. But from figure 2.d (coiled coils) visually it can be seen that most of windows also fall into orange region, but coiled coil proteins not preferred to be globular.</p>
    <p>We have modified the sentence that now reads “On the other hand, only 0.8% of the windows of E. coli are outside the orange region, indicating very little low complexity content”.</p>
    <p>*) Also, material is taken from UniProtKb which contains mainly globular proteins (as mentioned in manuscript), so discussion that method discovered that they are mainly globular is strange.</p>
    <p>In Results section “Regions in the low complexity...” we use SwissProt for all analysis; testing SwissProt as a whole as a first step acts as a dataset check. In the manuscript we state this as “We analyzed a complete SwissProt protein dataset and confirmed that their cloud signature (Fig 3a) is mostly similar to that of just protein domains...”. It is not a discussion rather than a confirmation, before parsing out datasets for the different sequence features. Then with the different panels in Figure 3 we show that SwissProt does not only contain globular regions.</p>
    <p>*) As an example (in proof-of-concept) one protein or group of proteins) which are non-globular should be taken, and then compared results of globular/non-globular groups (orange, green, red lines, etc.). Also and more important it is necessary to take some proteins that can not be characterized as low complexity and analyze results and graphics. The manuscript proposed method for assessing low complexity proteins, so it is normal to show how method works on both low complexity proteins and opposite group.</p>
    <p>Following the recommendation of the reviewer, we have included an additional analysis of three manually-curated protein datasets: globular proteins, low complexity proteins, and disordered regions. Results are added in section “Regions in the low complexity triangle are associated to sequence features”, and new supplementary files (S5-S7_File) and figure (S1_Figure) have been included in the revised manuscript.</p>
    <p>8) Comparison of results obtained with some other tools that locate LCR should be included.</p>
    <p>See reply to comment #1.</p>
    <p>9) Conclusion should include concrete sentences about possible use of this method and site - who, why and what are the advantages of using this method for locating LCR</p>
    <p>We have expanded the section Conclusions to address the request of the reviewer.</p>

    <p>
      <bold>Comments to the Author</bold>
    </p>
    <p>1. If the authors have adequately addressed your comments raised in a previous round of review and you feel that this manuscript is now acceptable for publication, you may indicate that here to bypass the “Comments to the Author” section, enter your conflict of interest statement in the “Confidential to Editor” section, and submit your "Accept" recommendation.</p>
    <p>Reviewer #1: All comments have been addressed</p>
    <p>Reviewer #2: All comments have been addressed</p>
    <p>**********</p>
    <p>2. Is the manuscript technically sound, and do the data support the conclusions?</p>
    <p>The manuscript must describe a technically sound piece of scientific research with data that supports the conclusions. Experiments must have been conducted rigorously, with appropriate controls, replication, and sample sizes. The conclusions must be drawn appropriately based on the data presented. </p>
    <p>Reviewer #1: Yes</p>
    <p>Reviewer #2: Yes</p>
    <p>**********</p>
    <p>3. Has the statistical analysis been performed appropriately and rigorously? </p>
    <p>Reviewer #1: Yes</p>
    <p>Reviewer #2: N/A</p>
    <p>**********</p>
    <p>4. Have the authors made all data underlying the findings in their manuscript fully available?</p>
    <p>The <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.plosone.org/static/policies.action#sharing">PLOS Data policy</ext-link> requires authors to make all data underlying the findings described in their manuscript fully available without restriction, with rare exception (please refer to the Data Availability Statement in the manuscript PDF file). The data should be provided as part of the manuscript or its supporting information, or deposited to a public repository. For example, in addition to summary statistics, the data points behind means, medians and variance measures should be available. If there are restrictions on publicly sharing data—e.g. participant privacy or use of data from a third party—those must be specified.</p>
    <p>Reviewer #1: Yes</p>
    <p>Reviewer #2: Yes</p>
    <p>**********</p>
    <p>5. Is the manuscript presented in an intelligible fashion and written in standard English?</p>
    <p>PLOS ONE does not copyedit accepted manuscripts, so the language in submitted articles must be clear, correct, and unambiguous. Any typographical or grammatical errors should be corrected at revision, so please note any specific errors here.</p>
    <p>Reviewer #1: Yes</p>
    <p>Reviewer #2: Yes</p>
    <p>**********</p>
    <p>6. Review Comments to the Author</p>
    <p>Please use the space provided to explain your answers to the questions above. You may also include additional comments for the author, including concerns about dual publication, research ethics, or publication ethics. (Please upload your review as an attachment if it exceeds 20,000 characters)</p>
    <p>Reviewer #1: In my view, all issues pointed by the reviewers were adequately addressed and the manuscript was revised accordingly.</p>
    <p>Reviewer #2: Authors respond to all reviewer's comments. Comment on sentence:</p>
    <p>"Originally, we left the numbers out of the figures because they are too small to be read; we thought the color code would be enough. The revised Figures 2 and 3 now contain these numbers."</p>
    <p>Suggestion is to implement possibility to save figures generated on server in some other format (now it is possible to save it in .png).</p>
    <p>Although current format can also be zoomed to clear read numbers, it will be better (also for possible future users) to implement save option to allow user to save figure in some other format (for example jpg, eps, ..) which is more convenient for for various purposes.</p>
    <p>**********</p>
    <p>7. PLOS authors have the option to publish the peer review history of their article (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/editorial-and-peer-review-process#loc-peer-review-history">what does this mean?</ext-link>). If published, this will include your full peer review and any attached files.</p>
    <p>If you choose “no”, your identity will remain anonymous but your review may still be made public.</p>
