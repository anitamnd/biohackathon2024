      <title>Summary</title>
      <p>Targeted proteomics is widely utilized in clinical proteomics; however, researchers often devote substantial time to manual data interpretation, which hinders the transferability, reproducibility, and scalability of this approach. We introduce DeepMRM, a software package based on deep learning algorithms for object detection developed to minimize manual intervention in targeted proteomics data analysis. DeepMRM was evaluated on internal and public datasets, demonstrating superior accuracy compared with the community standard tool Skyline. To promote widespread adoption, we have incorporated a stand-alone graphical user interface for DeepMRM and integrated its algorithm into the Skyline software package as an external tool.</p>

      <title>Motivation</title>
      <p>In clinical proteomics, targeted proteomics approaches like multiple-reaction monitoring (MRM) or parallel-reaction monitoring (PRM) are widely used, but their application is often hampered by labor-intensive and error-prone manual data interpretation. Existing computational methods, while helpful, often demand a substantial degree of manual intervention or decoy-transition approaches, constraining the throughput and efficiency of clinical proteomics assays. To address these challenges, we developed DeepMRM, a targeted proteomics data interpretation package that facilitates high-throughput analysis and enhances the reproducibility and scalability of targeted proteomics in clinical settings.</p>

    <title>Introduction</title>
    <p id="p0050">In clinical proteomics laboratories, targeted proteomics approaches such as multiple-reaction monitoring (MRM; also known as selected-reaction monitoring [SRM]) or parallel-reaction monitoring (PRM) are widely employed due to their high sensitivity and reproducibility.<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref> However, researchers often devote substantial time to manual peak selection, interference identification, and peak area adjustments to interpret targeted proteomics data.<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref> This step is prone to human error and may result in inconsistent outcomes due to subjective evaluations. The reliance on manual inspection is a major barrier to the transferability, reproducibility, and scalability of targeted proteomics in clinical applications.</p>
    <p id="p0055">Numerous computational methods have been developed to address these challenges. Skyline, the most widely used open-source software for targeted quantitative proteomics, offers a graphical user interface (GUI) with a suite of tools for peak picking, peak integration, and quantitative analysis of the results.<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> For automated absolute quantification, an external calibration curve method was developed.<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref> For quality assessment and control, a decoy-transition approach and machine learning models have been implemented.<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> Deep learning algorithms have recently been applied to the peak detection problem and have demonstrated a substantial improvement in accuracy compared with conventional methods.<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> However, existing approaches still necessitate substantial manual intervention or reliance on a decoy-transition approach,<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref> which ultimately constrains the assay’s throughput.</p>
    <p id="p0060">We introduce DeepMRM, a targeted proteomics data interpretation package leveraging deep learning algorithms for object detection specifically designed to substantially reduce the manual inspection burden, even for noisy and complex data (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). By reframing the challenge of finding peaks for targeted peptides as an object detection task, DeepMRM detects instances of peak groups within a set of 1D chromatograms, akin to how traditional object detection models identify object instances of a specific class within a 2D image. DeepMRM accepts transition chromatograms of varying lengths and numbers as input, generating chromatographic peaks of targeted peptides, along with their abundances and confidence scores. Detection results and transition chromatograms are visualized in a GUI, enabling users to review and adjust the results as needed rapidly. The performance of DeepMRM was benchmarked against Skyline and validated using internal and public datasets generated by different acquisition methods, such as MRM, PRM, or data-independent acquisition (DIA) experiments. DeepMRM facilitates high-throughput analysis of targeted proteomics by automated quantification and quality control without requiring decoy transitions.<fig id="fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>DeepMRM workflow for detecting peak groups of targeted peptides</p><p>Given the target list and MRM/PRM/DIA data as input, transition chromatograms of both heavy and light peptides are fed into the model as 2-channel heatmap images. Multiscale 1D feature maps are extracted and processed by two subnetworks: a classifier for determining whether candidate peak groups are present and a regressor for detecting the boundary of candidate peak groups. Detected peak groups are then examined by a CNN-based transition classification model to select transitions unaffected by interference or noise. The abundances of target peptides are estimated based on peak areas of heavy and light peptides.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gr1"/></fig></p>

      <title>Overview of DeepMRM</title>
      <p id="p0065">DeepMRM is a robust and highly accurate peak detection model designed for interpreting targeted proteomics data, complemented with a user interface for visualizing detection results. DeepMRM takes MRM, PRM, or DIA data and a target list as input, generating peaks corresponding to targeted peptides, their abundances, and confidence scores. The workflow consists of four steps (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>; see <xref rid="sec4" ref-type="sec">STAR Methods</xref>). First, for each targeted peptide, transition chromatograms of both heavy (stable isotope labeled [SIL]) and light (endogenous) peptides are extracted and converted into 2-channel heatmap images. Second, a deep learning-based peak detection model extracts 1D feature maps at various scales and identifies peak group candidates. Third, another convolutional neural network (CNN)-based transition classification model examines individual pairs of heavy and light transitions in the detected peak groups. Transitions unaffected by interference or noise are selected for calculating the abundances (peak areas) of target peptides. Lastly, quantification results are visualized alongside transition chromatograms in a GUI, allowing users to swiftly examine candidate peak groups and transitions selected for quantification and to make adjustments to their boundaries if necessary (<xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S1</xref>).</p>
      <p id="p0070">DeepMRM comprises two neural network models: a peak detection model for detecting peak groups and a transition classification model for selecting interference- and noise-free transitions. The peak detection model features a modified architecture of RetinaNet,<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref> a popular neural network model for object detection. DeepMRM can accept transition chromatograms of any length and number as input as a fully convolutional network. For the backbone convolutional architecture, we modified ResNet-18 to better learn relationships between transitions of the same peptide, as well as heavy and light peptides (see <xref rid="sec4" ref-type="sec">STAR Methods</xref>). Additionally, to improve model generalization across different target peptides and experimental settings unexplored during training, data augmentation schemes such as resizing, cropping, retention time shifting, and intensity jittering were incorporated during training. The transition classification model employs the same backbone architecture with different kernel sizes.</p>
      <p id="p0075">To train and evaluate DeepMRM, we used liquid chromatography (LC)-MRM-mass spectrometry (MS) data derived from tumor tissues of 66 patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC)<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref> (see <xref rid="sec4" ref-type="sec">STAR Methods</xref>). The MRM assay targeted 153 endogenous peptides and their heavy SIL peptides with three transitions each. Human experts examined the data using Skyline<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> and manually adjusted the targeted peptides’ peak boundaries. Additionally, peak quality was assessed using evaluation criteria such as equal retention time between heavy and light peptides, peak shape, intensity ratio consistency across transitions, and removal of transitions with interferences. A total of 30,294 peak groups were annotated, with 27,432 peak groups identified with peak boundaries and 19,230 peak groups deemed quantifiable.</p>

    <sec id="sec2.2">
      <title>DeepMRM showed better quantification accuracy compared with Skyline</title>
      <p id="p0080">We first evaluated DeepMRM’s quantification performance using a public MRM dataset consisting of two dilution series<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref> (<xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S1</xref>; see <xref rid="sec4" ref-type="sec">STAR Methods</xref>) and compared it with Skyline. In this dataset, heavy peptide abundances ranged from 0.1 to 100 fmol, while light peptide abundances remained constant. Absolute quantification was accomplished using the external calibration curve method as described in the original paper.<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref> We evaluated the linear relationship between known and measured abundances of heavy peptides using Pearson’s correlation coefficient (PCC) and Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient (SPC). Additionally, we calculated the mean arctangent absolute percentage error (MAAPE).<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref> Quantification results of Skyline reported in the previous benchmark test<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref> were analyzed in two scenarios: original results (denoted as Skyline default) and results filtered by the mProphet<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref> scoring model with a false discovery rate of 5% (denoted as Skyline FDR 5%) based on decoy transitions. Each technical replicate was treated as an independent sample in this test, and the quantification values for the same peptide in technical replicates were considered separate observations.</p>
      <p id="p0085">DeepMRM demonstrated higher quantification accuracy in detecting quantifiable peak groups compared with both Skyline default and Skyline 5% FDR (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). Although Skyline default reported the highest number of peak groups, it lacked quality control, resulting in the lowest correlation coefficients and highest MAAPE values. Skyline 5% FDR with the mProphet model improved quantification accuracy by filtering out 25% of results in the noisy dataset but did not filter any results in the complex background dataset, where a relatively small number of peak groups were considered. DeepMRM detected 85%–90% of peak groups for targeted peptides in both datasets and exhibited higher correlation coefficients and lower MAAPE values in quantification results compared with Skyline default and Skyline 5% FDR (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2</xref>D and 2H). Upon visual inspection of the quantification results, we observed that DeepMRM outperformed other methods in accurately determining peak boundaries in noisy examples and effectively filtering out non-quantifiable transitions or peak groups from quantification (<xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S3</xref>).<fig id="fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Comparison of DeepMRM and Skyline with or without mProphet</p><p>Relative quantification and distribution of the abundance of heavy peptides for (A–D) noisy dataset and (E–H) complex background dataset.

      <title>DeepMRM showed robust performance across MRM, PRM, and DIA data</title>
      <p id="p0090">We evaluated DeepMRM on a hold-out test set of MRM data from PDAC samples (PDAC-MRM) and three external datasets: an MRM dataset used in an epithelial ovarian cancer study (EOC-MRM)<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref> and PRM and DIA datasets employed to profile phosphosignaling responses (P100-PRM and P100-DIA)<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref> (<xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S1</xref>; see <xref rid="sec4" ref-type="sec">STAR Methods</xref>). In this test, we calculated recall (RC) and average precision (AP), which are conventional metrics used in the object detection task.<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20</sup></xref> A detected peak group is considered a true positive only if it has an Intersection over Union (IoU) greater than a certain threshold with the manually annotated peak group (i.e., ground truth). Since chromatogram peaks often have long tails, which may result in large variations in determining peak endpoints, and these variations do not substantially impact the peak area, we opted for a less stringent IoU threshold of 0.3 rather than 0.5, a typical threshold in object detection studies. RC was calculated for the top 1 and 3 candidates per heatmap image (RC<sub>1</sub> and RC<sub>3</sub>). Also, to validate the quality of true positive peak groups, we evaluated PCC, SPC, and MAAPE between the light/heavy ratios obtained by manual annotation and those obtained by DeepMRM.</p>
      <p id="p0095">DeepMRM exhibited an AP of 98%–99% and an RC of 97%–99% (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3</xref>A and <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2</xref>; <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S2</xref>). The light/heavy ratios estimated by peaks detected by DeepMRM displayed correlation coefficients of 0.96–0.99 when compared with manually annotated peaks (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>B). MAAPE was in the range of 5%–11%. The relatively high MAAPE observed in P110-DIA data was mainly due to many peak groups with light/heavy ratios close to zero. In particular, more transitions were considered in DIA data compared with MRM data, which led to relatively larger variations in quantification results depending on transition selection. If these low-ratio peak groups are excluded (e.g., &lt;0.05), the MAAPE decreased to 0.07.<fig id="fig3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>DeepMRM performances on MRM, PRM, and DIA datasets</p><p>(A and B) (A) Average precision (AP) and recall (RC) scores for MRM, PRM, and DIA datasets and (B) scatterplot comparing the results of light/heavy ratios calculated by peaks manually annotated and those by peaks detected by DeepMRM.

      <title>Windows desktop application and integration into Skyline</title>
      <p id="p0105">DeepMRM is packaged as a Windows desktop application, streamlining the detection task and visualization of results. The GUI in the desktop application enables users to examine detection results and input transition chromatograms swiftly. Additionally, it allows for loading multiple samples together, simplifying the comparison of results for a target peptide. The desktop application supports the community standard format for MS data (mzML<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref>) and proprietary formats like Thermo RAW and Sciex WIFF. In addition to the standalone desktop software, we have integrated the DeepMRM algorithm into the Skyline software package as an external tool.</p>
      <p id="p0110">The running time of DeepMRM (excluding time for chromatogram extraction) is a few seconds (&lt;10 s) per sample on a Windows computer with a 3.8 GHz CPU (AMD Ryzen) and 32 GB memory (<xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S4</xref>). Although using a GPU can further decrease the running time for data with a high number of transitions and longer chromatogram lengths (e.g., PRM or DIA data), the difference is not substantial in practice.</p>

    <title>Discussion</title>
    <p id="p0115">DeepMRM is a robust and highly accurate peak detection model for interpreting targeted proteomics data featuring a user interface for visualizing detection results. Designed to minimize human intervention in data interpretation, DeepMRM accepts targeted MS data and a target list as input and provides quantification results and confidence scores. Also, the GUI enables users to swiftly examine the results and make necessary corrections. We demonstrated that DeepMRM outperformed the community standard tool Skyline in quantification accuracy and exhibited robust accuracy across MRM, PRM, and DIA datasets. Importantly, DeepMRM does not require decoy transitions, which can limit assay throughput. With automated quantification and quality control, we anticipate that DeepMRM will facilitate high-throughput analysis of targeted proteomics.</p>
    <sec id="sec3.1">
      <title>Limitations of study</title>
      <p id="p0120">To enhance the applicability and accuracy of DeepMRM, we have planned several improvements. First, DeepMRM currently requires stable isotope-labeled peptides to quantify target peptides. We aim to expand the model to enable label-free quantification without heavy peptides. Second, isotopic peak cluster patterns in high-resolution PRM/DIA data are not currently utilized. We anticipate that incorporating the learning and utilization of these patterns will improve detection accuracy. Finally, DeepMRM has been designed and trained for targeted proteomics data interpretation. We are working on adapting DeepMRM to identify peptides in untargeted DIA data without prior transition information on targeted peptides. These developments will enhance the versatility of DeepMRM for various proteomics studies.</p>

          <p id="p0185">Given the input data, which includes the LC-MS data and the target list, DeepMRM begins by extracting transition chromatograms for targeted precursor ions and subsequently transforms them into heatmap images with two channels. The entire transition chromatograms for targeted peptides are extracted unless reference retention times with time windows are provided. Linear interpolation is applied to all transition chromatograms, ensuring they share the same length and a scanning interval of 0.5 s. All the chromatograms are concatenated, with the horizontal and vertical axes representing the transition index and retention time, respectively. Consequently, two concatenated matrices (i.e., a two-channel heatmap image) are generated: one channel for light transition chromatograms and another for heavy transition chromatograms. The dimensions of heatmap images correspond to [2, number of transitions, length of chromatograms]. Lastly, as part of the preprocessing step, each transition pair is scaled from 0 to 1.</p>

The first sub-network classifies the presence of peak groups on the extracted features; the second sub-network performs peak boundary regression.</p>
            <p id="p0200">We chose ResNet18 as the backbone network and modified it to accommodate the peak detection problem. First, the kernel size of conv1 is changed from 7x7 to 1x7, and the stride and padding sizes are adjusted accordingly. In the first convolutional layer, grouped convolutions are applied so that the heavy and light channels are convolved separately. Before the first residual block, an adaptive average pooling layer is inserted such that the height of the feature map becomes one. The kernel and padding sizes in the subsequent residual blocks are adjusted to 1x3 and 0x1, respectively. As a result, all the feature maps generated by the backbone are one-dimensional vectors.</p>
            <p id="p0205">Both sub-networks also employ convolutional layers with a kernel size of 1x3 and a padding size of 0x1. Since the regressor needs to predict only two points for a peak boundary rather than four points for a bounding box, the final output channel size is altered to twice the number of anchors. The anchors are generated with a single scale for feature level. The classifier subnetwork is configured for a binary classification problem: {background versus peak group}.</p>

            <title>Transition classification model</title>
            <p id="p0210">A CNN-based classification model is developed to select transitions unaffected by interference or noise from the detected peak groups. This model takes a pair of transitions as input and classifies whether the pair is quantifiable by considering factors such as peak shape similarity, retention time match, light/heavy ratio similarity, and interference. The transition classification model is a binary classifier that is applied to the backbone architecture used in the peak detection model, with the only difference being that the kernel size of the first convolutional layer (conv1) is changed to 2x7.</p>

        <sec id="sec5.4.5.3">
          <title>Transition selection</title>
          <p id="p0215">Once peak groups are identified by the peak detection model, noise- and interference-free transitions are selected using the transition classification model. This model evaluates the quantitative feasibility of transition pairs. To assess the quantitative feasibility of each transition, a representative transition profile is generated as a reference chromatogram. All pairs of available transitions are evaluated by the transition classification model. Quantifiable transitions are then combined to create the representative transition profile. If no quantifiable transition pairs are found, the representative transition profile is created by summing all transitions. To reduce the computational cost, only up to six transitions with the highest peak heights are considered. As a last step, each transition is paired with the representative transition profile and assessed using the transition classification model for its quantitative feasibility. The classification model’s confidence score is considered a transition quality score.</p>

          <title>Abundance calculation</title>
          <p id="p0220">Upon selecting the quantifiable transitions, the target peptide’s abundance (peak area) is calculated. If there are fewer than two quantifiable transitions, the peak area is computed using all transitions. The average of the transition quality scores of the selected transitions is reported as a quantification confidence score. The peak area is calculated using the trapezoidal numerical integration method.</p>

        <sec id="sec5.4.5.5">
          <title>Data augmentation</title>
          <p id="p0225">To enhance the robustness and applicability of DeepMRM, a data augmentation strategy is employed during model training. Augmentation methods include random resizing, cropping, intensity jittering, retention time shifting, and transition rescaling. The retention time shift destroys the alignment of the light and heavy transition peaks, and the transition rescaling makes the light/heavy ratio across transitions inconsistent. During the augmentation, the label data is also transformed accordingly. All these augmentation methods are applied prior to generating the heatmap image.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="sec5.4.5.6">
          <title>Training</title>
          <p id="p0230">The in-house dataset (PDAC-MRM) was split into training, validation, and test sets at a ratio of 8:1:1. The model was trained using the Adam optimizer with default parameters (lr = 1.e−3, β1 = 0.9, β2 = 0.999). The training was performed on NVIDIA GeForce 3090 GPUs for 100 epochs with a batch size of 512. The learning rate was decreased by 0.5 every 10 epochs. The training was stopped when there was no improvement over 50 epochs.</p>

        <sec id="sec5.4.5.7">
          <title>Confidence score</title>
          <p id="p0235">DeepMRM comprises a peak detection model and a transition classification model, which compute and report two confidence scores: peak group confidence score and quantification confidence score. The peak group confidence score is calculated by a peak detection model using a sigmoid function to estimate the probability of a peak group being present within the candidate boundary region.</p>
          <p id="p0240">The quantification confidence score is determined by evaluating the quality of selected transitions for quantification. Each transition’s quality is assessed by comparing it to a representative transition profile to determine if it contains interference or noise and if its retention time, peak shape, and heavy/light ratio are sufficiently similar for quantification. Details on creating the representative transition profile are described in the transition selection section. Then, the average quality score of the selected transitions for quantification is reported as the quantification confidence score.</p>

          <title>Data preparation</title>
          <p id="p0245">All mass spectrometry files were converted to mzML format using ProteoWizard’s msConvert toolkit.<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr"><sup>26</sup></xref> Then, pyOpenMS library was utilized to extract chromatograms from the mzML files. Before extracting chromatograms, all PRM and DIA spectra were centroided, and a 20ppm extraction window was set. In the case of the P100-DIA dataset, a retention time window of 20 min was used, with the reference retention time specified in the spectral library. For other MRM and PRM datasets, the complete transition chromatograms acquired for the targeted peptides were extracted and utilized as input for DeepMRM.</p>
          <p id="p0250">The boundary of peak groups, list of transitions, and annotation information about quantitative transitions (if available) were extracted from Skyline files for three external datasets. In the case of P100-PRM dataset, the quantification results were filtered and normalized using an in-house downstream analysis protocol by the original authors.<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref> Since the filtered quantification results were not available, we employed Skyline’s “dotp” score of 0.7 to exclude unreliable measurements. This filtering process removed 2,117 out of 13,629 peak groups. We manually inspected the excluded peak groups and observed that most lacked light or heavy peptide signals. For P100-DIA, we evaluated DeepMRM using the AvG open curation dataset.</p>

          <title>Evaluation</title>
          <p id="p0255">We evaluated DeepMRM’s performance in two major tasks. The first task is identifying peak groups relevant to the target peptide in the given chromatograms (i.e., object detection task). Since object detection involves searching for the target object from various combinations of location and scale, the precision-recall curve is typically used rather than the ROC curve commonly used for classification tasks.<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20</sup></xref> A detected peak group is considered a true positive only if it has an Intersection over Union (IoU) greater than a certain threshold with the manually annotated peak group (i.e., ground truth). Here, we calculated and reported the average precision (AP) metric averaged across all recall levels ranging from 0 to 1. AP can summarize the precision-recall curve as a single value. We also calculated recall considering only the top 1 or 3 candidates per input image at a certain IoU threshold (RC<sub>1</sub> and RC<sub>3</sub>). Recall can measure the detection model’s ability to identify all peak groups (actual positive instances). Chromatogram peaks often have long tails, which may result in large variations in determining the end of peaks. Since this variation does not significantly affect the peak area, we used a less stringent IoU threshold of 0.3 rather than 0.5, a common threshold in object detection studies.</p>
          <p id="p0260">The second task involves selecting the transitions unaffected by noise and interference from the detected peak groups and estimating the abundance (peak area) of the targeted peptides. We evaluated how well the estimated abundance matched the manually calculated or ground truth abundances (if available). We calculated the linear relationship between the known and measured abundances of targeted peptides using Pearson’s correlation coefficient (PCC) and Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient (SPC). Additionally, we calculated the mean arctangent absolute percentage error (MAAPE).<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref> For the two-dilution series dataset with available ground truth abundance, the abundance of the peak group with the highest score was considered. For other benchmark datasets, the abundance of true positive peak groups was taken into account.</p>

      <title>Summary</title>
      <p>Targeted proteomics is widely utilized in clinical proteomics; however, researchers often devote substantial time to manual data interpretation, which hinders the transferability, reproducibility, and scalability of this approach. We introduce DeepMRM, a software package based on deep learning algorithms for object detection developed to minimize manual intervention in targeted proteomics data analysis. DeepMRM was evaluated on internal and public datasets, demonstrating superior accuracy compared with the community standard tool Skyline. To promote widespread adoption, we have incorporated a stand-alone graphical user interface for DeepMRM and integrated its algorithm into the Skyline software package as an external tool.</p>

      <title>Motivation</title>
      <p>In clinical proteomics, targeted proteomics approaches like multiple-reaction monitoring (MRM) or parallel-reaction monitoring (PRM) are widely used, but their application is often hampered by labor-intensive and error-prone manual data interpretation. Existing computational methods, while helpful, often demand a substantial degree of manual intervention or decoy-transition approaches, constraining the throughput and efficiency of clinical proteomics assays. To address these challenges, we developed DeepMRM, a targeted proteomics data interpretation package that facilitates high-throughput analysis and enhances the reproducibility and scalability of targeted proteomics in clinical settings.</p>

    <title>Introduction</title>
    <p id="p0050">In clinical proteomics laboratories, targeted proteomics approaches such as multiple-reaction monitoring (MRM; also known as selected-reaction monitoring [SRM]) or parallel-reaction monitoring (PRM) are widely employed due to their high sensitivity and reproducibility.<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref> However, researchers often devote substantial time to manual peak selection, interference identification, and peak area adjustments to interpret targeted proteomics data.<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref> This step is prone to human error and may result in inconsistent outcomes due to subjective evaluations. The reliance on manual inspection is a major barrier to the transferability, reproducibility, and scalability of targeted proteomics in clinical applications.</p>
    <p id="p0055">Numerous computational methods have been developed to address these challenges. Skyline, the most widely used open-source software for targeted quantitative proteomics, offers a graphical user interface (GUI) with a suite of tools for peak picking, peak integration, and quantitative analysis of the results.<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> For automated absolute quantification, an external calibration curve method was developed.<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref> For quality assessment and control, a decoy-transition approach and machine learning models have been implemented.<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> Deep learning algorithms have recently been applied to the peak detection problem and have demonstrated a substantial improvement in accuracy compared with conventional methods.<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> However, existing approaches still necessitate substantial manual intervention or reliance on a decoy-transition approach,<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref> which ultimately constrains the assay’s throughput.</p>
    <p id="p0060">We introduce DeepMRM, a targeted proteomics data interpretation package leveraging deep learning algorithms for object detection specifically designed to substantially reduce the manual inspection burden, even for noisy and complex data (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). By reframing the challenge of finding peaks for targeted peptides as an object detection task, DeepMRM detects instances of peak groups within a set of 1D chromatograms, akin to how traditional object detection models identify object instances of a specific class within a 2D image. DeepMRM accepts transition chromatograms of varying lengths and numbers as input, generating chromatographic peaks of targeted peptides, along with their abundances and confidence scores. Detection results and transition chromatograms are visualized in a GUI, enabling users to review and adjust the results as needed rapidly. The performance of DeepMRM was benchmarked against Skyline and validated using internal and public datasets generated by different acquisition methods, such as MRM, PRM, or data-independent acquisition (DIA) experiments. DeepMRM facilitates high-throughput analysis of targeted proteomics by automated quantification and quality control without requiring decoy transitions.<fig id="fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>DeepMRM workflow for detecting peak groups of targeted peptides</p><p>Given the target list and MRM/PRM/DIA data as input, transition chromatograms of both heavy and light peptides are fed into the model as 2-channel heatmap images. Multiscale 1D feature maps are extracted and processed by two subnetworks: a classifier for determining whether candidate peak groups are present and a regressor for detecting the boundary of candidate peak groups. Detected peak groups are then examined by a CNN-based transition classification model to select transitions unaffected by interference or noise. The abundances of target peptides are estimated based on peak areas of heavy and light peptides.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gr1"/></fig></p>

      <title>Overview of DeepMRM</title>
      <p id="p0065">DeepMRM is a robust and highly accurate peak detection model designed for interpreting targeted proteomics data, complemented with a user interface for visualizing detection results. DeepMRM takes MRM, PRM, or DIA data and a target list as input, generating peaks corresponding to targeted peptides, their abundances, and confidence scores. The workflow consists of four steps (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>; see <xref rid="sec4" ref-type="sec">STAR Methods</xref>). First, for each targeted peptide, transition chromatograms of both heavy (stable isotope labeled [SIL]) and light (endogenous) peptides are extracted and converted into 2-channel heatmap images. Second, a deep learning-based peak detection model extracts 1D feature maps at various scales and identifies peak group candidates. Third, another convolutional neural network (CNN)-based transition classification model examines individual pairs of heavy and light transitions in the detected peak groups. Transitions unaffected by interference or noise are selected for calculating the abundances (peak areas) of target peptides. Lastly, quantification results are visualized alongside transition chromatograms in a GUI, allowing users to swiftly examine candidate peak groups and transitions selected for quantification and to make adjustments to their boundaries if necessary (<xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S1</xref>).</p>
      <p id="p0070">DeepMRM comprises two neural network models: a peak detection model for detecting peak groups and a transition classification model for selecting interference- and noise-free transitions. The peak detection model features a modified architecture of RetinaNet,<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref> a popular neural network model for object detection. DeepMRM can accept transition chromatograms of any length and number as input as a fully convolutional network. For the backbone convolutional architecture, we modified ResNet-18 to better learn relationships between transitions of the same peptide, as well as heavy and light peptides (see <xref rid="sec4" ref-type="sec">STAR Methods</xref>). Additionally, to improve model generalization across different target peptides and experimental settings unexplored during training, data augmentation schemes such as resizing, cropping, retention time shifting, and intensity jittering were incorporated during training. The transition classification model employs the same backbone architecture with different kernel sizes.</p>
      <p id="p0075">To train and evaluate DeepMRM, we used liquid chromatography (LC)-MRM-mass spectrometry (MS) data derived from tumor tissues of 66 patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC)<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref> (see <xref rid="sec4" ref-type="sec">STAR Methods</xref>). The MRM assay targeted 153 endogenous peptides and their heavy SIL peptides with three transitions each. Human experts examined the data using Skyline<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> and manually adjusted the targeted peptides’ peak boundaries. Additionally, peak quality was assessed using evaluation criteria such as equal retention time between heavy and light peptides, peak shape, intensity ratio consistency across transitions, and removal of transitions with interferences. A total of 30,294 peak groups were annotated, with 27,432 peak groups identified with peak boundaries and 19,230 peak groups deemed quantifiable.</p>

    <sec id="sec2.2">
      <title>DeepMRM showed better quantification accuracy compared with Skyline</title>
      <p id="p0080">We first evaluated DeepMRM’s quantification performance using a public MRM dataset consisting of two dilution series<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref> (<xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S1</xref>; see <xref rid="sec4" ref-type="sec">STAR Methods</xref>) and compared it with Skyline.

Skyline 5% FDR with the mProphet model improved quantification accuracy by filtering out 25% of results in the noisy dataset but did not filter any results in the complex background dataset, where a relatively small number of peak groups were considered.

      <p id="p0090">We evaluated DeepMRM on a hold-out test set of MRM data from PDAC samples (PDAC-MRM) and three external datasets: an MRM dataset used in an epithelial ovarian cancer study (EOC-MRM)<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref> and PRM and DIA datasets employed to profile phosphosignaling responses (P100-PRM and P100-DIA)<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref> (<xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S1</xref>; see <xref rid="sec4" ref-type="sec">STAR Methods</xref>).

Since chromatogram peaks often have long tails, which may result in large variations in determining peak endpoints, and these variations do not substantially impact the peak area, we opted for a less stringent IoU threshold of 0.3 rather than 0.5, a typical threshold in object detection studies. RC was calculated for the top 1 and 3 candidates per heatmap image (RC<sub>1</sub> and RC<sub>3</sub>).

      <title>Windows desktop application and integration into Skyline</title>
      <p id="p0105">DeepMRM is packaged as a Windows desktop application, streamlining the detection task and visualization of results. The GUI in the desktop application enables users to examine detection results and input transition chromatograms swiftly. Additionally, it allows for loading multiple samples together, simplifying the comparison of results for a target peptide. The desktop application supports the community standard format for MS data (mzML<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref>) and proprietary formats like Thermo RAW and Sciex WIFF. In addition to the standalone desktop software, we have integrated the DeepMRM algorithm into the Skyline software package as an external tool.</p>
      <p id="p0110">The running time of DeepMRM (excluding time for chromatogram extraction) is a few seconds (&lt;10 s) per sample on a Windows computer with a 3.8 GHz CPU (AMD Ryzen) and 32 GB memory (<xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S4</xref>).

    <title>Discussion</title>
    <p id="p0115">DeepMRM is a robust and highly accurate peak detection model for interpreting targeted proteomics data featuring a user interface for visualizing detection results. Designed to minimize human intervention in data interpretation, DeepMRM accepts targeted MS data and a target list as input and provides quantification results and confidence scores. Also, the GUI enables users to swiftly examine the results and make necessary corrections. We demonstrated that DeepMRM outperformed the community standard tool Skyline in quantification accuracy and exhibited robust accuracy across MRM, PRM, and DIA datasets. Importantly, DeepMRM does not require decoy transitions, which can limit assay throughput. With automated quantification and quality control, we anticipate that DeepMRM will facilitate high-throughput analysis of targeted proteomics.</p>
    <sec id="sec3.1">
      <title>Limitations of study</title>
      <p id="p0120">To enhance the applicability and accuracy of DeepMRM, we have planned several improvements. First, DeepMRM currently requires stable isotope-labeled peptides to quantify target peptides. We aim to expand the model to enable label-free quantification without heavy peptides. Second, isotopic peak cluster patterns in high-resolution PRM/DIA data are not currently utilized. We anticipate that incorporating the learning and utilization of these patterns will improve detection accuracy. Finally, DeepMRM has been designed and trained for targeted proteomics data interpretation. We are working on adapting DeepMRM to identify peptides in untargeted DIA data without prior transition information on targeted peptides. These developments will enhance the versatility of DeepMRM for various proteomics studies.</p>

          <title>Data preprocessing</title>
          <p id="p0185">Given the input data, which includes the LC-MS data and the target list, DeepMRM begins by extracting transition chromatograms for targeted precursor ions and subsequently transforms them into heatmap images with two channels. The entire transition chromatograms for targeted peptides are extracted unless reference retention times with time windows are provided. Linear interpolation is applied to all transition chromatograms, ensuring they share the same length and a scanning interval of 0.5 s. All the chromatograms are concatenated, with the horizontal and vertical axes representing the transition index and retention time, respectively. Consequently, two concatenated matrices (i.e., a two-channel heatmap image) are generated: one channel for light transition chromatograms and another for heavy transition chromatograms. The dimensions of heatmap images correspond to [2, number of transitions, length of chromatograms]. Lastly, as part of the preprocessing step, each transition pair is scaled from 0 to 1.</p>

          <title>Model architecture</title>
          <p id="p0190">DeepMRM comprises two neural network models: a peak detection model for identifying peak groups and a transition classification model for selecting interference- and noise-free transitions.</p>
          <sec id="sec5.4.5.2.1">
            <title>Peak detection model</title>
            <p id="p0195">The architecture of our peak detection model is based on RetinaNet, a widely-used neural network model for object detection.<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref> The network comprises a backbone network for extracting features and two small sub-networks. The first sub-network classifies the presence of peak groups on the extracted features; the second sub-network performs peak boundary regression.</p>
            <p id="p0200">We chose ResNet18 as the backbone network and modified it to accommodate the peak detection problem. First, the kernel size of conv1 is changed from 7x7 to 1x7, and the stride and padding sizes are adjusted accordingly. In the first convolutional layer, grouped convolutions are applied so that the heavy and light channels are convolved separately. Before the first residual block, an adaptive average pooling layer is inserted such that the height of the feature map becomes one. The kernel and padding sizes in the subsequent residual blocks are adjusted to 1x3 and 0x1, respectively. As a result, all the feature maps generated by the backbone are one-dimensional vectors.</p>
            <p id="p0205">Both sub-networks also employ convolutional layers with a kernel size of 1x3 and a padding size of 0x1. Since the regressor needs to predict only two points for a peak boundary rather than four points for a bounding box, the final output channel size is altered to twice the number of anchors. The anchors are generated with a single scale for feature level. The classifier subnetwork is configured for a binary classification problem: {background versus peak group}.</p>

            <title>Transition classification model</title>
            <p id="p0210">A CNN-based classification model is developed to select transitions unaffected by interference or noise from the detected peak groups. This model takes a pair of transitions as input and classifies whether the pair is quantifiable by considering factors such as peak shape similarity, retention time match, light/heavy ratio similarity, and interference. The transition classification model is a binary classifier that is applied to the backbone architecture used in the peak detection model, with the only difference being that the kernel size of the first convolutional layer (conv1) is changed to 2x7.</p>

          <title>Transition selection</title>
          <p id="p0215">Once peak groups are identified by the peak detection model, noise- and interference-free transitions are selected using the transition classification model. This model evaluates the quantitative feasibility of transition pairs. To assess the quantitative feasibility of each transition, a representative transition profile is generated as a reference chromatogram. All pairs of available transitions are evaluated by the transition classification model. Quantifiable transitions are then combined to create the representative transition profile. If no quantifiable transition pairs are found, the representative transition profile is created by summing all transitions. To reduce the computational cost, only up to six transitions with the highest peak heights are considered. As a last step, each transition is paired with the representative transition profile and assessed using the transition classification model for its quantitative feasibility. The classification model’s confidence score is considered a transition quality score.</p>

          <title>Abundance calculation</title>
          <p id="p0220">Upon selecting the quantifiable transitions, the target peptide’s abundance (peak area) is calculated. If there are fewer than two quantifiable transitions, the peak area is computed using all transitions. The average of the transition quality scores of the selected transitions is reported as a quantification confidence score. The peak area is calculated using the trapezoidal numerical integration method.</p>

          <title>Data augmentation</title>
          <p id="p0225">To enhance the robustness and applicability of DeepMRM, a data augmentation strategy is employed during model training. Augmentation methods include random resizing, cropping, intensity jittering, retention time shifting, and transition rescaling. The retention time shift destroys the alignment of the light and heavy transition peaks, and the transition rescaling makes the light/heavy ratio across transitions inconsistent. During the augmentation, the label data is also transformed accordingly. All these augmentation methods are applied prior to generating the heatmap image.</p>

        <sec id="sec5.4.5.6">
          <title>Training</title>
          <p id="p0230">The in-house dataset (PDAC-MRM) was split into training, validation, and test sets at a ratio of 8:1:1. The model was trained using the Adam optimizer with default parameters (lr = 1.e−3, β1 = 0.9, β2 = 0.999). The training was performed on NVIDIA GeForce 3090 GPUs for 100 epochs with a batch size of 512. The learning rate was decreased by 0.5 every 10 epochs. The training was stopped when there was no improvement over 50 epochs.</p>

        <sec id="sec5.4.5.7">
          <title>Confidence score</title>
          <p id="p0235">DeepMRM comprises a peak detection model and a transition classification model, which compute and report two confidence scores: peak group confidence score and quantification confidence score. The peak group confidence score is calculated by a peak detection model using a sigmoid function to estimate the probability of a peak group being present within the candidate boundary region.</p>
          <p id="p0240">The quantification confidence score is determined by evaluating the quality of selected transitions for quantification. Each transition’s quality is assessed by comparing it to a representative transition profile to determine if it contains interference or noise and if its retention time, peak shape, and heavy/light ratio are sufficiently similar for quantification. Details on creating the representative transition profile are described in the transition selection section. Then, the average quality score of the selected transitions for quantification is reported as the quantification confidence score.</p>

          <p id="p0245">All mass spectrometry files were converted to mzML format using ProteoWizard’s msConvert toolkit.<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr"><sup>26</sup></xref> Then, pyOpenMS library was utilized to extract chromatograms from the mzML files. Before extracting chromatograms, all PRM and DIA spectra were centroided, and a 20ppm extraction window was set. In the case of the P100-DIA dataset, a retention time window of 20 min was used, with the reference retention time specified in the spectral library. For other MRM and PRM datasets, the complete transition chromatograms acquired for the targeted peptides were extracted and utilized as input for DeepMRM.</p>
          <p id="p0250">The boundary of peak groups, list of transitions, and annotation information about quantitative transitions (if available) were extracted from Skyline files for three external datasets. In the case of P100-PRM dataset, the quantification results were filtered and normalized using an in-house downstream analysis protocol by the original authors.<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref> Since the filtered quantification results were not available, we employed Skyline’s “dotp” score of 0.7 to exclude unreliable measurements. This filtering process removed 2,117 out of 13,629 peak groups. We manually inspected the excluded peak groups and observed that most lacked light or heavy peptide signals. For P100-DIA, we evaluated DeepMRM using the AvG open curation dataset.</p>

          <title>Evaluation</title>
          <p id="p0255">We evaluated DeepMRM’s performance in two major tasks. The first task is identifying peak groups relevant to the target peptide in the given chromatograms (i.e., object detection task). Since object detection involves searching for the target object from various combinations of location and scale, the precision-recall curve is typically used rather than the ROC curve commonly used for classification tasks.<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20</sup></xref> A detected peak group is considered a true positive only if it has an Intersection over Union (IoU) greater than a certain threshold with the manually annotated peak group (i.e., ground truth). Here, we calculated and reported the average precision (AP) metric averaged across all recall levels ranging from 0 to 1. AP can summarize the precision-recall curve as a single value. We also calculated recall considering only the top 1 or 3 candidates per input image at a certain IoU threshold (RC<sub>1</sub> and RC<sub>3</sub>). Recall can measure the detection model’s ability to identify all peak groups (actual positive instances). Chromatogram peaks often have long tails, which may result in large variations in determining the end of peaks. Since this variation does not significantly affect the peak area, we used a less stringent IoU threshold of 0.3 rather than 0.5, a common threshold in object detection studies.</p>
          <p id="p0260">The second task involves selecting the transitions unaffected by noise and interference from the detected peak groups and estimating the abundance (peak area) of the targeted peptides. We evaluated how well the estimated abundance matched the manually calculated or ground truth abundances (if available). We calculated the linear relationship between the known and measured abundances of targeted peptides using Pearson’s correlation coefficient (PCC) and Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient (SPC). Additionally, we calculated the mean arctangent absolute percentage error (MAAPE).<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref> For the two-dilution series dataset with available ground truth abundance, the abundance of the peak group with the highest score was considered. For other benchmark datasets, the abundance of true positive peak groups was taken into account.</p>
