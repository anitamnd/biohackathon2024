    <abstract id="Abs1">
      <p id="Par1">Tissue function depends on cellular organization. While the properties of individual cells are increasingly being deciphered using powerful single-cell sequencing technologies, understanding their spatial organization and temporal evolution remains a major challenge. Here, we present Image-seq, a technology that provides single-cell transcriptional data on cells that are isolated from specific spatial locations under image guidance, thus preserving the spatial information of the target cells. It is compatible with in situ and in vivo imaging and can document the temporal and dynamic history of the cells being analyzed. Cell samples are isolated from intact tissue and processed with state-of-the-art library preparation protocols. The technique therefore combines spatial information with highly sensitive RNA sequencing readouts from individual, intact cells. We have used both high-throughput, droplet-based sequencing as well as SMARTseq-v4 library preparation to demonstrate its application to bone marrow and leukemia biology. We discovered that DPP4 is a highly upregulated gene during early progression of acute myeloid leukemia and that it marks a more proliferative subpopulation that is confined to specific bone marrow microenvironments. Furthermore, the ability of Image-seq to isolate viable, intact cells should make it compatible with a range of downstream single-cell analysis tools including multi-omics protocols.</p>

    <p id="Par3">Spatial transcriptomics is a rapidly advancing field that encompasses a range of different technologies capable of spatially resolved gene expression analysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. In contrast to single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), which provides deep insights into heterogeneities within cell populations but does not preserve the spatial relationships between individual cells, techniques such as MERFISH<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>, seqFISH<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup> and Slide-seq<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup> can link these heterogeneities to differences in spatial composition and cellular proximity. However, apart from Niche-seq<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>, they have been applied only in vitro or they have relied on the generation of tissue sections<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>, which confines their applicability to tissues that are easily sectioned. They map the gene expression profiles onto two-dimensional (2D) images, and extrapolation to three-dimensional (3D) architecture of intact tissues is still limited. For example, 3D expression profiles and cell segmentation have been demonstrated in tissue sections<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup> but the section thickness is limited by messenger RNA probe diffusion. In addition, tissue sections can provide only static images, necessitating the use of indirect methods such as pseudo-time analysis to infer cellular trajectories over time<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>, and to our knowledge none of the currently available spatial transcriptomics technologies has been combined with in vivo imaging.</p>
    <p id="Par4">Here, we present Image-seq, a new platform that enables image-guided cell isolation for scRNA-seq. The core of the Image-seq platform is a multiphoton microscope with two optical paths, one for imaging and one for laser micromachining that creates an access channel in tissue through which a micropipette is brought to the target location to aspirate cells under image guidance. Because it captures viable cells it can be combined with state-of-the-art library preparation protocols, leading to higher mRNA detection efficiencies and broader transcript coverage than other spatial sequencing technologies. In addition, standard computational tools can be used for data analysis.</p>
    <p id="Par5">We use Image-seq to study the bone marrow, the primary site of hematopoiesis, where hematopoietic stem cells give rise to all of the blood cells in the body. The bone marrow is also the site where malignant cells can either originate (such as leukemia) or preferentially metastasize to (such as prostate or breast cancer). Although the functional organization of hematopoietic cells in the bone marrow has been extensively characterized<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>, their 3D spatial organization has been difficult to assess due to their complexity and location deep inside the bone matrix<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. To demonstrate Image-seq’s versatility and high sensitivity, we used high-throughput, droplet-based sequencing with the 10x Chromium platform to profile bone marrow hematopoietic cells, as well as the SMARTseq-v4 protocol to profile rare (&lt;0.01% leukemic burden) acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells and bone marrow stromal cells. Specifically, we tracked AML progression using intravital microscopy, and observed pronounced spatial heterogeneity in the earliest stage of expansion from single AML cells seeded in the bone marrow. This highlighted the need to capture these cells from distinct bone marrow locations where they either proliferate or remain quiescent, to identify the factors that regulate leukemia progression in the earliest stage of the disease development. Using this approach we identified DPP4 (dipeptidyl peptidase 4) as a key upregulated gene in AML cells from the more proliferative bone marrow compartments. Strikingly, DPP4 was not expressed on the same cells cultured in vitro, suggesting that DPP4 was specifically activated in vivo and was correlated with disease progression.</p>

      <title>Cell isolation under image guidance</title>
      <p id="Par6">The core of the Image-seq platform is a confocal or multiphoton microscope with an additional laser beam capable of tissue ablation. The requirement for the ablation laser is that it needs to have sufficient pulse energy (&gt;10 nJ per pulse, or approximately 10-fold the pulse energy typically used in multiphoton microscopy) to generate a plasma through multiphoton ionization at the laser focus. To minimize thermal damage it also needs to have a low average power, which can be accomplished by reducing the pulse repetition frequency from the ~80 MHz typically used for multiphoton microscopy to a few MHz to compensate for the higher pulse energy needed for tissue ablation. These requirements are readily fulfilled with commercial or industrial femtosecond fiber lasers for micromachining or ophthalmic microsurgery<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. The plasma is used to ablate or etch away bone<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup> with minimal collateral damage to the surrounding tissue<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. A small, ~50 × 100 µm channel is created, through which a micropipette, controlled by a micromanipulator, is inserted to aspirate live bone marrow cells under image guidance. The sample is expelled from the micropipette, which directly generates a single-cell suspension.</p>
      <p id="Par7">In our implementation the imaging arm and the ablation arm are powered by a single femtosecond fiber laser operating at 5 MHz repetition frequency. This repetition frequency enables full-field (500 × 500 pixels) image acquisition at 15 frames per second (half the video rate) with a single laser pulse per pixel. However, it is also possible to integrate an ablation capability into an existing confocal or multiphoton microscope by adding an ablation laser that fulfills the requirements described above. A detailed optical design is shown in Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. The output of a 1,550 nm femtosecond fiber laser is frequency doubled to 775 nm and used for both imaging and plasma-mediated laser ablation by adjusting the pulse energy between 1 and 20 nJ. An additional imaging wavelength that is tunable between 940 and 980 nm is provided through soliton generation in a photonic crystal fiber<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. A revolving polygon and scanning galvanometer mirror, conjugated to one another and the back aperture of the objective lens, steer the ablation and imaging beams across the field of view in the imaging plane (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). A variable aperture at the intermediate image plane controls the 2D ablation geometry along the <italic>x</italic> and <italic>y</italic> dimensions (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>) while the sample is translated along the <italic>z</italic> dimension to either ablate or image a 3D tissue volume. By etching through bone a small opening (~50 µm × 100 µm) is created, and a micromanipulator is used to insert a fluorescently coated micropipette through the opening at a 20° angle into the bone marrow with micrometer spatial precision (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). Prior to making the opening, a larger area of bone is thinned (~200 × 300 µm) to improve micropipette accessibility and imaging depth. This step takes ~3 min. Target bone marrow cells are aspirated into the micropipette by suction with an Air Syringe, with the displaced volume controlling the total number of aspirated cells (from a few to a few thousand). With this design we were able to aspirate bone marrow cells from freshly collected bone samples as well as from live animals while tracking the process in real time (Supplementary Videos <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">1</xref>–<xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media">3</xref>). Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref> shows the bone marrow aspirate containing the target cell from the in vivo image after transfer to a glass slide and visualization with a wide-field fluorescence microscope. Using this strategy, recovery of a single, viable target cell has an efficiency of ~70%.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><title>Optical set-up and cell aspiration procedure.</title><p><bold>a</bold>, Schematic diagram of integral components of the combined multiphoton microscopy and laser ablation set-up (full diagram in Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).

        <title>Similarity of whole bone marrow and micropipette sample composition</title>
        <p id="Par8">To further demonstrate our instrument’s ability to isolate live cells from defined anatomic regions of murine bone marrow, we used it to isolate bone marrow samples from β-actin-green fluorescent protein (β-actin-GFP) mice. Figure <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref> shows a 4 × 8 mm, tiled, maximum intensity projection image of the calvarium bone marrow, along with a region of interest from which cells were aspirated both before and after cell extraction. To minimize sample loss we eliminated post-extraction sample processing by performing transcardial perfusion prior to cell isolation. This reduced the amount of red blood cells in our samples, and we directly generated a single-cell suspension by expelling samples from the micropipette. There is a notable variation in the CD71<sup>−</sup>Ter119<sup>+</sup> cell compartment that we attribute to slight differences in perfusion quality (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>). A total of nine calvarial bone marrow micropipette samples and four tibia bone marrow micropipette samples, containing an average of 2,000 cells each, were isolated from a total of five mice, yielding an average viability of 94% and 92%, respectively (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>). A 3D visualization of a representative volume of calvarial bone marrow before and after cell extraction is shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>. Similarly, Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">3a</xref> shows a representative volume of tibia bone marrow both before and after cell extraction. Both the view from above the bone surface and that achieved by rotation of 180° around the <italic>x</italic> axis are shown. We additionally analyzed extracted cell samples for their cell surface marker expression by flow cytometry and were able to detect the major hematopoietic cell populations in our pooled micropipette samples with similar frequency to those in whole bone marrow control samples (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref> and Extended Data Figs. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>,<xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>). Generally, the cell proportions were in good agreement, although we did observe statistically significant differences between tibia and calvarium bone marrow for the B-cell and pre-pro-B-cell populations. We also observed significant differences between the micropipette and whole bone marrow preparations for macrophage, pre-B-cell and pro-B-cell populations. It is unclear whether the differences between micropipette and whole bone marrow preparations are due to technical effects or the fact that we typically collected micropipette samples from within ~80 µm of the endosteal surface.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><title>Characterization of micropipette samples.</title><p><bold>a</bold>, Tiled, maximum intensity projection image of a 4 × 8 mm region of skull bone marrow (tiles shown as magenta squares on the schematic of the skull below the image), obtained by stitching together individual microscope fields of view.

A list of differentially expressed genes in each cluster is given in Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">1</xref>. Here, we pooled 11 Image-seq samples to characterize the distribution of cell populations in the limit of a large number of samples (for which we would expect the same distribution as for WCBM samples if there were no technical differences between the two sampling strategies).</p>
        <p id="Par12">As expected for sampling small volumes from different locations, we observed significant sample-to-sample variations (a detailed breakdown is given in Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>). However, we did not observe statistically significant differences in the proportion of any cell populations when comparing Image-seq (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>) and WCBM (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>) preparations in aggregated form (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">4c</xref>). We further examined the transcriptional similarity of the major cell types from WCBM and Image-seq samples. Correlation coefficients of average gene expression levels between WCBM and Image-seq samples (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3d</xref>) show a strong correlation between individual cell populations collected using the two methodologies. Gene ontology analysis of differentially expressed genes between Image-seq and WCBM samples for the most part showed very general terms that were not associated with cell damage or cell stress (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">4d,e</xref>), although there was a notable downregulation of ribosomal terms in Image-seq samples, which could indicate lower cell stress and could be related to the overall higher number of unique molecular identifiers and genes per cell that we observed in the Image-seq samples (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3f</xref>). We additionally assessed the percentage of cells that passed quality control using the two experimental strategies (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig11" ref-type="fig">5a</xref>) and found no statistically significant differences. We plotted the distribution of unique molecular identifiers and genes per cell for each sample that we collected (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig11" ref-type="fig">5b</xref>), along with a table that summarizes the overall number of cells in each sample and the ones that passed quality control (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig11" ref-type="fig">5c</xref>). Again, although some variations were observed between samples, the data as a whole led us to conclude that Image-seq produces scRNA-seq data with a quality that is comparable to or exceeds that of conventional cell collection protocols.</p>

        <title>Image-seq analysis of early leukemia expansion</title>
        <p id="Par15">We next turned our focus to early leukemia progression in a Hoxa9/Meis1-Ubiquitin-c-GFP (HA9M1) mouse model of AML, performing intravital imaging of the calvarium bone marrow between 1 and 3 days after transplanting 3 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells into non-irradiated recipients (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>). We found that starting from day 3, the number of leukemia cells per bone marrow cavity (concave endosteum) rapidly increases (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>), and chose this timepoint to study the mechanisms of early leukemia expansion. We used longitudinal imaging of the same cavities in the same animals to quantify proliferation dynamics (see Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4e</xref> for examples of longitudinal images) and classify cells as either proliferating (P, average of 30 cells per cavity on day 3), intermediate (IM, average of 13 cells per cavity on day 3) or non-proliferating (NP, average of 2 cells per cavity on day 3), as shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c</xref>, where the median and quartile of the distributions are given (see Methods for details). We then used the 99.9% confidence interval of AML cells per cavity on day 3 to identify sites for cell extraction and sequencing. Prior to the sequencing experiments we quantified label dilution on day 3 after transplantation with CellTracker-labeled AML cells. The percentage of CellTracker-positive cells per bone marrow cavity decreased as the overall number of cells increased (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig13" ref-type="fig">7a</xref>), further verifying our imaging-based classification. Surprisingly, these proliferative phenotypes were distributed throughout the calvarium bone marrow in a spatially heterogeneous manner (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4d</xref>), further underlining the need for a spatially resolved analysis by scRNA-seq.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><title>Early leukemia progression by Image-seq.</title><p><bold>a</bold>, In vivo imaging timepoints.

        <p id="Par16">We identified P, NP and IM AML cells by imaging and aspirated them by micropipette using our Image-seq platform. Subsequently, we separated the AML cells from the ~100–400 surrounding hematopoietic cells by sorting them into individual wells of a 96-well plate by flow cytometry and gating for GFP (see Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref> for examples of the gating strategy used to isolate an NP, as well as several P cells, from a single micropipette sample). By choosing this strategy (shown schematically in Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref> as steps 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5b), we optimized the yield of the rare AML cells and avoided the ~30–40% cell loss that occurs during cell encapsulation using the 10x Genomics platform. In total, we collected ~40 cells from four different locations in the P category, ~40 cells from ~30 different locations in the NP category, as well as ~20 cells from three different locations in the IM category from <italic>n</italic> = 11 mice. Experimental throughput was limited by the extremely rare NP cells, which made up only 0.7% of AML cells on day 3, with the overall leukemic burden already &lt;0.01%. To minimize the issue of dropout that is often observed in scRNA-seq data, we used the SMARTseq-v4 protocol for reverse transcription and library construction. Because of the SMARTseq protocol’s unique chemistry, the number of genes and transcripts detected per cell are higher than for any other scRNA-seq technology (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig11" ref-type="fig">5d</xref> and ref. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>). Used in combination with the SMARTseq-v4 protocol, Image-seq therefore has the highest sensitivity and transcript coverage of any currently available spatial sequencing technology, with an average of 3,314,087 total mapped reads or 8,053 genes per cell. Of the 97 cells that were sequenced, a total of 84 cells passed quality control.</p>

Cluster 1 was enriched in genes related to the S and G1/S phases, cluster 3 was enriched in genes related to the G2 and G2/M phases, and cluster 2 lacked expression of cycle genes and was therefore classified as quiescent cells (G0 phase). Interestingly, the distribution of cell cycle in the P and IM populations was very similar, with the largest proportion of cells in the G1/S and S phases, and the second largest proportion in G2 and G2/M (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4f</xref>). For the NP population, however, the major contribution came from the G0 phase, and the second largest from the G1/S and S phases.

        <p id="Par20">To validate <italic>DPP4</italic> expression we assessed its protein expression using flow cytometry and found that it increases as a function of disease progression, with a maximum stable expression at ~50% by week 4 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5b</xref>). Although DPP4 expression was too low to be detected using flow cytometry on day 3, it could be detected using in vivo imaging, and we found a statistically significant difference when DPP4 antibody labeling was compared in P versus NP cells whereas we did not observe this in the corresponding isotype control (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5c,d</xref> and Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig13" ref-type="fig">7d</xref>). Next, we analyzed the cell cycle in DPP4-positive versus DPP4-negative AML cells using Ki-67 staining (see Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig14" ref-type="fig">8b</xref> for gating strategy), which confirmed that DPP4-positive cells have a higher cycling rate (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5e</xref> and Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig14" ref-type="fig">8a</xref>). To elucidate whether this phenotype is more broadly observed, we studied an MLL-AF9 model of AML and found the decrease in the G1 phase and the concomitant increase in the S, G2 and M phases in DPP4-positive cells to be even more pronounced (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5f</xref>). Note that at day 13 (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig14" ref-type="fig">8a</xref>) the difference in cycling rate is less pronounced than at day 7, and there is no difference in the proportion of cells in the G1 phase. This is a very aggressive model and even at day 13 more than 80% of the marrow is composed of leukemia cells, suggesting that the cells are running out of space to proliferate, which is likely to reduce the cycling rate. In keeping with this, the overall proportion of DPP4-positive and DPP4-negative cells that are actively cycling is considerably lower on day 13 than on day 7 (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0001), which is likely the reason that the proportion of DPP4-positive cells reaches a maximum stable value of 50%. We additionally analyzed DPP4-correlated genes in two published, human AML datasets<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup> (see Methods for details) and observed a high overlap between the top 300 positively correlated genes. GO analysis of the overlapping gene set (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5g</xref>) showed an enrichment of terms related to cell cycle (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5h</xref>), suggesting that the phenotype is relevant to human AML.</p>

Interestingly, overexpression of Flt3 has been associated with poor prognosis in AML<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>, and combined expression of Itgb7 and Flt3 has been used to identify leukemic stem cells in Hoxa9/Meis1 AML<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>.

We were also unable to detect DPP4 by intracellular staining or quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig16" ref-type="fig">10b,c</xref>). In addition, we found that although DPP4-positive HA9M1 cells expressed <italic>Dpp4</italic> at comparable levels to splenic T cells immediately following removal from the bone marrow environment (day 0 qPCR results in Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig14" ref-type="fig">8d</xref>), they subsequently lost all <italic>Dpp4</italic> expression at the transcriptional level after 4 days of in vitro cell culture. Remarkably, co-culture of AML cells with bone marrow stromal and osteoblast precursor cells activated DPP4 cell surface expression, while co-culture with other stromal cell lines did not (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6a</xref>). Combined with the observation that DPP4 expression is upregulated in specific bone marrow compartments (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a,c</xref>), the data suggest that different niches drive the upregulation of DPP4. Given the recent finding that hematopoietic stem cell proliferation is restricted to a subset of bone marrow cavities with mixed bone remodeling activity (M-type cavities)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup> we reasoned that these niches could drive proliferation of AML cells.

    <title>Discussion</title>
    <p id="Par24">AML is an aggressive blood cancer characterized by an accumulation of immature myeloid cells in the bone marrow that are arrested in differentiation and that accumulate as immature and malignant self-renewing progenitors. Despite an initially favorable response to treatment with intensive cytotoxic chemotherapy, ~75% of patients die within 5 years of diagnosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup>. Relapse is thought to be driven by the rare pool of leukemia-initiating cells that persist in the bone marrow following chemotherapy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup>. Arguing that an important approach to the development of new therapeutics is the targeting and exploiting of the supportive interaction as leukemia-initiating cells communicate with and seek refuge within the bone marrow microenvironment, we decided to study and identify signals that trigger the exit of leukemia-initiating cells from the quiescent state, thereby gaining mechanistic insight into disease recurrence. We further reasoned that examining the bone marrow at a stage of very low leukemic burden, comparable to the state of minimal residual disease (when the AML cells are more likely to be surrounded by normal hematopoietic and stromal cells), provides unique insights that cannot be obtained using traditional assays of relatively high leukemic burdens in which the bone marrow is crowded with malignant cells and the microenvironment is severely altered.</p>
    <p id="Par25">Here, we have shown how the combination of intravital microscopy to study the dynamics of AML disease progression, and spatially resolved scRNA-seq, provides new insights into leukemia biology. Moreover, multiphoton microscopy uniquely informs the 3D spatial context of AML cells and can be used to validate the single-cell gene expression data in a spatially resolved manner (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5c,d</xref> and Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig13" ref-type="fig">7d</xref>), as well as characterize different microenvironments (Figs. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b–e</xref> and <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6b</xref>) that can be analyzed for their differential expression (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a</xref>). We found that DPP4 marks a more proliferative phenotype both in murine and in human disease, which makes it a promising target for further investigations that could lead to new treatments.</p>
    <p id="Par26">In situ imaging of murine bone marrow has led to numerous insights into the basic biology of hematopoietic stem cells, as well as the spatial organization of bone marrow tissue<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref></sup>. In the skull bone marrow, intravital microscopy has been used for the study of hematopoiesis, along with hematopoietic stem cell and leukemia biology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref></sup>. It has elucidated the temporal dynamics of these processes and tracked the association of individual cells with distinct bone marrow components in real time<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref></sup>. Imaging alone, however, fails to provide unbiased mechanistic insight into the observed cellular dynamics and spatial organization. It is precisely such information, however, that promises to bring new insights into hematopoietic and leukemia biology and, concomitantly, the development of new therapeutics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>.</p>
    <p id="Par27">To date, the only spatially resolved transcriptional study of the murine bone marrow, a tissue that remains highly challenging to section, relied on bulk transcriptomic analysis of tissue blocks that were cut from formalin-fixed bone marrow sections using laser micro-dissection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. The cellular composition of individual blocks was then inferred computationally using a separate, scRNA-seq dataset. To our knowledge there have been no spatially resolved transcriptional studies of the leukemic bone marrow.</p>
    <p id="Par28">Image-seq represents a new experimental approach for integrating spatial and molecular information. Multiple contrast mechanisms can be used to visualize the procedure and reconstruct the 3D spatial position of the extracted cell sample, including autofluorescence, confocal reflectance (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref> and Supplementary Video <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">1</xref>) or labeling with a fluorescent membrane dye such as Di-8-ANEPPS (used in the experiments in Figs. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref> and <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). When combined with intravital microscopy, Image-seq additionally enables transcriptomic analysis on cells for which the position and history have been documented by intravital microscopy. Because of its utility both for high-throughput sequencing and in-depth profiling of rare cells, the Image-seq platform is highly versatile in its applications. We additionally expect that it can be applied to study fixed tissues and tissue sections (for example, using the 10x Genomics protocol for fixed tissues instead of the protocol we detailed here), although we recommend working with live cell samples when possible to achieve the highest sensitivities and transcript coverage. Currently there is a trade-off between spatial resolution and throughput. Although it is possible to isolate very few cells and obtain a spatial resolution of ~30 × 30 × 30 µm, or even a single cell if there is only one fluorescent cell in the isolated tissue volume (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>) that can be sorted by flow cytometry, this comes at the cost of lowered throughput. Increasing the number of extracted cells, however, lowers spatial resolution. As we expand the technology we expect to overcome these shortcomings and refine its resolution and increase its throughput. We anticipate that Image-seq will be used to investigate a range of diseases and biological questions involving the bone marrow, along with other tissues that remain difficult to section. Furthermore, based on the technology’s ability to isolate viable cells, we anticipate its applicability to spatially resolved multi-omics studies in a range of biological settings.</p>

The output of a femtosecond, 1,550 nm fiber laser (Calmar Cazadero) operating at a repetition rate of 5 MHz was split into two optical paths: one was frequency doubled with a BiBO crystal (Newlight Photonics) to obtain a wavelength of 775 nm that was used for either imaging or ablation (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The other was coupled into a large mode-area photonic crystal fiber (LMA-35, NKT Photonics) where, by soliton self-frequency shift, radiation with a frequency tunable between 1,880 nm and 1,960 nm was generated. This was frequency doubled (BiBO, Newlight Photonics) to obtain imaging wavelengths between 940 and 980 nm. The imaging and ablation beams were spatially overlapped using a dichroic mirror (Zt 785 RDC, Chroma) and directed to the scanning optics, which consisted of a revolving polygon (36 facets, 14,400 r.p.m., <italic>x</italic> scan) conjugated to a scanning galvanometer mirror (15 Hz, <italic>y</italic> scan), and which were conjugated to the back aperture of the objective lens (Olympus, ×60, numerical aperture (NA) 1.0, water immersion). This served to steer the imaging and ablation beams across the microscope field of view. Typical pulse energies used for imaging were between 1 and 2 nJ and typical pulse energies for ablation were between 10 and 15 nJ. For stable plasma generation a continuous stream of PBS (ThermoFisher Scientific) was flushed across the sample at a rate of 10 ml min<sup>−1</sup> to remove any gas or debris generated during the ablation procedure. The sample (mouse) was positioned in the image plane using a micromanipulator (Sutter instruments) and translated along the z dimension to image or ablate a 3D volume of tissue. Fluorescence signals were collected after excitation with 775 nm or 980 nm laser light, using three photomultiplier tubes (PMTs). The typical configuration of the dichroic mirrors was FF705 LP, FF495 LP and FF552 LP, with filters 439/154 (blue PMT R7600-U300, Hamamatsu) for the detection of collagen second-harmonic generation signal from bone, 525/50 (green PMT R7600-U300, Hamamatsu) for the detection of AML cells and tetracycline, and 607/70 (red PMT R7600-U20, Hamamatsu) for the detection of CellTracker Red and Di-8-ANEPPS (ThermoFisher Scientific) signals.

      <p id="Par31">The procedure for intravital imaging of the calvarium bone marrow is described in detail elsewhere<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref></sup>. Prior to intravital microscopy and ablation, analgesics were given (buprenorphine at 0.05–0.1 mg kg<sup>−1</sup> i.p.), mice were anesthetized using vaporized isoflurane (3–4% for induction, 1–2% for maintenance) and depth of anesthesia ensured by toe pinch. Hair around the incision site on the scalp was trimmed, and skin was made aseptic using a betadine scrub. The incision (~5 mm × 7 mm) was made using sterile surgical scissors, and the skin folded back to expose the skull bone, which was hydrated using sterile PBS. Mice were transferred to a mouse holder with integrated heating pad (37 °C), and a continuous stream of isoflurane supplied via a nose cone during in vivo imaging and ablation. Intravital microscopy experiments were carried out using the microscope and dichroic mirror–filter configuration detailed above, and image stacks were acquired with a 2 μm step size from the calvaria surface and by averaging 15 frames to obtain a single image. At the end of each imaging session the mice were either sacrificed or survival surgery was performed. For survival, the exposed skull was extensively irrigated with sterile saline and the scalp closed with surgical sutures (Ethicon 6-0 nylon monofilament, Ethicon). After closure, 0.25% bupivacaine (2 mg per kg animal weight) was administered to the surgical site via percutaneous infiltration to aid with pain management, and triple antibiotic ointment (Curad) was applied on the sutured area. The animal was returned to its cage and monitored until awake. Buprenorphine (0.05–0.1 mg per kg animal weight) was given i.p. or s.c. along with topical antibiotic ointment every 8–12 h for up to 2 days after surgery.</p>

In brief, the HoxA9/Meis1 AML cell line was generated by retroviral transduction with an MSCV-HoxA9-IRES-Meis1 construct (originally designed by G. Sauvageau) into bone marrow mononuclear cells from a mouse expressing GFP under the control of the ubiquitin, and luciferase under the control of the β-actin promoter. The MLL-AF9 cell line used for the cell cycle experiments was generated by collecting bone marrow from a 5-fluorouracil-treated Cas9-GFP mouse, followed by two consecutive transfections with retroviral MLL-AF9. For both models the cells were transplanted into irradiated recipients, collected from terminally ill animals and re-transplanted into a second set of irradiated recipients, from which GFP-expressing cells were collected close to the disease endpoint. These cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 (Gibco) supplemented with 10% FBS (ThermoFisher Scientific), 100 IU ml<sup>−1</sup> penicillin (Corning), 100 mg ml<sup>−1</sup> streptomycin (Corning), 5 ng ml<sup>−1</sup> interleukin 3 (IL-3, Peprotech), as well as 100 ng ml<sup>−1</sup> stem cell factor (SCF, Peprotech) for the HoxA9/Meis1, and 20 ng ml<sup>−1</sup> SCF and 10 ng ml<sup>−1</sup> IL-6 (both from Peprotech) for the MLL-AF9.

    <p>C.H. developed the Image-seq platform, carried out the imaging and Image-seq cell isolation experiments, developed the stromal cell isolation protocol with the help of K.G., performed AML cell culture, SMARTseq-v4 library preparation and sequencing experiments (with the help of the Bauer core), analyzed the data, interpreted the scRNA-seq data and coordinated the entire project. C.H. and C.P.L. designed the optical platform and wrote the manuscript with input from all of the authors. K.G. performed the 10x Genomics Chromium and sequencing experiments as well as the flow cytometry, co-culture and qPCR experiments. S.M. analyzed the scRNA-seq data. S.-C.Y. performed the in vivo imaging and analysis of CellTracker and AML distribution in different bone remodeling environments. D.R. performed cell isolation experiments from the tibia. J.M. generated the secondary transplanted HoxA9/Meis1 leukemia cells and contributed to flow cytometry experiments. R.T. contributed to the early design and assembled a preliminary version of the optical platform. D.B.S. assisted in the design and interpretation of the leukemia and flow cytometry experiments. P.V.K., D.B.S., D.T.S. and C.P.L. supervised the study. C.P.L. conceived the project with input from P.V.K. and D.T.S.</p>
