      <p>Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) play a key role in numerous biological processes. Many efforts have been undertaken to develop PPI modulators for therapeutic applications; however, to date, most of the peptide binders designed to target PPIs are derived from native binding helices or using the native helix binding site, which has limited the applications of protein-protein interface binding peptide design. Here, we developed a general computational algorithm, HPer (Helix Positioner), that locates single-helix binding sites at protein-protein interfaces based on the structure of protein targets. HPer performed well on known single-helix-mediated PPIs and recaptured the key interactions and hot-spot residues of native helical binders. We also screened non-helical-mediated PPIs in the PDBbind database and identified 17 PPIs that were suitable for helical peptide binding, and the helical binding sites in these PPIs were also predicted for designing novel peptide ligands. The L2 domain of EGFR, which was the top ranked, was selected as an example to show the protocol and results of designing novel helical peptide ligands on the searched binding site. The binding stability of the designed sequences were further investigated using molecular dynamics simulations.</p>

    <title>Introduction</title>
    <p id="p0010">Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) play a key role in numerous biological processes, and many of PPIs are therapeutic targets. Developing PPI modulators for therapeutic applications has therefore attracted considerable attention. PPI modulators comprise three main classes: proteins, mini proteins/peptides, and small molecules; however, the flat surface and relatively large area of PPIs makes developing small molecules targeting PPIs challenging <xref rid="b0005" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. On the other hand, protein therapeutics (particularly antibodies) that regulate PPIs are hindered by limited drug delivery systems, a short half-life, and immunogenicity. Compared to small molecules and antibodies, mini proteins or peptides are promising due to their high binding specificity, good design-ability, and lower immunogenicity <xref rid="b0010" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>.</p>
    <p id="p0015">The most abundant secondary protein structure in nature is the α-helix, which plays important roles in both protein folding and executing functions, such as protein-protein association, and α-helices mediate many PPIs <xref rid="b0015" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="b0020" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Additionally, α-helices are good templates for modification or mimicry. Several strategies have been used to develop helix mimics, including helix stabilization, helical foldamers, and helical surface mimetics <xref rid="b0025" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. To date, most of the <italic>de novo</italic> designed protein binders use helical structures to bind at the interfaces. For example, several successful <italic>de novo</italic> designs of protein binders from Baker’s group use helices as interface motifs, including protein binders targeting hemagglutinin <xref rid="b0030" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, interleukin-2 and interleukin-5 <xref rid="b0035" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, and botulinum neurotoxin B <xref rid="b0040" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Our group has successfully designed single-helix peptides targeting tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) <xref rid="b0045" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Thus, there is enormous potential for designing helical binders at protein-protein interfaces as PPI modulators.</p>
    <p id="p0020">Although many PPIs are mediated by helices, they can also contain other common recognition motifs, such as loops <xref rid="b0050" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref> or β-strands <xref rid="b0055" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Designing protein-protein interface binders based only on the structures of native binders limits design approaches, and the same protein binding site can often bind different structural motifs. For example, Kuhlman <italic>et al</italic>.’s redesigned the C-terminal of the RGS14 GoLoco motif, which has a coil structure, into a helical structure and found it bound to Gα<sub>i1</sub> at the original binding site <xref rid="b0060" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. In our previous work designing TNF-binding peptides, we identified a helical binding site on TNF surface that was originally used to bind the β-structured TNF receptor. We successfully designed helical peptides that bind to the identified site and inhibit the cellular activity of TNFα <xref rid="b0045" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="b0065" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>.</p>
    <p id="p0025">Considering the advantages of the peptide modulators mentioned above, there is a need to identify more protein-protein interfaces that are suitable for single-helix peptide binding. In the present study, we developed a computational method that can locate single-helix binding sites at protein-protein interfaces based on the structure of the protein targets. To reveal the interacting profiles of a single α-helix peptide ligand, we first collected a dataset of single-helix-mediated PPIs (protein-peptide or protein-protein interactions mediated by only one helix in one of the two partners) and analyzed their structural features and properties. Guided by these binding features, we then developed a general computational algorithm, HPer (Helix Positioner) that locates single-helix binding sites at protein-protein interfaces (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/proteincraft/HPer" id="ir015">https://github.com/proteincraft/HPer</ext-link>). HPer recaptured most of the known helix binding sites in the dataset and predicted potential helix binding sites in PPIs in the PDBbind database, which are not naturally mediated by a helix. These identified helix binding sites may be very helpful for developing novel PPI modulators, including helical peptides, helix containing mini proteins, or helical mimetics. We selected the L2 domain of EGFR from the identified targets, and computational designed novel helical peptide ligands. The molecular dynamic (MD) simulation results showed that the designed complex structures were stable.</p>

      <title>Construction of the dataset of single helix-mediated PPIs</title>
      <p id="p0030">We constructed a unique Dataset of Single-Helix-mediated PPIs (DSHP) based on the protein-protein complex structures from the PDBbind database 2014 <xref rid="b0070" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. The interfacial residues in the complex structures were defined using Rosetta InterfaceAnalyzer with a 5 Å distance cutoff. Secondary structure types of interfacial residues were assigned using DSSP <xref rid="b0075" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. For highly helical interfaces (whose helical content is larger than 80%), the continuity of helical residues was checked by residue number to ensure the protein-protein interfaces were mediated by a single α-helix.</p>
      <p id="p0035">The selected complexes were then clustered with a single linkage clustering method based on the target protein sequences, using a similarity cutoff of 95%. In each of the clusters, the complex structure with highest resolution was selected. All of the resulting protein-protein complex structures were further validated by visual inspection. 30 single-helix-mediated PPIs were collected in the current version of the DSHP dataset (<xref rid="s0075" ref-type="sec">Table S1</xref>).</p>

      <title>Computational design of helical peptide binders using RosettaScripts</title>
      <p id="p0040">RosettaScripts <xref rid="b0080" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref> was used to design, filter, and evaluate helical peptides sequences at the surface of the PPIs. The backbones of helical peptide ligands were first remodeled using “LoopModeler”. Subsequently, “FlxbbDesign” was used to design sequences of helical peptides. Before filtering and evaluation of the designed complex models, we used “FlexPepDock” in refining mode to optimize the binding pose of the designed peptides. If the binding pose of a helical peptide was significantly changed, the sequence was optimized again. The helical sequences were allowed to be mutated to 19 types of amino acids (proline excluded). The helical peptide with N, C- terminus excluded was defined as the loop region for “LoopModeler”. The resulting complex structures were evaluated using “InterfaceAnalyzer”, and structure models with lowest binding energy and good packing quality were selected for further computational analysis. Scripts for the above design protocol are provided in the <xref rid="s0075" ref-type="sec">supplementary material</xref>.</p>

      <title>Molecular dynamics simulations</title>
      <p id="p0045">All of the energy minimizations and MD simulations were performed with Gromacs5.1.4 using Amber ff99SB-ildn force field and TIP3P water model. The water box of a target-helix complex was first minimized for 10,000 steps with all protein atoms restrained. A 200 ps NVT and a 200 ps NPT MD simulations were performed for equilibration. Then, a 100 ns NPT production simulation was performed for the dynamic study of the complex structures. The simulations were carried out at T = 300 K and P = 1.015 bars using a 2-fs time step. The V-rescale thermostat with a coupling constant τT = 0.1 ps, and the Parrinello-Rahman barostat with a coupling constant τp = 2.0 ps were used. The P-LINCS algorithm was used to restrain all bond lengths to their equilibration values. The van der Waals interaction cutoff was set to 14 Å, and the long-range electrostatic interaction was calculated using the Particle Mesh Ewald (PME) method. Analysis of MD simulation trajectories were performed using VMD <xref rid="b0085" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref> and Gromacs <xref rid="b0090" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref> built-in modules.</p>

      <title>Analysis of naturally occurring single helix-mediated PPIs</title>
      <p id="p0050">To reveal the interacting profiles of single α-helix ligands, we collected 30 single-helix-mediated protein-protein complex structures from the PBDbind database (<xref rid="s0075" ref-type="sec">Table S1</xref>) and performed statistical analysis.</p>
      <p id="p0055">Generally, the recognition between a single helix and its protein target can be divided into three categories, with hot-spot residues distributed on one face, two faces, or three faces <xref rid="b0025" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. All of these three situations are present in the DSHP dataset (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). The target protein structures are diverse based on the CATH <xref rid="b0095" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref> assignments. The target protein of 16 cases adopted all-helical structures, including alpha horseshoe, up-down bundle, and orthogonal bundle, and in half of these cases, the single-helix ligands bound to the groove formed by orthogonal bundles (e.g., Bcl-2 family proteins) (<xref rid="s0075" ref-type="sec">Table S1</xref>). The other 14 proteins were α/β or mixed α + β structures.<fig id="f0005"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Typical cases in the DSHP dataset with single helix in three different binding modes, the one face (A), two face (B), and three face (C) modes. The corresponding PDB codes are (A) 1YDI, (B) 2WH6, and (C) 2BE6. Interacting profiles (white, blue, and red surfaces indicates interfacial carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen atoms, respectively) between helical ligands (purple cartoons) and the target proteins (green surfaces) were extracted from the complex structures. Predicted binding sites (red spheres in line) aligned well with the corresponding original helices. (For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.)</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gr1"/></fig></p>
      <p id="p0060">The length of the helices ranged from 15 to 33 residues, with an average of 24 residues (<xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>A), which was longer than the average length of participating helix (not solely helix) PPIs, which was 14 residues <xref rid="b0015" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. This indicates that, for PPIs mediated only by a single helix, longer helices are needed to maintain stability. We calculated the buried surface area per residue, the percentage of interfacial target protein residues in a regular secondary structure (α-helix or β-strand), and the percentage of hydrophobic buried surface area on the target protein side. In DSHP, the average buried surface area per residue of the helix binder ranged between 36.5 Å<sup>2</sup> and 86 Å<sup>2</sup> (<xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>B). The percentage of interfacial residues in a regular secondary structure on the receptor fell between 0 and 100%, with a 66% average value and a 27.9% standard deviation (<xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>C). This average value exceeds the corresponding value of general PPIs with diversified interacting structures <xref rid="b0100" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. The percentage of hydrophobic buried surface areas on the target protein side of the PPIs mediated by a single helix showed an average of 72.5% and standard deviation of 8.9% (<xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>D), which is higher than that from Regan’s study using 113 heterodimeric complexes with an average hydrophobicity of approximately 65% <xref rid="b0105" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>.<fig id="f0010"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Distribution of interacting profiles of structures in a dataset of single-helix-mediated protein-protein interactions in the DSHP dataset.

      <title>Computational algorithm for locating helical peptide binding sites at protein-protein interfaces</title>
      <p id="p0065">Our algorithm searched for suitable positions for helical peptide binding at protein-protein interfaces with good shape complementarity, which is regarded as the dominant factor for PPIs <xref rid="b0110" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="b0115" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. A set of atoms in the target protein that would be blocked in order to modulate the PPIs were defined as the targeted atoms and used as the input of our algorithm. In this work, all of the target proteins were in a known complex structure, and their atoms within 5 Å of the binding partner were defined as interfacial and used as the targeted atoms. However, our algorithm was not limited to be used on proteins with complex structures. Without complex structures, the targeted atoms may be obtained from other experimental or computational evidences.</p>

Subsequently, a plane crossing the principal axis was rotated from 0 to 360° with a 6° interval, and generated 30 planes. The plane with minimum summation of targeted atom distances was selected and defined as the principal plane (<xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>A).<fig id="f0015"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>Illustration of the HPer algorithm for helix binding position detection.

Thus, we estimated the interface properties of the target protein interacting with the helix axis, including hydrophobicity, buried area, and secondary structure composition. Interfacial residues were defined as residues with a distance of 7–13 Å to the helix axis. The secondary structure types of these interacting residues were defined using DSSP <xref rid="b0075" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, and the polar or hydrophobic buried surface areas were calculated by summation of the solvent accessible surface area of the interacting polar or hydrophobic atoms given by NACCESS <xref rid="b0130" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref> of the interacting atoms (<xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>D).</p>

      <title>HPer (Helix positioner) identifies known single helix binding sites</title>
      <p id="p0100">We tested HPer on the DSHP dataset to see if HPer could identify the position of the α-helix peptide ligands. The best position for a helical peptide binding on the corresponding protein-protein interfaces was predicted and compared with the position of the native helical binder. We then defined two parameters to measure the offset of a predicted helix binding position to the position of the native helix binder. The first was the distance between the center of the predicted helix axis and the center of the native helix binder. The second was the angle between the predicted axis and the axis of the native helix binder (<xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>A). As shown in <xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>B, the offsets of these two parameters in 10 of 30 cases in the DSHP dataset were less than 2 Å and 10°, respectively. For 25 out of the 30 cases, the offsets were less than 4 Å and 20°. The inaccuracies of the remaining five cases came from the bending of the helices, which are common in long helices, but HPer currently uses the straight axis representation for a single helix.<fig id="f0020"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><p>Recapturing helical peptide positions in the DSHP dataset. (A) The distance (d) between the center and the angle (θ) between the axis are used to evaluate the offsets between the predicted helix binding site and corresponding native helix position.

      <p id="p0105">Overall, HPer correctly identified helix binding positions of all three binding modes present in the DSHP dataset with good accuracy (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). Meanwhile, for the ten cases that were predicted with high accuracy, the predicted interacting profiles given by HPer showed good correlation with the corresponding values calculated using the real complex structure (<xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>C and D). These results suggest that HPer is capable of locating helix binding sites on protein-protein interfaces, and at the same time gives good prediction on interacting profiles for the potential α-helix ligand binding, which is important for <italic>de novo</italic> single helix binder design.</p>

      <title>Recovery of key interactions and hot-spot residues in native helix-mediated PPIs</title>
      <p id="p0110">To validate the capability of designing helical binders using the binding sites predicted by HPer, we redesigned helical binders for 8 PPIs in the DSHP dataset, of which the length were less than 30 residues and the binding positions have been accurately predicted by HPer, with a distance offset <italic>d</italic> &lt; 2 Å and an angle offset <italic>θ</italic> &lt; 10°. Structures of poly-alanine in helical conformation were first generated using standard α-helix backbone parameters (ϕ = −60°, ψ = −42°) and were placed at the predicted binding sites with the N-terminal to C-terminal in two different directions along the axis. The two helical poly-alanines in opposite N-C directions were then rotated along the helical axis by 60° five times. Therefore, the resulting 12 helical poly-alanine peptides were generated in various orientations as the starting structures for sequence design.</p>
      <p id="p0115">For each input binding pose, the backbones were remodeled and the sequences were designed using RosettaScripts <xref rid="b0080" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. In total, 2400 sequences were generated for each of the eight cases. The designed sequences were then filtered using the binding energy and packing score given by RosettaInterfaceAnalyzer. For each case, the lowest binding energy sequence with the packing score larger than 0.6 was selected as the designed result.</p>
      <p id="p0120">According to previous studies on structural properties of PPIs, the interfaces can be dissected into core region (fully buried areas) and rim regions <xref rid="b0135" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. The interfaces we designed were compared with native ones. In seven of the eight cases, approximately 68% of the core regions and 76% of the rim regions of native PPIs were covered by our designed helices (<xref rid="f0025" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). The interface of 2GL7 consists of a crooked groove, and the straight designed helical peptide only docked to a portion of the groove (<xref rid="s0075" ref-type="sec">Fig. S4</xref>B), which caused the low coverage of native interfaces in this case.<fig id="f0025"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption><p>Recovery of key interactions of core regions and rim regions in designed models of the eight helix-mediated protein-protein interactions.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gr5"/></fig></p>
      <p id="p0125">Hot-spot residues are a small set of interfacial residues that contribute the most to binding. Several computational protein design strategies depend on hot-spot residues, such as grafting <xref rid="b0140" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref> and anchor-based design <xref rid="b0145" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. Thus, we further identified native hot-spot residues for the eight cases using SpotOn method <xref rid="b0150" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, <xref rid="b0155" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref> and compared the results with those in the designed models. In six of the eight cases (2HWN, 2P1L, 2XA0, 2XZE, 3H8K, and 3KJ2), the hot-spot residues were successfully recovered with average sequence identity and similarity of 35.0% and 85.0% (<xref rid="t0005" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) at corresponding sub-pockets (<xref rid="s0075" ref-type="sec">Fig. S4</xref>). For the other two cases (1VTY and 2GL7), the backbone of the designed peptides were more seriously deviated from the native positions, which result in the worse reproducing native hot-spot residues.<table-wrap position="float" id="t0005"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Redesign of native helix-mediated protein-protein interactions.

      <title>Prediction of novel helical peptide binding sites</title>
      <p id="p0130">HPer was developed for the purpose of extending PPI druggable spaces and providing starting structures for novel helical peptide binder design. We subsequently screened the 1592 structures of protein-protein complexes from the PDBbind 2014 for non-helical containing protein-protein interfaces suitable for helical peptide binding.</p>
      <p id="p0135">The complex structures were firstly screened according to the following steps. 21,017 complex structures containing pairwise chains were extracted from multiple chain structures. Then, the complex structures with the interfacial helical content of the ligand protein higher than 30% were discarded, and the 13,547 non-helix containing protein-protein interfaces were maintained. Secondary structures of interfacial residues were assigned using DSSP and interfacial residues were defined using Rosetta InterfaceAnalyzer with a distance cutoff of 5 Å.</p>
      <p id="p0140">We used HPer to search for potential helical peptide binding sites around the interface of the remaining structures. Because stable helical peptide ligands are assumed to have at least 4 turns <xref rid="b0160" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref> and α-helix contains ∼3.6 residues per turn, we defined the minimum length of the predicted helical peptide ligand to be 15 residues. The minimum value of the 4 interface properties from the statistical analysis of the DSHP dataset were defined as the criteria to determine whether the site was suitable for helical peptide binding, including score<sub>fitness</sub> &gt; 0.7, buried surface areas/residue &gt; 35 Å<sup>2</sup>, percent of hydrophobicity &gt; 0.5, and α + β proportion &gt; 0.27 (outliers excluded).</p>
      <p id="p0145">The 144 structures satisfying the above criteria were then clustered by similarity of sequences with a cutoff of 90%.

      <title>A case study: <italic>de novo</italic> design of helical peptides binding to the EGFR L2 domain</title>
      <p id="p0150">Among the selected cases in <xref rid="t0010" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, the interface of the EGFR L2 domain binding with a nanobody (PDB ID: 4KRP) showed the highest fitness score (0.78) and good predicted properties for the binding with helical peptide binders (<xref rid="t0005" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). We used the EGFR-EGF interface as an example to test the feasibility of designing helical binders at the predicted binding site. EGFR is an important therapeutic target associated with many cancers and other diseases <xref rid="b0165" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. Currently, there are two types of EGFR inhibitors: antibodies targeting the extracellular domain <xref rid="b0170" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref> and small molecule inhibitors of the tyrosine kinase domain <xref rid="b0175" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. Although anti-EGFR monoclonal antibodies have advantages over anti-EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors, including their high efficiency, high specificity, and low toxicity, the antibodies suffer from limited drug delivery routes and immunogenicity <xref rid="b0180" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop novel EGFR peptide inhibitors with high specificity and better pharmaceutical properties.</p>
      <p id="p0155">The extracellular portion of EGFR consists of four domains, L1, CR1, L2, and CR2. Downstream signaling of EGFR is activated by the dimerization of EGFRs after EGF binds to EGFR’s L1 and L2 domain <xref rid="b0165" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. The helix binding site we detected on the EGFR L2 domain was used for binding with EGF (<xref rid="f0025" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>A). The EGFR L2 domain comprises six turns of a β helix <xref rid="b0185" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. The helix binding site we predicted lies on the flat surface formed by the five β strands. The loops at the end of the β sheets present a groove shape, which is suitable for helix binding. The Cα atoms of the predicted helix were superimposed well with some of the interfacial Cα atoms of EGF (<xref rid="f0030" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>A).<fig id="f0030"><label>Fig. 6</label><caption><p>Computational design of novel helical peptide binding with EGFR L2 domain<bold>.</bold> (A) Structure model of EGFR L2 domain (white) in complex with TGFalpha (green, PDB ID: 1MOX).

(For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.)</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gr6"/></fig></p>
      <p id="p0160">We then designed sequences for the helical peptide binding to the EGFR L2 domain at the identified binding site using RosettaScripts. Among the 24,000 sequences we designed (<xref rid="f0030" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>B), we selected the sequence (EGFR-Pep1) with the lowest binding energy (−40.35 REU) and very good packing quality (0.704). EGFR-Pep1 formed hydrophobic interactions with the two hydrophobic pockets on the surface of EGFR L2 domain, which are the pocket formed by residues L325, L348, and V350, and the pocket formed by residues F412, V417, and I438. There were also two hydrogen bonds formed on their interface, including T10-Q384 and E9-S418. The side chain oxygen of Q384 on EGFR is the only buried polar atom without hydrogen bonding. In addition, electrostatic interactions were designed around the core region of the EGFR interface, including R353, D355, and K465 (<xref rid="s0075" ref-type="sec">Fig. S6</xref>).</p>
      <p id="p0165">MD simulations were then carried out to test the binding stability of EGFR-Pep1 to the EGFR L2 domain. The designed complex model of EGFR-Pep1 and the EGFR L2 domain was taken as the initial structure. For the three trajectories of 100 ns, the system showed convergence in the first several nanoseconds of the simulation and the root mean square deviation (RMSD) of the Cα atoms during the simulation was maintained as less than 3 Å (<xref rid="f0035" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>A). This indicates the designed model might be stable.<fig id="f0035"><label>Fig. 7</label><caption><p>Molecular dynamics simulations of a designed helical peptide in complex with the EGFR L2 domain.

Results from three independent trajectories are shown in different colors.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gr7"/></fig></p>
      <p id="p0170">The designed salt-bridges between EGFR-Pep1 Glu5 and EGFR Arg353 were maintained, and the distance was within 5 Å in the simulations (<xref rid="f0035" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>B). The designed hydrogen bonds at the interface Thr10-Gln384 (<xref rid="f0035" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>C) and Glu9-Ser418 (<xref rid="f0035" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>D) were also maintained, and the corresponding heavy atom distance were around 3 Å in the simulations. Buried surface areas were slightly fluctuated around 800 Å<sup>2</sup>, and most of the interfacial contacts in the complex model were also not changed. (<xref rid="s0075" ref-type="sec">Fig. S7</xref>).</p>
      <p id="p0175">The results from MD simulations showed that the hydrogen bonds, salt bridges, and hydrophobic interactions we have designed between EGFR-Pep1 and EGFR were stable during the simulation. The novel helical binder EGFR-Pep1 might has the ability to inhibit EGF-EGFR interaction.</p>

    <title>Conclusions</title>
    <p id="p0180">We have developed a computational method HPer for searching for and evaluating potential α-helical peptide binding sites to modulate PPIs. In contrast with other programs such as Peptiderive <xref rid="b0190" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref> or PepComposer <xref rid="b0195" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>, which can be used to design linear peptide binders to a given protein surface, HPer focuses on searching for helix binding sites on the interfaces of the targeted PPIs. The predicted binding sites provided the initial backbone positions for the subsequent sequence <italic>de novo</italic> design of the helical peptide binders. With the cases we collected in the DSHP dataset, we have extracted the structural and property features of single α-helix-mediated protein-protein complex structures, which were used as guidelines for ranking the designed helical peptide ligands.</p>
    <p id="p0185">We demonstrated that HPer recaptured the positions of α-helix ligands and predicted interacting profiles in the DSHP dataset. Using the predicted positions, we carried out sequence design for eight PPIs in the DSHP dataset and recovered native hot-spot residues in most cases. We further predicted potential helical peptide binding sites in the PPIs from the PDBbind database and identified 17 preferable helical peptide binding sites in non-helix-mediated PPIs. Many of the 17 examples of PPIs are important therapeutic targets that can be explored further in future studies. We used EGFR as case study and designed a novel helical peptide, EGFR-Pep1, for the EGFR-EGF interface, which might have the potential as a novel EGFR inhibitor.</p>
    <p id="p0190">In conclusion, HPer performed well in searching for helical peptide binding sites for PPI targets and provided good initial structural models for novel helical peptides and their mimetic design. The DSHP dataset we have compiled should be useful for testing methodologies of computational protein-protein interaction design and for understanding principles of helical peptide and protein recognition.</p>
