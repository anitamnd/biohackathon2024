      <p id="P3">Approaches that integrate molecular network information and tumor genome data could complement gene-based statistical tests to identify likely new cancer genes, but are challenging to validate at scale and their predictive value remains unclear. We developed a robust statistic (NetSig) that integrates protein interaction networks and data from 4,742 tumor exomes and used it to accurately classify known driver genes in 60% of tested tumor types and to predict 62 new candidates. We designed a quantitative experimental framework to compare the <italic>in vivo</italic> tumorigenic potential of NetSig candidates, known oncogenes and random genes in mice showing that NetSig candidates induce tumors at rates comparable to known oncogenes and 10-fold higher than random genes. By reanalyzing nine tumor-inducing NetSig candidates in 242 patients with oncogene-negative lung adenocarcinomas, we find that two (<italic>AKT2</italic> and <italic>TFDP2</italic>) are significantly amplified. Overall, we illustrate a scalable integrated computational and experimental workflow to expand discovery from cancer genomes.</p>

    <title>Introduction</title>
    <p id="P4">Cancers are initiated when somatic mutations, copy number alterations, or genomic fusion events of specific genes (hereafter, we will refer to these as driver genes or cancer genes) confer a selective advantage to the corresponding cell thus promoting tumorigenesis. Identifying the driver genes in tumors of individual cancer patients provides key diagnostic and therapeutic insight. Therefore, it is a central aim of oncology to provide a complete catalogue of genes underlying human cancers<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>–<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>.</p>
    <p id="P5">The recent revolution of cancer genome analyses has enabled the statistical identification of cancer genes in an unbiased manner based on somatic mutations or copy number changes using gene-based statistical tests such as MutSig, Oncodrive, GISTIC and RAE<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>–<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>. These methods have identified many genes mutated or amplified at high frequencies (&gt;20%) in tens of tumor types<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>. However, for many tumor types, insufficient sample numbers, compounded by high background mutation and copy number rates<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> render it challenging to confidently pinpoint driver genes at intermediate (2–20%) or low (&lt;2%) frequencies. For this reason, a large number of putative driver genes don't meet established statistical cutoffs, and a large number of biologically or clinically relevant driver genes remain to be discovered.</p>
    <p id="P6">Many existing methods have been used to highlight network modules (based on functional genomics data) that are significantly mutated in tumors<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>–<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>. These analyses have been valuable for illuminating the biological processes and pathways involved in cancers (reviewed in Creixall et al.<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>). However, the evidence from network-based approaches comes from aggregating weak genetic signals in a set of genes connected into a network and not from an overwhelming mutation signal in any individual gene itself. This means that there is no strong direct link between specific genes in a significantly mutated module and the cancer in question. Additionally, since most network-based methods are only retrospectively evaluated through benchmarks, or by rigorously following up on only a few new genes, it is impossible determine how much ‘knowledge contamination’ (i.e., the notion that genes are more studied because they are cancer genes) introduces circularity and biases the outcomes towards more well established, or classic, cancer networks. These issues could be addressed by executing a systematic large-scale comparison of the tumorigenic potential of tens of genes embedded in a significantly mutated network versus a large number of known cancer genes (positive controls) and random genes (random controls), but such an analysis is lacking. Together this means that, if the aim is specifically to expand cancer gene discovery amongst genes with inconclusive mutations in existing cancer genomes, the real predictive value of network-based approaches remains unclear.</p>
    <p id="P7">Towards this aim, we developed a statistic (NetSig) that combines cancer mutation data and molecular network information to expand cancer gene discovery from tumor genomes. With NetSig we had a particular focus on addressing the effects of ‘knowledge contamination’ and on designing a method that is independent of gene-based statistical tests like MutSig, Oncodrive, GISTIC and RAE so that it can seamlessly complement these approaches in any tumor genome analysis pipeline. To test the predictive power of NetSig, we developed an <italic>in vivo</italic> quantitative experimental framework that enabled us to compare the tumorigenic potential of 23 genes with a significant NetSig score to that of 25 known cancer genes and 79 random genes in mouse experiments. Based on the network analysis and <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments nine candidates were particularly relevant to lung adenocarcinoma. We reanalyzed copy number data derived from 660 patients with lung adenocarcinoma to discover higher rates of amplification of <italic>TFDP2</italic> and <italic>AKT2</italic> in patients without established genomic driver events compared to patients with mutations and amplifications in known oncogenes. The code is available from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.lagelab.org/resources">www.lagelab.org/resources</ext-link> and the algorithm has been implemented in FireCloud (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://software.broadinstitute.org/firecloud/">https://software.broadinstitute.org/firecloud/</ext-link>).</p>

      <title>Design and properties of the NetSig statistic</title>
      <p id="P8">NetSig, combines data from existing cancer genomes (spanning 21 tumor types and 4,742 tumor genomes) and InWeb (a human protein-protein interaction network that has been used in the 1000 Genomes Project<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>) to calculate the mutation signal in a genes’ functional protein-protein interaction network. Since we specifically wanted to test the predictive power of mutations in a gene’s network, we excluded mutation information on the gene itself in the calculation of the NetSig statistic (for all details see <bold>Methods</bold>).</p>
      <p id="P9">To benchmark NetSig and to understand the effect of ‘knowledge contamination’ on the statistic, we defined a set of ‘Cosmic classic’ (i.e., very well established) cancer genes from the Cosmic database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/cosmic">http://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/cosmic</ext-link>) and a set of ‘recently emerging cancer genes’ from recent sequencing studies (<bold>Methods</bold>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). To test for cryptic confounders we also defined a set of random genes (<bold>Methods</bold>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). We confirmed that the ‘Cosmic classic’ and ‘recently emerging’ sets can be classified based on their NetSig score with an area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) of 0.86, and 0.75, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>, adj. <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05 for each of these AUCs, using permuted networks, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>). As expected the random control genes fit the null hypothesis and cannot be distinguished from other genes represented in InWeb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>, AUC 0.49, <italic>P</italic> = 0.8). We further show that NetSig can accurately classify cancer genes in ~ 60% of the tumor types for which we have data (<bold>Methods</bold> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Note 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Figure 2</xref>), illustrating the potential of our statistic to inform many different individual tumor types.</p>
      <p id="P10">The majority of genes scored by NetSig fit the null hypothesis and lie on the diagonal in a quantile-quantile plot, but there is an overall genomic inflation (lambda = 1.29) of the significances assigned to genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Figure 3</xref>). This could be due to ‘knowledge contamination’, the inherent polygenic nature of cancers, or a combination. To dissect this phenomenon, we removed the effect of well-studied cancer genes from our analysis (<bold>Methods</bold>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Note 2</xref>). The ability to predict ‘Cosmic classic’ cancer genes is reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>, from an AUC of 0.86 to 0.79) indicating some ‘knowledge contamination’ of this set, but effect on ‘recently emerging’ cancer genes is much less pronounced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>, from an AUC of 0.75 to 0.73). Consistent with these observations, we see that removing the effect of the ‘Cosmic classic’ gene set reduces the lambda from 1.29 to 1.09 in the quantile-quantile plot and that it only changes slightly to 1.07 when the impact of the ‘recently emerging’ set is also removed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Figure 3</xref>). Furthermore, running NetSig on random networks results in a non-inflated quantile-quantile plot as expected (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Figure 3</xref>). We also show that NetSig adequately normalizes for the amount of interactions a gene has at the protein level (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Figure 4</xref>).</p>
      <p id="P11">Together, these analyses show that there is some ‘knowledge contamination’ in the protein-protein interaction data specifically of the ‘Cosmic classic’ set and that this leads to a significantly inflated AUC in the benchmark if it is not taken into consideration. Conversely, there is almost no ‘knowledge contamination’ of genes emerging from recent sequencing studies. This means that when predicting new cancer genes from existing cancer genomes, ‘knowledge contamination’ should not confound the NetSig method when applied to protein-protein interaction data from InWeb.</p>

      <title>Predicting NetSig candidates from 4,742 tumor genomes</title>
      <p id="P12">To test if NetSig can predict new likely driver genes from existing cancer genome data we calculated NetSig scores of all genes that had at least one high-confidence protein interaction in InWeb and adjusted the result of this analysis for multiple hypothesis testing. We calculated NetSig scores both using the pan-cancer cohort of 4,742 tumors and using mutation data from each of the individual 21 tumor types represented in<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> (<bold>Methods</bold>). We declared genes with a false discovery rate (FDR) Q ≤ 0.1 using the pan-cancer data significant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>) and also declared genes with a Q ≤ 0.1 in each of the individual 21 tumor types significant.</p>
      <p id="P13">The pooled set (named NetSig5000, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Supplementary Table 2</xref>) contains all unique genes that were significant in the pan-cancer analysis or in at least one of the 21 tumor types. Our NetSig5000 set comprises 62 genes, of which we divided into five groups based on their known connection to cancer. Groups 1 (n = 12) and 2 (n = 9) contain genes already known to be involved in cancers based on significant point mutations or gene fusion events, respectively. These groups serve as a positive control that NetSig can identify known cancer genes. Groups 3 (n = 24) and 4 (n = 13) contain genes that have been speculated to be causal in cancers based on evidence from model systems or from gene expression analyses. Group 5 (n = 4) have never been linked to cancer (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Supplementary Table 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Note 3</xref> for more information about genes in the NetSig5000 set and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Figure 5</xref> for examples of NetSig networks).

      <title>Comparing the tumorigenic potential of 23 NetSig candidates, 25 oncogenes, and 79 random controls</title>
      <p id="P14">To confirm whether NetSig nominates candidate genes with bona fide tumorigenic potential, we tested the tumorigenic potential of 23 genes from the NetSig5000 set (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8">Supplementary Table 4</xref>, for selection criteria of these 23 genes see <bold>Methods</bold>), 79 different patient-derived mutations of 25 known driver genes (positive control, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9">Supplementary Table 5</xref>) and 79 random genes (random control, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD10">Supplementary Table 6</xref>) using a massively parallel <italic>in vivo</italic> tumorigenesis assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref> and <bold>Methods</bold>). The assay transduces and overexpresses barcoded cDNA constructs of candidate genes (and alleles representing patient-derived mutations) into activated small-airway epithelial cells [SALE-Y cells<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>] or activated immortalized kidney epithelial cells [HA1E-M cells<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>–<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>]. For each cell model (SALE-Y or HA1E-M) all genes (or alleles) to be tested are pooled, grown, and injected subcutaneously into immunocompromised animals at three injection sites per animal. In animals that develop tumors, driver genes can be identified by homogenizing tumors in the animals and by sequencing the barcodes found in the tumor cells (<bold>Methods</bold>).</p>
      <p id="P15">To compare the tumorigenic potential of the three gene sets across multiple cell models we developed a quantitative analytical framework that defines a gene as tumorigenic based on both <italic>in vivo</italic> proliferation rate of the tumor cells and the significance of the relative growth of the tumors (<bold>Methods</bold>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Software and Data</xref>). Our analysis showed that many of the tested NetSig5000 genes (11/23 or 48%) are indeed capable of driving tumorigenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b and c</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11">Supplementary Table 7</xref>).

      <title>Significant copy number gains of <italic>TFDP2</italic> and <italic>AKT2</italic> in lung adenocarcinoma patients</title>
      <p id="P16">Nine NetSig5000 genes (<italic>AKT2, FER, FRK, MOS, PIK3CG, PTK6, RASGRP1, RASGRP3</italic>, and <italic>TFDP2</italic>) validated with high confidence in a cell model (SALE-Y) that is particularly relevant for exploring genes that can induce lung adenocarcinomas<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>. Based on this observation we hypothesized that a subset of these nine genes may be responsible for driving lung adenocarcinomas in oncogene negative patients [meaning patients that do not have a known oncogenic driver event in the RAS/RAF/receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) pathway as previously described<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>].</p>
      <p id="P17">To test these hypotheses we used a dataset of 660 lung adenocarcinomas from TCGA and related studies<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>–<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup>. We first tested for copy number differences between the oncogene negative (n = 242) and the oncogene positive patients (n = 418), showing that the nine genes as a set have a significantly higher copy number in the former group (<italic>P</italic> = 7.0e-3, using Fisher’s exact test, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>). We also show that <italic>TFDP2</italic> and <italic>AKT2</italic> are individually found at higher copy numbers in the oncogene negative group (FDR &lt; 0.1 for each gene, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>).</p>
      <p id="P18">Through an in-depth analysis of the surrounding genomic regions, we ruled out that adjacent potential oncogenes are underlying the signal we see (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figs 3b and c</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Note 5</xref>) and we also confirmed that there is no overall difference in copy numbers between the two patient groups (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Figure 6</xref>). The genomic events observed for <italic>AKT2</italic> and <italic>TFDP2</italic> are not high-level amplifications. Rather, 3 and 4% percent of the oncogene negative patients have two extra copies of <italic>AKT2</italic> and <italic>TFDP2</italic>, respectively; and 4 and 14% have one extra copy of <italic>AKT2</italic> and <italic>TFDP2</italic>, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figs 3d and e</xref>). In the nine genes we also tested whether there is evidence for increased rates of gain-of-function single nucleotide variants (SSNVs) or insertions or deletions (indels) in the oncogene negative versus positive group, which is not the case.</p>
      <p id="P19">Given the dominating effect of the RAS/RAF/RTK pathway in lung adenocarcinoma, a more straightforward approach to gene discovery would be to make a targeted analysis of mutations or copy number gains in genes in the extended RAS/RAF/RTK pathway (defined here as genes that have at least one protein interaction to a RAS/RAF/RTK pathway member in InWeb). We compared the degree of copy number gains, and activating SSNVs / indels, in our set of nine genes to 100 matched sets of nine RAS-affiliated genes, showing that the set of nine genes identified through our approach are significantly more enriched for oncogenic copy number gains (<italic>P</italic> = 0.04, using permutation tests, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Figure 7</xref>).

    <title>Discussion</title>
    <p id="P21">Overall our integrated computational and experimental analyses firmly establish network-based approaches can contribute to expanding gene discovery from existing cancer genomes. Not only do the genes in the NetSig5000 set point to new genes in well-established oncogenic pathways (e.g., <italic>AKT2, PIK3CB, PIK3CG, RASGRP1, RASGRP3</italic>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Note 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Figure 8</xref>), but our results also point to potential new cancer pathways (e.g., <italic>TFDP2</italic> and <italic>MYO7A</italic>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Note 7</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Figures 9 and 10</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD12">Supplementary Tables 8</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD13">9</xref>). For details about the differences between NetSig and other network-based methods, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Note 8</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Figure 11</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplementary Table 10</xref>.</p>
    <p id="P22">An important feature of NetSig is that it is explicitly designed to disregard any mutation information on the gene being tested so that the signal comes from the genes network alone. This ensures that NetSig <italic>P</italic> values are fully independent of those from existing gene-based statistical test such as MutSig, Oncodrive, GISTIC and RAE (in fact, the MutSig and NetSig <italic>P</italic> values of the same genes are only modestly correlated, Pearson correlation coefficient = 0.05, data not shown). This design choice means that NetSig can be seamlessly combined with (and thus complement) gene-based statistical tests in any computational cancer genome analysis workflow (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Note 9</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Figure 12</xref>). The NetSig code is available from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.lagelab.org/resources">www.lagelab.org/resources</ext-link> and the algorithm has been implemented in the FireCloud cancer genome analysis platform (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://software.broadinstitute.org/firecloud/">https://software.broadinstitute.org/firecloud/</ext-link>)</p>
    <p id="P23">NetSig is flexible and can work with many different types of functional genomics network data (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Note 9</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Figure 13</xref>). Interestingly, the average genomic inflation when NetSig is run on different sets of transcriptional networks<sup><xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> (i.e., based on data that cannot be effected by ‘knowledge contamination’) is 1.14 and 1.11, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Figures 14 and 15</xref>). This is comparable to the lambda in the protein-protein interaction data when the effect of ‘Cosmic classic’ genes are removed from the analysis (1.09), suggesting that our approach to removing ‘knowledge contamination’ is efficient in canceling out that effect. This strongly suggests that the remaining inflation is due to polygenicity of cancers and not due to any bias or confounders of the NetSig statistic or network data.</p>
    <p id="P24">While we did not observe any evidence for gain-of-function single nucleotide variants (SSNVs) or insertions or deletions (indels) across <italic>TFDP2</italic> and <italic>AKT2</italic>, it is our expectation that with more samples in the future these genes will be enriched for such events. This is consistent with the observation that NetSig5000 set overall is enriched for genes with lower MutSig <italic>P</italic> values in the Lawrence et al, 2014 set (<italic>P</italic> = 0.04 using a nonparametric two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test). Together, our results strongly suggest that many genes in the NetSig5000 set are likely real intermediate or low frequency driver genes that will reach significance in gene-based statistical tests with more tumor genomes in the future. For a discussion of the study’s limitations, an estimate of how well the NetSig statistic predicts real cancer genes, and information on the benefit of including several cell models and genetic backgrounds in the validation workflow, see the extended discussion in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Note 10</xref>.</p>

      <title>Calculating the network mutation burden</title>
      <p id="P26">For a given index gene, NetSig statistic is formalized into a probabilistic score that reflects the index-gene-specific composite mutation burden [i.e. the aggregate of single-gene MutSig suite Q values from<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>] across its first order biological network and is calculated via a three-step process: First, we identify all genes it interacts with directly at the level of proteins, only including high-confidence quality-controlled data from the functional human network InWeb<sup><xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> (where the vast majority of connections stem from direct physical interaction experiments at the level of proteins). Second, the composite mutation burden across members of the resulting network is quantified by aggregating single-gene MutSig suite Q values from<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> into one value ϕ using an approach inspired by Fisher’s method for combining p-values: 
<disp-formula id="FD1"><mml:math id="M1" display="block" overflow="scroll"><mml:mi>ϕ</mml:mi><mml:mo>~</mml:mo><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mn>2</mml:mn><mml:munderover><mml:mo>∑</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mi>k</mml:mi></mml:munderover><mml:mtext>ln</mml:mtext><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mtext mathvariant="italic">qi</mml:mtext><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:math></disp-formula> Where p<sub>i</sub> is the MutSig suite Q value for gene i, and k is the amount of genes in the first order network of the index gene (i.e. the index gene’s degree). Third, by permuting the InWeb network using a node permutation scheme, we compare the aggregated burden of mutations ϕ to a random expectation. In this step, the degree of the index gene, as well as the degrees of all genes in the index gene’s network is taken into careful consideration. The final NetSig score of an index gene is therefore an empirical <italic>P</italic> value that reflects the probability of observing a particular composite mutation burden across its first order physical interaction partners (at the level of proteins) normalized for the degree of the index gene as well as the degrees of all of its first order interaction partners. Because we are interested in estimating the mutation burden independent of the index gene (so that the NetSig results are fully independent of gene-based statistical tests such as MutSig, Oncodrive, GISTIC and RAE), this gene is not included in the analysis and it does not affect the NetSig calculation. This also means that for any given gene MutSig suite significances are independent of NetSig significances (i.e., the Cancer5000 gene set and the NetSig5000 gene set are independently predicted).</p>

      <title>Classifying cancer genes</title>
      <p id="P27">For each gene represented in InWeb (12,507 or 67% of the estimated genes in the genome), we used the gene-specific NetSig probability to classify it as a cancer candidate gene or not. True positive genes were a set of ‘Cosmic classic’ genes and a set of ‘recently emerging cancer genes’. Specifically, the Cosmic classic set consists of 38 established (or classic) cancer genes from the Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer (Cosmic, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/cosmic">http://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/cosmic</ext-link>, e.g., <italic>TP53, BRCA1</italic>, and <italic>BRAF</italic>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). The ‘recently emerge cancer genes’ contains 61 genes that have been recently identified as cancer genes from the Sanger Gene Census dataset (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/census/">http://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/census/</ext-link>, e.g., <italic>MLL2, CDK12</italic>, and <italic>GATA2</italic>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). The gene set for the purposes of the benchmarking analysis is a set of 87 random genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). True negatives were defined as all genes in InWeb that were not in these three sets which is likely conservative as many of these might be yet undetected cancer genes. We used the NetSig probability as the classifier and calculated the AUC for each gene set. For estimating AUC significances, we generated AUCs for 100 random networks (from Rossin et al., 2011) and calculated the empirical P value.</p>

      <title>Using NetSig to classifying driver genes across 21 tumor types</title>
      <p id="P28">For each tumor type we calculated tumor-type-specific NetSig scores and classified the corresponding tumor-specific driver genes. For example, we assembled a set of driver genes from breast tumors (BRCA) by identifying genes significantly mutated in this tumor type in<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>. We used mutation data from this tumor type to derive NetSig<sub>BRCA</sub> scores and measured their classification performance on the BRCA driver genes, which they could accurately distinguish with an AUC = 0.76. We compared this result to the results using NetSig scores derived using the pan-cancer dataset. The pan-cancer NetSig score increased the ability to accurately classify BRCA driver genes slightly to an AUC of 0.77 (for more information see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Note 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Figure 2</xref>).</p>

      <title>Testing the robustness of the NetSig approach</title>
      <p id="P29">To test the robustness of the NetSig approach, we tried several alternative permutation methods and calculated the composite mutation burdens of gene networks using both Q and <italic>P</italic> values from the Lawrence et al. 2014 paper. Specifically, to generate the null distribution of network mutation burdens used to assess the significance of observations in the actual data, we both used a node permutation scheme and a full network permutation scheme. Where the node permutation scheme permutes nodes that have similar degree has the advantage of being much faster than the network permutation scheme [explained in detail in<sup><xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup>], the architecture of the original network is more precisely mirrored in the random networks using the latter method. We ran the full analysis using both approaches and compared the quantile-quantile plots (not shown), and classification of Tiers 1–5 genes. This analysis confirmed that the choice of permutation scheme does not have a major influence on the overall results (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>). In addition to using q values from<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> for step 2 in the NetSig calculation (above), we also tried using unadjusted <italic>P</italic> values. For this latter approach the quantile-quantile plots (not shown) as well as the classification of ‘Classic’ and ‘Recently emerging’ cancer genes similar to the results we report in the main text (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>).</p>

We performed NetSig analyses with the pan-cancer Q values, as well as Q values from each of the 21 tumor types for which they were available. As it is a technical limitation of the NetSig approach that it is currently not possible to make 5.5 × 10<sup>6</sup> network permutations we could not create a dataset where we correct for all 12,500 × 22 hypotheses tested in the NetSig5000 set. For that reason our work does not have the equivalent of the Cancer5000-S (the stringent) set from Lawrence et al.<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>, where the authors control for all hypotheses is carried out simultaneously.</p>

Specifically, our earlier work revealed that immortalized small-airway epithelial cells harboring an activating <italic>YAP1</italic> variant are rendered tumorigenic via activation of the EGFR/MAPK pathways [SALE-Y cells<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>] and immortalized kidney epithelial cells harboring an activating <italic>MAPK1</italic> variant are rendered tumorigenic via activation of the PI3K/YAP/NFKB pathways [HA1E-M cells<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>–<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>]. Briefly, we inserted each gene into barcoded cDNA clones and these clones were transduced into SALE-Y and HA1E-M cells in 96 well plates in arrayed format.

Two million cells per pool per site were injected subcutaneously into immunocompromised mice in three sites (interscapular area and left and right flanks) per mouse and tumor formation monitored. The experimental endpoint was reached when any tumor length exceeded 1 cm. Tumors were homogenized and genomic DNA was extracted and sequenced to determine the relative proportion of each inserted DNA barcode. The relative proportions of each barcode serves as a proxy indicating the gene driving a tumor.

We refer to outcompeted, but real, oncogenic clones in the tumors as ‘subjugated oncogenic clones’. It is possible to detect subjugated oncogenic clones by iteratively removing dominant clones from the cell pools and repeating the experiments. However, this is very labor intensive. We developed a computational approach where we iteratively removed genes that accounted for more than 50% of the reads in a tumor and repeated the significance of relative growth analysis described above. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref> we report the best FDR after zero, one or two iterations. We confirmed that the subjugated oncogenic clones detected computationally were indeed driver clones by comparing the results from our computational approach to results from the iterative experimental removal of dominant clones and repetition of the injection of experimentally reduced cell pools into mice from the Berger et al., paper<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>.

      <title>Choosing 25 genes for the validation experiment</title>
      <p id="P38">We selected the genes based on a number of biological (not being known cancer genes) and technical (available high quality reagents) criteria: <underline>First</underline>, we selected a set of genes that were either in group 3,4 or 5 of our literature curation groups (meaning they have not already been shown to be cancer genes in humans). <underline>Second</underline>, we chose the subset of genes for which there were already reagents (meaning open reading frame [ORF] constructs) available from the Genetic Perturbation Platform at the Broad Institute. <underline>Third</underline>, we chose the set of genes where the ORF constructs had been sequenced and i) did not have any mutations [i.e., that the sequence of the cDNA corresponded to the wild type] and ii) where the sequence of the ORF passed a high quality sequence cutoff to avoid testing ORFs where the sequence of the clone was ambiguous and could have unknown mutations. <underline>Fourth</underline>, the cell models are optimized for perturbations in certain pathways (i.e., the SALE-Y cells are rendered tumorigenic via activation of the EGFR/MAPK pathways and the HA1E-M cells are rendered tumorigenic via activation of the PI3K/YAP/NFKB pathways). We hypothesized that choosing a set of genes that linked to the pathways activated in each cell model would likely increase the chance to induce tumors in these models. We tested this hypothesis by choosing the 25 genes so, when possible, they interacted directly with members of the pathway activated in the HA1E-M model, but not in the SALE-Y model. However, we see similar validation rates in the two models so it does not seem to have an effect that we are ‘fitting’ the candidates specifically to the HA1E-M model (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Note 10</xref>). It is likely that the higher validation rates observed for Netsig candidates (138% of the theoretical expectation, <bold>Discussion</bold>) when using both cell models in parallel is due to a combination of these selection criteria (available reagents and connection to known cancer pathways in the HA1E-M model) and underestimates of the sensitivity of the assay because there is an upper limit to how many true positive oncogenes in a cell pool can induce tumors based on the issues with subjugated clones mentioned above).</p>

Two peaks were considered the same across tumor types if (i) the known target gene of each peak was the same or (ii) the genomic location of the peaks overlapped after adding 1 mega base to the start and end locations of each gene. For the second criterion, only peaks that contained fewer than 25 genes and were smaller than 10 Mb were considered [for more details see Campbell et al., 2016)]. Because we are executing a case-control analysis of the copy numbers of genes that induce tumors in the SALE-Y model relevant for lung adenocarcinoma our analysis normalizes out any potential effects of, for example gene size, amount of protein-protein interactions a gene has and so forth).</p>
