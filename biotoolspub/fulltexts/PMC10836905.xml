      <sec>
        <title>Background:</title>
        <p>The conversion of adenosine (A) to inosine (I) through deamination is the prevailing form of RNA editing, impacting numerous nuclear and cytoplasmic transcripts across various eukaryotic species. Millions of high-confidence RNA editing sites have been identified and integrated into various RNA databases, providing a convenient platform for the rapid identification of key drivers of cancer and potential therapeutic targets. However, the available database for integration of RNA editing in hematopoietic cells and hematopoietic malignancies is still lacking.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>Methods:</title>
        <p>We downloaded RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data of 29 leukemia patients and 19 healthy donors from National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database, and RNA-seq data of 12 mouse hematopoietic cell populations obtained from our previous research were also used. We performed sequence alignment, identified RNA editing sites, and obtained characteristic editing sites related to normal hematopoietic development and abnormal editing sites associated with hematologic diseases.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>Results:</title>
        <p>We established a new database, "REDH", represents RNA editome in hematopoietic differentiation and malignancy. REDH is a curated database of associations between RNA editome and hematopoiesis. REDH integrates 30,796 editing sites from 12 murine adult hematopoietic cell populations and systematically characterizes more than 400,000 edited events in malignant hematopoietic samples from 48 cohorts (human). Through the Differentiation, Disease, Enrichment, and knowledge modules, each A-to-I editing site is systematically integrated, including its distribution throughout the genome, its clinical information (human sample), and functional editing sites under physiological and pathological conditions. Furthermore, REDH compares the similarities and differences of editing sites between different hematologic malignancies and healthy control.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>Conclusions:</title>
        <p>REDH is accessible at <ext-link xlink:href="http://www.redhdatabase.com/" ext-link-type="uri">http://www.redhdatabase.com/</ext-link>. This user-friendly database would aid in understanding the mechanisms of RNA editing in hematopoietic differentiation and malignancies. It provides a set of data related to the maintenance of hematopoietic homeostasis and identifying potential therapeutic targets in malignancies.</p>

    <title>Introduction</title>
    <p>RNA editing is an important regulatory mechanism in the transmission of co-/post-transcriptional genetic information. RNA editing modifies the base-pairing properties of RNA molecules through substitutions, insertions, and/or deletions at the RNA level.<sup>[<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup> Evidence has accumulated that RNA editing plays a critical role in maintaining messenger RNA (mRNA) stability,<sup>[<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup> splicing,<sup>[<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup> recoding protein sequences,<sup>[<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup> and regulating the biogenesis and base-pairing interactions of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs),<sup>[<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup> as well as nuclear export and localization.<sup>[<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup> RNA editing also plays a variety of functional roles in gene expression. Furthermore, RNA editing can change the amino acid (AA) identity encoded within the coding sequence (CDS) or generate significantly altered protein sequences if editing leads to the formation of a stop codon. Editing that occurs within introns can affect splicing, effectively resulting in the generation of alternatively spliced products.<sup>[<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup> Hyper-editing of untranslated regions (UTRs) can cause the mRNA to be retained inside the nucleus, leading to the downregulation of the encoded protein's synthesis by preventing the transport of its mRNA to the cytoplasm. RNA editing can also play an interesting role in the diversification of micro RNA (miRNA) sequences, resulting in changes to their target repertoire.<sup>[<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup></p>
    <p>Adenosine (A)-to-inosine (I) RNA editing is the most prevalent type of RNA editing in mammals; it mainly occurs in double-stranded regions of RNA molecules and is catalyzed by the deamination of adenosines to inosine residues.<sup>[<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</sup> Therefore, the majority of RNA editing instances occur in regions where long RNA stem-loop structures can be formed and are particularly abundant among repeat regions.<sup>[<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</sup> A-to-I editing can be identified as A-to-G (guanine) mismatches, as inosine can be base-paired with C (cytosine) and is recognized as G during RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). By using DNAâRNA parallel sequencing technology, combined with bioinformatics, RNA editing can be distinguished from sequencing errors or human polymorphisms, and accurate information about RNA editing sites can be obtained by screening differences between genome sequences and their corresponding RNA products.<sup>[<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</sup> Several studies have shown that RNA editing has broad physiological significance in mammals.<sup>[<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</sup> Abnormal editing enzyme activity and editing dysfunction in coding or non-coding regions are associated with a wide range of human diseases, including cardiovascular diseases,<sup>[<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup> several neurological disorders, and cancers.<sup>[<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</sup> Therefore, studying the physiological and pathological effects of RNA editing is imperative.</p>
    <p>The maintenance of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) homeostasis is an intricate and highly conserved process that is regulated by various factors, including cell-intrinsic transcription factors, signaling pathways, epigenetic modifications, and cell-extrinsic hematopoietic microenvironments. RNA modification has been identified as a new layer of epigenetics via post-transcriptional regulation, among which RNA editing is known to regulate HSPC function. Multiple studies have shown that adenosine deaminase acting on RNA-1 (ADAR1) plays an important role in hematopoiesis. For example, ADAR1 knockout in mice may cause embryonic lethality due to defective hematopoiesis in the fetal liver.<sup>[<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]</sup> Conditional deletion of ADAR1 alleles can impair hematopoietic differentiation into progenitor cells and mature blood cells.<sup>[<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]</sup> Dysregulation of RNA editing may lead to abnormal hematopoiesis and induce malignant transformation and therapeutic resistance in many types of malignancies. ADAR1-mediated A-to-I editing deregulation drives the progression of 20 different types of hematologic malignancies and solid tumors.<sup>[<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]</sup> The activation of ADAR1 is associated with the dysregulation of inflammatory cytokine signaling pathways in the malignant microenvironment of hematopoiesis. For example, overexpression of ADAR1p150 splicing isoforms induces blast crisis transformation of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) cells; ADAR1 activation induces HSPCs in myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) to undergo malignant reprogramming into self-renewing leukemia stem cells (LSCs), driving secondary acute myeloid leukemia (AML) therapeutic resistance; ADAR1 also promotes the malignant regeneration of multiple myeloma progenitor cells.</p>
    <p>With the development of next-generation sequencing technologies, millions of high-confidence RNA editing sites have been identified in various human tissues.<sup>[<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]</sup> To deal with this large quantity of data, researchers have developed several databases that integrate various RNA editing data, such as DARNED (<ext-link xlink:href="http://darned.ucc.ie" ext-link-type="uri">http://darned.ucc.ie</ext-link>, University College Cork, Ireland), which contains information about approximately 42,000 human genome coordinates corresponding to RNA locations that undergo RNA editing;<sup>[<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]</sup> LNCediting (<ext-link xlink:href="http://bioinfo.life.hust.edu.cn/LNCediting/" ext-link-type="uri">http://bioinfo.life.hust.edu.cn/LNCediting/</ext-link>), which characterizes and predicts the effects of all editing sites in long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) across model animals;<sup>[<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]</sup> Editome Disease Knowledgebase (EDK) (<ext-link xlink:href="http://bigd.big.ac.cn/edk" ext-link-type="uri">http://bigd.big.ac.cn/edk</ext-link>), an integrated knowledgebase of RNA editome-disease associations, manually curated from published literature; A-to-I RNA editing events in human database (REDIportal V2.0) (<ext-link xlink:href="http://srv00.recas.ba.infn.it/atlas/index.html" ext-link-type="uri">http://srv00.recas.ba.infn.it/atlas/index.html</ext-link>), which is based on 9642 human RNA-seq samples from 549 individuals (31 tissues and 54 body sites) of the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project;<sup>[<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]</sup> and The Cancer Editome Atlas (TCEA) (<ext-link xlink:href="http://tcea.tmu.edu.tw" ext-link-type="uri">http://tcea.tmu.edu.tw</ext-link>), which characterizes &gt;192 million editing events at &gt;4.6 million editing sites from approximately 11,000 samples across 33 cancer types in The Cancer Genome Atlas.<sup>[<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]</sup> These resources provide valuable annotations for RNA editing sites and a convenient platform for identifying key factors driving cancer and potential therapeutic targets involving RNA editing sites. However, the integration of knowledge regarding the RNA editome in hematopoietic cells and hematopoietic malignancy is still lacking. Therefore, it is necessary to establish a hematopoiesis-related RNA editing database.</p>

    <title>Methods</title>
    <sec>
      <title>Data collection</title>
      <p>We downloaded RNA-seq data from patients with AML or CML, from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database, using the GEO series accession numbers GSE128603 and GSE163690,<sup>[<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]</sup> respectively; we also downloaded data from healthy donors. Total RNA and genomic DNA from 12 hematopoietic mouse populations with 150 bp paired-end reads was obtained from our previous study, and the raw sequencing data were deposited in the GEO database under the accession number GSE142216.<sup>[<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]</sup> In the RNA editing identification pipeline, non-strand-specific RNA-seq data could introduce more false positive editing sites. Therefore, we used strand-specific RNA-seq data. In addition, since identifying RNA editing sites requires at least 10 reads covering for the site, we selected samples with an effective base number of data greater than 25 Gb for calculation.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec>
      <title>Sequence alignment and identification of RNA editing sites from 12 hematopoietic cells populations and leukemias</title>
      <p>To accurately identify RNA editing sites using RNA-seq, we referred to previous studies on the identification of RNA editing sites.<sup>[<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]</sup> Briefly, RNA-seq reads of 12 hematopoietic mouse cell populations which were isolated from 8- to 12-week-old female C57BL/6J mice and 48 cohorts were separately aligned using Burrows-Wheeler Aligner (BWA: hettp://bio-bwa.sourceforge.net/, Sanger Institute, Cambridge, UK) to reference mouse (Ensembl GRCm38.85) and human (Ensembl GRCh38.93) genomes, as well as annotated transcriptomes. A read was considered uniquely mapped only when it had no second-best hit or second-best mapping model including no less than three additional alignment mismatches. Then, putative RNA editing sites were identified using our in-house script, via the same method used in our previous studies,<sup>[<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]</sup> using uniquely mapping reads after polymerase chain reaction (PCR) duplicates had been removed by Picard (<ext-link xlink:href="http://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/" ext-link-type="uri">http://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/</ext-link>).</p>

      <title>Excluding editing events with low confidence</title>
      <p>To remove false positives in mice, three filters were modified, as follows: (1) All candidate editing sites were excluded from single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (mm10 SNP142 version: <ext-link xlink:href="https://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/mm10/database/snp142Common.txt.gz" ext-link-type="uri">https://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/mm10/database/snp142Common.txt.gz</ext-link>). (2) For candidate editing sites located in short interspersed elements (SINEs) (Mus) or Alu (Homo), we calculated its editing frequency (EF): EF = the number of Gs/the number of (As + Gs) at individual editing sites. The EF should be &gt;0.02.(3) For candidate editing sites located in non-SINEs (Mus) or non-Alu (Homo): (i) the minimum number of supporting reads for variant alleles should be more than three reads and (ii) the minimum EF should be more than 0.05.</p>
      <p>The EF of each position was calculated as the number of reads with G covering the position divided by the total number of reads covering the position. To control for detection bias and remove false non-edited sites, if the reads coverage was â¥10 and the EF for a given site = 0, then the EF = 0; if the reads coverage was &lt;10, we assigned the given site as being not detected (or not applicable, NA). For each cell type, the EF of a given site is the average EF of two replicates. In addition, the Spearman correlation of editing levels between independent biological replicates was calculated for sites with reads coverage â¥10.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec>
      <title>Identification of differentially edited sites</title>
      <p>We identified sites differentially edited between AML and healthy samples, AML diagnosis and AML relapse, and CML diagnosis and healthy samples. We examined the differentially edited sites using the following criteria: (1) For each of the cancer types, sites edited in â¥2 tumors or â¥2 healthy donor samples; (2) the minimum EF should be â¥0.05; and (3) median EF of sites with â¥10 covered tumor and â¥10 covered healthy samples. Selected editing sites were statistically analyzed using Fisher's exact test (adjusted using the BenjaminiâHochberg procedure). Sites with false discovery rate (FDR) &lt;0.10 were considered differentially edited (by editing prevalence) between AML/CML and healthy samples. For each editing site, we calculated its editing percentage (EP) in each cancer type/tissue: taking sample i as an example, EP<sub>i</sub> = the number of differential editing sites of sample i (EF&gt;0) /the total number of editing sites covered sample i (EF&gt;0).</p>

      <p>Fuzzy search focuses on elucidating the correlation between RNA editing and hematopoietic development, and users can search for RNA editing sites of interest, from a variety of perspectives [Figure <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>B], Most abnormal editing events, locating in the regions of CDS and 3Î-UTR, induce several molecular consequences, such as nonsynonymous substitution, alternative splicing, mRNA stability change and mRNA expression change. Based on this, we classified RNA editing sites as follows: (1) "Hematopoietic cell population" [Figure <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>B] or "Editing pattern" [Figure <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>B]: Previous studies have shown that RNA editomes of different hematopoietic populations are markedly different. The different biological functions of group- or stage-specific RNA editing imply that RNA editing regulates hematopoiesis in a multidimensional manner. Therefore, in this module, we provide search options for "Hematopoietic cell population" and "Editing pattern." (2) "Gene biotype" [Figure <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>B]: A-to-I editing can increase transcriptome diversity and alter the regulation of lncRNA and miRNA. This can affect hematopoietic development and homeostasis maintenance. REDH categorizes these edited genes into three types for searching, namely, mRNA, miRNA, and lncRNA. (3) "Gene region" [Figure <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>B]: Specific editing events that occur in the CDS and 3Î-UTR regions may affect hematopoiesis by causing non-synonymous substitution, affecting alternative splicing, altering mRNA stability, and changing mRNA expression.</p>
      <p>The "exact search" can be limited by several filters, which allows users to search for RNA editing sites of interest through mouse genome information or site characteristics [Figure <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>C]. By entering specific information, such as a gene name, chromosome location, etc., the data output can also be limited to a particular functional region within an RNA editing site (intron, exon, or intergenic) in the dropdown menu. Exon regions can be further specified as CDS, 5Î-UTRs,âor 3Î-UTRs. The user can also choose whether editing sites occur within repeat sequences and whether they cause AA substitutions. On this page, users can accurately search for the target site and avoid unnecessary interference in the results. This can help users to rapidly search for the site they are interested in.</p>
      <p>Retrieved sites from both the Fuzzy search and the Exact search are displayed in dynamic and sortable tables that are automatically generated by data tables in the server-side mode, which can easily handle a large number of rows [Figure <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>D]. Taking the "antizyme inhibitor 1 (Azin1)" as an example, it has been reported that RNA editing of Azin1 can lead to changes in AAs, inducing the translocation of Azin1 protein (AZI) to the cell nucleus, enhancing the binding affinity between AZI and DEAD-box polypeptide 1, altering the chromatin distribution of the latter, and changing the expression of various hematopoietic regulatory factors, ultimately promoting HSPC differentiation. Our database also shows that Azin1 is highly active in terms of EF and gene expression at various stages of HSC development. The table is organized into 11 columns: chromosome (Chr), Position, Strand, geneName, geneType, Genomic region, Repeat, AA change, Editing pattern, Freqency, and Expression. The "Chr" and "Position" columns provide the <italic toggle="yes">Mus musculus</italic> genome location (GRCm38) of each editing site [Figure <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>D]; the "Strand" column indicates from which strand an edited RNA is transcribed [Figure <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>D]; the "geneName" column associates an editing site on a gene [Figure <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>D]; the "geneType" column categorizes edited genes into several types, including mRNA, miRNA, and lncRNA; the "Genomic region" column indicates whether the RNA editing site occurs within a functional location (CDS, 5Î-UTR, or 3Î-UTR) or corresponds to an intronic or intergenic region [Figure <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>D]; the "Repeat" column provides information on whether the editing site is located in a repetitive sequence [Figure <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>D]; and the "AA change" column shows whether the editing site affects AA substitution [Figure <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>D]. The "Editing pattern" column determines three editing patterns of RNA editing sites: stage-specific editing (mature-specific, LT-HSC-specific, ST-HSC-specific, MPP-specific, CMP-specific, MEP-specific, GMP-specific, Ery-A-specific, Ery-B-specific, Mo-specific, Ma-specific, and Gn-specific), group-specific editing (bipotent specific and multipotent specific), and stable editing, including various well-known hematopoietic regulatory factors that are dynamically edited. This information helps us to rapidly identify key editing sites during hematopoiesis [Figure <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>D]. Previous studies have suggested that RNA editing may regulate gene expression and protein function during hematopoiesis. To establish a regulatory correlation between transcription and post-transcriptional levels, we have integrated RNA EF and gene expression data during hematopoietic differentiation. The "Editing frequency" and "Gene expression" columns show the EF and the corresponding gene expression level of each site in 12 murine hematopoietic cellular populations, respectively, in a bar chart format. Users can click on the corresponding button to obtain the bar chart [Figure <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>D].</p>

      <p>The Disease module (<ext-link xlink:href="http://www.redhdatabase.com/Editing_Cancer/" ext-link-type="uri">http://www.redhdatabase.com/Editing_Cancer/</ext-link>) characterizes nearly half a million A-to-I RNA editing sites from approximately 50 samples in two types of hematopoietic malignancy. Clinical information, gene expression, and RNA editing of lncRNAs and miRNAs are also integrated into this module. This module enables flexible exploration of editing events of a sample or cohort. RNA editing events can be obtained based on a "Sample search", "Edit search" or "Exact search" [Figure <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>], as described below.</p>

      <p>The "Sample" page provides a list based on clinical data and characteristics of RNA editing for each sample. It provides editing site information for 10 diagnosed AML samples, 10 relapsed AML samples, 9 CML samples, and 19 healthy donor samples. Each sample's information is displayed in the form of a table [Figure <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>A]. The table is labeled "Sample" and lists clinical information and RNA editing site information for the selected cohort. The table comprises eight columns, including "the number of editing sites (n. Editing sites)", "Status", "Cancer", "Gender", "Age", "Race/ethnicity", and "AA Phase". The table can be sorted by various parameters, such as cancer type or tissue, gender, or disease status to generate cohorts for convenient searching [Figure <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>B]. We provide a download function so users can click on the sample name in the first column to download the table.</p>
      <p>The "DiffEd" page focuses on shared and differential editing sites (DiffEds) in hematologic malignancies, presented as two pages for AML and CML, according to disease type. Users can search for DiffEds of a cohort of interest. We compared DiffEds in three groups: diagnosed AMLs and controls, diagnosed AMLs and relapsed AMLs, and CMLs and controls. Editing sites were included if sites were edited in â¥2 tumors or â¥2 healthy donor samples; DiffEds were statistically determined based on Fisher's exact test. A total of 11,426 DiffEds (in 1782 genes), 4164 DiffEds (in 2242 genes), and 6974 DiffEds (in 1182 genes) were obtained for the AMLs <italic toggle="yes">vs.</italic> normals, diagnosed AMLs <italic toggle="yes">vs.</italic> relapsed AMLs [Figure <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>C], and CMLs <italic toggle="yes">vs.</italic> controls, respectively. The detailed information of the corresponding sample's editing sites will be downloaded when the user click on the circles. Here, we use CML as an example to introduce the usage of this page. The page shows the editing status of 9 CML patients and 10 healthy controls. Users can choose the number of disease samples or the number of controls to obtain shared editing sites between 10 healthy donors and 9 CML patients. A sortable table is generated, which can be sorted based on EF (CML_Freq, Normal_Freq) and the number of samples with editing sites (CML_Num, Normal_Num). The "Diff" column indicates whether the RNA editing site is a DiffED between two groups. This page provides data for identifying driver-like editing events in hematologic malignancies.</p>
      <p>The "Exact Search" function not only allows users to quickly filter RNA editing sites in hematologic malignancies but also enables comparison of editing sites among AMLs, CMLs, and healthy donors [Figure <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>D]. Users can refine their search results by selecting additional options, such as "Category", "Gene type", "Gene location", "Gene name", and "Genomic region". By using the "Category" filter, users can generate RNA editing sites that only occur in healthy donors, AML patients, or CML patients, or in both AML and CML patients. In the results table, we provide genomic information, strand, gene name, and gene type of each editing site. A bar chart based on the "Editing Frequency" column can display the EF of each site in all disease and healthy samples; users can click on the corresponding button to obtain this information. Furthermore, the "Category" column labels the classification information of A-to-I editing sites, allowing users to obtain information quickly and efficiently about an editing site.</p>

      <title>Enrichment module</title>
      <p>The Enrichment module (<ext-link xlink:href="http://www.redhdatabase.com/Editing_Enrichment/" ext-link-type="uri">http://www.redhdatabase.com/Editing_Enrichment/</ext-link>) explores the functional relevance of RNA editing. Editing appears to regulate hematopoiesis in a multifaceted manner, as different biological functions are associated with different groups or stages of editing during hematopoietic cell differentiation [Figure <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>]. In this module, 9186 sites that are specifically edited in a single population or group or stably edited across 12 populations are significantly enriched in 18 networks, based on a Metascape analysis [Figure <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>A]. Group-specific editing sites are related to "Methylation-dependent chromatin silencing", "Regulation of DNA metabolic processes", and "G2/M DNA damage checkpoint"; LT-HSC-specific editing sites are enriched in "Chromatin organization" and "Ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis"; ST-HSC-specific editing sites are related to "Chromatin organization" and "Protein polyubiquitination"; MPP-specific editing events are related to "Chromatin organization" and "Cell cycle"; Specific editing sites of CMP, MEP, GMP, MK, Ery-A, Ery-B, Mo, Ma, and Gn are significantly enriched in "Protein modification by small protein conjugation removal", "Mitotic spindle checkpoint", "Chromatin organization", "Protein modification by small protein conjugation removal", "Regulation of chromosome organization", "Histone H3K36 trimethylation", "SUMOylation", "Positive regulation of dephosphorylation", and "Generic transcription pathway" respectively. Users can obtain corresponding RNA editing site information by clicking on the enrichment results of interest. The list of results is divided into 10 columns, providing detailed information about the genomic location on the mouse genome, gene name, gene type, genomic region, whether it is located in a repetitive sequence, whether it causes base substitution, editing pattern, and a bar chart of EF in 12 adult hematopoietic populations [Figure <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>B]. Enrichment analysis shows that the abnormal RNA edited coding/non-coding genes are significantly enriched in a number of networks involved in hematopoietic malignancy. We listed several significantly enriched terms relevant to diseases and functions, as follows: "Cell cycle", "Cytokine signaling in immune system", "Regulation of DNA-binding transcription factor activity", "Hemopoiesis", "WNT signaling", "Cellular responses to stress", "Modulators of TCR signaling and T cell activation", "Cellular response to DNA damage stimulus", "Positive regulation of cellular component biogenesis", and "Signaling by Rho GTPases" [Figure <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>C]. The results table also provides a detailed display of the genomic location on the human genome, gene name, gene type, and genomic region. A bar chart of EF for each editing site will be explored among 20 AMLs, 9 CMLs, and 19 healthy samples.</p>

      <p>The knowledge module (<ext-link xlink:href="http://www.redhdatabase.com/Editing_Knowledgebase/" ext-link-type="uri">http://www.redhdatabase.com/Editing_Knowledgebase/</ext-link>) integrates experimentally validated RNA editing events that affect hematopoiesis and hematopoietic malignancies from published studies. During hematopoietic cell differentiation, there are 8 experimentally validated RNA editing events, which are distributed on 7 mRNAs and 1 lncRNA. We provide detailed information on these editing sites, including their "Editing pattern", "Species", "Gene location", "Gene symbol", "Gene type", "Genomic region", "Enzyme", "Editing type", and "Editing effect". These curated information are sourced from multiple publications, and users can click on the "PMID (PubMed Unique Identifier)" column to access the corresponding paper for in-depth understanding. We also curated 26 experimentally validated abnormal RNA editing events associated with 12 hematopoietic malignancies. To elucidate the association between abnormal editing genes and hematopoietic malignancies, we classified disease-related editing genes into 17 mRNAs and 2 miRNAs. We also collected 6 editing enzymes including the enzyme families of ADARs (ADAR1 and ADAR2) and the enzyme families of apolipoprotein B mRNA editing enzyme, catalytic polypeptide-like (APOBEC): APOBEC1, APOBEC3, APOBEC3A, APOBEC3B, and APOBEC3G. They are responsible for the abnormal editing events (primarily A-to-I and C-to-U [uracil] types). Most abnormal editing events, located in the regions of CDS and 3Î-UTR, induce several molecular consequences, such as non-synonymous substitution, alternative splicing, mRNA stability change, and mRNA expression change. In addition, we compiled seven RNA editing events on double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) from exogenous viruses associated with hematopoietic disorders. We have listed the effect of each abnormal editing event, sourced from 24 publications, and users can click on the corresponding PMID link for further information.</p>

    <title>Discussion</title>
    <p>REDH is a curated database of the RNA editome in hematopoiesis and leukemia. Several studies have shown that A-to-I editing mediated by ADAR1 plays an important role in hematopoietic development and homeostasis maintenance. Abnormal RNA editing may lead to the onset and progression of blood disorders such as leukemia and other malignancies. Currently, more than 20 types of hematopoietic malignancies and solid tumors have been reported to be driven by abnormal RNA editing. Some databases have already integrated disease associated with RNA editing, including EDK, TCEA, and REDI portal. However, a database linking RNA editing to hematopoietic differentiation and malignancies is still lacking. One reason is that cells of some hematopoietic development stages are rare, making it difficult to analyze RNA editing profiles.</p>
    <p>Based on our previous work, we designed REDH database, which is freely accessible at <ext-link xlink:href="http://www.redhdatabase.com/" ext-link-type="uri">http://www.redhdatabase.com/</ext-link>. REDH not only integrates 12 murine adult hematopoietic cell populations at different stages and identifies 30,796 editing sites through RNA-seq<sup>[<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]</sup> but also systematically characterizes nearly half a million editing events involved in hematopoietic malignancy, including those from 20 AML samples, 9 CML samples, and 19 healthy donors. The REDH database stores A-to-I editing sites and relevant metrics for each sample, including the distribution of RNA editing sites across the genome, regardless of whether editing sites occur within repeat sequences or cause AA substitutions, and functional editing sites in both physiological and pathological states. The database also includes details of gene expression associated with each RNA editing site. The database can be used to statistically analyze whether RNA editing sites are differentially edited in at least one cancer type. The database also comprises stage- and group-specific and stable editing patterns that undergo significant changes during hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) lineage commitment. Users can explore them in their genomic context by information tables. It also includes experimentally validated RNA editing events that have been demonstrated to impact hematopoiesis and hematopoietic malignancies. REDH provides driving RNA editing events and functional RNA editing events that are of relevance to hematopoiesis at various stages, as well as functional abnormal RNA editing events in leukemia, which can help to identify potential therapeutic targets for blood disorders, based on post-transcriptional regulation. We also integrated RNA editing events with hematopoiesis in two species, <italic toggle="yes">Homo sapiens</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">Mus musculus</italic>, and in both physiological and pathological states.</p>
    <p>Currently, the types of hematopoietic malignancies included in our database are limited, partly due to the mismatch between some published RNA-seq data and the detection technology of existing editing sites. To keep the database synchronized with developments in the field of RNA editing, we will continue to monitor newly published literature and expand the types of blood diseases included in the database. We hope our database will act as a valuable resource to explore molecular mechanisms underlying hematopoietic differentiation and identify potential therapeutic targets for leukemia and hematopoietic malignancies.</p>

      <sec>
        <title>Background:</title>
        <p>The conversion of adenosine (A) to inosine (I) through deamination is the prevailing form of RNA editing, impacting numerous nuclear and cytoplasmic transcripts across various eukaryotic species. Millions of high-confidence RNA editing sites have been identified and integrated into various RNA databases, providing a convenient platform for the rapid identification of key drivers of cancer and potential therapeutic targets. However, the available database for integration of RNA editing in hematopoietic cells and hematopoietic malignancies is still lacking.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>Methods:</title>
        <p>We downloaded RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data of 29 leukemia patients and 19 healthy donors from National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database, and RNA-seq data of 12 mouse hematopoietic cell populations obtained from our previous research were also used. We performed sequence alignment, identified RNA editing sites, and obtained characteristic editing sites related to normal hematopoietic development and abnormal editing sites associated with hematologic diseases.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>Results:</title>
        <p>We established a new database, "REDH", represents RNA editome in hematopoietic differentiation and malignancy. REDH is a curated database of associations between RNA editome and hematopoiesis. REDH integrates 30,796 editing sites from 12 murine adult hematopoietic cell populations and systematically characterizes more than 400,000 edited events in malignant hematopoietic samples from 48 cohorts (human). Through the Differentiation, Disease, Enrichment, and knowledge modules, each A-to-I editing site is systematically integrated, including its distribution throughout the genome, its clinical information (human sample), and functional editing sites under physiological and pathological conditions. Furthermore, REDH compares the similarities and differences of editing sites between different hematologic malignancies and healthy control.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>Conclusions:</title>
        <p>REDH is accessible at <ext-link xlink:href="http://www.redhdatabase.com/" ext-link-type="uri">http://www.redhdatabase.com/</ext-link>. This user-friendly database would aid in understanding the mechanisms of RNA editing in hematopoietic differentiation and malignancies. It provides a set of data related to the maintenance of hematopoietic homeostasis and identifying potential therapeutic targets in malignancies.</p>

    <title>Introduction</title>
    <p>RNA editing is an important regulatory mechanism in the transmission of co-/post-transcriptional genetic information. RNA editing modifies the base-pairing properties of RNA molecules through substitutions, insertions, and/or deletions at the RNA level.<sup>[<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup> Evidence has accumulated that RNA editing plays a critical role in maintaining messenger RNA (mRNA) stability,<sup>[<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup> splicing,<sup>[<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup> recoding protein sequences,<sup>[<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup> and regulating the biogenesis and base-pairing interactions of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs),<sup>[<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup> as well as nuclear export and localization.<sup>[<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup> RNA editing also plays a variety of functional roles in gene expression. Furthermore, RNA editing can change the amino acid (AA) identity encoded within the coding sequence (CDS) or generate significantly altered protein sequences if editing leads to the formation of a stop codon. Editing that occurs within introns can affect splicing, effectively resulting in the generation of alternatively spliced products.<sup>[<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup> Hyper-editing of untranslated regions (UTRs) can cause the mRNA to be retained inside the nucleus, leading to the downregulation of the encoded protein's synthesis by preventing the transport of its mRNA to the cytoplasm. RNA editing can also play an interesting role in the diversification of micro RNA (miRNA) sequences, resulting in changes to their target repertoire.<sup>[<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup></p>
    <p>Adenosine (A)-to-inosine (I) RNA editing is the most prevalent type of RNA editing in mammals; it mainly occurs in double-stranded regions of RNA molecules and is catalyzed by the deamination of adenosines to inosine residues.<sup>[<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</sup> Therefore, the majority of RNA editing instances occur in regions where long RNA stem-loop structures can be formed and are particularly abundant among repeat regions.<sup>[<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</sup> A-to-I editing can be identified as A-to-G (guanine) mismatches, as inosine can be base-paired with C (cytosine) and is recognized as G during RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). By using DNAâRNA parallel sequencing technology, combined with bioinformatics, RNA editing can be distinguished from sequencing errors or human polymorphisms, and accurate information about RNA editing sites can be obtained by screening differences between genome sequences and their corresponding RNA products.<sup>[<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</sup> Several studies have shown that RNA editing has broad physiological significance in mammals.<sup>[<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</sup> Abnormal editing enzyme activity and editing dysfunction in coding or non-coding regions are associated with a wide range of human diseases, including cardiovascular diseases,<sup>[<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup> several neurological disorders, and cancers.<sup>[<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</sup> Therefore, studying the physiological and pathological effects of RNA editing is imperative.</p>
    <p>The maintenance of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) homeostasis is an intricate and highly conserved process that is regulated by various factors, including cell-intrinsic transcription factors, signaling pathways, epigenetic modifications, and cell-extrinsic hematopoietic microenvironments. RNA modification has been identified as a new layer of epigenetics via post-transcriptional regulation, among which RNA editing is known to regulate HSPC function. Multiple studies have shown that adenosine deaminase acting on RNA-1 (ADAR1) plays an important role in hematopoiesis. For example, ADAR1 knockout in mice may cause embryonic lethality due to defective hematopoiesis in the fetal liver.<sup>[<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]</sup> Conditional deletion of ADAR1 alleles can impair hematopoietic differentiation into progenitor cells and mature blood cells.<sup>[<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]</sup> Dysregulation of RNA editing may lead to abnormal hematopoiesis and induce malignant transformation and therapeutic resistance in many types of malignancies. ADAR1-mediated A-to-I editing deregulation drives the progression of 20 different types of hematologic malignancies and solid tumors.<sup>[<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]</sup> The activation of ADAR1 is associated with the dysregulation of inflammatory cytokine signaling pathways in the malignant microenvironment of hematopoiesis. For example, overexpression of ADAR1p150 splicing isoforms induces blast crisis transformation of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) cells; ADAR1 activation induces HSPCs in myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) to undergo malignant reprogramming into self-renewing leukemia stem cells (LSCs), driving secondary acute myeloid leukemia (AML) therapeutic resistance; ADAR1 also promotes the malignant regeneration of multiple myeloma progenitor cells.</p>
    <p>With the development of next-generation sequencing technologies, millions of high-confidence RNA editing sites have been identified in various human tissues.<sup>[<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]</sup> To deal with this large quantity of data, researchers have developed several databases that integrate various RNA editing data, such as DARNED (<ext-link xlink:href="http://darned.ucc.ie" ext-link-type="uri">http://darned.ucc.ie</ext-link>, University College Cork, Ireland), which contains information about approximately 42,000 human genome coordinates corresponding to RNA locations that undergo RNA editing;<sup>[<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]</sup> LNCediting (<ext-link xlink:href="http://bioinfo.life.hust.edu.cn/LNCediting/" ext-link-type="uri">http://bioinfo.life.hust.edu.cn/LNCediting/</ext-link>), which characterizes and predicts the effects of all editing sites in long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) across model animals;<sup>[<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]</sup> Editome Disease Knowledgebase (EDK) (<ext-link xlink:href="http://bigd.big.ac.cn/edk" ext-link-type="uri">http://bigd.big.ac.cn/edk</ext-link>), an integrated knowledgebase of RNA editome-disease associations, manually curated from published literature; A-to-I RNA editing events in human database (REDIportal V2.0) (<ext-link xlink:href="http://srv00.recas.ba.infn.it/atlas/index.html" ext-link-type="uri">http://srv00.recas.ba.infn.it/atlas/index.html</ext-link>), which is based on 9642 human RNA-seq samples from 549 individuals (31 tissues and 54 body sites) of the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project;<sup>[<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]</sup> and The Cancer Editome Atlas (TCEA) (<ext-link xlink:href="http://tcea.tmu.edu.tw" ext-link-type="uri">http://tcea.tmu.edu.tw</ext-link>), which characterizes &gt;192 million editing events at &gt;4.6 million editing sites from approximately 11,000 samples across 33 cancer types in The Cancer Genome Atlas.<sup>[<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]</sup> These resources provide valuable annotations for RNA editing sites and a convenient platform for identifying key factors driving cancer and potential therapeutic targets involving RNA editing sites. However, the integration of knowledge regarding the RNA editome in hematopoietic cells and hematopoietic malignancy is still lacking. Therefore, it is necessary to establish a hematopoiesis-related RNA editing database.</p>
  </sec>
  <sec sec-type="methods">
    <title>Methods</title>
    <sec>
      <title>Data collection</title>
      <p>We downloaded RNA-seq data from patients with AML or CML, from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database, using the GEO series accession numbers GSE128603 and GSE163690,<sup>[<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]</sup> respectively; we also downloaded data from healthy donors. Total RNA and genomic DNA from 12 hematopoietic mouse populations with 150 bp paired-end reads was obtained from our previous study, and the raw sequencing data were deposited in the GEO database under the accession number GSE142216.<sup>[<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]</sup> In the RNA editing identification pipeline, non-strand-specific RNA-seq data could introduce more false positive editing sites. Therefore, we used strand-specific RNA-seq data. In addition, since identifying RNA editing sites requires at least 10 reads covering for the site, we selected samples with an effective base number of data greater than 25 Gb for calculation.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec>
      <title>Sequence alignment and identification of RNA editing sites from 12 hematopoietic cells populations and leukemias</title>
      <p>To accurately identify RNA editing sites using RNA-seq, we referred to previous studies on the identification of RNA editing sites.<sup>[<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]</sup> Briefly, RNA-seq reads of 12 hematopoietic mouse cell populations which were isolated from 8- to 12-week-old female C57BL/6J mice and 48 cohorts were separately aligned using Burrows-Wheeler Aligner (BWA: hettp://bio-bwa.sourceforge.net/, Sanger Institute, Cambridge, UK) to reference mouse (Ensembl GRCm38.85) and human (Ensembl GRCh38.93) genomes, as well as annotated transcriptomes. A read was considered uniquely mapped only when it had no second-best hit or second-best mapping model including no less than three additional alignment mismatches. Then, putative RNA editing sites were identified using our in-house script, via the same method used in our previous studies,<sup>[<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]</sup> using uniquely mapping reads after polymerase chain reaction (PCR) duplicates had been removed by Picard (<ext-link xlink:href="http://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/" ext-link-type="uri">http://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/</ext-link>).</p>
    </sec>
    <sec>
      <title>Excluding editing events with low confidence</title>
      <p>To remove false positives in mice, three filters were modified, as follows: (1) All candidate editing sites were excluded from single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (mm10 SNP142 version: <ext-link xlink:href="https://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/mm10/database/snp142Common.txt.gz" ext-link-type="uri">https://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/mm10/database/snp142Common.txt.gz</ext-link>). (2) For candidate editing sites located in short interspersed elements (SINEs) (Mus) or Alu (Homo), we calculated its editing frequency (EF): EF = the number of Gs/the number of (As + Gs) at individual editing sites. The EF should be &gt;0.02.(3) For candidate editing sites located in non-SINEs (Mus) or non-Alu (Homo): (i) the minimum number of supporting reads for variant alleles should be more than three reads and (ii) the minimum EF should be more than 0.05.</p>
      <p>The EF of each position was calculated as the number of reads with G covering the position divided by the total number of reads covering the position. To control for detection bias and remove false non-edited sites, if the reads coverage was â¥10 and the EF for a given site = 0, then the EF = 0; if the reads coverage was &lt;10, we assigned the given site as being not detected (or not applicable, NA). For each cell type, the EF of a given site is the average EF of two replicates. In addition, the Spearman correlation of editing levels between independent biological replicates was calculated for sites with reads coverage â¥10.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec>
      <title>Identification of differentially edited sites</title>
      <p>We identified sites differentially edited between AML and healthy samples, AML diagnosis and AML relapse, and CML diagnosis and healthy samples. We examined the differentially edited sites using the following criteria: (1) For each of the cancer types, sites edited in â¥2 tumors or â¥2 healthy donor samples; (2) the minimum EF should be â¥0.05; and (3) median EF of sites with â¥10 covered tumor and â¥10 covered healthy samples. Selected editing sites were statistically analyzed using Fisher's exact test (adjusted using the BenjaminiâHochberg procedure). Sites with false discovery rate (FDR) &lt;0.10 were considered differentially edited (by editing prevalence) between AML/CML and healthy samples. For each editing site, we calculated its editing percentage (EP) in each cancer type/tissue: taking sample i as an example, EP<sub>i</sub> = the number of differential editing sites of sample i (EF&gt;0) /the total number of editing sites covered sample i (EF&gt;0).</p>
    </sec>
    <sec>
      <title>Gene expression analysis</title>
      <p>The gene expression in each population was quantified using StringTie software (<ext-link xlink:href="http://ccb.jhu.edu/software/stringtie" ext-link-type="uri">http://ccb.jhu.edu/software/stringtie</ext-link>),<sup>[<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]</sup> with the parameters "-e -a 8 -rf". The reference genome was GRCm38 for mice and GRCh38 for humans. For each aligned RNA-seq experiment of malignant samples, FeatureCounts was applied to count the number of reads per gene,<sup>[<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]</sup> and a custom script was used to normalize these values in transcripts per million (TPM). The annotations were made on GRCh38 genomes for both AML/CML samples and healthy donors. (<ext-link xlink:href="https://ftp.ensembl.org" ext-link-type="uri">https://ftp.ensembl.org</ext-link>).</p>
    </sec>
    <sec>
      <title>Gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis</title>
      <p>To gain insights into the functions of stage-/group-specific edited genes in hematopoietic differentiation and differentially edited genes between AML/CML and healthy donors, Metascape (<ext-link xlink:href="http://metascape.org/" ext-link-type="uri">http://metascape.org/</ext-link>) was used to perform GO enrichment analysis. Editing sites were assigned to genes using BEDTools software.<sup>[<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]</sup> Background genes used in the GO enrichment analysis were determined as follows: gene expression of 100,510 Monte Carlo simulations of intergenic regions of 3000 bp length in each population was calculated by StringTie,<sup>[<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]</sup> with the parameters "-e -a 8 -rf". Then, the threshold of background gene expression was set as the 95th percentile; genes for which the expression level were greater than the threshold were designated as background genes.</p>

    <sec>
      <title>Database architecture and web interface</title>
      <p>Data were stored in a MySQL database(MySQL AB company, Uppsala, Sweden), and the web back-end was implemented using the Django web framework (Lawrence Publishing Group, Lawrence, USA). The user interface, tables, and figures were designed and dynamically generated with Semantic UI (<ext-link xlink:href="https://semantic-ui.com" ext-link-type="uri">https://semantic-ui.com</ext-link>) and jQuery (OpenJS Foundation, USA).</p>

    <p>REDH delineates the associations between RNA editing and hematopoiesis. It comprises three analytic modules: Differentiation, Disease, and Enrichment. A knowledge module is also established for organizing experimentally validated RNA editing events that impact hematopoiesis and hematopoietic malignancies that have been reported [Figure <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>]. Each module supports user-defined filters, dynamically generating tables based on user-defined settings, and the results are available for download.

      </fig>
      <p>Fuzzy search focuses on elucidating the correlation between RNA editing and hematopoietic development, and users can search for RNA editing sites of interest, from a variety of perspectives [Figure <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>B], Most abnormal editing events, locating in the regions of CDS and 3Î-UTR, induce several molecular consequences, such as nonsynonymous substitution, alternative splicing, mRNA stability change and mRNA expression change. Based on this, we classified RNA editing sites as follows: (1) "Hematopoietic cell population" [Figure <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>B] or "Editing pattern" [Figure <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>B]: Previous studies have shown that RNA editomes of different hematopoietic populations are markedly different. The different biological functions of group- or stage-specific RNA editing imply that RNA editing regulates hematopoiesis in a multidimensional manner. Therefore, in this module, we provide search options for "Hematopoietic cell population" and "Editing pattern." (2) "Gene biotype" [Figure <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>B]: A-to-I editing can increase transcriptome diversity and alter the regulation of lncRNA and miRNA. This can affect hematopoietic development and homeostasis maintenance. REDH categorizes these edited genes into three types for searching, namely, mRNA, miRNA, and lncRNA. (3) "Gene region" [Figure <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>B]: Specific editing events that occur in the CDS and 3Î-UTR regions may affect hematopoiesis by causing non-synonymous substitution, affecting alternative splicing, altering mRNA stability, and changing mRNA expression.</p>
      <p>The "exact search" can be limited by several filters, which allows users to search for RNA editing sites of interest through mouse genome information or site characteristics [Figure <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>C]. By entering specific information, such as a gene name, chromosome location, etc., the data output can also be limited to a particular functional region within an RNA editing site (intron, exon, or intergenic) in the dropdown menu. Exon regions can be further specified as CDS, 5Î-UTRs,âor 3Î-UTRs. The user can also choose whether editing sites occur within repeat sequences and whether they cause AA substitutions. On this page, users can accurately search for the target site and avoid unnecessary interference in the results. This can help users to rapidly search for the site they are interested in.</p>
      <p>Retrieved sites from both the Fuzzy search and the Exact search are displayed in dynamic and sortable tables that are automatically generated by data tables in the server-side mode, which can easily handle a large number of rows [Figure <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>D]. Taking the "antizyme inhibitor 1 (Azin1)" as an example, it has been reported that RNA editing of Azin1 can lead to changes in AAs, inducing the translocation of Azin1 protein (AZI) to the cell nucleus, enhancing the binding affinity between AZI and DEAD-box polypeptide 1, altering the chromatin distribution of the latter, and changing the expression of various hematopoietic regulatory factors, ultimately promoting HSPC differentiation. Our database also shows that Azin1 is highly active in terms of EF and gene expression at various stages of HSC development. The table is organized into 11 columns: chromosome (Chr), Position, Strand, geneName, geneType, Genomic region, Repeat, AA change, Editing pattern, Freqency, and Expression. The "Chr" and "Position" columns provide the <italic toggle="yes">Mus musculus</italic> genome location (GRCm38) of each editing site [Figure <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>D]; the "Strand" column indicates from which strand an edited RNA is transcribed [Figure <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>D]; the "geneName" column associates an editing site on a gene [Figure <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>D]; the "geneType" column categorizes edited genes into several types, including mRNA, miRNA, and lncRNA; the "Genomic region" column indicates whether the RNA editing site occurs within a functional location (CDS, 5Î-UTR, or 3Î-UTR) or corresponds to an intronic or intergenic region [Figure <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>D]; the "Repeat" column provides information on whether the editing site is located in a repetitive sequence [Figure <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>D]; and the "AA change" column shows whether the editing site affects AA substitution [Figure <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>D]. The "Editing pattern" column determines three editing patterns of RNA editing sites: stage-specific editing (mature-specific, LT-HSC-specific, ST-HSC-specific, MPP-specific, CMP-specific, MEP-specific, GMP-specific, Ery-A-specific, Ery-B-specific, Mo-specific, Ma-specific, and Gn-specific), group-specific editing (bipotent specific and multipotent specific), and stable editing, including various well-known hematopoietic regulatory factors that are dynamically edited. This information helps us to rapidly identify key editing sites during hematopoiesis [Figure <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>D]. Previous studies have suggested that RNA editing may regulate gene expression and protein function during hematopoiesis. To establish a regulatory correlation between transcription and post-transcriptional levels, we have integrated RNA EF and gene expression data during hematopoietic differentiation. The "Editing frequency" and "Gene expression" columns show the EF and the corresponding gene expression level of each site in 12 murine hematopoietic cellular populations, respectively, in a bar chart format. Users can click on the corresponding button to obtain the bar chart [Figure <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>D].</p>

      <title>Disease module</title>
      <p>The Disease module (<ext-link xlink:href="http://www.redhdatabase.com/Editing_Cancer/" ext-link-type="uri">http://www.redhdatabase.com/Editing_Cancer/</ext-link>) characterizes nearly half a million A-to-I RNA editing sites from approximately 50 samples in two types of hematopoietic malignancy. Clinical information, gene expression, and RNA editing of lncRNAs and miRNAs are also integrated into this module. This module enables flexible exploration of editing events of a sample or cohort. RNA editing events can be obtained based on a "Sample search", "Edit search" or "Exact search" [Figure <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>], as described below.</p>

      <p>The "Sample" page provides a list based on clinical data and characteristics of RNA editing for each sample. It provides editing site information for 10 diagnosed AML samples, 10 relapsed AML samples, 9 CML samples, and 19 healthy donor samples. Each sample's information is displayed in the form of a table [Figure <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>A]. The table is labeled "Sample" and lists clinical information and RNA editing site information for the selected cohort. The table comprises eight columns, including "the number of editing sites (n. Editing sites)", "Status", "Cancer", "Gender", "Age", "Race/ethnicity", and "AA Phase". The table can be sorted by various parameters, such as cancer type or tissue, gender, or disease status to generate cohorts for convenient searching [Figure <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>B]. We provide a download function so users can click on the sample name in the first column to download the table.</p>
      <p>The "DiffEd" page focuses on shared and differential editing sites (DiffEds) in hematologic malignancies, presented as two pages for AML and CML, according to disease type. Users can search for DiffEds of a cohort of interest. We compared DiffEds in three groups: diagnosed AMLs and controls, diagnosed AMLs and relapsed AMLs, and CMLs and controls. Editing sites were included if sites were edited in â¥2 tumors or â¥2 healthy donor samples; DiffEds were statistically determined based on Fisher's exact test. A total of 11,426 DiffEds (in 1782 genes), 4164 DiffEds (in 2242 genes), and 6974 DiffEds (in 1182 genes) were obtained for the AMLs <italic toggle="yes">vs.</italic> normals, diagnosed AMLs <italic toggle="yes">vs.</italic> relapsed AMLs [Figure <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>C], and CMLs <italic toggle="yes">vs.</italic> controls, respectively. The detailed information of the corresponding sample's editing sites will be downloaded when the user click on the circles. Here, we use CML as an example to introduce the usage of this page. The page shows the editing status of 9 CML patients and 10 healthy controls. Users can choose the number of disease samples or the number of controls to obtain shared editing sites between 10 healthy donors and 9 CML patients. A sortable table is generated, which can be sorted based on EF (CML_Freq, Normal_Freq) and the number of samples with editing sites (CML_Num, Normal_Num). The "Diff" column indicates whether the RNA editing site is a DiffED between two groups. This page provides data for identifying driver-like editing events in hematologic malignancies.</p>
      <p>The "Exact Search" function not only allows users to quickly filter RNA editing sites in hematologic malignancies but also enables comparison of editing sites among AMLs, CMLs, and healthy donors [Figure <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>D]. Users can refine their search results by selecting additional options, such as "Category", "Gene type", "Gene location", "Gene name", and "Genomic region". By using the "Category" filter, users can generate RNA editing sites that only occur in healthy donors, AML patients, or CML patients, or in both AML and CML patients. In the results table, we provide genomic information, strand, gene name, and gene type of each editing site. A bar chart based on the "Editing Frequency" column can display the EF of each site in all disease and healthy samples; users can click on the corresponding button to obtain this information. Furthermore, the "Category" column labels the classification information of A-to-I editing sites, allowing users to obtain information quickly and efficiently about an editing site.</p>

      <title>Enrichment module</title>
      <p>The Enrichment module (<ext-link xlink:href="http://www.redhdatabase.com/Editing_Enrichment/" ext-link-type="uri">http://www.redhdatabase.com/Editing_Enrichment/</ext-link>) explores the functional relevance of RNA editing. Editing appears to regulate hematopoiesis in a multifaceted manner, as different biological functions are associated with different groups or stages of editing during hematopoietic cell differentiation [Figure <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>]. In this module, 9186 sites that are specifically edited in a single population or group or stably edited across 12 populations are significantly enriched in 18 networks, based on a Metascape analysis [Figure <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>A]. Group-specific editing sites are related to "Methylation-dependent chromatin silencing", "Regulation of DNA metabolic processes", and "G2/M DNA damage checkpoint"; LT-HSC-specific editing sites are enriched in "Chromatin organization" and "Ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis"; ST-HSC-specific editing sites are related to "Chromatin organization" and "Protein polyubiquitination"; MPP-specific editing events are related to "Chromatin organization" and "Cell cycle"; Specific editing sites of CMP, MEP, GMP, MK, Ery-A, Ery-B, Mo, Ma, and Gn are significantly enriched in "Protein modification by small protein conjugation removal", "Mitotic spindle checkpoint", "Chromatin organization", "Protein modification by small protein conjugation removal", "Regulation of chromosome organization", "Histone H3K36 trimethylation", "SUMOylation", "Positive regulation of dephosphorylation", and "Generic transcription pathway" respectively. Users can obtain corresponding RNA editing site information by clicking on the enrichment results of interest. The list of results is divided into 10 columns, providing detailed information about the genomic location on the mouse genome, gene name, gene type, genomic region, whether it is located in a repetitive sequence, whether it causes base substitution, editing pattern, and a bar chart of EF in 12 adult hematopoietic populations [Figure <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>B]. Enrichment analysis shows that the abnormal RNA edited coding/non-coding genes are significantly enriched in a number of networks involved in hematopoietic malignancy. We listed several significantly enriched terms relevant to diseases and functions, as follows: "Cell cycle", "Cytokine signaling in immune system", "Regulation of DNA-binding transcription factor activity", "Hemopoiesis", "WNT signaling", "Cellular responses to stress", "Modulators of TCR signaling and T cell activation", "Cellular response to DNA damage stimulus", "Positive regulation of cellular component biogenesis", and "Signaling by Rho GTPases" [Figure <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>C]. The results table also provides a detailed display of the genomic location on the human genome, gene name, gene type, and genomic region. A bar chart of EF for each editing site will be explored among 20 AMLs, 9 CMLs, and 19 healthy samples.</p>

      <p>The knowledge module (<ext-link xlink:href="http://www.redhdatabase.com/Editing_Knowledgebase/" ext-link-type="uri">http://www.redhdatabase.com/Editing_Knowledgebase/</ext-link>) integrates experimentally validated RNA editing events that affect hematopoiesis and hematopoietic malignancies from published studies. During hematopoietic cell differentiation, there are 8 experimentally validated RNA editing events, which are distributed on 7 mRNAs and 1 lncRNA. We provide detailed information on these editing sites, including their "Editing pattern", "Species", "Gene location", "Gene symbol", "Gene type", "Genomic region", "Enzyme", "Editing type", and "Editing effect". These curated information are sourced from multiple publications, and users can click on the "PMID (PubMed Unique Identifier)" column to access the corresponding paper for in-depth understanding. We also curated 26 experimentally validated abnormal RNA editing events associated with 12 hematopoietic malignancies. To elucidate the association between abnormal editing genes and hematopoietic malignancies, we classified disease-related editing genes into 17 mRNAs and 2 miRNAs. We also collected 6 editing enzymes including the enzyme families of ADARs (ADAR1 and ADAR2) and the enzyme families of apolipoprotein B mRNA editing enzyme, catalytic polypeptide-like (APOBEC): APOBEC1, APOBEC3, APOBEC3A, APOBEC3B, and APOBEC3G. They are responsible for the abnormal editing events (primarily A-to-I and C-to-U [uracil] types). Most abnormal editing events, located in the regions of CDS and 3Î-UTR, induce several molecular consequences, such as non-synonymous substitution, alternative splicing, mRNA stability change, and mRNA expression change. In addition, we compiled seven RNA editing events on double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) from exogenous viruses associated with hematopoietic disorders. We have listed the effect of each abnormal editing event, sourced from 24 publications, and users can click on the corresponding PMID link for further information.</p>

    <title>Discussion</title>
    <p>REDH is a curated database of the RNA editome in hematopoiesis and leukemia. Several studies have shown that A-to-I editing mediated by ADAR1 plays an important role in hematopoietic development and homeostasis maintenance. Abnormal RNA editing may lead to the onset and progression of blood disorders such as leukemia and other malignancies. Currently, more than 20 types of hematopoietic malignancies and solid tumors have been reported to be driven by abnormal RNA editing. Some databases have already integrated disease associated with RNA editing, including EDK, TCEA, and REDI portal. However, a database linking RNA editing to hematopoietic differentiation and malignancies is still lacking. One reason is that cells of some hematopoietic development stages are rare, making it difficult to analyze RNA editing profiles.</p>
    <p>Based on our previous work, we designed REDH database, which is freely accessible at <ext-link xlink:href="http://www.redhdatabase.com/" ext-link-type="uri">http://www.redhdatabase.com/</ext-link>. REDH not only integrates 12 murine adult hematopoietic cell populations at different stages and identifies 30,796 editing sites through RNA-seq<sup>[<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]</sup> but also systematically characterizes nearly half a million editing events involved in hematopoietic malignancy, including those from 20 AML samples, 9 CML samples, and 19 healthy donors. The REDH database stores A-to-I editing sites and relevant metrics for each sample, including the distribution of RNA editing sites across the genome, regardless of whether editing sites occur within repeat sequences or cause AA substitutions, and functional editing sites in both physiological and pathological states. The database also includes details of gene expression associated with each RNA editing site. The database can be used to statistically analyze whether RNA editing sites are differentially edited in at least one cancer type. The database also comprises stage- and group-specific and stable editing patterns that undergo significant changes during hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) lineage commitment. Users can explore them in their genomic context by information tables. It also includes experimentally validated RNA editing events that have been demonstrated to impact hematopoiesis and hematopoietic malignancies. REDH provides driving RNA editing events and functional RNA editing events that are of relevance to hematopoiesis at various stages, as well as functional abnormal RNA editing events in leukemia, which can help to identify potential therapeutic targets for blood disorders, based on post-transcriptional regulation. We also integrated RNA editing events with hematopoiesis in two species, <italic toggle="yes">Homo sapiens</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">Mus musculus</italic>, and in both physiological and pathological states.</p>
    <p>Currently, the types of hematopoietic malignancies included in our database are limited, partly due to the mismatch between some published RNA-seq data and the detection technology of existing editing sites. To keep the database synchronized with developments in the field of RNA editing, we will continue to monitor newly published literature and expand the types of blood diseases included in the database. We hope our database will act as a valuable resource to explore molecular mechanisms underlying hematopoietic differentiation and identify potential therapeutic targets for leukemia and hematopoietic malignancies.</p>
