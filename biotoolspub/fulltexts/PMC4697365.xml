      <p id="P3">Genetic risk for breast cancer is conferred by a combination of multiple variants of small effect. To better understand how risk loci might combine, we examined whether risk-associated genes share regulatory mechanisms. We created a breast cancer gene regulatory network between transcription factors (TFs) and putative target genes (regulons) and asked whether specific regulons are enriched for genes associated with risk loci via eQTLs. We identified 36 overlapping regulons that were enriched and formed a distinct cluster within the network, suggesting shared biology. The risk-TFs driving these regulons are frequently mutated in cancer and lie in two opposing subgroups, which relate to ER<sup>+</sup> luminal A/B and to ER<sup>−</sup> basal-like cancers and to different, luminal epithelial cell populations in the adult mammary gland. Our network approach provides a foundation to reveal the regulatory circuits governing breast cancer, to identify targets for intervention, and is transferable to other disease settings.</p>

    <title>Introduction</title>
    <p id="P4">Polygenic disease susceptibility results in a distribution of risk within the population. Given the large number of known risk loci there is a huge number of possible combinations of genotypes associated with high risk. Therefore, in parallel with the ongoing analysis of individual loci, a framework is needed to understand how multiple risk variants can combine at the cellular level, and indicate whether they work through many different mechanisms or – which would be more tractable for understanding and intervention – whether they converge on just a few. Germline variants will interact not only with each other, but with exposures and with acquired somatic events. Ideally, the framework should be able to capture these interactions.</p>
    <p id="P5">Systems biology approaches may be able provide such a framework<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>. Protein-protein interaction networks have been derived in attempts to shed light on the pathways underlying risk<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>, but most of these networks remain sparse and have only yielded limited insight into cancer risk. Most germline risk variants are thought to affect gene expression. Therefore regulatory networks may be an appropriate starting point to understand the combinatorial effect of risk variants.</p>
    <p id="P6">Here, we model breast cancer as such a gene regulatory network<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> onto which the loci relating to risk can be mapped to identify key regulators<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>. We extend our previous analysis<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> to map onto the network all genes that are associated with the known breast cancer GWAS loci<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>. We found that the transcription factors (TFs) regulating the genes linked to risk loci cluster within the network, suggesting potential commonality of mechanisms. We also show that the same TFs are frequently mutated in breast cancer. Our analysis provides insight into the gene regulatory circuits operating in breast cancer and has implications for treatment and for the identification of novel therapeutic targets. The approach can be applied in any other settings where data from GWAS, large-scale genotyping and gene expression are available.</p>

      <title>Mapping of breast cancer risk loci to regulatory networks</title>
      <p id="P7">Briefly, our analysis builds a regulatory network and then asks for each regulon in the network whether the genes within it are linked to more risk loci than would be expected by chance. In a subsequent step we examine whether the risk regulons, and the TFs driving them, cluster in the overall network.</p>
      <p id="P8">First we created a regulatory network for breast cancer using the ARACNe algorithm<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> which defines regulons (possible target genes) for a set of curated TFs. Each TF-regulon is composed of all those genes whose gene expression data display significant mutual information with that of a given TF and are therefore likely to be regulated by that TF. We previously validated the functional significance of these regulons using ChIP-seq data and TF-knock-down studies<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>. Regulatory networks were inferred using separate analyses on gene expression data from the METABRIC cohort I (n=997) and II (n=995)<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>. Within each network regulons overlap because many genes are regulated by more than one TF. We confirmed that copy number variation does not significantly impact the network structure (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Note</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>).</p>
      <p id="P9">Secondly, we identified regulons enriched for genes associated with risk loci using EVSE (<bold>e</bold>QTL-conditioned <bold>v</bold>ariant <bold>s</bold>et <bold>e</bold>nrichment)<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>. GWAS identify risk loci, marked by tagging SNPs that may themselves not be causative. Therefore each tagging SNP was expanded into an associated variant set (AVS)<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> that includes all SNPs in strong linkage disequilibrium (methods). We then used variation in gene expression to determine which risk loci can be assigned to a given regulon using eQTL<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> (<bold>e</bold>xpression <bold>q</bold>uantitative <bold>t</bold>rait <bold>l</bold>oci; SNPs where allelic differences determine expression of a target gene). We used a multivariate eQTL analysis to test the association between the genotypes of the SNPs in each AVS, and, for each regulon separately, the expression of all the genes that lay within a +/− 250kb window around the AVS. If such an association was found, the locus was counted towards a mapping tally of the number of GWAS loci associated with genes in the regulon. Finally the statistical significance of the mapping tally was assessed by permutation analysis (methods, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>). We refer to TFs whose regulons were significantly enriched as “risk-TFs”.</p>
      <p id="P10">We carried out the EVSE analysis independently for cohort I and II of the METABRIC cancer data set and identified 63 and 61 TFs, respectively, with significant enrichment scores, but none using the much smaller data set from normal tissue (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>). Frequently, a single risk locus contributes to the mapping tally of many regulons. This can be driven by a single gene that is part of many regulons or by multiple distinct genes encoded at that locus contributing to the association with different regulons (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Note</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 4</xref>). The regulons for 36 TFs were significant in both cohorts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a,b</xref>).</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="S4">
      <title>Validation of the risk-TFs</title>
      <p id="P11">To gain confidence in the identification of the 36 risk-TFs, we tested the effects of changing the input GWAS data or regulons on the resultant enrichment score. The red box plots in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1c</xref> show the average enrichment score for the 36 risk-TFs using eQTLs and regulons from METABRIC. When replacing the breast cancer GWAS data, we found that GWAS hits for bone mineral density (BMD), chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) or random SNPs did not give significant enrichment scores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref> blue box plots). For prostate cancer GWAS loci the scores obtained were lower but still significant, probably reflecting similarities in these two hormone driven cancers<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>. When we replaced the regulons calculated from METABRIC with random regulons of similar size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>, grey box plots) none of the associations were significant. These results support the specificity and validity of the EVSE analysis. Our results were not confounded by population stratification (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Note</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref>). We did not find enrichment when using normal breast samples from METABRIC to calculate eQTLs (white box plot). This is possibly surprising, as one might expect inherited risk to be expressed in normal tissue. However, eQTL discovery is dependent on sample size<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> and only 144 normal tissue samples were available in this data set.</p>

      <title>Comparison of ARACNe/EVSE to other methods</title>
      <p id="P12">We compared our analysis to alternative methods for the derivation of the network structure and expansion of tagging SNPs into AVSs and obtained very similar results (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Note</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figures 6-8</xref>). We also compared our EVSE algorithm to analyses in which the multivariate eQTL step was replaced by a distance-based gene selection, or by using ‘pre-defined’ eQTLs<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> from the same sample set (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Note</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figures 9-12</xref>). EVSE identified more risk-TFs and showed better reproducibility than the other tested methods.</p>

      <title>Risk-TFs are frequently mutated in breast cancers</title>
      <p id="P13">To ask whether somatic and germline variation are associated with the same regions of the network, we examined the frequency of mutations and/or copy number changes affecting TF genes in data from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>. Collectively our 36 risk-TFs have a significantly increased frequency of alterations compared to random genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>) and are mutated at a similar frequency as annotated cancer genes for which mutations have been causally implicated in cancer<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="S7">
      <title>Confirmation of risk association using ChIP-seq data</title>
      <p id="P14">To validate that our risk-TFs are indeed associated with the regulation of GWAS loci we examined ChIP-seq data<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> that was generated for TF-eGFP fusion proteins, driven from endogenous sequences in MCF-7 cells. We used these data in a variant set enrichment (VSE) analysis<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> to test whether risk-TF binding sites are enriched at risk SNPs. Our analysis correlated the position of TF binding sites with risk AVSs. ChIP-seq data were available for 9 of our 36 risk-TFs and were compared to 9 low-risk TFs chosen from the EVSE analysis. 5 out of the 9 high-risk TFs, but none of the low-risk TFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a,b</xref>), yielded a significant enrichment score. The signal in this analysis is likely to be relatively low since fusion proteins rather than the native TFs were assayed. When we used ChIP-seq data obtained with anti-FOXA1 and anti-ESR1 antibodies, much higher enrichment scores were obtained (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>), corroborating previous results<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>. CEBPB binding was also enriched at breast cancer risk loci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>). Some of the TFs, such as AR and PPARD, are expressed at very low levels in MCF-7 cells. We therefore tested whether AR binding sites were significantly enriched for GWAS hits in the cell line MDAMB453, which belongs to the molecular apocrine subclass<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> and expresses high levels of AR. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2d</xref> shows that after AR activation, AR targets yield significant enrichment scores in this cell line. Collectively, the ChIP-seq experiments strongly support our conclusion that the risk-TFs play a role in regulating transcription at risk SNPs.</p>

    <sec id="S8">
      <title>Confirmation of risk association by master regulator analysis</title>
      <p id="P15">Estrogen and FGFR2 signalling pathways are known to be associated with breast cancer risk. We examined differential gene expression in response to estrogen and FGFR2 signalling in three ER<sup>+</sup> breast cancer cell lines: MCF-7, T47D and ZR751. Using a master regulator analysis (MRA)<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> (methods) we identified MRs consistently associated with these responses (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Note</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 2</xref>) and found a high prevalence of risk-TFs amongst the MRs, providing further support that our risk-TFs are indeed functionally related to breast cancer risk.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="S9">
      <title>Clustering of risk-TFs and clues to function</title>
      <p id="P16">To examine whether the different risk-TFs converge on common mechanisms, we used ARACNe to calculate the breast cancer regulatory network and mapped onto this network the p-values for risk-association (shown in orange to red) using METABRIC cohort I. The network was visualised by the degree of overlap of regulons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 13</xref>). The enriched regulons mostly cluster together, suggesting that the risk-TFs share biological function.</p>
      <p id="P17">To refine the clustering analysis and look for clues to biological function, we extended the RTN<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> package (methods) to include the direction of association between any TF-target gene pair using Pearson correlation. For all pairs of TFs with a target gene in common, the correlation values were used to assess whether the TFs regulated shared target gene in the same direction (up or down), or in different (opposite) directions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a-c</xref>). This analysis was carried out for all TFs in our regulatory network, and the correlation heat map was used in unsupervised clustering to generate the dendrogram depicted above the matrix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4d</xref>). The position of the 36 risk-TFs is highlighted by the black bars below the dendrogram.</p>
      <p id="P18"><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4e</xref> shows an enlargement of the analysis for just the 36 risk-TFs. They fall into two distinct groups with high correlation within each group: Gene targets shared between two TFs in the same group are regulated in the same direction by both TFs, whereas gene targets shared between a TF in one group and a TF in the other, are regulated in opposite directions, suggesting the existence of two distinct regulatory groups of TFs able to oppose the effects of the other. The two groups of TFs are highly expressed in ER<sup>+</sup> and ER<sup>−</sup> tumours respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4f</xref>). Bootstrap analysis demonstrated that the split into two distinct groups is extremely stable (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 14</xref>). The behaviour of shared gene targets was mirrored in the correlation between the expression of the TFs themselves, but with much weaker signals (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 15a-c</xref>). This may reflect the difference between the regulatory activity of a TF, influenced by post-translational regulation and the presence of interacting factors, and the level of TF expression.</p>
      <p id="P19">With respect to the intrinsic breast cancer subtypes, group 1 TFs are highly expressed in luminal A and B subclasses, while group 2 TFs are highly expressed in basal tumours. Her2 and normal-like tumours showed more heterogeneous gene expression patterns (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 16</xref>). Given this distribution, we tested the enrichment of each regulon for genes upregulated in ER<sup>+</sup> or ER<sup>−</sup> tumours using MRA (methods). We split each regulon into activated and repressed targets and found that group 1 positive targets were enriched in the ER<sup>+</sup> gene signature, whilst the negative targets were enriched in the ER<sup>−</sup> signature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4e</xref>, bar above the matrix). Group 2 generated the opposite pattern, demonstrating that each group of TFs is associated with gene expression changes in both tumour subtypes, but with opposite effects.</p>
      <sec id="S10">
        <title>Identification of clusters associated with known breast cancer subtypes</title>
        <p id="P20">The dendrogram generated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4d</xref> was used to draw a tree and leaf diagram (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a</xref>) representing the 555 TFs whose regulons in cohort I were of sufficient size to be analysed in the EVSE pipeline. Colouring of regulons indicates p-values for risk association. While some risk-TFs occur scattered throughout the diagram, two distinct clusters emerge: cluster 1 (enlarged in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5b</xref>) corresponds closely to group 1 in the previous analysis. These TFs include those important for the FGFR2 and estrogen response and also correlate with the TFs highly expressed in luminal A and B subtypes. Group 2 TFs are somewhat more dispersed throughout the tree, but there is clear clustering around the TFs YBX1, CBFB, NFIB, TRIM29 and SOX10, labelled as cluster 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5c</xref>). Another branch in this node contains the risk-TFs CEBPB and TBX19.</p>
        <p id="P21">A literature survey confirmed that TFs in cluster 2 are primarily associated with basal-like breast cancer. We therefore tested whether a gene signature for basal tumours<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> was linked to cluster 2 using MRA. Of the six consensus MRs for basal-like cancers obtained from the METABRIC cohorts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 3</xref>), the two most strongly associated TFs map to this cluster (SOX10, TRIM29).

        <p id="P23">Next we examined the expression patterns of our risk-TFs in primary cell populations isolated from the normal human mammary gland. Gene expression patterns for three luminal cell populations have previously been described<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>: an EpCAM<sup>+</sup> CD49f<sup>−</sup> population highly enriched in ER<sup>+</sup> cells that express high levels of luminal cell differentiation markers; ER<sup>−</sup> EpCAM<sup>+</sup> CD49f<sup>+</sup> ALDH<sup>+</sup> cells that function as alveolar precursor cells; and ER<sup>−</sup> EpCAM<sup>+</sup> CD49f<sup>+</sup> ALDH<sup>−</sup> luminal cells that have a phenotype intermediate between the EpCAM<sup>+</sup> CD49f<sup>−</sup> and the ER<sup>−</sup> EpCAM<sup>+</sup> CD49f<sup>+</sup> ALDH<sup>+</sup> subpopulations. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5f</xref> lists the risk-TFs that showed differential gene expression across these three populations (adj p-value &lt;0.05).

In MCF10A cells, siRNA-targeting of YBX1 strongly reduced proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6a</xref>), and targeting CBFB, NFIB, TBX19 and LMO4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 20</xref>) all had a significant anti-proliferative effect.

      <title>Regulon activity as prognostic read-out</title>
      <p id="P26">The ESR1 regulon consists of estrogen-induced and estrogen-repressed genes in approximately equal proportions.<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> Our current analysis suggests that the relative activity of these two groups of genes may be important for determining the phenotype of the cell. We therefore devised a 2-tailed GSEA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7a,b</xref>; methods) in which positive and negative targets of the ESR1 regulon are considered separately to generate a differential enrichment score (dES) (methods) representing the activity of the regulon. We used this in a stratified survival analysis in the METABRIC data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7c,d</xref>). We found a continuous spectrum of dES across the tumors, except near the transition between the active and repressed state of the ESR1 regulon, which was characterized by an abrupt change. There was a strong trend for better survival with a high dES. Interestingly, we identified a set of patients with histochemically ER<sup>+</sup> tumours that had a repressed ESR1 regulon and a significantly worse outcome than those with tumours with an active ESR1 regulon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7e,f</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 21</xref>). This is not apparent when stratifying by ESR1 gene expression alone (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 22</xref>). We also tested the effect of tamoxifen treatment on the activity of the ESR1 regulon in MCF-7 cells using 2-tailed GSEA. As expected, we found that estrogen induction of steroid-starved MCF-7 cells led to a strong activation of the ESR1 regulon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7g</xref>). However with estrogen plus tamoxifen treatment, the ESR1 regulon was shifted towards a more repressed state than with estrogen alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7h</xref>).

    <title>Discussion</title>
    <p id="P27">Our goal was to develop a network-based approach to understand how the effects of multiple GWAS loci combine to influence susceptibility. We derived a TF-centric regulatory network for breast cancer and asked by eQTL analysis which regulons were enriched for an association with confirmed breast cancer GWAS loci. We identified 36 regulons that were enriched in both of two separate analyses. The TFs controlling these regulons are frequently mutated in breast cancer, implying a convergence of germline and somatic events in the etiology of breast cancer. Many of the risk-TFs are master regulators of pathways associated with breast cancer risk, such as estrogen and FGFR2 signalling. Within the regulatory network, almost all of the risk-TFs clustered around a group of TFs already known to be central to breast cancer risk: ESR1, FOXA1, GATA3 and SPDEF<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>. This clustering supports the functional significance of the newly identified risk-TFs and suggests that risk-TFs share regulatory mechanisms.</p>
    <p id="P28">The validity of the ARACNe/EVSE analysis was confirmed through extensive comparisons to other methods. The 36 identified risk-TFs were specific for hormone-driven cancer and could be validated experimentally. The EVSE analysis avoids the multiple testing problems of unrestrained eQTL calling and was therefore able to identify more risk-TFs than other methods. However, as in other analyses<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>, we identified eQTLs for only a minority of GWAS loci. Our method utilised gene expression data from breast tumours. Yet, our hypothesis is that inherited variation exerts its effects on normal tissue, and indeed on specific cell types within that tissue. To detect this, improved, context-specific methods for eQTL identification<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> are required. The EVSE analysis we have developed can provide a general approach to interpret GWAS data in the context of regulatory networks.</p>
    <p id="P29">Considering the direction (up or down) of the response of shared target genes revealed two distinct clusters of risk-TFs: those in cluster 1 whose positive targets were overexpressed in ER<sup>+</sup> cancers, and those in cluster 2, whose positive targets were overexpressed in basal-like ER<sup>−</sup> cancers. However, the inverse also holds true: cluster 2 TFs repress genes associated with ER<sup>+</sup> cancers, and cluster 1 TFs repress those associated with ER<sup>−</sup> cancers. Therefore both clusters of TFs are likely to be important for the establishment of ER<sup>+</sup> and ER<sup>−</sup> tumours, albeit with opposing effects. This is supported by GWAS results, where the majority of loci confer risk for both ER<sup>+</sup> and ER<sup>−</sup> disease<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>. Furthermore, our EVSE analysis using only ER<sup>+</sup> tumours identified risk-TFs from both clusters.</p>
    <p id="P30">Some cluster 1 TFs have previously been reported as critical for ER<sup>+</sup> disease<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>-<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> (ESR1, FOXA1, GATA3, SPDEF). We confirmed these and added more validated risk-TFs: XBP1, RARA and AR. XBP1 and ESR1 gene expression is highly correlated in laser microdissected breast tissue<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> and RARA cooperates with ESR1 to drive estrogen-induced transcription<sup><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup>. Recent data suggest that in ER<sup>−</sup> apocrine tumours AR is able to replace the function of ESR1, leading to a luminal-like gene expression profile<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup>. The identification of XBP1, RARA and AR as risk-TFs fits the overall framework that estrogen-driven gene expression is the predominant determinant of luminal breast cancer risk.</p>
    <p id="P31">Cluster 2 comprises YBX1, CBFB, NFIB, TRIM29, SOX10, CEBPB and TBX19, all highly expressed in ER<sup>−</sup> tumours. Of these, our functional assays identified YBX1, NFIB and CBFB as important for proliferation in ER<sup>−</sup> cells in culture. Existing literature links individual TFs in cluster 2 to basal-like breast cancer<sup><xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>-<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup>, which is associated with increased aggressiveness, metastasis and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Here we suggest a network of cooperating TFs important in determining this cancer subtype. The link of cluster 2 TFs to basal-like breast cancer is further supported by increased binding at GWAS loci by CEBPB, a TF required for lobuloalveolar development<sup><xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> whose loss is associated with EMT<sup><xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup>.</p>
    <p id="P32">The most striking aspect of cluster 1 and 2 TFs is the opposing regulatory effect they exert on their target genes. We postulate that this mutually exclusive activity reflects the decision of a progenitor to commit to either an ER<sup>+</sup> ductal or an ER<sup>−</sup> alveolar cell fate. In line with this hypothesis we find that in primary human mammary cell populations<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>, those representative of ER<sup>−</sup> alveolar progenitors show differential upregulation of cluster 2 TFs, whilst ER<sup>+</sup> luminal cells display higher expression of cluster 1 TFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8</xref>). Recent genetic tracing experiments have shown that the ER<sup>+</sup> ductal progenitors and ER<sup>−</sup> alveolar progenitors are self-renewing in the mouse mammary gland<sup><xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup>. The differential expression of risk-TFs in these two self-renewing populations may suggest that these are the populations where risk genes are effective and cell transformation occurs. In line with this, transcriptional profiles of basal-like tumours most resemble that of ER<sup>−</sup> alveolar progenitors<sup><xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup>, while luminal A and B tumours phenocopy ER<sup>+</sup> ductal cells<sup><xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>-<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>. Furthermore, the ER<sup>−</sup> alveolar progenitor population is expanded in BRCA1 mutation carriers<sup><xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup>, which are predisposed to develop ER<sup>−</sup> breast cancer.</p>
    <p id="P33">The opposing activity of two distinct networks of TFs has not previously been reported, but is consistent with studies carried out for individual TFs. For example, ELF5, an important inducer of alveolar differentiation<sup><xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup> can reduce estrogen sensitivity in ER<sup>+</sup> cell lines<sup><xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></sup>. FOXA1 in combination with GATA3 and ESR1 can specify an estrogen-responsive phenotype<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>, and, conversely, is able to repress the basal phenotype<sup><xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref></sup>. The concept of antagonism between TFs, led us to the 2-tailed GSEA analysis of the ESR1 regulon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref>). Of potential clinical relevance, the analysis identifies a subgroup of histochemically ER<sup>+</sup> patients in whom the ESR1 regulon is functionally in a repressed state and in whom anti-estrogen treatment might not be effective. Our results also highlight the possibility that repression of cluster 1 TFs may lead to a shift in cell state towards more basal-like cancer, that is potentially associated with a more aggressive tumour phenotype and resistance to therapy. Better understanding of the interplay of the key regulators will be critical for optimal therapeutic strategies.</p>
    <p id="P34">In summary, we have shown that EVSE analysis, together with gene regulatory networks, can identify key regulators that may influence disease risk. The analysis can be applied to any combination of GWAS loci for which eQTLs can be interrogated, not just those for which the causative SNPs and genes are already known. For breast cancer, the risk-enriched regulons include many driven by TFs already implicated in breast cancer, but many others that were not. The mutual antagonism of the two identified clusters of risk-TFs provides novel insights into their interactions, with potential clinical implications.</p>

        <p id="P35">Regulons were calculated based on mutual information using the ARACNe algorithm<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>. Of the 809 TFs<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> tested, we were able to assign regulons to 555 TFs in cohort I and 635 in cohort II of the METABRIC data set. The EVSE analysis has been described before<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> and here we extended our previous computational pipeline (RTN<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>) to allow the testing of all regulons defined in the network. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 2</xref> illustrates the steps and data sets used in this analysis. In more detail, EVSE was carried out using the 72 breast cancer risk SNPs identified by Michailidou et al.<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>. For most of these GWAS loci neither the causative SNP nor the potential target genes are known. To deal with the former, the top hit at each locus (tagging SNP) was expanded into an AVS including all SNPs with a D′&gt; 0.99 and a LOD&gt;3.0 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2a</xref>), following the previously published VSE method<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>. This approach gave similar results to those obtained using r<sup>2</sup> to expand the tagging SNP into the AVS (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 8</xref>). To identify potential target genes at each GWAS locus, we used gene expression and genotyping data in a multivariate eQTL analysis<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>. When considering multiple GWAS loci in a single analysis, the number of potential target genes may vary strongly for each GWAS locus to be analysed, making statistical comparisons between them difficult. For this reason we carried out a single multivariate eQTL analysis at each GWAS locus, asking whether there is an association of any of the SNPs in the AVS and the expression of any of the genes in a given regulon in a window of +/− 250kb around the AVS (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig 2b,c</xref>). (For each AVS only those SNPs for which genotyping data was available in METABRIC were considered in the analysis.) If a positive association was found, the locus was counted towards a mapping tally (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2d</xref>) as described by Cowper Sal Iari et al<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>. In a subsequent step statistical significance was assessed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2e</xref>). To reduce the cost of the computational analysis when interrogating many regulons, we ran a low resolution analysis to remove obviously non-significant regulons (RTN package<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>). For all remaining regulons the EVSE analysis using breast cancer GWAS hits was tested against a null distribution based on random permutations of the AVS (that is, matched random variant sets). These distributions were normalised and centred around the null to obtain the enrichment score, which is the number of standard deviations that the observed mapping tally deviates from the null mapping mean. From these null distributions p-values were calculated. To gain confidence in our results we used cohort I and II of the METABRIC data set separately and only considered regulons that were significant in both cohorts. Where different GWAS results were tested (BMD, prostate cancer and CLL), each GWAS set was controlled with the appropriate number of random SNPs. As threshold for significance a Bonferroni correction was applied.</p>

Cells were cross-linked and ChIP-seq performed using an AR antibody (N20; sc-816; Santa Cruz Biotech; 10 μg/IP) with subsequent data processing as previously described<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup>. Two independent experiments were performed in each cell line and consensus AR chromatin binding events determined for each treatment condition.</p>

      <title>Gene expression analysis after estrogen and FGF10 signalling</title>
      <p id="P47">MCF-7 cells were plated at 5×10<sup>5</sup> cells/well in 6-well dishes and left in complete medium overnight. Cell synchronisation via estrogen-starvation was then carried out for three days in estrogen-free media (phenol red-free media supplemented with 5% charcoal dextran-treated FBS and 2 mM L-glutamine), with media changed every 24 hours. Estrogen-deprived cells were stimulated with 1 nM β-estradiol (E2; Sigma) or 100 ng/ml FGF10 (Invitrogen) in combination with 1 nM E2. 6 hours after cell treatment, total RNA was isolated from 3 biological replicates, quality controlled and used for cRNA amplification and labeling using the Illumina TotalPrep-96 kit (Ambion). cRNA was hybridised to HumanHT-12 v4 Expression BeadChips according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Illumina WGGX DirectHyb Assay Guide 11286331 RevA). Raw image files were processed and analysed using the beadarray package from Bioconductor.</p>

      <title>Transient transfection of siRNA</title>
      <p id="P48">Cell lines were transfected with ON-TARGETplus SMARTpool siRNA (Dharmacon) directed against risk-TFs NFIB (L-008456-00), YBX1 (L-010213-00), CBFB (L-011602-00), LMO4 (L-012124-00), ELF5 (L-011265-02), TBX19 (L-011910-00) and SOX10 (L-017192-00). CEBPB was not included in the analysis as multiple distinct isoforms with opposing function may be present in the cell. A custom siRNA was used against FOXA1<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>. Knock-down of mRNA was confirmed for each cell line by RT-PCR of cDNA 48 hours after transfection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 20c</xref>) using the primer pairs shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 5</xref>. 1 μg of total RNA was reverse transcribed using the High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied Biosystems) and qRT-PCR performed using cDNA obtained from 10 ng of total RNA. qRT-PCR was performed using an ABI 9800HT Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems) with SDS software version 2.3. Amplification and detection were carried out in 384-well Optical Reaction Plates (Applied Biosystems) with Power SYBR Green Fast 2× qRT-PCR Mastermix (Applied Biosystems). All expression data were normalised to DGUOK expression. Primer-specificity was confirmed at the end of each qRT-PCR run through the generation of single peaks in melt-curve analysis. siRNA against SOX10 did not cause a reduction in mRNA levels and was not examined further. A control non-targeting pool of siRNAs (D-001810-01-05) was included in each experiment. Transfections were carried out using Lipofectamine RNAiMax Reagent (Invitrogen), according to manufacturer’s protocol. Growth was measured in 96-well plates using the IncuCyte (Essen BioScience) system every 3 hours. 8 wells were averaged for each experiment and at least two repeats were carried out for each cell line (MCF10A n=3, ZR751 n=2). The results of knock-downs for TFs in cluster 2 that are not consensus risk-TFs are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 20</xref>). Statistical analysis was carried out using the <italic>compareGrowthCurves</italic> command in the statmod package<sup><xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref></sup> in R, generating BY<sup><xref rid="R54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref></sup> adjusted p-values.</p>

The matrix shows each multivariate eQTL test with a significant result as a grey box. Mapping tallies are summed on the right of the matrix. Box plots show the normalized null distributions of the enrichment scores (box: 1st–3rd quartiles; bars: extremes). Solid and open red diamonds highlight enrichment scores that satisfy a Bonferroni-corrected threshold for significance of <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.01 and <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05, respectively. P-values are based on null distributions from 1,000 random AVSs. (c) Computational validation of EVSE analysis for cohort I and II. Averages of enrichment scores obtained in the EVSE analysis using different GWAS data sets (breast cancer (BCa), prostate cancer (PCa), bone mineral density (BMD) or chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) or random SNPs) shown along the x-axis, using different regulons and eQTLs (origin indicated by colour). The grey dotted line highlights the Bonferroni-corrected threshold (<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05). (d) Mean aberration frequency of the 36 risk-TFs compared to sets of 36 random genes (empirical p&lt;0.001, boxplot whiskers extend to the 99th percentile of the random distribution with 10,000 random sets).

      <title>Correlation of expression of targets shared between TF pairs in breast tumours</title>
      <p>(a-c) Correlations of gene expression between a given TF and its targets were plotted for three different TF-TF pairs as indicated. Above each panel a cartoon depicts the observed interactions. Red circles indicate co-activation, blue circles co-repression. Targets are shown in grey if the two TFs have opposing effects on the target. (d) Heat map of the correlation of gene expression for targets shared by any pair of the 555 TFs (cohort I, METABRIC) whose regulons were of sufficient size to be analysed in the EVSE pipeline. Unsupervised clustering was applied to this correlation heat map resulting in the dendrogram shown at the top of the plot. The black bars depict the 36 risk-TFs, which fall into two distinct clusters. (e) Enlargement of the correlation heat map for the risk-TFs only. Above the matrix a bar with yellow to red colouring depicts the results (BH adjusted p-values) of a MRA analysis for the enrichment within each regulon of positive and negative targets that are upregulated in ER<sup>+</sup> or ER<sup>−</sup> tumours, respectively, in cohort I of the METABRIC samples. The panel to the left of the matrix shows the master regulators identified for the FGFR2 and E2 responses. (f) Relative gene expression levels of the risk-TFs in ER<sup>+</sup> or ER<sup>−</sup> tumours in cohort I of the METABRIC samples: expression levels were averaged in all ER<sup>+</sup> and all ER<sup>−</sup> tumours and compared to expression levels averaged across all samples. TFs are shown ranked by differential gene expression between ER<sup>+</sup> and ER<sup>−</sup> tumours.</p>

      <title>Schematic model of mammary gland cell populations</title>
      <p>In this model we show the predominant expression of cluster 1 versus cluster 2 risk-TFs with respect to the cell populations found in the mammary gland and the cancer subtypes that arise from them. In the normal mammary gland all three populations have self-renewal capacity. Claudin<sup>low</sup> tumours were originally classified as basal in the PAM signature, but are likely to represent a separate lineage arising from myoepithelial cells<sup><xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup>. Basal-like cancer is thought to arise from alveolar progenitor cells, (The somewhat misleading term ‘basal-like’ reflects the fact these tumours not only express epithelial, but also mesenchymal cell surface markers that are also highly expressed in the myoepithelial lineage located near the basal membrane.) and luminal A/B cancer from ER+ precursors.</p>
