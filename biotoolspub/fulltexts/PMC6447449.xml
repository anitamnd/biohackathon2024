      <p id="P3">Although mass spectrometry is well-suited to identifying thousands of possible protein post-translational modifications (PTMs), it has historically been biased towards just a few. To measure the entire set of PTMs across diverse proteomes, software must overcome the dual challenges of searching enormous search spaces and distinguishing correct from incorrect spectrum interpretations. Here, we describe TagGraph, a computational tool that overcomes both challenges with an unrestricted string-based search method that is as much as 350-fold faster than existing approaches, and a probabilistic validation model we optimized for PTM assignments. We applied TagGraph to a published human proteomic data set of 25 million mass spectra and tripled confident spectrum identifications compared its original analysis. We identified thousands of modification types on almost one million sites in the proteome. We show new contexts for highly abundant yet understudied PTMs such as proline hydroxylation, and its unexpected association with cancer mutations. By enabling broad PTM characterization TagGraph informs how their functions and regulation intersect.</p>

    <title>Introduction</title>
    <p id="P5">Post translational modifications (PTMs) dynamically modulate the activity, conformation states, localization, interactions, abundance and degradation of almost all proteins encoded by the human genome<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>. However most remain poorly understood since mapping the full breadth of PTM identities and locations across the entire human proteome has remained intractable<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>. Although mass spectrometry is arguably the best-suited technology for direct, large-scale PTM measurement, most global PTM studies have focused on modifications for which optimized enrichment workflows exist<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>. Consequently, our current view of PTMs’ collective impact on the human proteome is heavily skewed towards a small fraction of the possible PTM landscape<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>.</p>
    <p id="P6">Despite this, PTM-containing peptides are readily detected by routine tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) experiments, but are believed to comprise much of the “dark matter” in proteome datasets that consistently evades reliable identification<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>. Search parameters used by most MS/MS search approaches strike a compromise between the diversity of discoverable modifications, the time needed to interpret MS/MS datasets and the ability to distinguish correct from incorrect assignments. Strategies that constrain the number of proteins being searched, apply protease specificity rules or minimize the allowable types and numbers of PTMs partially address this compromise<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>. In practice, however, these approaches only marginally decrease search times and still do not distinguish correct from incorrect PTM assignments<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>.</p>
    <p id="P7">Here, we describe <italic>TagGraph</italic>, a computational tool that addresses these limitations in two ways. First, TagGraph leverages accurate <italic>de novo</italic> mass spectrum interpretations<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>, efficient string-based indexing<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>, and a graph-based string reconciliation algorithm to rapidly search MS/MS data sets without restricting the number of proteins, PTMs or protease specificities. Second, by replacing conventional “target-decoy” error estimation<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> with a PTM-optimized probabilistic model, we can accurately discover and discriminate high-confidence peptide identifications from large search spaces. Combined, these advances make unconstrained surveys of large MS/MS data sets possible. Our analyses expand the number of known modification sites for some PTM types by as much as 30-fold, particularly those lacking biochemical enrichment techniques. We show that TagGraph enables unbiased and rapid proteome-wide PTM characterization.</p>

      <title>Development of TagGraph</title>
      <p id="P8">We developed TagGraph (<xref rid="SD3" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Code</xref>) to accurately assign peptides bearing multiple unspecified PTMs or amino acid substitutions (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>). TagGraph leverages the speed of indexed string matching algorithms by first transforming complex, numeric mass spectra into discrete, unambiguous query strings using <italic>de novo</italic> peptide sequencing. <italic>De novo</italic> sequencing algorithms are more sensitive to MS/MS spectra imperfections than traditional database search engines, and therefore have not been widely used for large-scale proteomics analysis. However, we recently showed that they frequently produce long, reasonably accurate sequence predictions from high resolution MS/MS spectra: these predictions were over 50% correct for nearly all interpretable MS/MS spectra (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>)<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>. We therefore suspected that many <italic>de novo</italic> peptides contain long (e.g., &gt;5 amino acids) substrings that perfectly match the true protein sources of their observed MS/MS spectra. The FM-index data structure<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> was developed to facilitate this kind of search. TagGraph uses it to rapidly find a small number of substring-matched candidate peptides from an arbitrarily large, pre-indexed sequence database with no restrictions on protease specificity, post-translational modifications, or sequence variants (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>). These candidates are then reconciled against the input <italic>de novo</italic> sequence using a graph-based alignment algorithm. This strategy lets TagGraph discover and localize multiple PTMs and other sequence alterations that co-occur on a single peptide sequence without anticipating them <italic>a priori</italic> (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Note 1</xref>). Modification masses localized to specific amino acids are cross-referenced with the Unimod resource<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> to suggest the modification’s identity based on mass and amino acid specificity. In this way, TagGraph effectively searches all possible sequence alterations on time scales and search sensitivities commensurate with conventional database search tools (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d, 1e</xref>, <bold>Dataset 1</bold> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://taggraph.page.link/Datasets">https://taggraph.page.link/Datasets</ext-link>)).</p>
      <p id="P9">TagGraph surveys very large sequence spaces that would be impractical to query using traditional database search engines and other flexible search methods. Our strategy contrasts with prior approaches including sequence tag filtering<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>, iterative search<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>, precursor mass shift<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> and spectrum clustering<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Note 2</xref>). Compared to an equivalent database search, these approaches reduce the number of peptides considered per mass spectrum (or vice versa for spectrum clustering). However, they are subject to similar speed limitations as they consider larger numbers of amino acid modifications and variants. As a result, most are prone to impractically long search times (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Note 2</xref>). TagGraph addresses this obstacle by shifting the computational burden of generating many numerical pattern comparisons to an efficient string matching and reconciliation procedure. We measured the resulting speed advantage by comparing TagGraph’s execution time to five algorithms designed to consider greatly expanded search spaces<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>–<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>, and found that none could execute on both the entire data set and the search space TagGraph considered in this comparison. Recognizing that most of these methods were not designed to consider such unrestricted parameters, we provided them with reduced number of spectra, search spaces or both. Nevertheless, TagGraph was 4- to 18-fold faster than any other algorithm, depending on whether we considered its preliminary <italic>de novo</italic> sequencing step (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d, 1e</xref>). We note that more restrictive search parameters than the ones tested here could be expected to produce substantially faster search times for some of these prior methods. In contrast, however, TagGraph has just one unrestricted operation mode removing researchers’ need to choose between search speed and search depth.</p>

      <title>Hierarchical Bayes Model for decoy-free error estimation</title>
      <p id="P10">Indexed string searches solve the conflict between search speed and search depth, but exacerbate the challenge of estimating reliable FDRs. The standard target-decoy estimation method we previously developed<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> is unsuitable for unconstrained search results since it loses discrimination accuracy as more peptides and PTMs are considered (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Note 3</xref>)<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>. Consequently, we developed a probabilistic validation strategy using a hierarchical Bayes Model optimized by expectation maximization (EM) (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figs. 2, 3</xref>)<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>. Our model deduces the likelihood that any individual peptide-spectrum match is correctly interpreted based on fourteen quantitative and categorical attributes (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Note 4.B</xref>); of these, half relate specifically to modified peptides. Consequently, our model concurrently discriminates correctly and incorrectly interpreted spectra from both modified and unmodified peptides.</p>
      <p id="P11">We first evaluated TagGraph’s error model by comparing it to target-(shuffled) decoy database searching (<xref rid="S10" ref-type="sec">Online Methods</xref>) with SEQUEST using the cell line dataset described in <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>. We found that the EM-based scoring discriminated decoys from high-confidence identifications (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>) while generating FDR estimates which were more conservative than those inferred from target-decoy searches (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>, <bold>Dataset 2</bold> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://taggraph.page.link/Datasets">https://taggraph.page.link/Datasets</ext-link>)), as expected for a model that discriminates between correct and incorrect PTM assignments. Furthermore, we found that the extent to which SEQUEST and TagGraph disagreed was consistent with the estimated 1% FDR threshold we applied to both (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 4a</xref>). For the majority of these disagreements, however, TagGraph-generated peptide-spectrum matches were more consistent with correct identifications based on protease specificity, algorithm-assigned scores, and ion assignment (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figs. 4b, 5</xref>). Twelve other large data sets analyzed in a similar manner yielded comparable observations (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Analysis 1</xref>).</p>
      <p id="P12">To further evaluate TagGraph’s error model, we sought to measure how often it misassigns modifications to incorrect amino acid sites. To accomplish this, we replaced all tyrosine residues with phenylalanines (mass difference of one oxygen, 15.9995 Da) in an altered human proteome sequence database (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref>). We reasoned that an accurate expanded search algorithm should return phenylalanine-containing peptides with an additional oxygen localized to converted phenylalanines. We benchmarked five search methods against TagGraph with this validation tool. Each algorithm’s results were filtered based on target-decoy-based criteria (either the algorithm’s own implementation or a linear discriminant analysis<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>) or, for TagGraph, the hierarchical Bayes model. The proportion of peptide-spectrum matches containing unmodified phenylalanines at tyrosine positions was used to estimate both sequence- and modification-specific FDRs relative to the 1% predicted FDR. Only TagGraph’s error model reliably discriminated both incorrect “base” peptide sequences and those bearing unmodified altered phenylalanines. TagGraph reported 3.5-fold fewer inconsistencies with the expected search results than the next-best flexible search method (MODa) but with 4.3-fold greater sensitivity (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref>). These data suggest that both incorrect sequences and modifications may be common when searching multiple types of target-decoy protein databases (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 6</xref>).</p>
      <p id="P13">Stringent error tolerance often comes at the expense of overall analysis sensitivity<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>. However, we found that TagGraph doubled the number of unique peptide identifications relative to SEQUEST, in part, by enabling accurate identification of peptides with any modification state. Once reconciled with Unimod, we found that unanticipated post-isolation modifications accounted for the majority of this increase (50.2% of novel modifications), followed by biologically-regulated post-translational modifications (8.5%) and those with no previous association (2.1%) (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig 4a</xref>). This analysis demonstrated TagGraph’s unique ability to characterize modified peptides with the speed, accuracy and sensitivity that is compatible with large-scale proteomic workflows.</p>
      <p id="P14">To further verify TagGraph’s ability to generate <italic>bona fide</italic> PTMs, we analyzed 451,655 MS/MS spectra from a published phosphorylation-enriched data set<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>. We first established a set of high-confidence phosphorylated peptides by searching these spectra with SEQUEST and localizing phosphates to specific amino acid residues with the A-score algorithm<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>. In parallel, we searched these spectra with the four expanded search approaches demonstrating the greatest throughput: TagGraph, Peaks-PTM, Open Search and MSFragger (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1e</xref>). Comparing TagGraph with PEAKS-PTM, we found similar proportions of phosphorylated peptides (30% vs 31%, respectively), and agreement with high-confidence SEQUEST phosphopeptide identifications (98% vs 99%) (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 7</xref>, <bold>Dataset 3</bold> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://taggraph.page.link/Datasets">https://taggraph.page.link/Datasets</ext-link>)). Furthermore, we found that TagGraph rarely (1–2%) yielded tied peptide candidates for individual spectra (<bold>Dataset 4</bold> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://taggraph.page.link/Datasets">https://taggraph.page.link/Datasets</ext-link>), <xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 1</xref>), supporting our scoring model’s ability to discriminate between alternate modification configurations. The Open Search and MSFragger methods produced proportionately fewer phosphopeptide identifications (24 and 22%) which were not inherently localized to specific amino acids due to the general nature of this approach (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Note 2</xref>).</p>

    <sec id="S5">
      <title>The human proteome’s broad modification landscape</title>
      <p id="P15">To demonstrate TagGraph’s utility for deep PTM characterization, we re-analyzed a draft human proteome data set<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>, which is approximately 150 times larger than our initial test data set. Interpreting these 25 million tandem mass spectra – derived from 30 adult and fetal tissues and over 2,000 raw data files – would not be feasible with prior expanded search approaches, but took just six days on a single desktop computer once <italic>de novo</italic> sequencing was complete (one month of total running time). These data yielded over 1.1 million unique peptides, tripling the number originally reported using traditional database searching (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>, <bold>Dataset 5</bold> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://taggraph.page.link/Datasets">https://taggraph.page.link/Datasets</ext-link>)). As with the phosphorylation data set described above, the human proteome analysis yielded few tied spectra (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 1</xref>, <bold>Dataset 6</bold> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://taggraph.page.link/Datasets">https://taggraph.page.link/Datasets</ext-link>)), further supporting our scoring and validation model. Although the analysis presented here focused on identification and FDR estimations for peptides rather than proteins, we nevertheless found evidence for 100 (Adult CD8+ T Cells) to over 600 (Adult Gallbladder) additional proteins per tissue that were not originally reported (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 8a</xref>, <bold>Dataset 7</bold> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://taggraph.page.link/Datasets">https://taggraph.page.link/Datasets</ext-link>)). Several of these were corroborated by histological staining (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 8b</xref>).</p>
      <p id="P16">As with our cell line analysis (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>), TagGraph rescued peptides bearing at least one modification that was not considered in the original search (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>). A small number of post-isolation modifications (methionine oxidation; N-terminal carbamylation, carbamidomethylation, and formylation) collectively accounted for 38% of modified spectra (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c</xref>, <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), as previously observed<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup>. TagGraph rescued other commonly disregarded peptide classes, including semi-specific and non-specific trypsin cleavage, and misassigned monoisotopic precursor masses (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 9</xref>). We note that these general identification classes persisted when we searched low-resolution MS/MS spectra with TagGraph, but the overall identification success rate was reduced two-fold relative to conventional database search (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 10</xref>, <bold>Dataset 8</bold> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://taggraph.page.link/Datasets">https://taggraph.page.link/Datasets</ext-link>)). This coincided with decreased performance of our EM model on this data set (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Analysis 1</xref>). Thus, our ability to probe post-translationally modified proteomes depends on the mass resolution of the underlying MS/MS spectra.</p>
      <p id="P17">In comparison to the handful of abundant yet biologically irrelevant post-isolation modifications, this extremely deep proteome analysis revealed a much wider array of lesser-abundant PTMs (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c,d</xref>, <bold>Dataset 9</bold> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://taggraph.page.link/Datasets">https://taggraph.page.link/Datasets</ext-link>)). For example, we found N-terminal myristoylation, lysine hydroxylation and arginine dimethylation hundreds to thousands of times in the proteome without requiring the kind of targeted, sample-intensive enrichment procedures that have previously been essential to PTM analysis. This study confirmed 4,278 modifications previously reported in the Uniprot proteomics resource, while extending it by an additional 39,954 (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3e</xref>, <bold>Dataset 10</bold> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://taggraph.page.link/Datasets">https://taggraph.page.link/Datasets</ext-link>)). To evaluate the extent to which marginal, incorrect identifications might disproportionately inflate our modification tally, we manually examined 100 diverse modification-bearing peptide assignments from this human proteome dataset, which were assigned scores just at the threshold of acceptance. We found that just 26 were clearly incorrect as deemed by expert scrutiny, coinciding with an overall expected increased FDR for these proportionally rare and marginal results (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Analysis 1d, Supplementary Analysis 2</xref>, <bold>Dataset 11</bold> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://taggraph.page.link/Datasets">https://taggraph.page.link/Datasets</ext-link>)).

      <title>Quantifying PTMs without biochemical enrichment</title>
      <p id="P20">Since PTMs and their host proteins can be simultaneously quantified by mass spectrometry, we accordingly estimated each PTM’s stoichiometry (<xref rid="S10" ref-type="sec">Online Methods</xref>, <bold>Dataset 14</bold> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://taggraph.page.link/Datasets">https://taggraph.page.link/Datasets</ext-link>))<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>.

Since PTM stoichiometries can have important implications for substrate protein activity and function, deeply sequenced proteome datasets like this are an untapped resource for measuring a wide range of protein regulation. We found that protein N-terminal acetylation demonstrated the most consistently high stoichiometry (95.5%; stdev = 16.7%, <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4d</xref>). This is expected, considering the broad and irreversible acetyl group addition, co-translationally catalyzed by N-terminal acetyltransferases<sup><xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup>. Conversely, we found that lysine acetylation exhibited low and variable stoichiometry (15.2%; stdev = 22.7%, <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4d</xref>), consistent with its heterogeneous representation on histone proteins<sup><xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup>, and its possible non-enzymatic origins on abundant cytosolic and mitochondrial proteins<sup><xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup>.

Histones are known to undergo extensive and combinatorial modifications to encode epigenetic information<sup><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup>, but deciphering these modifications has previously required individual histone isoform<sup><xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup> or specific modification<sup><xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup> enrichment. Using TagGraph, we identified 273 PTMs across the five major histone proteins, 128 of which were not previously reported (<bold>Dataset 15</bold> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://taggraph.page.link/Datasets">https://taggraph.page.link/Datasets</ext-link>)). While we found modifications such as K28 dimethylation and K80 methylation on Histone H3 were both abundant and ubiquitous across the tissues examined here (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4f</xref>), we note several tissue-specific PTMs, such as Histone H4 R56 dimethylation occurring with 25-fold greater abundance in fetal than adult tissues. Twenty-six diverse PTMs showed similarly greater abundance in fetal tissues, suggesting specific roles in development (<bold>Dataset 15</bold> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://taggraph.page.link/Datasets">https://taggraph.page.link/Datasets</ext-link>)).

      <title>Enrichment-free discovery and characterization of protein hydroxylation</title>
      <p id="P22">We found that hydroxylated prolines, tyrosines and lysines were a sizeable (16%) proportion of histone PTMs (<bold>Dataset 15</bold> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://taggraph.page.link/Datasets">https://taggraph.page.link/Datasets</ext-link>)), yet only hydroxylated tyrosine was previously described<sup><xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup>. Proline hydroxylation is the most abundant modification in the human body<sup><xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup>, but just 321 sites have been catalogued<sup><xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup>. Unlike more widely studied modifications, no enrichment methods have facilitated its focused analysis. Furthermore, of 11 amino acids capable of becoming hydroxylated<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>, four (Met, Trp, Phe, His) are often hydroxylated by sample preparation protocols. Thus, true post-translational proline hydroxylation must be distinguished from mislocalized artifacts<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>. TagGraph’s modification-focused error model allowed us to identify and localize over 10-fold more hydroxyl proline residues than were previously known in humans (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).</p>
      <p id="P23">Proline hydroxylation is essential to the role of collagen proteins in maintaining extracellular matrix (ECM) stability. Despite hydroxyl proline comprising over 13% of mammalian collagen by weight<sup><xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup>, only 254 sites across all collagens were previously assigned in humans (79% of all charted hydroxyl prolines in the human proteome). TagGraph identified 166 proline hydroxylation sites on COL1A2 alone, just 4 of which were previously described<sup><xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></sup> (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a</xref>). While most proline hydroxylation sites were represented across most solid tissues examined here (e.g., P330, P642), several displayed tissue-specific abundance (e.g., P408, restricted to colon, bladder, liver, gallbladder and pancreas) (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5b</xref>). TagGraph identified 14 other PTM types from this single protein, suggesting multiple routes by which PTMs cooperatively regulate collagen structure and function (<bold>Dataset 16</bold> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://taggraph.page.link/Datasets">https://taggraph.page.link/Datasets</ext-link>)).</p>
      <p id="P24">Our analysis extends known proline hydroxylation by nearly 3,000 sites spanning almost 1,000 substrate proteins (<bold>Dataset 10</bold> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://taggraph.page.link/Datasets">https://taggraph.page.link/Datasets</ext-link>)). These proteins were significantly enriched for 113 biological processes and 60 cellular compartments (Benjamini-corrected Fisher’s exact p &lt;0.01) (<bold>Dataset 12</bold> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://taggraph.page.link/Datasets">https://taggraph.page.link/Datasets</ext-link>)), suggesting that proline hydroxylation could influence many cellular processes beyond matrix homeostasis (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b</xref>). Noting that tumors exploit some of these same processes during oncogenesis, we hypothesized that proline hydroxylation could play a role in cancer. Associations were previously shown between specific phosphorylation sites and cancer-associated mutations<sup><xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref></sup>, and using a similar approach, we examined whether proline hydroxylation significantly intersected with missense somatic cancer mutations catalogued in the COSMIC database<sup><xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref></sup>. We found that hydroxylated prolines were 25% more likely to be associated with cancer mutations than expected (p=6e-11, Fisher’s exact test; p&lt;1e-9, Bonferroni corrected), even excluding collagens (22%, p=4e-6 Fisher’s exact test; p&lt;7e-5, Bonferroni corrected) (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5c</xref>, <bold>Datasets 17, 18</bold> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://taggraph.page.link/Datasets">https://taggraph.page.link/Datasets</ext-link>)). Methionine oxidation, a common post-isolation modification, was not enriched (p=0.49, Fisher’s exact test), nor were other post-isolation proline modifications (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5c</xref>). Thus, further study of hydroxylation could provide insight into cancer pathogenesis and reveal new therapeutic targets.</p>
      <p id="P25">As with proline hydroxylation, TagGraph substantially expanded the number of known lysine hydroxylation and asparagine hydroxylation sites by 14- and 4-fold, respectively. To elucidate possible direct protein-PTM interactions, we screened all PTM and protein quantifications for strong correlations across the 30 tissues examined here. We found several that confirmed known functional associations (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5d</xref>, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 14</xref>). Generally, we found that proteins that were highly correlated with specific modifications did not bear those modifications themselves (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 14b</xref>). However, they tended to be enriched for the same functional ontologies as the PTMs’ substrates (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 14c</xref>). Such highly correlated proteins may be candidate PTM-altering enzymes (analogous to kinases) or indirect regulators (analogous to cyclins).</p>
      <p id="P26">We found over 70 proteins that correlated highly with lysine hydroxylation across all tissues (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5d</xref>). Many of these proteins, such as PXDN and CYGB have known roles in oxygen transport or oxidoreductase activity (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 14c</xref>), supporting their role in regulating hydroxylation PTMs. Notably, many proteins that correlated with lysine hydroxylation also correlated with asparagine hydroxylation despite no previous evidence linking these PTMs to the same biological context. ECM collagens are the major substrates for lysine hydroxylation. Though asparagine hydroxylation was not previously characterized in the ECM, TagGraph revealed 45 sites on Fibrillin-1 and Fibrillin-2 (<bold>Datasets 10</bold> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://taggraph.page.link/Datasets">https://taggraph.page.link/Datasets</ext-link>)), both of which are ECM constituents.

    <title>Discussion</title>
    <p id="P27">While conventional database searches remain the optimal strategy for restricted protein identification, improvements in <italic>de novo</italic> sequencing speed<sup><xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref></sup> suggest that the TagGraph strategy can approach real-time data acquisition speeds. We expect this capability will become increasingly important as high-resolution and high-volume mass spectrometers become more widely available. Relatedly, enrichment methods remain the optimal choice for very deep analysis of select modifications, but we expect this requirement will greatly diminish as instrumentation sensitivity improves. Here, we find that given sufficiently deep MS/MS spectra, TagGraph makes otherwise un-enrichable PTMs readily measurable (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a,b</xref>).</p>
    <p id="P28">TagGraph incorporates a single-pass probabilistic model that simultaneously evaluates the likelihood that a peptide’s sequence and any modifications it bears are correct (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). This component of our approach was essential because current “target-decoy” error estimation methods are inherently blind to amino acid modifications<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref></sup>. We demonstrate the accuracy of our error estimations with expert inspection, synthetic peptides, direct comparison to target-decoy error estimations and secondary modification localizations. The re-discovery of known modification sites, motifs, protein-PTM relationships and functional roles for various PTMs further supports the validity of our approach. We expect this model can be further expanded for protein-level error estimation and to incorporate additional mass spectrum and peptide features attributes made possible by new data acquisition methods<sup><xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref></sup>.</p>
    <p id="P29">This kind of high-throughput, unbiased PTM discovery platform is compatible with any proteomics experiment that uses high-resolution tandem-mass spectrometry. We envision applying TagGraph to many types of experiments requiring much larger sequence spaces, including metaproteomics<sup><xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref></sup>, alternate start site utilization<sup><xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref></sup> and gene prediction refinement<sup><xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref></sup>. By rapidly evaluating many candidate protein and peptide configurations, TagGraph can validate translation products that would confound conventional database search methods. TagGraph’s peptide-focused output maintains compatibility with protein assembly and related post-search computations<sup><xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref></sup>, and this flexibility should have direct application to systems that have previously been intractable to large-scale proteome analysis such as the gut microbiome and other complex microbial communities. Finally, by learning essential experimental details directly from input data, TagGraph can help standardize proteomic analyses. This could enable direct comparisons between data sets collected by multiple laboratories, thereby fostering the kind of large-scale collaborations that have transformed the genomics field.</p>

        <title>Algorithm benchmarking with the A375 data set</title>
        <p id="P38">We assessed several expanded database search algorithms’ abilities to detect undefined modifications, without constraining protease specificity, using the A375 dataset. As a baseline, we searched all 168,391 MS/MS spectra in this dataset with SEQUEST<sup><xref rid="R64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref></sup> (ver. 28 rev 12) using an indexed sequence database comprised of the human proteome (Uniprot, downloaded 12/9/2014)<sup><xref rid="R65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref></sup> plus common contaminants. These sequences were appended by decoy protein sequences constructed as described in <bold>TagGraph Parameters</bold> section, below. The SEQUEST search was conducted with LysC protease specificity, 50 ppm precursor ion mass tolerance, and 0.5 Da fragment ion mass tolerance. Cysteine carbamidomethylation (+57.021464 Da) was set as a static modification and methionine oxidation (+15.994915 Da) was set as a differential modification. False discovery rates (FDRs) were estimated with a linear discriminant method<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>.</p>
        <p id="P39">The A375 dataset was then searched using PEAKS PTM (ver. 7)<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>, Byonic (ver. 2.5.6)<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>, ModA (ver. 1.03)<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>, the Open Search method using SEQUEST<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> and MSFragger (build 20170103)<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> – four distinct strategies described as being able to either consider relatively large numbers of discrete amino acid modifications, or searching spectra with no <italic>a priori</italic> constraints on possible modifications. It was not possible to search the entire A375 dataset with any of the above algorithms using completely unconstrained parameters with respect to both modifications and protease specificity: either the algorithms would not execute, or they did not complete within a reasonable amount of time (5 days per RAW data file). Thus, CPU times (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1e</xref>) were calculated using the least restrictive parameters that were compatible with each algorithm. Search times were extrapolated from a limited subset of search results (Byonic) for which searching the entire dataset would be too computationally intensive with similar computational resources used by the other algorithms. As such, reported search times represent a substantial underestimate of the true time needed for each of these algorithms to analyze a sample in a manner equivalent to TagGraph, as described below.</p>

FDRs were estimated using PEAKS’ internal target-decoy method.</p>

          <title>Open Search (MSFragger):</title>
          <p id="P44">the A375 dataset was analyzed using the following settings: 500 Da precursor mass tolerance; 10 ppm precursor true tolerance; 20 ppm fragment mass tolerance; no isotope_error correction; semispecific Trypsin digestion; one missed cleavage; clipped N-terminal Methionine; cysteine carbamidomethylation as a static modification; variable oxidized methionine, allow multiple modifications on one residue; allow up to three variable modifications per modification type; allow up to 1000 variable modifications per peptide; require at least 15 fragment ion peaks per MS/MS spectrum.

          <p id="P45">For the above algorithms, the target sequence database used was the same as for SEQUEST. PEAKS PTM and Byonic were allowed to use their own internal methods for creating decoy sequences, whereas ModA and both Open Search methods were provided the same concatenated target-decoy sequence database used for TagGraph EM comparisons (see <bold>TagGraph Parameters</bold> section, below). Open Search with SEQUEST used the same pre-processed sequence index as the conventional SEQUEST search. One CPU thread was used for all searches.</p>
          <p id="P46">CPU search times (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1e</xref>) were calculated as the sum of the CPU time over all processes spawned by each database search algorithm to analyze the data. Due to computational constraints, it was not possible to run Byonic with semi specific or nonspecific enzyme specificity or on the entire A375 dataset. Thus, we conducted the Byonic search with full LysC specificity (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref>), and analyzed only the first fraction of the A375 dataset. The estimated CPU time over the entire dataset was extrapolated by multiplying the CPU time recorded from the analysis of a single HPRP fraction by the ratio of the total MS/MS spectra in the dataset (168,391) divided by the number of MS/MS spectra in the single fraction (16,613).</p>

      <title>Target-decoy database construction and utilization</title>
      <p id="P53">For the purpose of comparing EM-based FDR estimations with the standard target-decoy approach (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2a, 2b</xref>, <xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Analysis 1</xref>), we concatenated human proteome sequences with decoy counterparts for target-decoy FDR estimation<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>. We previously observed that <italic>de novo</italic> sequencing algorithms occasionally mistake <italic>b</italic>- and <italic>y</italic>-ion series, and consequently have a tendency towards returning reversed sequences<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>. As a result, decoys generated by strict sequence reversal are at risk of systematically overestimating FDRs of TagGraph results: PSMs derived from incorrect, reversed de novo sequence would preferentially match decoy sequences over target sequences.</p>
      <p id="P54">We addressed this bias by generating decoy sequences in a manner that shuffled amino acid sequences while preserving the distribution of tryptic peptides and frequencies of peptides shared between proteins: (i) protein sequences are first reversed; (ii) the locations of all lysines and arginines in the reversed sequences are fixed, and the intervening sequences are shuffled; (iii) for each unique intervening pre-shuffled peptide sequence, the shuffled variant is cached and all subsequent peptide instances are mapped to the same shuffled variant. This method well-preserved a desired 50–50 target decoy ratio (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>, <xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Analysis 1a</xref>) by maintaining the same number, length, and mass distribution of unique LysC/tryptic peptides in the target and decoy databases, while removing the source of the overestimation bias described above.</p>
      <p id="P55">FDRs based on the target-decoy strategy (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>, and <xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Analysis 1b–d</xref>) were calculated by summing the number of decoy identifications exceeding a given EM score threshold, dividing this by the total number of identifications exceeding this threshold, and then multiplying this quotient by the “decoy factor” we previously described to account for the slight bias we observed towards decoy identifications<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>. This factor was estimated as the proportion of low-confidence (EM score &lt;0) target identifications relative to all low-confidence identifications. This factor was on average 1.88, rather than the expected 2.0. Short peptides &lt;8 amino acids in length were excluded from this analysis due to their lower information content.</p>

      <title>TagGraph Parameters</title>
      <p id="P56">TagGraph was used to analyze proteome data sets described above. All available MS/MS were first <italic>de novo</italic> sequenced using PEAKS as described in the <bold>Database search engine comparisons</bold> section above and noted below. The resulting peptide sequences and raw mass spectra (mzXML-formatted<sup><xref rid="R66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref></sup>) were given as input to TagGraph.</p>
      <p id="P57">For the A375 dataset, PEAKS was run with a precursor mass tolerance of 10 ppm and a fragment mass tolerance of 0.01 Da. To account for wider fragment mass variances for several component data sets that comprised the draft Human Proteome, we increased the fragment ion tolerance to 0.05 Da. This parameter was set to 1 Da for the low-resolution MS/MS lung data set. Other parameters were consistent with the A375, phosphorylation and low-resolution lung data set analyses: 10 ppm precursor mass tolerance cysteine carbamidomethylation as a static modification, and methionine oxidation as a differential modification. Unless otherwise specified, <italic>de novo</italic> sequencing results were searched with TagGraph against the human proteome (Uniprot, downloaded 12/9/2014) plus common contaminants without any additional decoy sequences.</p>
      <p id="P58">The above database was concatenated with decoy sequences only for searches involving the A375 data set, and for 12 other data sets examined in this report (<bold>Target-decoy database construction and utilization</bold> section, above): Searching this target-decoy sequence database with TagGraph enabled fair comparison of the CPU times of TagGraph with the other database search algorithms (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1e</xref>) and direct comparisons of FDR estimates (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a,b</xref>, <xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Analysis 1</xref>). Otherwise, no decoys were used for TagGraph analyses.</p>
      <p id="P59">TagGraph empirically optimizes precursor mass tolerances as part of its hierarchical Bayes scoring model. Fragment ion tolerances were initially set to 20 ppm of the precursor mass. We also define the quantity <bold>modification mass tolerance</bold>, which describes whether a particular modification agrees with one represented in the Unimod resource, or a novel modification specific to the present dataset. This tolerance was set to 0.1 Da. Enzyme specificity was set to LysC for the A375 dataset and Trypsin for the human proteome data set. Although enzyme specificity was considered as a scoring attribute in the hierarchical Bayes model, TagGraph is able to return high-confidence semi specific and nonspecific peptide-spectrum matches regardless of the input enzyme specificity.</p>
      <p id="P60">For the purposes of calibrating EM- and target-decoy FDR estimations, all returned peptide-spectrum matches were ranked according to their probabilities P(D|+) from highest to lowest, and the inverse (1- P) of these probabilities were summed in order of decreasing rank. FDRs were estimated from EM scores as described in <xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Note 4</xref>, <xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Equation 2</xref>. For all other purposes, we applied a probability threshold of 0.99 (log10 (1-P) ≥ 2), as previously described for parametric error estimation<sup><xref rid="R67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref></sup> – i.e., an EM scoring threshold of 2.0 (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Analysis 1c,d</xref>).</p>

      <title>PTM error estimation with amino acid-substituted proteome</title>

Despite this, all previously described unrestricted search algorithms rely on target-decoy to delineate sets of confidently identified spectra. To assess the degree to which estimated FDRs reflect underlying identification errors, we employed a modified human proteome sequence database in which every tyrosine residue was replaced by a phenylalanine. The mass difference between these residues (15.994915 Da) corresponds with an oxygen atom, and is a frequently observed modification on several residues (e.g., methionine), while distinguishing other unmodified residues (e.g., alanine and serine). Search engines capable of accurate PTM assignment and discrimination should search the tyrosine-substituted database and return phenylalanine-containing peptides modified by an oxygen only on those phenylalanines that were previously tyrosines. They should be able to discriminate these identifications from erroneous ones in which oxidation modifications were assigned to unaltered residues. We analyzed the A375 dataset against this modified sequence database using SEQUEST, PEAKS PTM, Byonic, ModA, and Open Search with SEQUEST and MSFragger. The results from each algorithm were then filtered to a 1% predicted FDR using target-decoy based statistics, or a 0.99 probability threshold for TagGraph (EM score &gt;2.0). Byonic, MODa, and PEAKS PTM were allowed to use their own internal target-decoy based filtering procedures. Search results provided by SEQUEST were filtered using a linear discriminant method<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>. All results were compared to the initial SEQUEST search results of the unaltered sequences database, which were filtered to a 1% FDR. Identification error was assessed based on the proportion of peptides that conflicted with the high confidence search results with respect to the overall amino acid sequence (base peptide), or to the presence of an unmodified phenylalanine at a former tyrosine position.</p>
      <p id="P62">The A375 dataset was also analyzed with TagGraph against the phenylalanine-substituted human sequence database. The parameters used were identical to those described in the <bold>TagGraph Parameters</bold> section above. Results were filtered to a probability value ≥0.99 (EM score &gt;2.0) as described above.</p>
      <p id="P63">We estimated a 2% maximum expected likelihood of conflicting identifications in <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2c</xref> as follows: We consider two sets of search results of the same mass spectra such that identifications made in any one set have a 99% likelihood of being correct. Assuming incorrect identifications are randomly distributed within each set of search results, spectra which receive the same identification from both search result sets should have a likelihood of being correct of 0.99<sup>2</sup> = 0.9801. Accordingly, the likelihood of an incorrect search result returned by either or both searches should be estimated as 1 –, 0.99<sup>2</sup> = 0.0199.</p>

Briefly, the number of spectral counts originating from peptides that uniquely map to single proteins were summed over all proteins identified in an experiment. Spectral counts recorded from peptides that map to multiple proteins were distributed across all such proteins according to the proportion of spectral counts assigned to them from uniquely mapped peptides. Finally, summed spectral counts for each protein were normalized by protein length, and the sum of all protein abundances for each experimental dataset was normalized to one. Protein abundances per tissue were calculated as the average of the individual NSAF for that protein over all experiments performed on that tissue. For the purpose of this analysis, proteins were defined solely by their unique representation in the input sequence file – proteins with equal or overlapping peptide evidence were represented in <bold>Dataset 7</bold> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://taggraph.page.link/Datasets">https://taggraph.page.link/Datasets</ext-link>).

        <title>Site abundance and stoichiometry calculations</title>
        <p id="P65">To compare modification sites between tissues, we quantified the abundance of sites using two methods: normalized spectral counts (NSC) and estimated stoichiometry. For both methods, we first generated a catalog of all confident peptide identifications that span a given modified amino acid position of a protein, regardless of modification state. The total spectral counts corresponding to all peptides containing the amino acid position (S<sub>T</sub>) and just those corresponding to peptides containing the exact modification on the site of interest (S<sub>m</sub>) were calculated for each experimental dataset.</p>
        <p id="P66">The normalized spectral count of a modification site was calculated as S<sub>m</sub> divided by the number of confidently identified peptide-spectrum matches in the experimental dataset. The stoichiometry of the modification was calculated as S<sub>m</sub> divided by S<sub>T</sub>, following a previously described rationale<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>. Modification site abundances (stoichiometry or NSC) per tissue were calculated as the average of the site abundances over all experiments performed on that tissue. Due to inherent difficulties in accurately reporting very low abundances with spectral counting<sup><xref rid="R70" ref-type="bibr">70</xref></sup>, experiments in which no peptides overlapping the site of modification were detected were not included in the average. Thus, the sum of stoichiometries of all modifications at a particular site in a particular tissue may not be normalized. Finally, the abundance, stoichiometry or normalized spectral count of a modification site was set to zero for a particular tissue if the corresponding protein NSAF was zero in that tissue.</p>

      <p id="P71">We tested the significance of any overlap between COSMIC cancer mutations and TagGraph-identified modifications via Fisher’s exact test. Using hydroxylated prolines to illustrate this calculation, we first identified all TagGraph-identified proteins bearing at least one proline hydroxylation and were also represented in the COSMIC database. From these, we tabulated the number of prolines in the protein sequences (31,603); the number of TagGraph-identified hydroxylations among these prolines (3,248); the number of COSMIC-identified mutated prolines (5,005) and the number of mutated sites that were also found to be hydroxylated (645). These values were used to derive the expected number of overlapping mutated and hydroxylated sites by chance (514.4). We observed 25% more overlapping sites than would be predicted by chance: (645–514.4)/514.4 = 25.4%</p>
      <p id="P72">To guard against biases in background amino acid distributions, overlap statistics were only calculated for proteins on which both cancer mutations and the PTM of interest were detected and only against the background of peptides confidently identified by TagGraph in the human proteome dataset.

      <title>Protein-PTM correlation analysis</title>
      <p id="P73">Reasoning that many modifications’ abundances and stoichiometries will depend on specific protein-modifying enzymes, we sought to discover functional relationships between post-translational modifications and proteins. We identified highly correlated subsets of modifications and proteins by comparing their abundances across the tissues examined here. Modification site and protein lists were first filtered to include only those identified from at least three tissues. For a particular post-translational modification of interest (e.g., Lysine hydroxylation), the abundance of the modification was averaged across all measured sites from all proteins within each tissue, forming a vector representing the abundance of the modification across all tissues. Similarly, for all identified proteins, the calculated NSAF was used to form an abundance vector of that protein’s expression across all tissues. We next determined the Pearson correlation coefficient between all modification and all protein vectors computed and filtered as described above. The proteins with the largest magnitude correlations (positive or negative) were then considered as candidates having a functional relationship with a modification of interest.</p>
      <p id="P74">Modification abundance vectors were calculated using both modification stoichiometries and modification-normalized spectral counts. Both types of quantification were used in the correlation analysis, often yielding different results (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 14a</xref>).

      <p id="P82"><bold>a)</bold> Traditional versus TagGraph workflow. <bold>b)</bold> Most <italic>de novo</italic>-interpreted high-resolution MS/MS spectra are mostly correct. The proportion of analyzed spectra interpreted with over 50% sequencing accuracy by PEAKS<sup><xref rid="R56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref></sup>, pNovo<sup><xref rid="R57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref></sup>, and PepNovo<sup><xref rid="R58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref></sup> on a data set of 168,391 MS/MS spectra derived from the A375 melanoma cell line (n=12 fractions evaluated in parallel). Central line denotes medians; whiskers indicate the 1.5 interquartile range, and circles indicate data points outside this range. <bold>c)</bold> TagGraph’s longest matching substring criterion (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>, <xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Note 1</xref>) yields very few candidate sequences for subsequent refinement and scoring. Heat map depicts the number of candidate peptide matches per spectrum (y-axis) versus the longest-matching substring used for candidate retrieval. Over 50% of all spectra TagGraph considered from the A375 data set were selected from &lt;6 candidates, and over 50% matched with sub-string lengths &gt;6 amino acids. <bold>d)</bold> TagGraph considered an entirely unrestricted peptide search space (black) with respect to protease specificity, range of modifications, number of modifications per peptide, and number of proteins. The same A375 data set was searched with conventional and expanded database search methods, but with one or more major (white) or modest (grey) space restrictions. Restrictions were selected so as to approach TagGraph’s unrestricted parameters while allowing each search engine to execute without failure (see <xref rid="S10" ref-type="sec">Online Methods</xref>). <bold>e)</bold> The combined <italic>de novo</italic> sequencing and TagGraph search times on the A375 data set were 4.3-fold shorter than previously described expanded modification and iterative search strategies, even when the latter were given considerably reduced search spaces (<bold>Fig. 1d</bold>). Search rates for TagGraph and PEAKS PTM included the preliminary <italic>de novo</italic> sequencing step using PEAKS (red; 0.51 sec/spectrum). Excluding the <italic>de novo</italic> step, TagGraph was 17.9-fold faster than the next-ranked search method. *Extrapolated values: Byonic was run on just 1/12 of the A375 data set due to search speed limitations (see <xref rid="S10" ref-type="sec">Online Methods</xref>, <bold>Dataset 1</bold> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://taggraph.page.link/Datasets">https://taggraph.page.link/Datasets</ext-link>)).</p>

      <p id="P83">Correct and incorrect TagGraph search results were discriminated with a hierarchical Bayes probabilistic model optimized by Expectation Maximization (EM) to score identification confidence and estimate false discovery rates (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Note 4</xref>, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 2</xref>). <bold>a)</bold> The A375 data set (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>) was searched against a composite target-decoy sequence database (<xref rid="S10" ref-type="sec">Online Methods</xref>) with TagGraph and evaluated by EM (<bold>Dataset 1</bold> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://taggraph.page.link/Datasets">https://taggraph.page.link/Datasets</ext-link>)). Decoys were effectively discriminated with this approach although the EM was blind to the decoy label in this analysis and in 12 other data sets (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Analysis 1a</xref>). <bold>b)</bold> EM was generally consistent with, but more conservative than target-decoy-based FDR estimates when both were applied to TagGraph results. This is expected considering target-decoy’s inability to distinguish correct and incorrect modifications. These findings were reproduced considering 12 other data sets (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Analysis 1b</xref>). <bold>c)</bold> The human proteome sequence database was modified, substituting every tyrosine residue with a phenylalanine (mass difference of −15.994915 Da). Unrestricted search error was estimated from the frequencies of “base” peptide sequences (grey) or substituted phenylalanine-containing peptides (red) reported by each algorithm that conflicted with results returned by a standard database search with SEQUEST (<xref rid="S10" ref-type="sec">Online Methods</xref>). Only TagGraph reported results with an empirically calculated error rate close to the expected 1.99% upper limit, assuming each algorithm’s results were filtered to a 1% FDR (<xref rid="S10" ref-type="sec">Online Methods</xref>). Open Search methods using SEQUEST<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> and MSFragger<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> were not evaluated for incorrect PTM localization because they do not directly localize modifications to specific residue positions.

As expected, the majority of peptides identified by both TagGraph and Kim et al. correspond to tryptic peptides. Peptides identified by TagGraph but not Kim et al. primarily originated from non-tryptic peptides and peptides with unanticipated modifications. Post-isolation modifications comprised the most prevalent identification category in this dataset. <bold>c)</bold> Mass shifts (modified amino acid mass – unmodified amino acid mass) corresponding to all modifications identified by TagGraph from the human proteome dataset reveal a complex modification landscape. Numbers of identifications (peptide-spectrum matches) span six orders of magnitude. Despite the presence of several highly abundant post-isolation modifications (e.g., formylation), the depth of the proteomic profiling achieved in this dataset made it possible to characterize lower abundance post-translational modifications. Inset: modification frequencies without log transformation. <bold>d)</bold> Ranked relative abundances of 2,576 PTM-amino acid combinations, as estimated by the number of spectra bearing each from the human proteome dataset. Ten of these are highlighted; all modifications are represented in <bold>Dataset 9</bold> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://taggraph.page.link/Datasets">https://taggraph.page.link/Datasets</ext-link>). <bold>e)</bold> Over 90% of modification sites (39,954 of 44,232) identified by TagGraph from the human proteome dataset were not among 52,959 previously described in Uniprot. However, the overlap in the sites reported by TagGraph and Uniprot (4,278) is highly significant (p-value = 1e-308, one-tail Fisher’s exact test).</p>

      <title>Characterization of hydroxylation, an un-enrichable PTM, enabled by TagGraph.</title>

Many hydroxylations displayed uniform abundance across solid tissues (i.e., P330, P642), whereas others displayed tissue-specific abundance variations (P408). <bold>c)</bold> Comparison between modification and cancer mutation sites (COSMIC). The size of each bubble indicates the number TagGraph-identified modification sites that were also found to be mutated in sequenced tumors (<bold>Dataset 17</bold> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://taggraph.page.link/Datasets">https://taggraph.page.link/Datasets</ext-link>)). The expected value and significance (one-tailed Fisher’s exact test) of this overlap was determined from the background of all peptides confidently identified by TagGraph (<xref rid="S10" ref-type="sec">Online Methods</xref>, <bold>Dataset 18</bold>). Proline hydroxylation sites significantly overlapped with mutation sites both overall (p =6e-11, Fisher’s exact test; p=1e-9, Bonferroni corrected) and when restricted to non-collagen domain containing proteins (p =4e-6, Fisher’s exact test; p=7e-5, Bonferroni corrected), suggesting that mutating these sites’ PTM capacity plays a role in cancer pathogenesis. <bold>d)</bold> Correlations between protein abundance and total PTM profiles across tissues (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 14</xref>) suggest candidate regulatory enzymes and functional associations. Proteins that highly correlated with lysine hydroxylation (x-axis), asparagine hydroxylation (y-axis) or both are highlighted (yellow, blue, or green, respectively). PLOD1 (in purple), the enzyme responsible for lysine hydroxylation in collagen emerged among the proteins most correlated with this modification. Protein expression levels were correlated with PTM stoichiometry across all tissues (<xref rid="S10" ref-type="sec">Online Methods</xref>).</p>
