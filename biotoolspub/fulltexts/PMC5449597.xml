      <title>Abstract</title>
      <p>Established and emerging next generation sequencing (NGS)-based technologies allow for genome-wide interrogation of diverse biological processes. However, accessibility of NGS data remains a problem, and few user-friendly resources exist for integrative analysis of NGS data from different sources and experimental techniques. Here, we present Online Resource for Integrative Omics (ORIO; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://orio.niehs.nih.gov/">https://orio.niehs.nih.gov/</ext-link>), a web-based resource with an intuitive user interface for rapid analysis and integration of NGS data. To use ORIO, the user specifies NGS data of interest along with a list of genomic coordinates. Genomic coordinates may be biologically relevant features from a variety of sources, such as ChIP-seq peaks for a given protein or transcription start sites from known gene models. ORIO first iteratively finds read coverage values at each genomic feature for each NGS dataset. Data are then integrated using clustering-based approaches, giving hierarchical relationships across NGS datasets and separating individual genomic features into groups. In focusing its analysis on read coverage, ORIO makes limited assumptions about the analyzed data; this allows the tool to be applied across data from a variety of experiments and techniques. Results from analysis are presented in dynamic displays alongside user-controlled statistical tests, supporting rapid statistical validation of observed results. We emphasize the versatility of ORIO through diverse examples, ranging from NGS data quality control to characterization of enhancer regions and integration of gene expression information. Easily accessible on a public web server, we anticipate wide use of ORIO in genome-wide investigations by life scientists.</p>

    <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
    <p>With the advent of next generation sequencing (NGS) (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>), a wide diversity of techniques for whole-genome characterization of biological processes has emerged. These techniques allow for interrogation of genetic sequence (DNA-seq), DNA accessibility (DNase-seq and ATAC-seq) (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>), DNA-protein interactions (ChIP-seq) (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>) and expression profiles (RNA-seq) (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>), among other biological properties. Though valuable on their own, integration of these approaches provides a fuller picture of highly coordinated biological processes, such as gene regulation (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Despite these advances, integrative analysis of NGS data remains inaccessible to many life scientists. Most existing tools for NGS data require specialized computational expertise that to-date has not been a core component of biology training. Further, accessible data integration tools primarily focus on visualization of data at a single locus (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>), limiting genome-wide analyses.</p>
    <p>To provide a platform for large-scale NGS data integration that empowers life scientists, we developed ORIO (Online Resource for Integrative Omics), a web-based tool for rapid analysis of NGS datasets (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). An ORIO analysis begins with the user selecting NGS datasets of interest and specifying a list of loci as genomic coordinates. These coordinates can correspond to biologically relevant genomic features, such as transcription start sites or genomic locations of ChIP-seq peaks. ORIO first iteratively calculates the read coverage at genomic features for each NGS dataset (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). ORIO provides dynamic display options to investigate these read coverage values, including heatmaps with extensive options for rank ordering. To support discovery-based investigation of these coverage values, ORIO then performs clustering across datasets, grouping genomic features into informative groups (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>) and finding hierarchical relationships across NGS datasets (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). Clustering can have functional implications important to discovery, implying coordinated regulation or direct interaction.</p>

    <p>ORIO is implemented in a modern web framework that organizes data and analysis results. All features are accessible using its web interface; users may upload data, set up analyses and view results. ORIO also hosts 4506 human and mouse datasets from the ENCODE research project, providing a point of access for life scientists to contextualize their own data within a rigorously controlled dataset. Statistical tests are also implemented next to dynamic displays of analysis results, allowing transitions from discovery to hypothesis-based inquiry over iterative analysis. ORIO was consciously designed to make minimal assumptions about data during analysis, allowing its applications to a variety of experiment types and study designs. We present ORIO alongside several example analyses to illustrate its versatility. These examples range from quality control of a target dataset to integration of NGS data with gene expression information and genome-wide characterization of enhancer regions.</p>

      <title>ORIO analysis</title>
      <p>ORIO anchors its analysis of NGS datasets on a user-defined feature list of genomic coordinates. The first step of an ORIO analysis is selection of NGS datasets (up to 500 individual datasets) and a feature list from public or user-uploaded options. Feature lists of genomic coordinates are accepted in Browser Extensible Data (BED) format (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>), facilitating its use with other bioinformatics tools. BED files may contain up to 500 000 features, allowing for comprehensive analysis of most genome-wide phenomena. ORIO accepts BED files with three or more columns. ORIO takes strand information from a BED file if available and uses it to orient coverage calculations for individual features.</p>
      <p>ORIO first iteratively finds read coverage for NGS datasets at each genomic feature. Read coverage is determined within user-specified windows anchored at each genomic feature. By default, the window originates 2500 nts upstream of the center of a given feature and extends downstream by fifty 100-nt non-overlapping bins; the total default window size is 5000 nts. The window start, bin number and bin size may all be changed by the user. The user may also specify strand for both the genomic feature list and NGS datasets. If specified, values will reflect same-strand coverage. Observation of strand-specificity is especially important in the context of gene models where only a single strand is transcribed and where the genomic environment may be distinct upstream and downstream of a given feature (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Read coverage values are compiled into a matrix file for each NGS dataset. Matrix files are accessed internally by ORIO and may be downloaded by the user through the web interface.</p>
      <p>ORIO performs correlative analysis considering read coverage values. A single total read coverage value is found for each genomic feature by adding the coverage from NGS datasets across all bins in a genomic window. Clustering methods are then applied to total read coverage values considering both NGS datasets and individual genomic features. To group NGS datasets, the Spearman correlation value for each pair of datasets is found by comparing feature coverage values. The use of rank-order Spearman correlation values mitigates the need of normalization of read coverage values between datasets. NGS datasets are then grouped by hierarchical clustering considering 1 – abs(<italic>ρ</italic>) as a distance metric. To group genomic features, a 1D vector is first found for each feature by concatenating coverage totals for each NGS dataset. These values are normalized by variance, and the Euclidean distance between these vectors is used to group genomic features by <italic>k</italic>-means clustering. <italic>k</italic>-means clustering is iteratively performed for <italic>k</italic>-values 2 through 10, and clustering results for any of these <italic>k</italic>-values may be selected and accessed by the user in the interface.</p>
      <p>An alternative analytical approach is used if a sort vector is specified at the onset of analysis. A sort vector is a flexible data format where a single value is specified for each genomic feature. A sort vector is useful for integrating information into an ORIO analysis that may not be easily inferred from read coverage and may require additional assumptions in analysis. For instance, we present an example in this work where gene expression information is incorporated using a sort vector. When a sort vector is specified, Spearman correlations are determined between sort vector values and calculated NGS read coverage for each window bin. Correlation values across each window are then concatenated, resulting in a single data vector for each NGS dataset. Hierarchical clustering is then performed considering Euclidean distance between vectors as a distance metric. <italic>k</italic>-means clustering of genomic features is performed in the same way as in analyses without a sort vector.</p>
      <p>ORIO accepts coverage information from NGS datasets in bigWig format. Consortia such as ENCODE report read coverage in this format. Increasingly, other groups are following the same practice, allowing other users access to coverage values consistent with alignment and read processing procedures of the original authors. Coverage values may be derived from actual reads or from estimated fragments, as appropriate for each individual dataset, and may be readily derived from alignment files using publically available software such as BEDTools (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). ORIO achieves fast runtimes by parallelizing read coverage calculations and performing computationally intensive calculations in C utilities. Coverage values are calculated using bigWigAverageOverBed from the UCSC Kent Tools utilities package (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). ORIO runtimes range from seconds to hours, depending on the number of datasets analyzed and the length of the genomic feature list. Benchmarking results are given in Table <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">1</xref>.</p>

      <p>ORIO is hosted on a public server. ORIO uses the Python-based Django web framework (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>) that allows for robust management of user data and integration with data visualization tools. To create an analysis, ORIO requires that each user create an email-associated account; the user receives notification of completed analyses through email messages. By default, analyses are private and only accessible by the creator; however, analyses may be made public such that anyone who has the URL could view the output (the examples presented below are public). ORIO allows for upload of user genomic feature lists through a web form and of user NGS data through HTTP. The web interface of ORIO is available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/niehs/orio-web/">https://github.com/niehs/orio-web/</ext-link>. In addition to providing a manual and ‘Getting Started’ guide, its documentation includes instructions for deployment and creation of a development environment.

      <title>Data visualization and statistical tests</title>
      <p>ORIO provides tools for dynamic visualization of analysis results. The results of clustering approaches are presented in heatmaps annotated by tooltips. Raw read coverage values may be viewed using heatmaps and 2D scatterplots. Further investigation of read coverage may be performed through rank-order sorting of coverage heatmaps and quartiling of genomic features by independent data vectors. Non-parametric statistical tests may be applied to NGS and genomic feature groups for rigorous comparisons and hypothesis testing. Differences across quartiled genomic features are assessed using Anderso–-Darling and Kruskal–Wallis tests. Differences across clustered genomic features are assessed using pairwise Mann–Whitney tests. These tests empower rigorous analysis of visualized differences and may imply functional association.</p>
      <p>Data visualization by ORIO is implemented in Javascript and uses D3 (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Statistical tests are implemented using NumPy and SciPy (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>).</p>

      <p>Published mouse embryonic stem cell Start-seq data (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>) was used to call transcription start sites (TSSs). Prior to calling, reads with average Phred quality scores less than 20 were removed, and TruSeq adaptor sequences were trimmed using cutadapt (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). Reads were then aligned to the mm9 assembly using Bowtie (parameters: -m1 -v2 -X1000) (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). 5΄ read end read coverages were then compiled into a bedGraph file and applied to TSS calling by Python script TSScall.py (default parameters). This calling approach is based on previously described methodologies (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). In short, TSSs called at single-nt positions with the most reads across bins spanning the entire genome. TSSs are only called at positions whose read count exceeds an FDR-based threshold (here, FDR = 0.001). TSSs were then grouped by distance; groups were made such that any two TSSs within 1000 bp of each other were placed in the same group. The TSS with the highest read count was taken forward as a representative TSS. TSScall.py and a script for selecting group representatives (TSSfilterToClusterRepresentatives.py) are available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/niehs/TSScall/">https://github.com/niehs/TSScall/</ext-link>.

    <title>RESULTS AND DISCUSSION</title>
    <p>An ORIO analysis begins with selection of a list of features at discrete genomic coordinates. A variety of different biological phenomenon may be represented as such a list. For instance, the activity of a transcription factor may be represented by protein binding sites determined empirically from ChIP-seq data (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>) or predicted by occurrence of protein binding motifs (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). ORIO anchors its analysis to the selected feature list, effectively focusing on regions of the genome relevant to user interest.</p>
    <p>ORIO iteratively calculates read coverage for each genomic feature and each NGS dataset (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). Coverage values are found in user-defined windows anchored at each feature. Acknowledging that most NGS analytical methods involve some manipulation of read coverage, ORIO bases its analysis on coverage and is agnostic to the exact method used. Because read coverage is considered, ORIO may be applied to a wide variety of NGS data types, allowing for integration of different experiment types. Use of a relatively simple analytical approach was a deliberate choice that enhances ORIO's flexibility and makes its results readily interpretable. Even when using targeted analytical approaches specific to a given data type, read coverage is still informative. For instance, considerations specific to ChIP-seq data may be used in peak calling; however, results must often be validated through direct comparison to read coverage, either by eye or by performing meta-analyses of coverage values.</p>
    <p>Coverage values are then used in integrative analysis. Both NGS datasets and genomic features are associated into informative groups by hierarchical and <italic>k</italic>-means clustering, respectively (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">C</xref>). Analysis results are reported in dynamic displays alongside p-values from statistical tests. Clustering approaches and statistical tests were selected to minimize assumptions made about the analyzed data and broaden applicability. For instance, rank-order correlation and non-parametric statistical tests are applied due to the minimal assumptions made about the underlying data.</p>
    <p>ORIO combines several informative analytical and visualization methods into a single tool, each tied to the execution of a single analysis run. We are unaware of another tool that combines the ability to rapidly compare NGS datasets with integrated statistical tests and clustering, though these functions are individually available (Table <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). With this and other features, ORIO differentiates itself based on ease of use and accessibility. ORIO achieves a high degree of flexibility by supporting a diversity of data types, allowing incorporation of user-defined custom data, and by not requiring analysis on predefined features. All ORIO functions are accessible through a standalone web interface, with an intuitive data management system for adding and editing user data. Unique for NGS data visualization tools, ORIO hosts publicly available NGS datasets and annotations and performs computationally intensive analytical calculations on a remote server. By hosting 4506 human and mouse datasets from the ENCODE project (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>), ORIO obviates the need for users to download and maintain prohibitively large data. Incorporating these files into ORIO enables filtering functions for rapid and facile selection of consortial data. Together with intuitive management of user-uploaded data and remote hosting of intensive analysis, users may readily contextualize their data amongst diverse datasets.</p>

    <p>We have described the function of ORIO in general terms, but its applicability to biological questions may best be conveyed by example analyses. In the following examples, we apply ORIO analysis to (i) validate data derived from a ChIP-seq experiment, (ii) integrate ChIP-seq peaks with other NGS data, (iii) correlate gene expression with enrichment of histone modifications, (iv) recapitulate cell lineages using DNase-seq data and (v) characterize enhancer and promoter regions by a variety of NGS datasets (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://orio.niehs.nih.gov/quickstart/">https://orio.niehs.nih.gov/quickstart/</ext-link>). We provide publicly accessible links to analysis results for each example.</p>

      <title>Example 1: quality control by comparative validation of ChIP-seq data</title>
      <p>NGS data quality is frequently first assessed using metrics such as read quality scores and duplication rates. However, even datasets with acceptable sequencing metrics can fail to provide biologically relevant information. Confidence in an experimental dataset may be improved by comparing it to validated experiments. This is especially important with techniques such as ChIP-seq where observed signal enrichment may be due to intrinsic variation found in input controls. ORIO complements common quality control procedures by allowing rapid comparison with validated datatsets similar in experimental design. We considered a publicly available H3K27ac ChIP-seq dataset from mouse ES-Bruce4 cells as an experimental test case and analyzed it against a diversity of other H3K27ac ChIP-seq datasets (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Datasets from input controls were included in analysis as well as datasets from the mutually exclusive and functionally distinct H3K27me3 mark. A hosted list of 27 829 mouse TSSs from RefSeq was used as the ORIO feature list, restricting the analysis to biologically relevant promoter regions. Default parameter were used, defining analysis windows of 5 kb centered on each TSS. We present results from this analysis Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>; the analysis is publicly available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://orio.niehs.nih.gov/dashboard/analysis/889-sample-validation-of-chip-seq-data/">https://orio.niehs.nih.gov/dashboard/analysis/889-sample-validation-of-chip-seq-data/</ext-link>.</p>

      <p>Hierarchical clustering show clear separate grouping of H3K27ac, H3K27me3, and input control datasets (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). Replicates are tightly coupled in the resulting clustering. Importantly, test case data from ES-Bruce4 cells clusters well with other datasets, implying high data quality. Further supporting the separation between H3K27ac and controls, signal enrichment is coordinated across H3K27ac, H3K27me3, and input groups in feature clustering of RefSeq TSSs; an individual feature will generally have either high or low signal for a given group, but signal may not be consistently high across H3K27ac, H3K27me3, and input controls (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). Notably, there is intrinsic variability in the input controls, which could easily be misinterpreted as signal in the experiment. Correlative analysis by ORIO allows the user to validate that differences in experimental signal are distinct from intrinsic variability in the input control. Due to the abundance of hosted data, ORIO can support rapid validation for many potential experimental datasets.</p>

      <title>Example 2: integration of NGS data over ChIP-seq peaks</title>
      <p>Peak calling is often applied to ChIP-seq datasets to define areas of enriched read coverage. We analyzed a list of 30 774 ChIP-seq peaks derived from the same ES-Bruce4 H3K27ac dataset validated in example 1 (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). These peaks correspond to regions in the genome enriched for the H3K27ac mark. We performed an ORIO analysis over these sites to see what data correlate with H3K27ac and to see if distinct functional states exist at H3K27ac-enriched regions. These functional states may display coincident genomic features such as histone modifications and transcription factor binding sites; in this way, though the analysis is centered on H3K27ac-enriched sites, other features are effectively investigated. We used the list of H3K27ac peaks as an ORIO feature list and then integrated all ENCODE ChIP-seq data from mouse Bruce4 and E14 ES cell lines, allowing exploration of transcription factors and other histone marks. Results from this analysis are presented in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> and are publicly available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://orio.niehs.nih.gov/dashboard/analysis/850-sample-integration-over-chip-seq-peaks/">https://orio.niehs.nih.gov/dashboard/analysis/850-sample-integration-over-chip-seq-peaks/</ext-link>.</p>

      <p>H3K27ac is a mark associated with activated regions of the genome, including both promoters and enhancers. Therefore, H3K27ac marks coincide with other marks associated with promoters and enhancers, though promoters and enhancers themselves will be distinct in terms of chromatin state. ORIO provides informative clustering of ChIP-seq datasets at H3K27ac peaks; there are two distinct clusters of histone marks, one with promoter-associated marks and another with enhancer-associated marks (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). A separate bar-plot view displays all correlations sorted by the absolute correlation value (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). Though centered on H3K27ac peaks, ORIO analysis allows characterization of other genomic features. A relatively strong correlation is seen between H3K4me3 and H3K9ac marks. To allow more precise examination of pairwise relationships, ORIO creates rank-ordered heatmaps (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>), scatterplots (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref>), and plots of read coverage quartiled by rank order (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3E</xref>). Anderson–Darling and Kruskal–Wallis statistical tests are applied to rank-ordered quartiles of read coverage to evaluate the differences in quartile distributions. Data displays and statistical tests are complementary, allowing for in-depth characterization of biological phenomena and validation of initial observations. Here, the significant correlation between H3K4me3 and H3K9ac implies coincidence of these two marks in biologically active regions, suggests their potential coordination in gene regulation, and recapitulates trends observed in heatmaps and scatterplots.</p>
      <p>ORIO also clusters features based on their overlap with NGS datasets. Here, H3K27ac peaks are clustered by their coincidence with other histone marks. Clustering predominately separates peaks into those associated with promoters and/or enhancers; cluster 1 peaks, in regions with enhancer-associated marks like H3K4me1, are found in intergenic regions and gene bodies, while cluster 3 peaks, coincident with marks like H3K4me3, are found at promoters (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3F</xref>). ORIO generates box plots and performs statistical tests that allow comparisons of individual clusters considering a given dataset; cluster 1 shows a significant enrichment of H3K4me1 signal over cluster 3, while cluster 3 shows a significant enrichment of H3K4me3 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">H</xref>). ORIO automatically associates features with genes by proximity and allows these gene lists to be easily accessed in the user interface. These results are amenable for use in external tools such as gene ontology and functional annotation programs (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). Genes from cluster 3 show overlap with functions and processes associated with embryonic stem cells, such as chordate embryonic development and wide-spread negative transcription regulation commonly associated with a pluripotent state (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3I</xref>). Clustering by ORIO recapitulates that H3K27ac is associated with distinct promoter and enhancer regions, each characterized by distinguishing genomic features (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>).</p>

      <title>Example 3: correlation of gene expression with enrichment of histone modifications</title>
      <p>Integrating analysis of gene expression values with NGS data is a common way to investigate putative mechanisms of gene regulation. Determining the extent of gene expression from RNA-seq data typically requires analysis of read coverage while considering transcript models. ORIO provides no means of natively determining gene expression values. However, we anticipated that users will want to incorporate independently analyzed outside data into ORIO. To address this, ORIO allows flexible integration of non-NGS data through a generic data format. Users may provide individual values for each item in a genomic feature list in a tab-delimited text file. These values could be quantitative, such as gene expression values, or categorical, such as chromatin states. In ORIO, these data are referred to as a sort vector. When a sort vector is provided at the outset of an ORIO analysis, hierarchical clustering of NGS data is performed based on rank-order correlation of read coverage values with the sort vector. Sort vectors may be leveraged to allow creative integration of non-NGS data. Using a sort vector, we incorporated gene expression information into this example to find genomic features associated with active genes.</p>
      <p>To quantify gene expression, FPKM values were calculated from an ENCODE RNA-seq dataset for mouse ES-Bruce4 cells. These FPKM values were then used as a sort vector in an ORIO analysis. To correlate gene expression with histone modification enrichment, the analysis was run with all ENCODE ChIP-seq datasets in ES-Bruce4 cells considering RefSeq TSSs as the feature list. Analysis was also run with the RNA-seq datasets used to calculate FPKM values. Results are presented in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> and are publicly available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://orio.niehs.nih.gov/dashboard/analysis/853-sample-correlation-with-gene-expression/">https://orio.niehs.nih.gov/dashboard/analysis/853-sample-correlation-with-gene-expression/</ext-link>.</p>

      <p>Considering genomic windows about features, ORIO presents sort vector correlations on a bin-by-bin basis (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>). As expected, RNA-seq read coverage values correlate well with expression values immediately downstream of TSSs. Here, RNA-seq read coverage represents steady-state levels of transcribed RNAs. Lower correlation values further downstream of TSSs likely reflect the lower coverage in downstream introns. Correlations also reveal histone marks associated with active promoters, such as H3K4me3. Correlations may be investigated at a given bin through scatterplot (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>) or for a given dataset by bar chart (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>). ORIO also allows for rank ordering of heatmaps and quartiling of read coverage by sort vector values. H3K4me3 heatmaps sorted by gene expression show a relationship between H3K4me3 read coverage and expression (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D</xref>), and Anderson–Darling and Kruskal–Wallis tests verify that the difference in the distributions of quartiles is significant (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4E</xref>).

      <title>Example 4: recapitulation of cell lineages using DNase-seq</title>
      <p>For the fourth and fifth examples, we applied ORIO to a comprehensive list of 163 274 TSSs derived from Start-seq data in mouse embryonic stem cells (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). ORIO allows custom-defined genomic features to center analysis. Here, features were determined by TSScall.py, a standalone Python script for calling TSSs from Start-seq data based upon previously described methods (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). Start-seq begins with the selection of short capped species from nuclear RNA isolates, ensuring that characterized transcripts are derived from early stages of transcription (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). The 5΄ end of each Start-seq read corresponds with single-nucleotide resolution to the TSS of that transcript. Because transcripts are taken from the early stages of transcription, Start-seq describes TSSs of both mRNAs and short-lived non-coding RNAs, including RNAs produced at enhancers (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). As such, TSSs called from Start-seq describes active promoters and enhancers across the genome. TSSs were examined with all ENCODE DNase digital genomic footprinting (DGF) data available in mouse representing 22 different cell lines and tissues. DNase-DGF footprinting assays regions of the genome available for DNA-protein interactions and effectively characterizes the cis-regulatory framework of the target organism (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). The list of TSSs provides a catalog of enhancer and promoter regions under cis-regulatory control. Across different cells and tissues, many of these regions will be regulated in a similar fashion, but differences may be attributed in part to differences in cell lineage (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). We hoped to capture these differences in an ORIO analysis. Results from this example are presented in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> and are available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://orio.niehs.nih.gov/dashboard/analysis/842-sample-recapitulation-of-cell-lineages/">https://orio.niehs.nih.gov/dashboard/analysis/842-sample-recapitulation-of-cell-lineages/</ext-link>.</p>

      <p>The TSSs described by Start-seq are found in active regions across the genome, including in regions with distinct functional roles, like promoters and enhancers. TSSs were clustered considering ChIP-seq and RNA-seq read coverage values (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>). <italic>k</italic>-means clustering results were examined with <italic>k</italic>-value of 10 to provide the greatest granularity allowed by ORIO. As evidenced by coverage values at cluster centroids (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>), clusters are enriched for histone modifications associated with distinct functional roles. These roles were confirmed by comparisons with RefSeq gene models (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>) and chromatin states determined by chromHMM analysis (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6C</xref>). Clusters 2 and 7 show an enrichment of enhancer-associated marks like H327ac and H3K4me1 (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>); consistent with this, most TSSs in this cluster display ‘Strong Enhancer’ chromatin states. Clusters 3 and 9 display an enrichment of H3K4me3, a mark associated with promoter regions (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). TSSs in this cluster are found predominantly in the promoter regions of RefSeq gene models. Cluster 3 shows strong overlap with ‘Active Promoter’ chromatin states. Cluster 9, with a distinct enrichment of repressive mark H3K27me3 (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>), shows unique overlap with ‘Poised Promoter’ and ‘Repressed’ chromatin states; ORIO accurately segregates promoter-associated TSS clusters into functionally relevant groups. Though commonly used to interrogate gene expression, here RNA-seq provides a measure of transcription at a genomic locus. Cluster 10 shows enrichment for RNA-seq and H3K36me3 coverage (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>); consistent with this, these TSSs occur predominantly within RefSeq gene models and in transcribed chromatin states. The remaining clusters 1, 4, 5, 6, and 8 all show relatively low signal with most histone modifications and are variably enriched for ‘Heterochromatin’ chromatin states. However, many TSSs in these clusters are found in enhancer- and transcribed region-associated chromatin states.</p>
      <p>As evidenced by Example 5, ORIO informatively groups features into biologically relevant clusters. Coincident marks at individual clusters also imply coordinated function. For instance, cluster 9 implies interplay between H3K4me3 and H3K27me3, two histone modifications associated with opposing activation and repression functions. Cluster membership provides a list of many genomic loci where this association may be investigated in detail.</p>

    <title>CONCLUSION</title>
    <p>ORIO provides a framework for rapid and informative integration of NGS data. As shown by numerous examples, ORIO performs applications ranging from data validation to hypothesis-driven investigations and provides biologically relevant results that recapitulate independent analyses. An intuitive web interface and extensive help documentation makes ORIO accessible to life scientists with minimal computational expertise. ORIO's acceptance of widely used data formats makes it amenable to integration with other bioinformatics tools, such as peak callers, and its modern architecture makes it suitable to outside development toward specialized application. ORIO will facilitate genome-wide exploration of NGS data by life scientists and will support scientists transition between discovery, hypothesis generation, and more detailed investigations through robust analysis, informative visualization, and rigorous statistical tests.</p>
