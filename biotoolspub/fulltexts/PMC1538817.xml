      <title>Abstract</title>
      <p> siVirus ( <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://siVirus.RNAi.jp/">http://siVirus.RNAi.jp/</ext-link> ) is a web-based online software
system that provides efficient short interfering RNA (siRNA) design for antiviral RNA
interference (RNAi). siVirus searches for functional, off-target minimized siRNAs
targeting highly conserved regions of divergent viral sequences. These siRNAs are expected
to resist viral mutational escape, since their highly conserved targets likely contain
structurally/functionally constrained elements. siVirus will be a useful tool for
designing optimal siRNAs targeting highly divergent pathogens, including human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), influenza virus and SARS
coronavirus, all of which pose enormous threats to global human health. </p>

  <sec>
    <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
    <p> RNA interference (RNAi) is now widely used to knockdown gene expression in a
sequence-specific manner, making it a powerful tool not only for studying gene function, but
also for therapeutic purposes, including antiviral treatments ( <xref rid="B1">1</xref> –
<xref rid="B4">4</xref> ). Currently, the replication of a wide range of viruses can be
inhibited successfully using RNAi, with both short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and siRNA
expression vectors ( <xref rid="B5">5</xref> ). </p>
    <p> In mammalian RNAi, the efficacy of each siRNA varies widely depending on its sequence;
only a limited fraction of randomly designed siRNAs is highly effective. Many experiments
have been conducted to clarify possible sequence requirements of functional siRNAs. Of
these, our work incorporates guidelines from three major studies ( <xref rid="B6">6</xref> –
<xref rid="B8">8</xref> ) of selecting functional siRNAs. However, designing functional
siRNAs that target viral sequences is problematic because of their extraordinarily high
genetic diversity. For example, about 500 entries of near full-length sequences of HIV-1
group M, which is largely responsible for global pandemic, are stored in the sequence
databases, but it proved impossible to select a common 21mer from among all of them.
Moreover, RNAi-resistant viral mutants achieved through point mutation or deletion emerge
rapidly when targeting viruses in cell culture. These problems suggest a strong need to
select highly conserved target sites for designing antiviral siRNAs. Furthermore, the
off-target silencing effects of siRNA are also a serious problem that could affect host gene
expression ( <xref rid="B9">9</xref> ). Off-target silencing effects arise when an siRNA has
sequence similarities with unrelated genes. In antiviral RNAi, it is desirable to minimize
off-target effects against human genes. </p>
    <p>Consequently, only a limited fraction of 21mers is suitable for use as antiviral siRNAs. In
this study, we developed a novel web-based online software system, siVirus, which provides
functional, off-target minimized siRNAs targeting highly conserved regions of divergent
viral sequences.</p>
  </sec>
  <sec>
    <title>METHODS</title>
    <sec>
      <title>Selection of highly conserved siRNA target sites</title>
      <p> Highly conserved siRNA sequences are selected based on their <italic>degree of
conservation</italic> , defined as the proportion of viral sequences that are targeted
by the corresponding siRNA, with complete matches (i.e. 21/21 matches). All possible siRNA
candidates targeting every other position of user-selected viral sequences are generated
and their degrees of conservation are computed. Users can arbitrarily specify a set of
viral sequences for the computation; e.g. sequences can be selected from a specific
geographic region(s) or a specific genotype(s) to design the best siRNAs tailored to
specific user needs. siVirus also accepts user's own sequences in a multi-FASTA format and
shows whether each siRNA can target the posted sequences. </p>
    </sec>
    <sec>
      <title>siRNA efficacy prediction</title>
      <p> In mammalian RNAi, the efficacy of each siRNA varies markedly depending on its sequence;
hence, several groups have reported guidelines for selecting functional siRNAs. siVirus
incorporates the guidelines of Ui-Tei <italic>et al</italic> . ( <xref rid="B6">6</xref>
), Reynolds <italic>et al</italic> . ( <xref rid="B7">7</xref> ) and Amarzguioui
<italic>et al</italic> . ( <xref rid="B8">8</xref> ) and shows whether each siRNA
satisfies these guidelines. </p>
    </sec>
    <sec>
      <title>Off-target searches</title>
      <p> Off-target searches were performed for each siRNA using siDirect ( <xref rid="B10">10</xref> , <xref rid="B11">11</xref> ). siVirus shows the number of off-target hits
within two mismatches against the non-redundant database of human transcripts ( <xref rid="B10">10</xref> ). </p>
    </sec>
    <sec>
      <title>Database maintenance</title>
      <p> Currently, siVirus incorporates viral genome sequences of HIV-1, HCV, influenza A virus
and SARS coronavirus. These sequences were downloaded from the Los Alamos HIV Sequence
Database ( <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hiv-web.lanl.gov/">http://hiv-web.lanl.gov/</ext-link> ), the Los Alamos HCV Sequence
Database ( <xref rid="B12">12</xref> ), the NCBI Influenza Virus Sequence Database (
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/FLU/FLU.html">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/FLU/FLU.html</ext-link> ), and NCBI GenBank ( <xref rid="B13">13</xref> ), respectively. siVirus will be updated continuously as these
databases are revised. We also plan to incorporate other viruses if sufficient numbers of
their sequences are available. </p>
    </sec>
  </sec>
  <sec>
    <title>RESULTS AND DISCUSSION</title>
    <p> To design anti-HIV siRNA, we analyzed the 495 near full-length HIV-1 sequences listed in
Supplementary Table 1. A total of 4 417 157 possible siRNA candidates (i.e. substrings of
length 21) targeting every other position of the HIV-1 sequences were produced from the 495
viral sequences. The analysis of these siRNA candidates revealed that highly conserved
siRNAs constituted only 0.3% of the possible siRNAs if &gt;90% conservation is expected (
<xref rid="FIG1">Figure 1A</xref> ). The fraction is still as small as 0.8% even if the
threshold of the conservation is relaxed to 80%. On the other hand, siRNAs predicted to be
functional by one or more guidelines ( <xref rid="B6">6</xref> – <xref rid="B8">8</xref> )
constituted 35.5% of the 4 417 157 siRNAs ( <xref rid="FIG1">Figure 1B</xref> ). Taken
together, siRNAs that are &gt;80% conserved, and satisfy at least one guideline constitute
only 0.2% of the siRNAs. In this condition, 20–30 siRNAs can be designed for each
full-length sequence of HIV-1. These indicate that most of the randomly designed siRNAs are
not suited for targeting HIV-1 efficiently. </p>
    <p><xref rid="FIG1">Figure 1C</xref> shows typical output from siVirus for designing anti-HIV
siRNAs. A total of 182 sequences from HIV-1 subtypes B, C and CRF01_AE, which are the most
prevalent HIV-1 genotypes circulating in Asia, were selected. The results were sorted by
their degree of conservation, and filtered to display siRNAs that satisfy at least one
efficacy guideline. The off-target search results against human genes are also shown. It is
desirable to select an siRNA that has less off-target hits. </p>
    <p> To test the validity of siVirus, 35 siRNAs satisfying the guideline by Ui-Tei <italic>et
al</italic> . ( <xref rid="B6">6</xref> ) were designed against the conserved regions of
HIV-1 genomes using siVirus and were assayed for inhibition of viral replication. Among
them, 31 siRNAs effectively inhibited HIV-1 replication by &gt;80% when each siRNA duplex
was transfected at 5 nM (Y. Naito, K. Ui-Tei, K. Saigo and Y. Takebe, unpublished data).
