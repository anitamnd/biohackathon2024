      <p>With advances in
machine learning (ML) techniques, the quantitative
structure–activity relationship (QSAR) approach is becoming
popular for evaluating chemicals. However, the QSAR approach requires
that the chemical structure of the target compound is known and that
it should be convertible to molecular descriptors. These requirements
lead to limitations in predicting the properties and toxicities of
chemicals distributed in the environment as in the PubChem database;
the structural information on only 14% of compounds is available.
This study proposes a new ML-based QSAR approach that can predict
the properties and toxicities of compounds using analytical descriptors
of mass spectrum and retention index obtained via gas chromatography–mass
spectrometry without requiring exact structural information. The model
was developed based on the XGBoost ML method. The root-mean-square
errors (<italic>RMSE</italic>s) for log <italic>K</italic><sub><italic>o-w</italic></sub>, log (molecular weight), melting point,
boiling point, log (vapor pressure), log (water solubility), log (LD<sub>50</sub>) (rat, oral), and log (LD<sub>50</sub>) (mouse, oral) are
0.97, 0.052, 51, 23, 0.74, 1.1, 0.74, and 0.6, respectively. The model
performed well on a chemical standard mixture measurement, with similar
results to those of model validation. It also performed well on a
measurement of contaminated oil with spectral deconvolution. These
results indicate that the model is suitable for investigating unknown-structured
chemicals detected in measurements. Any online user can execute the
model through a web application named Detective-QSAR (<uri xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="http://www.mixture-platform.net/Detective_QSAR_Med_Open/">http://www.mixture-platform.net/Detective_QSAR_Med_Open/</uri>). The analytical descriptor-based approach is expected to create
new opportunities for the evaluation of unknown chemicals around us.</p>

  <p id="sec1">Chemicals greatly aid our daily
lives; however, we are not acutely aware of which ones surround us.
Chemical Abstracts Service has more than 250 million chemical species
registered in its database.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref></sup> The publicly
accessible database, PubChem, provides information on over 111 million
unique compounds.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref></sup> Of these data, over
16 million chemical structures, which correspond to approximately
14% of the PubChem compounds, are provided with a link to the PATENTSCOPE
patent database. Furthermore, approximately 32,000 compounds are linked
to physical and physicochemical properties, and 11,000 are linked
to toxicological information, including acute toxicity; these values
account for only 0.3% and 0.1% of all PubChem compounds, respectively.
The situation is similar or more dismal for other famous large databases
such as ChemSpider and ChEMBL.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref></sup> The proportion is considerably
smaller for the GDB-17 database, which contains 166.4 billion <italic>in silico</italic> chemical structures of up to 17 atoms of C, N,
O, S, and halogens.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref></sup> This situation indicates
that we can access information on the properties, hazards, and risks
only for a small fraction of the chemicals.</p>
  <p>The quantitative
structure–activity relationship (QSAR)
approach is popular for evaluating chemicals.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref></sup> QSAR is based on the similarity-property principle (SPP), wherein
the chemical structure is strongly related to chemical activity, which
includes pharmacological activity and toxicity to organisms. Thus,
information on molecular features, such as chemical functional groups
as substructures, properties that represent the structure, mathematical
descriptors known as fingerprints,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref></sup> and
other chemical descriptors from calculators including DRAGON (alvaDesc),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref></sup> RDKit,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref></sup> and OpenBabel,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref></sup> is used as explanatory variables for predicting
the properties or biological effects, including the toxicity of the
target compound. When the focus is on properties, this is referred
to as the quantitative structure–property relationship (QSPR).</p>
  <p>Recent advances in ML techniques allow QSAR to handle an expanded
number of descriptors calculated from the chemical structure, resulting
in a wider application range and enhanced predictive performance.
The ML-based QSAR called istkNN, which employs <italic>k</italic>-nearest
neighbors (<italic>k</italic>NN), demonstrated excellent performance
with a mathematical descriptor of a structural key that represents
a chemical structure with a binary code. This approach resulted in
a root-mean-square error (<italic>RMSE</italic>) of 0.55 and an <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> of 0.63 for the external data of the logarithm
of the median lethal dose (LD<sub>50</sub>) on a rat administered
orally (mmol/kg).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref></sup> In another case, aiQSAR employed
multiple methods, including an ML-based one that used a number of
chemical descriptors calculated by DRAGON based on the target chemical
structure. This approach resulted in an <italic>RMSE</italic> of 0.54
and an <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> of 0.65 for the external data
of the log LD<sub>50</sub> (rat, oral).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref></sup> These methods
outperform traditional QSAR; for example, a univariant model that
used <italic>in vitro</italic> cytotoxicity as a surrogate for log
LD<sub>50</sub> (rat, oral) achieved an <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> of 0.40 even for the training data set.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref></sup></p>
  <p>QSAR approaches, which include ML-based methods, require the
structure
of the target compound to be available and convertible to any type
of molecular descriptor. However, PubChem only provides structural
information on 14% of its compounds, and the structures of the rest
are undefined; thus, QSAR may face limitations in predicting the properties
and toxicities of chemicals in the environment. For example, a study
that explored environmental pollutants in 50 river water samples using
a nontarget analytical technique of two-dimensional gas chromatography
(GC × GC) interfaced with high-resolution time-of-flight mass
spectrometry (MS) found 87,000 raw chromatographic peaks corresponding
to single or multiple chemicals. However, only 0.2% of the total peaks
were identified by a spectral database search with high reliability.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref></sup> Similarly, averages of 9550 and 9610 chromatographic
peaks were found in the effluents of wastewater treatment plants using
the positive and negative ion modes of liquid chromatography interfaced
with high-resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS), respectively. Only
1.7% and 0.6% of the peaks were identified and assigned based on measurement
data of chemical standards in the positive and negative ion modes,
respectively.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref></sup> Determination of the chemical
structures for a vast number of peaks in measurements remains a challenge.</p>
  <p>As indicated above, structure identification remains challenging
for most chemicals in our surroundings detected with instrumental
measurements, even using state-of-the-art instruments. Thus, approaches
for predicting the properties and toxicities of unknown-structured
chemicals detected in actual samples are required for hazard and risk
assessment. However, QSAR requires the chemical structure as a first
step, and there is currently a lack of ability to meet this requirement.</p>
  <p>If measurement data such as those from MS are directly used for
the prediction without the process of structure identification, it
may be possible to expand the range of chemicals involved in hazard
and risk assessments, even if exact information regarding the structure
is not available. The mass spectrum obtained with electron impact
ionization (EI), which is used for gas chromatography (GC) interfaced
with MS, comprises instrumental signals of the fragment ions of a
compound. Several studies have aimed to predict the GC–EI–MS
mass spectrum from the chemical structure using deep neural networks
(DNNs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref></sup> and vice versa.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref></sup> The results of these studies suggest that the EI spectrum
is strongly correlated with the chemical structure.</p>
  <p>Several
homologues of certain compounds show the same mass spectral
pattern in GC–MS (e.g., alkyl phthalates), even though their
structures are different. In such cases, information on retention
time differences in the GC is useful for distinguishing these homologues.
Thus, the GC–MS output may contain sufficient information to
infer chemical structures. This indicates that the instrumental output,
i.e., analytical descriptor, has considerable potential to predict
the properties and toxicities of chemicals.</p>
  <p>The idea of an analytical
descriptor has been partially introduced
in some QSAR research fields. For example, QSAR-like approaches in
genomics have used biological properties of gene expression profiles
obtained by high-throughput screening as gene-based descriptors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref></sup> Experimentally determined properties, such as elemental composition,
zeta potential, size distribution, and shape, are used to reveal quantitative
nanostructure–activity relationships, referred to as nano-QSAR.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref></sup> The characterization of material surfaces that interact with biological
film formation was investigated using cell imaging techniques, such
as time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) and a
QSAR-like approach.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>−<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref></sup> These studies have shown that high-content data obtained
via ToF-SIMS have strong potential to elucidate the surface functions
of materials against biofilm formation through self-organizing maps
and partial least-squares regression.</p>
  <p>However, the above-described
studies with the idea of analytical
descriptor were performed to reinforce the prediction performance
of traditional QSAR models by combining them with other types of chemical
descriptors. Such chemical descriptors eventually require the chemical
structure to identify new or potentially useful chemical descriptors
for predicting the target properties/toxicities or to investigate
undefined phenomena by exploring meaningful correlations between analytical
data and biological activity. QSAR methods that do not require an
exact chemical structure and are fully based on analytical descriptors
are currently scarce. However, they have strong potential for empowering
research in various domains of chemistry, including chemical risk
and safety.</p>
  <p>This study proposes a new QSAR approach that predicts
the properties
and toxicities of compounds based solely on the analytical descriptors
obtained by GC–MS using a combination of ML techniques. The
predictive performance of the developed approach was evaluated, and
metrics to capture the applicability domain (AD) of the method were
implemented in a free web application called Detective-QSAR. This
approach will be useful for evaluating various unknown-structured
chemicals that exist in our surroundings and to prioritize them for
detailed assessment.</p>

    <title>Methods</title>
    <p>An overview of the study
is illustrated in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref></xref>. This study predicted physicochemical properties
and toxicities of compounds directly from the mass spectrum and retention
index (RI) of GC–MS, equipped with EI unless specified otherwise.
It does not require information on the exact chemical structure of
interest. This requirement is mandatory for traditional and ML-based
QSAR approaches that use chemical descriptors or mathematical descriptors,
such as MACCS keys, PubChem fingerprints, and CDK-standard fingerprints
obtained from chemical structures.</p>

      <title>Data Set and Preparation</title>
      <p>A data
set of chemicals containing
GC–MS mass spectra and RIs as analytical descriptors, properties,
and toxicities as objective variables was prepared for modeling. The
mass spectra and RIs were obtained from NIST17,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref></sup> MassBank,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref></sup> Fiehn laboratory,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref></sup> RIKEN,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref></sup> and in-house data.
The RIs used in this study were obtained with semistandard nonpolar
GC columns, such as DB-5, under ramped temperature conditions; if
unavailable, RIs with standard nonpolar GC columns, such as DB-1,
were used. There were only a few minor percentage differences between
the RI values, unlike the differences in the polar GC columns. The
property lists of log <italic>K</italic><sub><italic>o-w</italic></sub>, boiling point, melting point, vapor pressure, and water solubility
were obtained from ChemID<italic>plus</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">32</xref></sup> and Comptox<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34">34</xref></sup> for over 110,000 candidate compounds
that were GC amenable. The LD<sub>50</sub> (rat, oral) and LD<sub>50</sub> (mouse, oral) values were obtained from ChemID<italic>plus</italic>. The molecular weights of the chemicals were obtained using OPERA.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref35">35</xref></sup> The data set of chemicals with GC–MS
spectra and RI contained the molecular weight (g/mol), melting point
(°C), boiling point (°C), log <italic>K</italic><sub><italic>o-w</italic></sub> (unitless), vapor pressure (Pa), water
solubility (mmol/L), LD<sub>50</sub> (rat, oral) (mmol/kg), and LD<sub>50</sub> (mouse, oral) (mmol/kg) of 12810, 3836, 3385, 2674, 1299,
1383, 2080, and 1630 compounds, respectively (summarized in <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.analchem.2c01667/suppl_file/ac2c01667_si_001.pdf">Table S-1</ext-link>).</p>
      <p>The data on each objective
list were split randomly into training, validation, and test data
with a ratio of 0.8:0.1:0.1. The <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> range of the mass spectrum in the data set was 1–6420. The
entire range of the mass spectrum was used for the modeling. Each <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> value was normalized such that the
highest intensity was 1 so that data from different sources could
be combined. The vector resulting from concatenation of the RI value
and corresponding <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> values of
the mass spectrum was used as input to the proposed model. The vector
is converted to the format used for sparse model during the model
execution.</p>
      <p>In addition to the data set of the predictive and
objective variables
for modeling, molecular features of the chemicals in the data set
were prepared to represent the chemical space of the chemicals used
for modeling and to investigate the model performance. The well-known
molecular features of Abraham parameters (E, S, A, B, L, and V) used
for linear free energy relationship (LFER) or linear solvation energy
relationship (LSER) in pharmacology and environmental chemistry were
calculated by Absolv in the ACD/Laboratories software with the simplified
molecular input line entry system (SMILES) as input.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref36">36</xref>−<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref38">38</xref></sup> The number of mass spectral bins, which represents the number of
centroided bars of the mass spectrum for each compound, was set based
on the original mass spectral data. The number of elemental species
constituting each molecule was obtained by converting its molecular
formula.</p>

      <p>Several regression and

regression methods that use regularization terms to avoid overfitting.
RF is an ensemble-learning method based on decision trees.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref45">45</xref></sup> A DNN comprises an unbounded number of layers that are unbounded
in width with nonpolynomial activation functions, which permits practical
application and optimized implementation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref49">49</xref></sup> Further, a DNN requires model construction and parameter finetuning
to achieve better predictive performance. The model construction and
parameter finetuning are described in the <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.analchem.2c01667/suppl_file/ac2c01667_si_001.pdf">Supporting Information (Section S-1)</ext-link>.</p>
      <p>XGBoost was developed by Chen
and Guestrin.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref46">46</xref></sup> Both RF and XGBoost are
ensemble-learning methods that use a decision tree as the base learner.
RF adapts bagging as the ensemble technique to improve predictive
performance and control overfitting by averaging several decision
trees generated in parallel on several subsamples of the data set.
Alternatively, XGBoost adapts the boosting ensemble technique to improve
the model based on a sequential learning process involving iterative
calculation to update and adjust the parameters based on outliers
in the previous model. It is based on the same idea as that employed
for gradient boosting; the second-order method originates from Friedman
et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref50">50</xref></sup> In addition to the second-order
method, XGBoost has been improved for regularized objectives.</p>
      <p>In brief, XGBoost—a tree ensemble model—uses K additive
functions to predict the output<disp-formula id="eq1"><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="ac2c01667_m001" position="anchor"/><label>1</label></disp-formula>where <inline-formula id="d33e463"><inline-graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="ac2c01667_m002.gif"/></inline-formula> indicates
all possible trees, and the function <italic>f</italic><sub><italic>k</italic></sub> at each step <italic>k</italic> maps the <italic>i</italic>-th sample of descriptor <italic>x</italic> to a certain
output <inline-formula id="d33e482"><inline-graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="ac2c01667_m003.gif"/></inline-formula>.</p>
      <p>The following regularized objective is minimized to learn
the set
of functions used in the model<disp-formula id="eq2"><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="ac2c01667_m004" position="anchor"/><label>2</label></disp-formula>where <italic>l</italic> represents
a differentiable convex loss function, and the second term Ω
penalizes the complexity of the model, which helps smooth the final
learned weights to avoid overfitting.</p>
      <p>A second-order approximation
is used to optimize the objective
using the following equation at the <italic>t</italic>-th iteration<disp-formula id="eq3"><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="ac2c01667_m005" position="anchor"/><label>3</label></disp-formula>where <inline-formula id="d33e507"><inline-graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="ac2c01667_m006.gif"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula id="d33e510"><inline-graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="ac2c01667_m007.gif"/></inline-formula> represent the first- and second-order gradient
statistics of the loss function, respectively. Two additional techniques,
shrinkage and column subsampling, were introduced in XGBoost to further
prevent overfitting. The shrinkage scales the newly added weights
by a factor η after each boosting step; this reduces the influence
of each tree and leaves space for future trees to improve the model.
Column (feature) subsampling considers only a random subset of descriptors
when building a given tree; this technique also accelerates the computation.
In addition, XGBoost uses a sparsity-aware split-finding approach
to efficiently train the model on sparse data, such as the mass spectral
data used in this study. This method requires parameter finetuning
to achieve higher predictive performance. The gbtree function was
selected as the booster, and a regression model with a squared loss
was applied as the learning objective. For parameter tuning, to avoid
model overfitting, the parameters eta (learning rate) = 0.02, alpha
(L1 regularization) = 1, lambda (L2 regularization) = 1, and minimum
child weight = 1 were determined via a parameter grid search. The
depth of the tree was chosen as 7 based on grid search optimization.</p>

      <p>The ranges of all collected measurement
data on all possible important molecular features of over 48,000 compounds
out of the 110,000 candidates were compared with those of the data
used for the modeling to check the chemical space of the data handled
by the model. The total numbers of data on the properties and toxicities
were 6341, 4635, 4416, 1467, 3535, 3559, and 2990 out of the 48,000

of the model was evaluated using the actual measurement of a chemical
standard mixture and sample of contaminated car engine oil running

an input CSV file that includes the analytical descriptors of <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> values and RI of a target compound.

      <title>Calculation
of Applicability Domain</title>
      <p>The applicability
domain (AD) of a model in QSAR is measured by an indicator to determine
whether a chemical of interest is covered by the model.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref52">52</xref>−<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref54">54</xref></sup> The similarity level between a target vector and model training
data was applied as an indicator to determine whether the target is
within the AD. The cosine distance between the vectors of input and
training spectra combined with RI was used as the similarity index
(<italic>SI</italic>)<disp-formula id="eq7"><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="ac2c01667_m011" position="anchor"/><label>7</label></disp-formula>where <italic>u</italic> represents
an <italic>o-dimensional</italic> vector of RI and normalized <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> intensity for the target compound,
and <italic>v</italic> represents a compound in the training data
set.</p>
      <p>The mean of <italic>SIs</italic> between the input and <italic>m</italic> most similar spectra in the training data was calculated
as <italic>SI.t</italic>, which helped evaluate whether the model
was suitable
for predicting an objective list of interest in the input spectrum<disp-formula id="eq8"><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="ac2c01667_m012" position="anchor"/><label>8</label></disp-formula>where <italic>m</italic> represents the number
of candidates and was set to 5.</p>
      <p>A higher <italic>SI.t</italic> indicates that compounds expressed
by input descriptors are included in the training data (the input
is included in the AD of model). The <italic>RMSE</italic> for the
validation data that exceed the specified <italic>SI</italic> threshold
value (<italic>RMSE</italic> only for data within the AD) can be calculated
using Detective-QSAR. Users can achieve a higher prediction accuracy
for a target input that presents a higher <italic>SI.t</italic> (e.g.,
&gt;0.7) by referring to the “<italic>RMSE</italic> with the <italic>SI</italic> threshold” calculated and provided by Detective-QSAR.

      <title>Chemical
Space of Data for Modeling</title>
      <p>Clarity regarding
the chemical space of the data (i.e., model coverage) is important
for modeling the properties and toxicities of various chemicals.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref55">55</xref></sup> The data used in this study were curated from
reliable sources considering duplication and outliers following the
curation approach described in a previous study.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref56">56</xref></sup> The range of the molecular features of the training data
alongside that of all available data on log <italic>K</italic><sub><italic>o-w</italic></sub> to capture the chemical space for
the model is illustrated in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>. The training data covered a wide range of molecular
features, which were consistent with all available data over 48,000
GC amenable compounds in terms of the Abraham parameters (E, S, B,
L, and V). The training data for parameter A were slightly skewed
toward nonzero data. This means that there could have been slightly
less low-acidity molecules regarding hydrogen bonds in the training
data than in all data. The number of data on molecular weight in the
training data set was slightly lower for compounds with low molecular
weights. This indicates that the model developed with the training
data performed well for compounds with low molecular weights but not
for compounds with high molecular weights. Training data on the number
of mass spectral bins that were possibly correlated with the molecular
weight were concentrated around the lower side. Although the number
of all available data was still not sufficient for the objective list
of log <italic>K</italic><sub><italic>o-w</italic></sub> in
the data-driven approach, the training data were chosen uniformly
from all available data according to the data distributions. Distributions
of other objective lists are shown in <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.analchem.2c01667/suppl_file/ac2c01667_si_001.pdf">Figures S-2–S-8</ext-link>. Overall, severely biased data were not used
for the modeling, and the wide ranges of chemical spaces within the
GC amenable chemicals were covered by the training data.</p>

on DNN, ridge regression, Enet, lasso, RF, and XGBoost. The distributions
of absolute differences between the predicted and measured values
on the test data set are shown as violin plots with their <italic>RMSE</italic>s. The RF and XGBoost-based models showed high accuracy
for prediction by analytical descriptors of <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> values with RI as the input. The other methods fluctuated
in performance between the test and validation data sets, as shown
in <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.analchem.2c01667/suppl_file/ac2c01667_si_001.pdf">Figure S-10</ext-link>. RF and XGBoost are ensemble-learning
models for bagging and boosting, respectively, based on the decision
tree model. Each spectral bin (or RI) variable is evaluated in the
tree model, and its coefficient weight is assigned to the respective
node of the tree. These models were superior to linear regression
models with certain regularization(s), such as lasso, ridge regression,
and Enet. The relatively poor quality by the DNN was not expected
because generally DNN has high potential for superior prediction by
iteratively calculating the coefficient weights of spectral bins through
a fully connected multilayer at each depth. Other attempts at DNN
optimization, including the application of various types of activation
functions, regularization terms, and convolutional neural network
approaches, did not provide high performance. DNNs are not always
superior to other methods in predictive performance, as shown in previous
studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref57">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref58">58</xref></sup> DNNs are susceptive of hyperparameters,
architecture, and optimizers. It is difficult to achieve competitive
performance with other methods in certain cases. Meanwhile, one study
demonstrated comparative performance between DNN and XGBoost in terms
of predictive accuracy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref59">59</xref></sup> Therefore, the
application of a more suitable algorithm to connect each layer and/or
the usage of more training data may enhance the neural network’s
performance. In this study, XGBoost, which showed the highest prediction
accuracy, was applied and further evaluated.</p>

    <sec id="sec3.3">
      <title>Performance of the Developed
Model</title>
      <p>The performance
of the XGBoost-based model was evaluated using the test data for the
objective lists, as shown in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref></xref>. The predictive performance was very close to that
with the validation data, as shown in <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.analchem.2c01667/suppl_file/ac2c01667_si_001.pdf">Figure S-11</ext-link>. Therefore, it is considered that the models were not biased by
the validation process and were optimized based solely on the training
data. The boiling and melting points were modeled using an antilog
scale because the data range was not wider and normally distributed.
These predictive accuracies were high considering <italic>RMSE</italic>s of 24 and 51. The other objective lists were modeled on a log scale
because of the log-normal distribution of the data that span wide
ranges. The partitioning property of <italic>K</italic><sub><italic>o-w</italic></sub> is known to be the log-transformed value
of log <italic>K</italic><sub><italic>o-w</italic></sub>; therefore,
the value of log <italic>K</italic><sub><italic>o-w</italic></sub> was considered without reconversion in this study. Good relationships
in terms of <italic>y</italic> = <italic>x</italic> between the predicted
and measured values were obtained for log (molecular weight), log
(vapor pressure), and log <italic>K</italic><sub><italic>o-w</italic></sub>, followed by log (water solubility).</p>

      <p>The developed model predicted the objective lists
with a similar
level of accuracy to other QSAR models that require molecular descriptors
as inputs. Using the model T.E.S.T., which applies the consensus method
of several methods including hierarchical clustering with a genetic
algorithm-based technique, multilinear regressions, and nearest neighbor
method with 797 molecular descriptors as input variables, the <italic>RMSE</italic>s of the melting point, boiling point, log (vapor pressure),
log (water solubility), and log (LD<sub>50</sub>) (rat, oral) were
43.7, 20.5, 0.82, 0.87, and 0.60, respectively.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref60">60</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref61">61</xref></sup> The <italic>RMSE</italic>s of the melting point, boiling point,
log <italic>K</italic><sub><italic>o-w</italic></sub>, log
(vapor pressure), and log (water solubility) obtained using the OPERA
model, which applies the <italic>k</italic>NN algorithm with 9–16
molecular descriptors as input variables, were 52.2, 22.1, 0.78, 1.00,
and 0.86, respectively.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref35">35</xref></sup> There were differences
in the coverage of the chemical space for each of the proposed model,
which handles GC amenable chemicals, and these two above models, which
handle wider ranges of compounds. Although such a difference exists,
the predictive accuracies are comparable, except for log (water solubility),
which was slightly inferior for the proposed model. The advantage
of the proposed model is that it does not require an exact chemical
structure to obtain molecular descriptors but instead requires measurement
data. Detective-QSAR (Ver. Pred) is available (<uri xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="http://www.mixture-platform.net/Detective_QSAR_Pred_Open/">http://www.mixture-platform.net/Detective_QSAR_Pred_Open/</uri>) to emulate the predictions of T.E.S.T. and OPERA with the Detective-QSAR
system.</p>
      <p>Although the <italic>RMSE</italic>s of log (LD<sub>50</sub>) for
rats and mice in the proposed model were as low as 0.70 and 0.73,
respectively, the slopes of the linear regressions of the plots predicted
against measured values were not adequate (0.37 and 0.32, respectively).
Although the training data were chosen to be as comprehensive as possible,
the ranges of values for log (LD<sub>50</sub>) were 4–5 orders
of magnitude. These ranges were narrower than those of other objective
lists, such as log <italic>K</italic><sub><italic>o-w</italic></sub>, log (vapor pressure), and log (water solubility), whose ranges
were 10–15 orders of magnitude. Therefore, although the values
of log (LD<sub>50</sub>) were predictable with an <italic>RMSE</italic> of approximately 0.7 when using this model to assess the toxicity
of unknown compounds spread in AD, further refinement to capture the
relationship between structural information and toxic mechanisms is
necessary. Applicability domain judged by <italic>SI.t</italic> of
the model is discussed in <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.analchem.2c01667/suppl_file/ac2c01667_si_001.pdf">Section S-2</ext-link>.</p>

    <sec id="sec3.4">
      <title>Descriptor Importance in Model Prediction</title>
      <p>The relative
importance of variables for prediction results was calculated as the
score of descriptor importance (or feature importance).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref62">62</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref63">63</xref></sup> The variable was provided with a relative value among the descriptors
and showed a strong influence on the prediction results when the score
of a certain variable was high, irrespective of the direction of influence.
The results of the descriptor importance of the model inputs for all
objective lists are shown in <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.analchem.2c01667/suppl_file/ac2c01667_si_001.pdf">Figure S-16</ext-link>. The importance values were calculated for all descriptors (<italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> values with RI) so that the importance
value of the highest <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> value became
1, making the importance result visible as a mass spectrum. Clear
trends were not captured from the patterns of <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> importance because several <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> values simultaneously affected the results in positive
and negative directions.</p>
      <p>Contrary to the trend of <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> values, differences in RI importance among objective
lists were clearly observed. The boiling points followed by vapor
pressure showed high scores of 460 and 300, respectively. The boiling
point and vapor pressure showed a direct relationship with the GC
retention times (i.e., RI). The RI importance values of the molecular
weight and melting point were 36 and 19, respectively. Other objective
lists showed a relatively low influence from RI; however, they were
higher than all the <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> values.</p>
      <p>Similarly, the effect of RI on the model was observed from the
model performance results. The performance of the model that excluded
RI from explanatory variables deteriorated with <italic>RMSE</italic>s of 0.060, 63, 45, 1.1, 1.5, 0.72, and 0.80 for molecular weight,
melting point, boiling point, log <italic>K</italic><sub><italic>o-w</italic></sub>, vapor pressure, LD<sub>50</sub> (rat, oral), and LD<sub>50</sub> (mouse, oral), respectively. Owing to the requirement of RI data
in addition to <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> values, 74, 40,
27, 39, 11, 28, 42, and 46% of data entries were removed from the
training data set of the RI-excluding model, respectively. Only the
RI-excluding model for water solubility did not deteriorate (<italic>RMSE</italic> decreased from 1.5 to 1.2). The RI-including model
for water solubility was affected by the decrease in training samples
(28%) because of the RI data requirement, which outweighed the benefit
of RI information to the model performance. In addition, RI, which
represents the extent of partitioning between the GC column phase
and gas phase for the chemical of interest, was not simply correlated
with water solubility, in contrast to vapor pressure. Comparison with
the proposed RI-including model with a model based only on RI is described
in the following section.</p>

      <title>Practical Application of Detective-QSAR and
Implications</title>
      <p>The method developed through Detective-QSAR
was applied to actual
measurements. Prior to the application, it was a concern that raw
measured data contain very little noise throughout the <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> range; the noise severely affected the prediction
results for all the objective lists. The threshold cut of the intensity
for the target input improved the noise issue, as indicated in <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.analchem.2c01667/suppl_file/ac2c01667_si_001.pdf">Table S-2</ext-link>. A threshold cut of 0.5% intensity
for the normalized mass spectrum had a positive effect on all the
lists except for melting point and LD<sub>50</sub>. The negative effects
on the melting point and LD<sub>50</sub> were negligible. The varying
effects of models are considered to be the results of a combination
of noise conditions in the input and model descriptor importance which
is different among the models. The noise conditions vary case-wise,
and it may affect predictions of melting point and LD<sub>50</sub> in some cases. Therefore, the process of the threshold cut with
0.5% intensity on the input was implemented for all the objectives
in Detective-QSAR, as described in the <xref rid="sec2" ref-type="other">Methods section</xref>.</p>
      <p>Detective-QSAR was applied to 31 structure-identified chromatographic
peaks in the chemical standard mixture and 14 peaks detected in the
contaminated oil sample. <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.analchem.2c01667/suppl_file/ac2c01667_si_001.pdf">Figure S-17</ext-link> shows
the results of all the objective lists on these peaks. Several properties

Although deteriorated performance on log (LD<sub>50</sub>) (rat, oral) was observed for nitrobenzenes, the results did not
show clear trends on other objective lists (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.analchem.2c01667/suppl_file/ac2c01667_si_001.pdf">Table S-5</ext-link>). As shown in <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.analchem.2c01667/suppl_file/ac2c01667_si_001.pdf">Figure S-17</ext-link>, it
also performed well on the peaks in contaminated oil after spectral
deconvolution.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref64">64</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref66">66</xref></sup> The deconvolution improved spectral
similarity with the reference spectrum (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.analchem.2c01667/suppl_file/ac2c01667_si_001.pdf">Figure S-18</ext-link>), resulting in improved predictive performance compared
with the cases on the raw spectrum (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.analchem.2c01667/suppl_file/ac2c01667_si_001.pdf">Figure S-19</ext-link>). Without the deconvolution procedure, the model underperformed
on peaks in contaminated oil compared with the results of model validation,
especially for log <italic>K</italic><sub><italic>o-w</italic></sub>, boiling point, and log (water solubility). This was because
these chromatographic peaks without deconvolution were influenced
by signals of coeluted compounds and/or sample matrices. In addition
to the instrumental noise discussed above, interference by coelution
should be considered in the model application on the measurement of
a raw spectrum. To obtain the spectrum stem from a sole compound convoluted
in the coeluted peak, spectral deconvolution techniques are helpful.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref64">64</xref>−<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref67">67</xref></sup> Once spectral deconvolution was performed for the detected peaks
in the contaminated oil, the prediction results were improved (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.analchem.2c01667/suppl_file/ac2c01667_si_001.pdf">Figure S-19</ext-link>), and eventually, the results were
comparative with those of the model validation. Performance of Detective-QSAR
was comparable to that of a GC × GC property estimation model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref68">68</xref></sup> that uses only RI on the estimation of log <italic>K</italic><sub><italic>o-w</italic></sub> or superior to that on log (water
solubility) as shown in <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.analchem.2c01667/suppl_file/ac2c01667_si_001.pdf">Figure S-20</ext-link>. The
applicability domain of the GC × GC model is currently limited
to nonpolar compounds, but Detective-QSAR is not limited to them.</p>
      <p>Further validation for various actual cases with different types
of compounds is warranted for detailed model characterization and
enhancing the model performance, and the results demonstrated the
possibility of applying the method based on analytical descriptors
for predictions. The approach will be useful for the hazard and risk
assessment of unknowns found in measurements. In most cases of measurements
of complex mixtures, such as environmental, food, beverage, waste
material, biological, and manufactured product samples, GC–MS
peaks of chemicals overlap with each other. As shown in this study,
the developed method is applicable even to actual measured peaks comprising
multiple chemicals with the help of spectral deconvolution techniques.
To enhance the number of compounds in the mixture sample to be evaluated
using the analytical descriptor-based method, further functionality
in the deconvolution technique, such as judgment/estimation of spectral
purity for unknowns in coeluted peak, is expected. The model has considerable
potential for predicting properties and toxicities of unknown-structured
compounds found in measurements as long as the target signal is not
taken from mixtures (pure component) and is judged by <italic>SI.t</italic> to be within the model AD. The predicted values of all objective
lists with <italic>SI.t</italic> can be calculated for approximately
10 min for 1000 spectra in the web application.</p>
      <p>The objective
lists considered throughout the study are only a
fraction of what is required for the detailed assessment of chemicals.
A further expansion of the lists, such as bioaccumulation factor,
degradation rate, mutagenicity, ecotoxicity, cytotoxicity, and others,
is expected in the future. In addition, the analytical descriptor-based
approach has the potential to expand to other analytical methodologies
that provide structure-specific signals, including GC interfaced with
multistage mass spectrometry (MS<sup><italic>n</italic></sup>), LC-MS<sup><italic>n</italic></sup>, and LC interfaced with a diode array detector.</p>

    <title>Conclusions</title>
    <p>This study proposed a new QSAR approach that
predicts the properties
and toxicities of compounds based solely on the analytical descriptors
obtained by GC–MS using a combination of ML techniques. The
model based on XGBoost was developed to predict log <italic>K</italic><sub><italic>o-w</italic></sub>, log (molecular weight), melting
point, boiling point, log (vapor pressure), log (water solubility),
log (LD<sub>50</sub>) (rat, oral), and log (LD<sub>50</sub>) (mouse,
oral). It performed well on a chemical standard mixture and contaminated
oil with spectral deconvolution. This approach compensates for the
limitation of traditional QSAR, i.e., the requirement of a chemical
structure. Further, it will be useful to prioritize chemicals without
structural information for detailed environmental hazard and risk
assessment, safety checks of food and beverages, product and waste
management, medical investigation, and further exploration in new
fields. The analytical descriptor-based QSAR approach developed in
this study will provide insights for evaluating unknown chemicals
around us.</p>
