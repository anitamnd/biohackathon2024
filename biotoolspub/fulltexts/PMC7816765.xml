      <p>Comprehensive profiling of lipid
species in a biological sample,
or lipidomics, is a valuable approach to elucidating disease pathogenesis
and identifying biomarkers. Currently, a typical lipidomics experiment
may track hundreds to thousands of individual lipid species. However,
drawing biological conclusions requires multiple steps of data processing
to enrich significantly altered features and confident identification
of these features. Existing solutions for these data analysis challenges
(i.e., multivariate statistics and lipid identification) involve performing
various steps using different software applications, which imposes
a practical limitation and potentially a negative impact on reproducibility.
Hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography-ion mobility-mass spectrometry
(HILIC-IM-MS) has shown advantages in separating lipids through orthogonal
dimensions. However, there are still gaps in the coverage of lipid
classes in the literature. To enable reproducible and efficient analysis
of HILIC-IM-MS lipidomics data, we developed an open-source Python
package, LiPydomics, which enables performing statistical and multivariate
analyses (“stats” module), generating informative plots
(“plotting” module), identifying lipid species at different
confidence levels (“identification” module), and carrying
out all functions using a user-friendly text-based interface (“interactive”
module). To support lipid identification, we assembled a comprehensive
experimental database of <italic>m/z</italic> and CCS of 45 lipid
classes with 23 classes containing HILIC retention times. Prediction
models for CCS and HILIC retention time for 22 and 23 lipid classes,
respectively, were trained using the large experimental data set,
which enabled the generation of a large predicted lipid database with
145,388 entries. Finally, we demonstrated the utility of the Python
package using <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> strains that are resistant to various antimicrobials.</p>

    <title>Introduction</title>
    <p>Lipids are a class
of biomolecules with broad biological importance,
from being structural components of the cell membrane and microdomains
to serving as signaling molecules, and dysregulation of lipid metabolism
is a common feature of many disease states.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref></sup> Lipidomics,
the comprehensive analysis of lipids within a biological system, continues
to gain popularity as it offers insight into metabolic phenotype and
underlying mechanisms of these disease states.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>−<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref></sup></p>
    <p>Lipid
species can be broken into classes and subclasses on the
basis of their headgroup chemistry, in addition to the composition
of their fatty acyl tails (chain length, number, arrangement, and
stereochemistry of double bonds).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>−<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref></sup> Identification of lipid
species may be performed at a variety of levels of structural detail,
ranging from basic lipid class (Level 1) to complete molecular species
(lipid class, subclass, and fatty acid isomeric composition, Level
5),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref></sup> according to the Lipidomics Standard Initiative (LSI).
In lipidomics experiments, it is desirable to identify lipid species
at the highest level possible in order to gain the most complete understanding
of the biological processes being studied. The use of liquid chromatography
coupled to ion mobility-mass spectrometry (LC-IM-MS) for lipidomics
experiments has been demonstrated to provide a good balance between
analytical throughput, resolution, and confidence in lipid identifications.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>−<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref></sup> Hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC)
is particularly advantageous as it provides resolution on the basis
of lipid headgroups in the retention time dimension, while the orthogonal
IM and MS separations allow for further delineation of overlapping
subclass and fatty acid sum composition.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>−<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref></sup> Therefore,
this method generally allows Level 3 lipid identifications (lipid
class/subclass and fatty acid sum composition).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref></sup></p>
    <p>Lipid identifications by IM-MS rely on reference CCS values to
compare against, and although there are several large collections
of experimental lipid CCS values in the literature,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>−<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref></sup> these collections do not yet comprehensively cover the vast lipid
chemical space (both in terms of class and composition). CCS prediction
using machine learning (ML) is one solution that has gained traction
in recent years,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>−<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref></sup> and variants of this general technique have been used by multiple
groups to generate predicted CCS databases for lipids.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>−<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref></sup> Zhou et al. were the first to construct regression models for predicting
lipid CCS from a large set of molecular descriptors (45 and 66 for
positive and negative modes, respectively) using support vector regression.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref></sup> Blaženović et al. trained several classification models
(primarily K-nearest neighbor algorithm) using combinations of <italic>m/z</italic>, retention time, and CCS for the prediction of lipid
class and carbon number,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref></sup> but their approach
did not result in a predicted database covering theoretical lipids.
We recently reported a clustering-to-prediction approach for a comprehensive
prediction of CCS of diverse chemical structures, including lipids
and other types of molecules, but a comprehensive predicted lipid
CCS database is still needed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref></sup> More recently,
a large predicted CCS database was constructed using a regression
model (XGBoost algorithm) that predicts lipid CCS from 328 molecular
descriptors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref></sup> However, although the previous
approaches perform well in lipid identification or classification,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>−<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref></sup> previous databases mostly cover
mammalian lipid species, have limited coverage of bacterial lipids,
and have no built-in statistical functions, which are needed for a
complete lipidomics workflow.</p>
    <p>A typical lipidomics experiment
may track hundreds to thousands
of individual lipid species (features) across a large number of biological
samples. The dimensionality of these data sets (many features, fewer
samples) can make the interpretation of results difficult since macroscopic
differences between samples often correspond to nuanced patterns of
change across many features. To address this challenge, multivariate
statistical analyses are often applied to lipidomics data in order
to draw out the features that are most important or explanatory with
regard to the specific biological question being probed. Commonly
employed analyses range from simple statistical tests like per-feature
ANOVA or Pearson correlation analysis to multivariate dimensionality
reduction analyses like principal components analysis (PCA) and partial
least-squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA). At a high level, the
use of such analyses allows large lipidomic data sets to be pared
down to the set of lipid features that are altered by the specific
biological conditions. Owing to the complexity of the entire process
and the fact that they are often implemented in different pieces of
software, thus requiring moving the data between different programs
and converting them between different formats, these analyses can
be laborious to perform and difficult to apply consistently across
multiple data sets.</p>
    <p>To address the primary challenges faced
in the analysis of lipidomics
data (lipid identification and data complexity), we have prepared
a Python package, LiPydomics, which contains a suite of tools for
performing data analysis and lipid identification on HILIC-IM-MS lipidomics
data in an efficient and reproducible fashion. To support lipid identification,
we assembled a comprehensive experimental CCS database from the literature,
trained ML models for the prediction of CCS and HILIC retention times
using simple but specialized feature sets, and built a predicted lipid
database with a broad coverage of lipid classes.</p>

      <title>Reference
Lipids Database Assembly</title>
      <p>A comprehensive
collection of lipid CCS values was assembled from individual CCS collections
available in the literature<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>−<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref></sup> into a single database of reference lipids for use in lipid identification.
Briefly, the source data sets were manually examined for errors and
the relevant data (i.e., lipid name, MS adduct, <italic>m/z</italic>, and CCS) from each was converted into the JSON format, yielding
clean and consistently formatted data with separate files for each
data set. The SQLite3 relational database was initialized with a table
to hold the reference CCS values. A series of build scripts developed
in-house was used to assemble the combined database from individual
cleaned data files in a reproducible fashion. During database assembly,
the lipid names were parsed for relevant information (i.e., lipid
class, sum composition of fatty acids [number of carbons and unsaturation
degrees], and presence of ether lipids), and this information along
with metadata reflecting measurement conditions was associated with
each entry. CCS values measured on drift tube (DT), traveling wave
(TW), and trapped ion mobility spectrometry (TIMS) instruments were
included, and those measured on TW were calibrated using lipid standards.
For the individual data sets that were measured using the same HILIC-IM-MS
protocol as reported previously (referred to hereafter as the established
HILIC method),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>−<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref></sup> the retention time was also stored with each lipid
measurement. Additional tables containing predicted <italic>m/z</italic>, CCS, and retention times were also added to the database and populated
as described below.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec2.2">
      <title>Generation of Exact Lipid <italic>m/z</italic> Values</title>
      <p>Theoretical <italic>m/z</italic> values were systematically
produced
for lipid classes using a subpackage within LiPydomics (<italic>lipydomics/identification/LipidMass</italic>). Monoisotopic masses were computed from the lipid classes and subclasses,
fatty acid compositions (ranging from 10 to 30 carbons, including
both even and odd numbers, and 0–6 unsaturations per fatty
acid), and MS adducts using a method similar to that used in LipidPioneer.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref></sup> Separate functions were used for each lipid
class, and lipid classes are further grouped into sphingolipids (Cer,
GlcCer, SM), glycerolipids (DG, TG), glycolipids (MGDG, DGDG, GlcADG),
glycerophospholipids (AcylPG, AcylPE, AlanylPG, CL, LysylPG, PA, PC,
PE, PG, PI, PIP, PIP2, PIP3, PS), lysoglycerophospholipids (LPA, LPC,
LPE, LPG, LPI, LPS, LCL), and free fatty acids (FA). Lipid abbreviations
follow the standards established by LIPID MAPS (see <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.analchem.0c02560/suppl_file/ac0c02560_si_001.pdf">Table S1</ext-link> in the Supporting Information for lipid class abbreviations).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref></sup> Exact <italic>m/z</italic> values were computed for lipids using
a number of commonly observed ESI adducts in positive ([M]<sup>+</sup>, [M + H]<sup>+</sup>, [M + Na]<sup>+</sup>, [M + K]<sup>+</sup>,
[M + NH<sub>4</sub>]<sup>+</sup>, [M + H-H<sub>2</sub>O]<sup>+</sup>, [M + 2Na-H]<sup>+</sup>, [M + 2 K]<sup>2+</sup>) and negative ([M-H]<sup>−</sup>, [M + HCOO]<sup>−</sup>, [M + CH<sub>3</sub>COO]<sup>−</sup>, [M + Cl]<sup>−</sup>, [M-2H]<sup>2–</sup>) modes.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec2.3">
      <title>Prediction of CCS Using Machine Learning</title>
      <p>Predicted
CCS values for lipids were produced using a predictive model trained
on the reference lipid database. For all reference lipids, lipid classes,
fatty acid modifiers (e.g., “p” indicating a plasmenyl
lipid), and MS adducts were each encoded into one-hot binary vectors
(22, 3, and 11 features, respectively; see the <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.analchem.0c02560/suppl_file/ac0c02560_si_001.pdf">Supporting Information</ext-link> for specific encodings). Only the lipid
classes, fatty acid modifiers, and MS adducts with sufficient representation
(at least 20 measurements) in the database were explicitly encoded.
The final feature vector was prepared by appending fatty acid sum
composition (number of carbons and unsaturations) and observed <italic>m/z</italic> to the binary encoded vectors for each lipid (a total
of 39 features; <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.analchem.0c02560/suppl_file/ac0c02560_si_001.pdf">Tables S2–S4</ext-link>). A
subset of the reference lipid database (6394 measurements; <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.analchem.0c02560/suppl_file/ac0c02560_si_001.pdf">Table S2</ext-link>) consisting of only the explicitly encoded
lipid classes, fatty acid modifiers, and MS adducts was selected for
use in CCS prediction. This subset was randomly split into training
and test data sets in proportions of 80 and 20%, respectively, and
the test data set was set aside until model training was complete.
The training data were scaled such that all features had a variance
of 1 to avoid arbitrary overweighting of individual features based
on their scale. A support vector machine with radial basis function
kernel (svr) was selected for CCS prediction based on preliminary
testing, and hyperparameters were optimized using a grid search with
fivefold cross-validation on the training data. Using the optimized
hyperparameters, the model was trained on the full set of training
data, and performance metrics [mean absolute error (MAE), median absolute
error (MDAE), median relative error (MDRE), and root mean squared
error (RMSE)] were computed on the training data. Finally, the same
performance metrics were computed with the trained model on the test
set data to validate model performance on unseen data.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec2.4">
      <title>Prediction
of HILIC Retention Time Using Machine Learning</title>
      <p>Predicted
HILIC retention times were produced using a predictive
model trained on all entries in the reference lipid database that
contain HILIC retention times measured using the HILIC method mentioned
above (596 lipids in total; <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.analchem.0c02560/suppl_file/ac0c02560_si_001.pdf">Table S5</ext-link>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>−<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref></sup> A smaller feature set (26 features) was used for retention time
prediction compared with CCS prediction: binary encoded lipid class
(22 features), fatty acid modifier (2 features), and sum composition
(2 features). The smaller number of lipid classes and fatty acid modifiers
present in the feature set are reflective of the fact that this subset
represents less than 10% of the complete reference lipids database
(596 of 7907 lipids, see <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.analchem.0c02560/suppl_file/ac0c02560_si_001.pdf">Table S5</ext-link> for specific
encodings). In addition, <italic>m/z</italic> and encoded MS adduct
were not included since these do not relate directly to chromatographic
retention time. This subset was split into training and test data
sets as described above for CCS prediction. A multivariate linear
regression model was used for retention time prediction. The model
was fit, and performance metrics (MAE, MDAE, and RMSE) were computed
using the training data. Finally, performance metrics were computed
with the trained model on the test set data to validate model performance
on unseen data.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec2.5">
      <title>Calibration of HILIC Retention Time</title>
      <p>HILIC retention
times present in the reference lipid database were measured using
an established HILIC method mentioned above,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>−<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref></sup> and the ML
model for predicting retention times was trained on these retention
times. In order to be able to compare retention times acquired using
other HILIC conditions, a retention time calibration utility was developed
and included in the library. This utility uses linear interpolation
of known standards to calibrate retention times of a given HILIC gradient
to the retention times in the database. Multiple calibration points
can be used in order to approximate nonlinear relationships between
reference and measured HILIC retention times. This approach offers
excellent calibration accuracy and flexibility, without the complications
of choosing a fitting function when the relationship is nonlinear.
Once a retention time calibration has been set, the calibrated retention
time is automatically used for compound identification. To evaluate
this calibration strategy, we first examined three different gradients
on the same Phenomenex Kinetex HILIC column (100 × 2.1 mm, 1.7
μm) with Solvent A being acetonitrile/water (50/50) with 5 mM
ammonium acetate and Solvent B being acetonitrile/water (95/5) with
5 mM ammonium acetate: (1) 0–1 min, 100% B; 1–4 min,
100–90% B; 4–7 min, 90–70% B; 7–8 min,
70% B; 8–9 min, 70–100% B, 9–12 min, 100% B;
(2) 0–0.8 min, 100% B; 0.8–1.8 min, 100–90% B;
1.8–2.8 min, 90–70% B; 2.8–3.8 min, 70% B; 3.8–4.8
min, 70–100% B, 4.8–8 min, 100% B; (3) 0–2 min,
100% B; 2–8 min, 100–90% B; 8–14 min, 90–70%
B; 14–15 min, 70% B; 15–16 min, 70–100% B, 16–19
min, 100% B. We then examined three different columns from the Phenomenex
Kinetex HILIC series (100 × 2.1, 50 × 2.1, or 30 ×
2.1 mm; 1.7 μm). The gradients for different columns were changed

      <title>Development of an All-in-One
Python Package for Comprehensive
Lipidomics: LiPydomics</title>
      <p>To enable efficient and reproducible
analysis of HILIC-IM-MS data, we developed a free and open-source
(MIT license) Python package, LiPydomics. The library contains several
modules, each responsible for handling different aspects of lipidomics
data analysis (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref></xref>). The <italic>data</italic> module is responsible for the organization
and storage of the lipidomics data set itself, along with relevant
metadata and any statistics calculated on the data set using the <italic>stats</italic> module. It also contains utilities for saving/loading
a data set to file, exporting to a spreadsheet, and normalizing intensities.
The <italic>stats</italic> module contains functions for applying
statistical and multivariate analyses [ANOVA <italic>p</italic>-value,
Pearson correlation, PCA, PLS-DA, partial least-squares regression
analysis, two-group Log2(fold-change)] on the data set, and the <italic>plotting</italic> module contains functions for extracting data and
generating standard plots, such as bar graph and heatmap, for the
visualization of the data set and statistical analyses. The <italic>identification</italic> module is used for calibrating HILIC retention
times and identifying lipid features at various confidence levels
using <italic>m/z</italic>, HILIC retention times, and CCS, and contains
utilities for accessing and retraining the CCS and HILIC retention
time predictive models as discussed below. The <italic>identification</italic> module additionally contains a subpackage, <italic>LipidMass</italic>, which allows for easy generation of exact masses for a large selection
of lipid classes. The <italic>interactive</italic> module contains
a user-friendly text-based interface for performing lipidomics data
analysis (see the Supporting Information, <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.analchem.0c02560/suppl_file/ac0c02560_si_001.pdf">Figure S1</ext-link>). This entire package, including the interface, can be easily
installed on any computer with a compatible Python interpreter (version
3.5 or greater). The assembly of the experimental database, development
of CCS and retention time prediction models, the assembly of the predicted
database, and demonstration of various modules are discussed in the
following sections. A more in-depth overview of the library structure
and function is available in the package documentation on GitHub (<uri xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://github.com/dylanhross/lipydomics">https://github.com/dylanhross/lipydomics</uri>).</p>

      <title>Assembly of an Experimental Reference Lipid Database</title>
      <p>A database
of experimental reference lipid CCS values was assembled
from data sets available in the literature.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>−<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref></sup> In total, 7907 experimental CCS values were included in the database,
representing 45 lipid classes (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.analchem.0c02560/suppl_file/ac0c02560_si_001.pdf">Table S6</ext-link>) and covering major lipid species present in both mammalian and
bacterial systems. The database covers a variety of MS adducts with
5110 positive mode measurements and 2797 negative mode measurements.
CCS measurements made on DTIM, TWIM, and TIMS instruments were included
in the database (1285, 596, and 6026 values, respectively). Excellent
agreement has already been demonstrated between measurements made
on DT and TW platforms when lipid calibrants are used to calibrate
CCS values in TW measurements.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref></sup> However,
a systematic comparison of TIMS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref></sup> CCS values against
the established DT method has not yet been performed. To this end,
we assessed the agreement between CCS values of overlapping lipids
present in TW and TIMS data sets relative to DT values (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>). Both positive and negative
mode TW CCS values (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>A,B) show excellent agreement with DT values as evidenced
by median relative errors (MDRE) much less than 1% and high degrees
of correlation in CCS-CCS plots. Positive mode TIMS CCS values also
showed excellent agreement with DT values (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>C); however, negative mode TIMS values (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.analchem.0c02560/suppl_file/ac0c02560_si_001.pdf">Figure S2A</ext-link>) displayed an MDRE of ∼1% with
two apparent populations in the histogram. Negative mode TIMS CCS
values from the two constituent data sets<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref></sup> were examined separately (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.analchem.0c02560/suppl_file/ac0c02560_si_001.pdf">Figure S2B,C</ext-link>), and it was found that both data sets displayed MDREs &gt;1%, but
in opposite directions. The CCS-CCS plots indicated distinct linear
relationships between these TIMS CCS values and DT values for the
two data sets. Therefore, in order to utilize both data sets for building
the CCS prediction model, we applied a linear correction to each data
set toward DT values using equations shown in <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.analchem.0c02560/suppl_file/ac0c02560_si_001.pdf">Figure S2</ext-link> prior to ML model training. After this correction,
the MDRE for negative mode TIMS CCS values is −0.36% (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>D). Overall, this
database represents comprehensive coverage of currently available
experimental lipid CCS values, with a broad representation of lipid
classes and IM-MS platforms. A particular strength of this comprehensive
lipid database is the extended coverage of bacterial lipids, such
as LysylPGs, AlanylPGs, AcylPGs, AcylPEs, GlcADG, and doubly charged
lipids, such as CLs and LCLs, which were not covered in previous large-scale
lipidomics data sets that contain mostly mammalian lipids.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref></sup></p>

      <title>Performance of CCS Prediction Using Machine Learning</title>
      <p>An
ML model was trained on data from the experimental lipid database
to predict CCS values using only a minimal feature set consisting
of encoded lipid class, fatty acid composition, encoded MS adduct,
and <italic>m/z</italic>. These features do not require computation,
which make them easy to assemble for a wide range of lipids and avoids
reproducibility issues regarding structural assignment and descriptor
generation. It has also been demonstrated that lipids display distinct
trends in CCS with respect to <italic>m/z</italic>, lipid class, MS
adduct, and acyl chain composition (visit <uri xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="http://CCSbase.net">CCSbase.net</uri> for interactive visualization of such trends),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref></sup> supporting their inclusion in our minimal feature set. Lipid classes
of the same MS adducts with at least 20 measurements, resulting in
6394 CCS values in 22 lipid classes, were included for building the
prediction model. This selected subset of measurements was split in
an 80/20 proportion for training and test data sets, respectively.
The predictive model was trained using support vector regression with
a radial basis function kernel as described in the <xref rid="sec2" ref-type="other">Experimental Section</xref>. This model was able to predict CCS values
for lipids with high accuracy, achieving MAE, MDAE, and RMSE scores
of 1.05, 0.55, and 1.79 Å<sup>2</sup>, respectively, on the training
data set and 1.34, 0.78, and 3.03 Å<sup>2</sup>, respectively,
on the test data set. Our model slightly outperformed a recently reported
lipid-specific CCS prediction model trained on TIMS CCS values,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref></sup> which achieved RMSE scores of 1.4 and 2.8 Å<sup>2</sup> on their training and test set data, respectively. With MDRE
scores of 0.20 and 0.27% on the training and testing data, respectively,
our model also modestly outperforms the established Lipid CCS predictor,
which achieved MDRE scores of 0.50 and 0.42%, respectively, on positive
and negative mode intralab external validation sets (i.e., data not
seen during model training).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref></sup> Relative
standard deviation (RSD) was computed for 1667 lipid species having
multiple reported CCS measurements in the combined CCS database (CCS
was corrected as described above for negative mode data from Vasilopoulou
et al. and Tsugawa et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref></sup>), and the mean and
median RSD for this group were 0.60 and 0.50%, respectively. Thus,
the performance of our predictive model (specifically by MDRE) also
compares favorably with variance in experimentally measured CCS values. <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref></xref> shows CCS versus <italic>m/z</italic> plots for MS adducts of several major lipid classes
in both positive and negative modes along with corresponding relative
errors of predicted CCS values relative to available measured values,
where predicted values were produced using the ML model and measured
values are taken from the experimental lipid CCS database. The predicted
CCS and theoretical <italic>m/z</italic> values for all lipids span
a comprehensive range of fatty acyl chain lengths and unsaturation
degrees, with clear structural trends visible in this space as a function
of both characteristics. The predicted CCS values for these lipid
classes generally show excellent agreement with the measured values,
with residual CCS of predicted values falling mostly within 1% of
measured values for most lipid species. We note that although there
are some outliers in the measured values (possibly attributable to
misidentified lipids), the contribution of these outliers to the training
of the overall prediction model appears to be minimum as the majority
of the consistent data outweigh the small number of outliers during
model training. Plots for additional abundant lipid classes are available
in the Supporting Information, <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.analchem.0c02560/suppl_file/ac0c02560_si_001.pdf">Figure S3</ext-link>. These results demonstrate that high-quality lipid CCS predictions
can be obtained using a relatively small but specialized feature set,
which includes lipid-specific information, such as lipid class, sum
fatty acid composition, and fatty acid modifiers (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.analchem.0c02560/suppl_file/ac0c02560_si_001.pdf">Tables S2–S4</ext-link>), with sufficient training data. Using
these specialized features also allows easy expansion of the prediction
model as experimental data for additional lipid classes becomes available
since these features are easy to generate without computational effort.</p>

interpolation between calibrants. To demonstrate this utility, retention

    <sec id="sec3.6">
      <title>Automated Identification of Lipid Species
at Different Confidence
Levels</title>
      <p>Identification of lipid species is performed by matching <italic>m/z</italic>, retention time, and CCS against values from the reference
lipid database. Lipid identifications can be made at several levels
of confidence based on the number of components used for the identification
and whether these were compared against experimental or predicted
values. The available identification levels in this package are (in
descending order of confidence): measured <italic>m/z</italic>, retention
time, and CCS; predicted <italic>m/z</italic>, retention time, CCS;
measured <italic>m/z</italic> and retention time; predicted <italic>m/z</italic> and retention time; measured <italic>m/z</italic> and
CCS; predicted <italic>m/z</italic> and CCS; measured <italic>m/z</italic>; and predicted <italic>m/z</italic>. The user may specify one of
these confidence levels when undertaking lipid identification or use
a tiered approach, where the highest confidence level is tried first
for each lipid species and successive levels are attempted until an
identification is made. If retention time calibration has been set
up, the calibrated retention time is automatically used for lipid
identification. Whenever lipid identifications are made, both the
putative identification(s) and the level of confidence are stored
for each lipid feature. When multiple annotations are made for a single
feature, the putative identifications are ranked by a score reflecting
the agreement between query and reference values, computed as the
dot product of residuals from the matched values normalized by their
respective search tolerances. All lipid identifications made by this
method are of LSI Level 3,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref></sup> i.e., lipid
class, subclass, and fatty acid sum composition. Overall, this utility
allows users to identify lipids in an efficient, automated fashion.
In addition, the predicted lipid database was added to our existing
web interface (<uri xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://CCSbase.net">https://CCSbase.net</uri>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref></sup> so that users can query these data

      <title>Demonstration of LiPydomics
Functionality</title>
      <p>In order
to demonstrate the functionality of LiPydomics, we reanalyzed data
from our recently published study examining lipidomic changes associated
with antibiotic resistance in methicillin-resistant <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (MRSA) strains.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref></sup> Aligned and peak-picked HILIC-IM-MS data acquired
in negative ESI mode were used for this analysis. The data contained
normalized intensities for 3647 features from four different MRSA
strains (JE2 parent strain, “Par”; JE2-derived strain
with reduced susceptibility to daptomycin, “Dap2”; reduced
susceptibility to dalbavancin, “Dal2”; and reduced susceptibility
to vancomycin, “Van4”), each with four biological replicates.
Lipids were identified by matching on predicted <italic>m/z</italic>, retention time, and CCS (using search tolerances of 0.02 Da, 0.2
min, and 3.0%, respectively), or measured <italic>m/z</italic> and
CCS to cover lipid classes without retention time information. Using
the <italic>stats</italic> module, we computed a three-component PCA
to see how the groups separated according to their overall variance. <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref></xref>A shows the PCA projections
for each sample along the first two principal components, colored
by strain. These components capture around 90% of the total variance
in the data set, and samples from each group cluster together and
separate from other groups in this space, indicating that there are
distinct characteristics that are associated with each strain. We
next looked specifically at the comparison between the lipid profiles
of the daptomycin-resistant Dap2 and the parent strains that have
been examined previously. First, we performed PLS-DA and Pearson correlation
between Dap2 and Par. The PLS-DA projections (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref></xref>B) showed excellent separation between the
strains, and similar levels of intragroup variance. The S-plot (PLS-DA
x-loadings vs. Pearson correlation) highlights multiple features that
are highly abundant in either strain and different between strains
(<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref></xref>C). Examination
of these discriminating features reveals systematic changes in the
DGDG, LysylPG, and FA lipid classes between these strains. To explore
these effects at a higher level, we computed the Log2(fold-change)
between Dap2 and Par and produced heat maps of all annotated lipids
from each of these classes using the <italic>plotting</italic> module

From these heat maps, we observed a general decrease in DGDGs, an
increase in LysylPGs, and an increase in FAs between 15 and 21 carbons
in length in Dap2 strains relative to Par. It should be noted that
these heat maps include lipid features annotated as unsaturated lipids;
however, these are unlikely to be found in the bacterial system studied.
Indeed, a close examination of those features suggests that most have
low signal intensities likely corresponding to background signals.
We also produced bar plots using the <italic>plotting</italic> module,
showing the mean intensities with standard deviation in Dap2 and Par
strains for the most significantly altered lipids in each of the previously
discussed lipid classes (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref></xref>G–I). Overall, this analysis using LiPydomics
reproduced the key findings of the previous report<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref></sup> and was performed with only 19 lines of Python code on
minimally processed data.</p>

      <p>Separately, we used both
positive and negative ESI mode data from
the same study to perform lipid identification using the predicted
lipid database at varying levels of confidence. <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref></xref>J shows the number of lipids identified at
each level of confidence for both ESI modes. The number of lipids
identified decreases steadily as we progress from matching solely
based on <italic>m/z</italic> (lowest confidence) to matching based
on <italic>m/z</italic>, retention time, and CCS (highest confidence),
using search tolerances of 0.02 Da, 0.2 min, and 3.0%, respectively,
across all tests. This example demonstrates the flexibility of the
lipid identification utility in LiPydomics, which allows a user to
prioritize annotation coverage or confidence as it suits the biological
problem being studied.</p>

    <title>Conclusions</title>
    <p>The key strengths of
LiPydomics as a resource for lipidomics data
analysis lie in its large coverage of lipid classes (both experimental
and predicted), versatility (from statistical analysis to identification),
reproducibility, extensibility, and ease of use. In addition, data
analyses can be partially or fully automated through scripting, further
enhancing the reproducibility and efficiency of such analyses. The
unique reference lipid database contains measured and predicted <italic>m/z</italic>, retention time, and CCS values, with broad coverage
of common and rare lipid species from both mammalian and bacterial
systems, the latter being underrepresented in other lipid databases
to date. The predicted <italic>m/z</italic>, retention times, and
CCS values display good agreement with measured values and cover a
comprehensive range of lipid classes and fatty acid compositions,
enabling identification of more lipids than would be possible using
measured values alone. Thus, this comprehensive lipid database enables
the identification of lipid species at the level of class, subclass,
and sum fatty acid composition (LSI Level 3) from diverse biological
systems. The package (including the lipid database and prediction
models) is also built to be highly extensible and customizable, allowing
easy expansion as more data becomes available and optimization for
specific analysis workflows via its flexible and well-documented API.
The text-based user interface makes the library more broadly accessible
to those who are not familiar with Python programming. Together, these
attributes make LiPydomics a unique and comprehensive tool for performing
analysis of HILIC-IM-MS lipidomic data.</p>
