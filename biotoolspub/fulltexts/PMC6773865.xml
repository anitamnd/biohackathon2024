      <p id="Par1">During clathrin mediated endocytosis (CME), the concerted action of dynamin and its interacting partners drives membrane scission. Essential interactions occur between the proline/arginine-rich domain of dynamin (dynPRD) and the Src-homology domain 3 (SH3) of various proteins including amphiphysins. Here we show that multiple SH3 domains must bind simultaneously to dynPRD through three adjacent motifs for dynamin’s efficient recruitment and function. First, we show that mutant dynamins modified in a single motif, including the central amphiphysin SH3 (amphSH3) binding motif, partially rescue CME in dynamin triple knock-out cells. However, mutating two motifs largely prevents that ability. Furthermore, we designed divalent dynPRD-derived peptides. These ligands bind multimers of amphSH3 with &gt;100-fold higher affinity than monovalent ones in vitro. Accordingly, dialyzing living cells with these divalent peptides through a patch-clamp pipette blocks CME much more effectively than with monovalent ones. We conclude that dynamin drives vesicle scission via multivalent interactions in cells.</p>

    <title>Introduction</title>
    <p id="Par3">Clathrin mediated endocytosis (CME) is fundamental to all eukaryotic cells. It is implicated in nutrient uptake, cell motility, cell signalling and neurotransmission<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. The formation of clathrin coated vesicles (CCVs) from the plasma membrane involves more than 50 proteins, each recruited in specific steps. Multi-colour fluorescent live cell imaging of reference proteins, including clathrin, a constitutive cargo such as the transferrin receptor (TfR), as well as other associated proteins, has unveiled a stereotyped sequence of protein recruitments leading to CCV formation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. This choreography is orchestrated by a dense network of protein-protein and protein-lipid interactions, which, taken individually, are rather weak. This initially surprising property has been proposed to ensure the directionality and irreversibility of the process<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Therefore, understanding how this intricate network is organized and regulated in space and time is a major challenge of the field.</p>
    <p id="Par4">The large GTPase dynamin is essential for vesicle scission<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup> and is primarily recruited at the last steps of vesicle formation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Many aspects of the function of this indispensable protein have been deciphered<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup> but how its recruitment is regulated in cells is still a matter of debate. In this regard, the C-terminal proline/arginine rich domain of dynamin (dynPRD) is critical. It is a major interaction hub for Src-homology domain 3 (SH3) domain-containing endocytic accessory proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup> that bears several class I (RxxPxxP) and class II (PxxPxR) SH3-binding motifs (where P is proline, R is positively charged arginine and x is any amino-acid)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. These motifs interact with various specificities to many SH3 domain containing proteins involved in CME such as intersectin1-2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>, endophilinA1-3<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>, amphyphysin1-2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>, syndapin1-3<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>, SNX9 and SNX18<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Among those, amphiphysins play a central role in regulating the recruitment of dynamin at CME sites<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. The amphiphysin specific binding site on dynPRD, conserved in all three dynamin isoforms, consists of two overlapping class-II SH3-binding motifs resulting in its characteristic PxRPxR consensus sequence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. A so-called D15 peptide containing this particular motif has been extensively used to inhibit endocytosis in living neuronal cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. However, its low affinity for the SH3 domain of amphiphysin (amphSH3), 90 µM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>, makes it a poor competitor of endogenous dynamin. This suggests that the specific binding of a single SH3 to a given motif on dynPRD cannot solely account for the functional interaction of dynamin with its associated proteins and that avidity effects may be at play in vivo.</p>
    <p id="Par5">The essential role of dynamin in CME, as well as the wealth of information about its recruitment to nascent endocytic vesicles and its interactions with SH3 domain containing proteins, makes the dynPRD-SH3 interaction network a very good candidate to test the hypothesis that weak individual interactions are reinforced by avidity effects in the scission machinery in vivo. To do so, we set up two complementary experimental approaches. First, we rescue CME in dynamin triple knock-out (TKO) cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup> by re-expressing a number of dynamin mutants. We show that multiple neighbouring SH3 binding motifs in the dynPRD are necessary for CME rescue and for the timely recruitment of dynamin to nascent CCVs. Second, we develop divalent peptide-based amphSH3 ligands that are designed to mimic the native interactions and bind multimeric amphSH3 domains with high affinity. To test these peptides in living cells, we set up a protocol that combines the ppH assay, which detects the formation of endocytic vesicles with high temporal resolution<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>, with patch-clamp mediated cell dialysis. We show that at a given concentration, these peptides block CME in living cells within minutes more efficiently than the commonly used monovalent D15 peptide. These results demonstrate the importance of multimeric interactions and reveal avidity effects in regulating the scission machinery.</p>

      <title>Multiple SH3 binding sites support dynamin function in cells</title>
      <p id="Par6">We tested which feature of the PRD domain of dynamin is necessary for its optimal function in CME. We based our approach on rescuing CME in dynamin TKO mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cells by re-expressing wild-type or mutant dynamin2 tagged with GFP (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). Indeed, unlike the neuronally enriched dynamins 1 and 3, the ubiquitously expressed dynamin 2 was reported to fully rescue CME in dynamin1,2 KO cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. First, we confirmed the knock-out of endogenous dynamins and re-expression of dyn2-GFP to comparable levels by Western blot (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>, Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1A</xref>). We also validated the ability of dyn2-GFP to rescue CME by monitoring the uptake of Alexa568 labelled transferrin (A568-Tfn). Wild-type dyn2-GFP fully rescued the uptake of A568-Tfn (103.7 ± 7.5% of control, <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.99), normally abolished in TKO cells (22.8 ± 1.6%, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001, Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c, e</xref>). We additionally verified that dyn2-GFP expression levels did not influence A568-Tfn internalisation (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1B</xref>) such that we could pool the data obtained with a given construct and use as a single dataset. Then, we tested dyn2-GFP mutated in the C-terminal portion of the PRD according to our hypothesis. We had noted that this domain contains three class II SH3 binding motifs. We labelled them A, B and C such that motif B is part of the known D15 peptide while motifs A and C flank motif B as illustrated in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref>. Of note, all dynamin mutants tested thereafter were expressed in TKO cells at similar levels (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1C</xref>). As expected<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>, neither re-expression of dyn2-GFP lacking the whole PRD domain (dyn2-GFP-ΔPRD) nor the D15-containing C-terminal domain (dyn2-GFP-ΔCter) could rescue endocytosis in those cells (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1e</xref>). But interestingly, the same phenotype was obtained with the much milder mutant dyn2-GFP-ABC<sub>mut</sub> in which only the 6 arginine residues present in motifs A, B and C were mutated to alanine (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1e</xref>). On the other hand, mutating motif B alone (dyn2-GFP-B<sub>mut</sub>) resulted in a partial rescue of endocytosis (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1e</xref>). This suggests that the flanking binding motifs A and/or C play a role in the rescue process, potentially by stabilizing the PRD-SH3 interaction. To test this hypothesis further we mutated these motifs individually. Mutating flanking motif A alone (dyn2-GFP-A<sub>mut</sub>) permitted a full rescue of CME. Mutating flanking motif C alone (dyn2-GFP-C<sub>mut</sub>) allowed a partial rescue, to a similar extent as when only the core motif B was mutated. These results thus reveal that motif B is not the sole determinant of dynamin function in CME. Consistent with these results on Tfn uptake, mutant dyn2-GFP localisation in cells was very diverse, from punctate for the endocytically active mutants (dyn2-GFP and dyn2-GFP-A<sub>mut</sub>) to homogenous for the inactive mutants (dyn2-GFP-ΔPRD/ΔCter/ABC<sub>mut</sub>) and intermediate for the partial mutants (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1f</xref>). Hence our working model: binding of amphiphysin to the PRD requires the core B motif as well as another motif for stabilisation. Motif C is the prime target when available. However, when this site is not available, motif B appears to be stabilized enough to impart a partial rescue. The prime candidate for this partial stabilisation is the flanking motif A, which when mutated alone appeared to play no role. We confirmed this hypothesis by mutating motifs A and C simultaneously (dyn2-GFP-AC<sub>mut</sub>). Under these conditions, the rescue of endocytosis was very poor (albeit significantly above the inactive mutants dyn2-GFP-ΔPRD, ΔCter and ABC<sub>mut</sub>). Again, this confirms that the B (D15) motif alone is not sufficient to ensure the full functional recruitment of dynamin.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Rescue of endocytosis in dynamin TKO cells with PRD mutant dynamins. <bold>a</bold> Protocol for dynamin knock-out and rescue.

      <title>Recruitment kinetics of dynamin PRD mutants</title>
      <p id="Par7">To understand at which stage of CME dynamin function was affected by PRD mutations, we analysed their recruitment using TIRF imaging in living cells. We compared the recruitment kinetics of dyn2-GFP mutants in TKO cells with that of genome-edited SKMEL cells expressing dyn2-GFP in the endogenous gene locus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. For this analysis, we chose four different dyn2-GFP constructs that showed various degrees of CME rescue: WT, ΔCter, B<sub>mut</sub> and AC<sub>mut</sub> (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>). As observed above in fixed cells, mutated dyn2-GFP appeared as a combination of clustered and homogenous fluorescence (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>). The average cell fluorescence outside clusters was thus significantly higher in mutants compared to the WT (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>). These clusters were transient and the frequency at which these clusters could be detected correlated with the ability of the constructs to rescue CME: highest for dyn2-GFP-WT re-expression, intermediate for dyn2-GFP-B<sub>mut</sub>, low for dyn2-GFP-AC<sub>mut</sub> and essentially null for dyn2-GFP-ΔCter where fluorescence was completely homogenous (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>). Interestingly, the peak amplitude (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref>) and kinetics (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2e</xref>) of these recruitment events were similar in all conditions, including in genome-edited cells. We verified that the higher frequency of transient dynamin clusters detected in the latter (0.34 ± 0.04 ev min<sup>−1</sup> µm<sup>−2</sup>, <italic>n</italic> = 15 SKMEL vs 0.20 ± 0.02 ev min<sup>−1</sup> µm<sup>−2</sup>, <italic>n</italic> = 9, MEF; <italic>p</italic> = 0.006) was indeed due to the difference in cell types rather than an artefact of the position of the GFP tag by transfecting TKO cells with wild-type dyn2 tagged at three different positions. This did not affect the frequency, amplitude and kinetics of dynamin recruitment events (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Frequency and kinetics of dyn2 recruitment events in dynPRD mutants. <bold>a</bold> TIRF images of living SKMEL cells expressing dyn2-GFP in both endogenous loci (left) or dynamin TKO MEF cells transfected with the indicated dyn2-GFP mutants (right).

      <p id="Par8">Considering that amphiphysins are major interactors of dynamins and are essential for CME<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>, their recruitment to the plasma membrane could be affected by the dynamin mutants. We co-expressed amphiphysin2-mCherry with dyn2-GFP mutants in TKO cells. In all cases, amphiphysin2-mCherry appeared punctate and, except in the case of the homogenous ΔCter mutant, partly colocalized with dyn2-GFP (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2f</xref>). Similar to dynamin, amphiphysin2-mCherry also displayed transient clusters. Their frequency or amplitude were not affect by the co-expression of any of the dyn2-GFP mutant construct (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2g, h</xref>). Therefore, amphiphysin recruitment to CCPs does not depend on its interaction with dynPRD. Taken together, these results suggest that the PRD-SH3 interaction regulates the probability of recruiting dynamin but that once it is initiated, the process unfolds in a stereotyped manner to complete vesicle formation.</p>
      <p id="Par9">Next, we directly assessed membrane scission achieved by the dyn2 mutants using the ppH assay. This assay relies on the overexpression of TfR fused to pH sensitive superecliptic pHluorin (TfR-SEP) as an endocytosis marker to detect the formation of single CCVs in living cells with a temporal resolution of 2 s<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. We co-transfected TKO cells with TfR-SEP and dyn2-mCherry constructs. TfR-SEP was clustered at clathrin coated structures (CCSs) in cells co-transfected with dyn2-mCherry-WT or dyn2-mCherry-B<sub>mut</sub> (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>), but was homogenously distributed on the plasma membrane in cells expressing dyn2-mCherry-ΔCter or dyn2-mCherry-AC<sub>mut</sub> (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>). This is likely due to the redistribution of TfR to the plasma membrane and saturation of CCSs as already observed in TKO cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. We detected nascent CCVs with the ppH assay in cells co-transfected with dyn2-mCherry and dyn2-mCherry-B<sub>mut</sub> at frequencies of 0.025 ± 0.009 and 0.004 ± 0.002 event min<sup>−1 </sup>µm<sup>−2</sup>, respectively. This significant difference (<italic>p</italic> = 0.016) reflects the changes in Tfn uptake observed (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1e</xref>). On the other hand, we observed some moving vesicles at pH 5.5 in cells co-transfected with dyn2-mCherry-ΔCter or dyn2-mCherry-AC<sub>mut</sub> but the high intracellular background and lack of clustering on the plasma membrane precluded further characterization. We then moved on to compare endocytic events in cells transfected with the endocytically competent mutants. Dyn2-mCherry-WT was readily recruited in a burst of fluorescence that peaked at the time of CCV formation (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c–f</xref>) as observed previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. Dyn2-mCherry-B<sub>mut</sub> recruitment looked comparable but, remarkably, the peak fluorescence at the time of scission was smaller (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3e</xref>). We hypothesised this could be due to a desynchronization of dynamin recruitment relative to scission. However, the recruitment kinetics of both dynamin mutants relative to CCV formation (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3f</xref>), as well as the histograms of peak recruitment of individual events (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3g</xref>), were similar before scission, arguing against this possibility. On the other hand, the fluorescence of dynamin at the time of scission for individual events was smaller with a narrower distribution for dyn2-mCherry-B<sub>mut</sub> than for dyn2-mCherry-WT (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3h</xref>). Therefore, we conclude that destabilisation of the dynPRD-SH3 interaction reduces the amount of dynamin recruited at the time of scission. This observation goes in line with the reduced probability of mutant dynamin being recruited by amphiphysin as suggested above.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>Kinetics of dynamin recruitment to forming CCVs measure with ppH. <bold>a</bold>, <bold>b</bold> Images of a TKO cell co-transfected with TfR-SEP and dyn2-mCherry-WT (<bold>a</bold>) or dyn2-mCherry-ΔCter (<bold>b</bold>).

      <title>Binding of divalent D15-based ligands for amphSH3 dimers</title>
      <p id="Par10">To further test the model that multiple SH3 binding motifs in dynPRD are necessary for its recruitment to CCSs, we designed synthetic peptide-based ligands that preserved the key binding properties of dynamin in its capacity to interact simultaneously with multiple SH3 domains. We anticipated that such multivalent ligands should inhibit CME with higher efficiency than the classical, monovalent, D15 peptide. First, we synthesized peptides derived from dyn1-PRD (named D44 thereafter) and dyn2-PRD (D54-dyn2) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>) and compared their binding properties to recombinant amphSH3 with that of the D15 peptide by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Long peptides bound in a similar manner (K<sub>D</sub> 1.0 and 1.1 µM for D44 and D54-dyn2, respectively) but more strongly than D15 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>). Moreover, mutating motif A in D44 abolished high affinity binding (D44-R11A in Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>), consistent with the hypothesis that several class II binding motifs stabilize the interaction with several amphSH3 immobilized at a high density on the substrate. To analyse the effect of the multimerisation of SH3 domains in greater detail, we produced them with controlled valences: (i) monomeric as a fusion to the small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO-amphSH3), (ii) dimeric<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup> fused to the widely used glutathione S-transferase C terminal domain (GST-amphSH3)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup> as confirmed by size exclusion chromatography (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c</xref>), or (iii) tetrameric by reacting a biotinylated SUMO-amphSH3 with tetrameric neutravidin (Ntr, leading to a Ntr-bSUMO-amphSH3 complex). Using surface plasmon resonance (SPR), we first measured the dissociation constants of mono- and divalent dyn1-derived peptides D15 and D44 with SUMO-amphSH3. In both cases, the affinities were weak with K<sub>D</sub>s in the high micromolar range (37 µM vs. 102 µM respectively, Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4d, e</xref>) and the binding kinetics were too fast to be accurately measured. In contrast, robust binding of the dimeric GST-amphSH3 to D44 was observed, with an estimated K<sub>D</sub> of 572 nM, while there was no measureable binding to D15 below 1 µM (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4f</xref>). We attribute this dramatic gain in affinity to the fact that dimeric GST-amphSH3 can simultaneously bind to the two SH3 binding motifs present in D44, thereby stabilizing the interaction. Finally, the tetrameric Ntr-bSUMO-amphSH3 complex showed an even higher affinity for D44 (17 nM) while no binding was observed for D15 in the tested concentration range (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4g</xref>). Of note, these increases in affinity for the dimeric and tetrameric amphSH3 assemblies were accompanied by slower dissociation rate constants, a hallmark of multivalent interactions.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><p>Binding of mono- and multimeric SH3 domains to D15-based peptides. <bold>a</bold> Scheme of the peptides used in this study, based on dynamin1b (top) and dynamin2 (bottom) PRDs. <bold>b</bold> ELISA to evaluate the respective binding properties of biotinylated peptides to surface-bound SUMO-SH3 domains (K<sub>D</sub> = 1.12 and 1.01 µM for D54-dyn2 and D44 respectively, the other peptides were not fitted).

      <p id="Par11">Second, we designed synthetic ligands that mimic the presence of multiple SH3 binding motifs in dyn1-PRD. These divalent peptide variants consist of two D15 peptide motifs linked through their N or C termini by PEG linkers (dD15-N and dD15-C: Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>, Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref> and Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). They behaved in a qualitatively similar manner as D44 such that they bound dimeric GST-amphSH3 and tetrameric Ntr-bSUMO-amphSH3 much more efficiently than they did monomeric SUMO-amphSH3. dD15-N bound SUMO-amphSH3, GST-amphSH3 and Ntr-bSUMO-amphSH3 with K<sub>D</sub>s of 65 µM, 509 nM and 4.5 nM, respectively, while dD15-C bound Ntr-bSUMO-amphSH3 with 34 nM (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c–g</xref>). To further characterize the functional relevance of the increased valence of those peptides, we performed affinity isolation assays on brain lysates. In our conditions, D15 was unable to pull down any detectable amount of protein whereas dD15-N isolated a number of proteins (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4h</xref>). Mass spectroscopy analysis of the pull-down material indicated that while D15 failed to show any significant enrichment in comparison to control conditions (absence of peptide), the material the co-precipitated proteins by dD15-N was highly enriched in CME related proteins and in particular in known interactors of dynamin such as SH3kbp1 (known as CIN85 in human)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>, intersectin1-2, amphiphysin1 and amphiphysin2 (also known as BIN1), endophilinA1-2 and SNX18 (Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>). Notably, all these interactors either contain multiple SH3 domains which bind dynamin (CIN85, intersectins) or a BAR domain which enables dimer formation (endophilins, amphiphysins, SNX18)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. Our in vitro data therefore support the idea that multimerisation of SH3 domains together with the presence of multiple SH3 binding motifs in dynPRD play an essential role in increasing the affinity of their interaction by avidity effects.</p>

      <title>Divalent D15-based peptides inhibit CME in living cells</title>
      <p id="Par12">We then developed an assay to determine whether D44 (bearing motifs A and B) and divalent D15 peptides exhibited an increased inhibitory activity over the monovalent D15 on CME. To do so, we monitored cellular endocytic activity using the ppH assay with new developments for fully automated analysis on a large number of cells (See “Methods” and Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref>). We combined this assay, which monitors in real time the endocytic activity of cells, with the patch-clamp technique in order to dialyse the relevant peptide at a known concentration inside the cellular cytoplasm to inhibit endocytosis acutely. Each recording consisted of 5 min in cell-attached mode (CA) with no dialysis followed by 10 min in whole cell mode (WC) during which the inhibitors were dialysed (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a, b</xref>). Each recording therefore had its own internal control condition, i.e., the cell-attached mode, from which we obtained the frequency ratio <italic>f</italic> = <italic>F</italic><sub>WC</sub>/<italic>F</italic><sub>CA</sub>, where <italic>F</italic> is the event frequency recorded during the indicated mode. Of note, the electrical parameters of patch clamp recordings were similar in all conditions (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5</xref>). To assess the innocuousness of this assay, we monitored the endocytic activity of unperturbed cells vs. cells dialysed with a control solution (see methods for composition). Patching the cells minimally affected their endocytic activity over a 10 min period (event frequency <italic>f</italic> = 67.3 ± 4.3%, <italic>n</italic> = 60, vs. 90.7 ± 14.9% in no patching recordings, <italic>n</italic> = 8, <italic>p</italic> = 0.58).<fig id="Fig5"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption><p>Effect of D15-based peptides on CME monitored with the ppH assay. <bold>a</bold> Experimental design.

      <p id="Par13">To assess the proper dialysis of the inhibitors in this assay, we first dialysed the cells with a solution in which GTP was replaced by its non-hydrolysable form, GTPγS, which prevents the GTP-hydrolysis dependent activity of dynamin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. As expected, this rapidly abolished CCV formation (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5c, d</xref>) (<italic>f</italic> = 11.2 ± 4.1%, <italic>n</italic> = 4, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001). We then compared the effect of the D15 peptide when patched inside the cells with its effect when bath applied in its myristoylated, cell-permeable form (myrD15<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>). D15 dialysed at 1 mM with a patch pipette partially inhibited endocytosis within 10 min (<italic>f</italic> = 38.2 ± 3.9 %, <italic>n</italic> = 22, <italic>p</italic> = 0.0002, Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5b–d</xref>). Similarly, myrD15 (10 µM) incubated with cells for 20 min, partially inhibited endocytosis (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6A, B</xref>). The corresponding non-sense, inactive sequences had no effect on endocytosis (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5d</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6B</xref>). We confirmed that inhibitor concentration could be controlled in the patch-clamp assay by varying the concentration in the pipette. When used at 100 µM, D15 indeed hardly had any effect on endocytosis (<italic>f</italic> = 59.0 ± 5.0 %, <italic>n</italic> = 13, <italic>p</italic> = 0.98) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5d</xref>), which is consistent with its low affinity for its target amphiphysin. Of note, we observed that myrD15 also partially inhibited the endocytosis of the β2 adrenergic receptor (β2AR) (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6C, D</xref>), another cargo of CME<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup> but did not significantly affect the internalisation of the closely related β1 adrenergic receptor (β1AR) (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6E, F</xref>), which uses a dynamin mediated, clathrin independent pathway<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>.</p>
      <p id="Par14">We thus moved on to compare the inhibitory activities of multivalent dynPRD derived peptides on CME. The dialysis of 1 mM of D44 with a patch pipette abolished endocytosis almost completely, (<italic>f</italic> = 20.6 ± 5.2%, <italic>n</italic> = 15, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001). Even 100 µM of either D44 or D30, a trimmed down version of D44 bearing the two SH3-binding motifs (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>), partially inhibited endocytosis (<italic>f</italic> = 41.4 ± 9.6% and 41.7 ± 5.4%, <italic>p</italic> = 0.03 and 0.04, respectively). Finally, the divalent peptides dD15-N and dD15-C also had a clearly increased efficiency over D15 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5b–d</xref>), with the C terminal version being the most potent D15-derived inhibitor of endocytosis (<italic>f</italic> = 13.3 ± 3.7%, <italic>n</italic> = 6, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001). The effects of the various conditions on CME measured with the ppH assay were consistent with the changes in cell capacitance, measured with patch-clamp in whole cell mode, which reflect the balance between exocytosis and endocytosis (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5F</xref>). Overall, the increased efficiency of D44 and divalent D15 peptides in inhibiting endocytosis in living cells is reminiscent of the in vitro behaviour described above. Thus, these data support a model in which dynamin binding partners are present in a multimeric configuration in the cellular context for efficient recruitment of dynamin at endocytosis sites.</p>

However, we clearly show with TKO cell rescue experiments that isolated motifs cannot stably bind multivalent targets. We propose that adjacent SH3 binding motifs on dynPRD stabilize its binding to neighbouring multiple SH3 domains. One motif (B or C) shows specificity for amphSH3 whereas the stabilizing motif may or may not show any specificity, but the proximity of binding sites is enough to stabilize the interaction by avidity effects.</p>
    <p id="Par17">Our second set of experiments with competing peptides is entirely consistent with this model. We showed that D15 alone was a poor binder to amphSH3 in either its mono- (SUMO-amphSH3) or oligomeric (GST- or Ntr-bSUMO-amphSH3) forms, whereas both the elongated D44 peptide and the divalent D15 peptides bound with higher affinity to oligomeric amphSH3. Alternatively, D44 could bind amphSH3 with higher affinity because of additional motifs binding to other, non-canonical sites on a single SH3 domain, as shown for dynPRD binding to syndapin SH3 domain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. However, it is unlikely to be the case here because the differential effect we observe takes place only with oligomeric SH3 constructs. Our in cellulo data were also consistent with these properties. Indeed, dialysing D44 or divalent D15 peptides inside 3T3 cells fully inhibited CCV formation whereas inhibition by monovalent D15 was only partial. To our knowledge, despite the recognized importance of multivalent interactions for the endocytic process<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>, divalent peptides have never been used to interfere with endocytosis in living cells. Considering the moderate inhibitory activity of D15, the D44 and dD15 peptides described here appear to be better tools for this purpose. However, long peptides such as D44 are more difficult to obtain than shorter peptides such as D15 due to the inherent limitations of solid-phase peptide synthesis. In this context, divalent peptides present the advantage of being accessible with significantly less synthetic steps as compared to D44<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup> (see “Methods” for details). dD15-N appeared to bind slightly more strongly to tetrameric amphSH3 than dD15-C (4.5 nM vs 34 nM). However, dD15-C was more potent in inhibiting CME in living cells than dD15-N, suggesting that the precise arrangement and dynamics of SH3 domains recruiting dynamin to nascent endocytic vesicles cannot be easily reproduced in vitro. In all cases, these tools will help to decipher the role of multimeric interactions for dynamic protein assemblies in cells, an emerging field in cell biology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>.</p>
    <p id="Par18">Our results shed light on the mechanisms of dynamin recruitment to CCSs (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). Efficient recruitment of dynamin requires that multiple adjacent class II motifs on dynPRD interact simultaneously with multiple SH3 domains. Consequently, these multiple SH3 domains must be brought together, either in a single protein or through protein oligomerization. In vitro, dynPRD interacts with many SH3 domain containing proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup> which display distinct recruitment patterns relative to CCV formation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Dynamin is recruited early at low levels in the formation of CCSs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup> mainly at the edge of the clathrin lattice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. Interestingly, intersectin has five SH3 domains, of which three can bind dynamin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup> and can thus interact with multiple motifs on dynPRD regardless of its oligomerization state. Moreover, intersectin is among the earliest proteins recruited to CCSs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup> and is also located at the edge of clathrin lattices<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>, making it a prime candidate for an early interactor of dynamin. At later stages, dynamin accumulates rapidly to the neck of forming vesicles at the same time as endophilins, amphiphysins, and SNX9/18<sup>4</sup>. All these proteins contain a single SH3 domain as well as a BAR domain. BAR domains form dimers that can bind to or induce curved membranes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. Among those, amphiphysins are the most likely to be critical for dynamin function in CME because dialysis of amphSH3 has strong effects on CCV formation and transferrin uptake<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup> and knock-down of amphiphysins has the strongest effects of these proteins on CME<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Interestingly, we found that myrD15 partially blocks CME of TfR and β2AR but has no significant effect on the internalization of β1AR, which depends on dynamin and endophilin but not on clathrin and amphiphysin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>. D15-derived peptides could thus antagonize specific forms of dynamin dependent endocytosis such as CME which critically depend on the interaction between dynamin and amphiphysin. We propose that as long as dynamin and amphiphysin are found in the cytoplasm as monomers or perhaps homo-dimers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>, they cannot strongly bind to each other due to the low affinity of their interaction and because the two SH3 domains are too far apart. They would just form short-lived, transient complexes. However, when amphiphysin is recruited to the neck of vesicles thanks to its curvature sensing properties, its SH3 domains may rearrange in such a way that they would be in close proximity and made available for dynamin binding<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>. Whether amphSH3 domains are optimally placed to face dynPRD in a cellular environment remains unknown. The structure of dynamin has been solved by crystallography<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup> or cryo electron microscopy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup> in many different conformations but always without its unstructured PRD. Moreover, dynPRD binding to amphSH3 competes with an intramolecular interaction between its BAR and SH3 domains as was seen for other proteins involved in CME such as syndapin 1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup> or endophilin A1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>. Therefore, a reciprocal stabilisation of the interaction between dynamin and amphiphysin could occur through oligomerisation. The open configuration of amphiphysin would only be possible once the neck of the vesicle is tight enough for amphiphysin to form a scaffold around it. Dynamin would bind this multimeric scaffold, stabilising amphiphysin’s new conformation. This would provide a seed for further recruitment of both proteins around the vesicle neck in a positive feedback mechanism. Consistent with this model is the observation that the start of dynamin burst recruitment ~20 s before scission coincides with that of amphiphysin and endophilin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Also, affecting dynamin recruitment kinetics in turn affects endophilin recruitment kinetics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup>. The coincidence of this precise geometry and the advent of avidity conferred by multimerisation as highlighted by this study therefore provide an elegant explanation for the timely accumulation of dynamin at the moment of membrane scission.<fig id="Fig6"><label>Fig. 6</label><caption><p>Model of dynamin recruitment to forming CCVs.

      <title>Procedure for peptide synthesis</title>
      <p id="Par21">Monomeric peptides were synthesised at 0.05 mmol scale on Fmoc-NOVA PEG rink amide AM LL resin (Novabiochem) and dimeric peptides on PAL NovaSyn TG resin (Novabiochem). Amino-acids were assembled by automated SPPS on a CEM micro-waves Liberty-1 synthesiser (Saclay, France) except for C-terminally linked dimeric peptides. Coupling of PEG motifs and N-terminal derivatisations were also performed manually. For automated synthesis, Fmoc protecting groups were cleaved with 4-methylpiperidine in DMF (1:5 v/v) containing 0.1 M HOBt using a combination of short (35 W, 75 °C, 30 s) and a long cycle (35 W, 70 °C, 180 s). Couplings of Fmoc-protected amino acids (0.2 M) were carried out in the presence of HBTU (0.25 M) and DIPEA (1 M) using standard coupling cycles (20 W, 70 °C, 300 s, except for Fmoc-Arg(Pbf)-OH (0 W, RT, 1500 s followed by 20 W, 70 °C, 300 s). For the synthesis of D44, we evaluated a priori difficult couplings according to<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup>. We thus introduced a systematic double coupling on Y1, A2, L3, G5 (N-terminus amino acids) V37, P38, I40 and T41 (bulky amino acids). Other double couplings were then introduced empirically at positions P7, S11, S16, P22, P23, 33, P34, G36, D43 and P44. An acetylation step was systematically introduced after each amino-acid coupling in order to eliminate truncation products. For manual synthesis, Fmoc protecting groups were cleaved with 4-methylpiperidine in DMF (1:5 v/v, 1 × 1 min + 2 × 7 min) except for the final coupling of PEG motifs on N-terminally linked dimeric peptides for which the deprotection was performed using 4-methylpiperidine in NMP (1:5 v/v, 1 × 1 min + 4 × 5 min). Couplings of Fmoc-protected amino acid were carried out in the presence of HBTU/HOBt and DIPEA (5:5:10 eq, 1h30min). C-terminally linked dimeric peptides were obtained by generating two points of chain elongation with a Fmoc-Lys(Fmoc)-OH amino acid, whereas N-terminally linked dimeric peptides were obtained by coupling a 7:3 mixture of Fmoc-Lys(N3)-OH and pentynoic acid followed by copper(I)-catalysed azide-alkyne cycloaddition in DMF/4-methylpiperidine (8:2) with CuI (5 eq), ascorbic acid (10 eq) and aminoguanidine (10 eq). N-free peptide resins were derivatised with acetyl groups or biotin. Acetylation was performed using 7 mL of a solution of 0.15 M acetic anhydride and 0.15 M pyridine in DMF (1 h 30 min). Biotinylation was performed by first coupling Fmoc-TTDS-OH (3 eq) then biotin (3 eq). Both couplings were mediated by HBTU/ HOBt and DIPEA (3:3:6 eq, 1 h 30 min). Acetylated peptides were used in living cells and for SPR experiments. Biotinylated peptides were used for affinity isolation from rat brain lysates and SPR experiments.. Peptides were cleaved from the resin for 3 h using TFA/H<sub>2</sub>O/TIPS (95:2.5:2.5) with mild orbital shaking and precipitated with cold diethyl ether. All crude peptides were resuspended in H<sub>2</sub>O containing a few drops of DMF and purified in a Waters 1525 semi-preparative Reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) system equipped with a UV/Vis detector and a YMC C18, ODS-A/120, 250 × 20 mm. Purification was performed using a standard gradient of 5% MeCN containing 0.1% TFA for 5 min followed by an appropriate gradient of MeCN containing 0.1% TFA in H<sub>2</sub>O for 40 min (1 mL min<sup>−1</sup>). UV detection was performed at 220 and 280 nm. All peptides were obtained at more than 90% purity as judged by analytical RP-HPLC with the exception of dD15-N (84.8% purity). Masses were determined by MALDI-TOF spectroscopy in an UltraFlex III TOF-TOF (Bruker Daltonics).

      <title>Dynamin2 mutant design</title>
      <p id="Par30">Dynamin 2 (human dynamin2bb according to the nomenclature of ref. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref></sup>) plasmids were based on the dyn2-mCherry construct from Taylor et al. 2011 (Addgene 27689). We first generated dyn2-GFP by sub-cloning dyn2 into pEGFP-N1 vector with BglII/EcoRI sites. To generate GFP-dyn2, we amplified its ORF by PCR with the following primers: tcgtaacaactccgcccc (forward) ggcctcgagtcagtcgagcagggatggctc (reverse) and sub-cloned it into pEGFP-C1 with BglII/XhoI sites. We then generated dyn2-GFP and dyn2-mCherry constructs in which the GFP/mCherry tag is relocated before the PRD (residue 740) with linkers composed of six residues (GTSGSS). We first generated an unlabeled dyn2 plasmid by subcloning it from the dyn2-GFP and GFP-dyn2 plasmids with Nhe/PmlI sites. We then amplified EGFP/mCherry from their respective vectors with primers catcagcaccagcactgtgggaacctccggaggctctatggtgagcaagggcgagg (forward) and cgggggtacaggcgtggaagagcctccggaggttcccttgtacagctcgtccatggc (reverse) and the unlabeled dyn2 plasmid with primers tccacgcctgtacccccg (forward) and cacagtgctggtgctgatg (reverse), and generated the final plasmids with In-Fusion HD cloning kit (Clontech). Dyn2-GFP-ΔCter was generated by re-introducing EGFP into the dyn2-GFP plasmid with NheI/BsrGI sites, introducing a stop codon after the EGFP. The dyn2-GFP PRD mutants (ΔCter, A<sub>mut</sub>, B<sub>mut</sub>, C<sub>mut</sub> AC<sub>mut</sub> and ABC<sub>mut</sub>) were generated by inserting the artificially synthesized PRD (Eurofins) containing these mutations into the dyn2-GFP construct by In-Fusion. All constructs were verified by sequencing.</p>

      <title>Cell culture and transfection</title>
      <p id="Par31">NIH 3T3 cells (ECACC 93061524) were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 1% sodium pyruvate, 1% glutamax and 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen). Cells were incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO<sub>2</sub> until use and subcultured every 2 to 4 days for maintenance up to passage 20. Cells were transfected with 1.5 μg of TfR-SEP plasmid 24 h prior to imaging and patch clamp. Care was taken to find the right balance between sufficient fluorescent signal to allow for proper imaging and reasonable overexpression to diminish potential saturation artefacts. Best results were obtained using Fugene 6 (Promega) as the transfection reagent but Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) has also been used in this study due to a temporary arrest of Fugene 6 production by the provider. All transfections were performed according to the manufacturers’ recommendations. Four to eight hours after transfection, cells were seeded at a density of ~70,000 cells ml<sup>−1</sup> on 18 mm glass coverslips coated with poly-L-lysine (3 min application of 0.1 mM polylysine (Sigma P2636) in borate buffer, pH 8.0 followed by a quick rinse in PBS) and used the next day.</p>
      <p id="Par32">The MEF cell line obtained from tamoxifen inducible triple dynamin conditional mice (dynamin TKO cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>) was a kind gift from Pietro De Camilli (Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, CT). Cells were cultured in DMEM/F12 supplemented with 1% sodium pyruvate, 1% glutamax and 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen). Dynamin TKO was induced by the application of 3 µM Hydroxytamoxifen (OHT, Sigma) for 2 days, then 0.3 µM for 4 more days before transfection. Cells were transfected by nucleofection with the kit MEF 1 and the program MEF T20 (Lonza, Switzerland) by mixing 3 µg of DNA (dynamin construct and TfR-SEP if applicable) with 10<sup>6</sup> cells. After electroporation, cells were plated on 4–6 18 mm glass coverslips coated with fibronectin (50 nM, Sigma) and equilibrated in culture medium. Cells were used one day after for transferrin uptake assay or imaging. Complete dynamin knock-out and dyn2-GFP re-expression was verified by Western Blot (WB) with a pan dynamin antibody (Santa Cruz sc-6401, dilution 1/200). Transfection efficiency was estimated by counting the cells with DAPI staining and the transfected cells with dyn2-GFP fluorescence. It was 46 ± 9% in three separate experiments. Therefore, because the amount of expression of dyn2-GFP-WT in TKO cells estimated by WB was similar to the one in untreated (WT) cells (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>), we conclude that TKO cells transfected with dyn2-GFP-WT have about twofold overexpression of dynamin compared to WT cells. On the other hand, there was in the range of expression obtained here no correlation between the level of dyn2-GFP-WT and A568-Tfn uptake (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4B</xref>). In later control experiments (Supplementary Figs. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1C</xref> and <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>), we have used another electroporation device (Neon, ThermoFisher) which yielded a slightly smaller fraction of transfected cells (22 ± 7%, <italic>n</italic> = 8) than the Lonza device.</p>

      <title>Live cell imaging</title>
      <p id="Par35">Imaging was performed at 34–37 °C on an Olympus microscope (Olympus IX71 or IX83) equipped with an inverted Apochromat ×60 oil objective of numerical aperture 1.49 in combination with a ×1.6 magnifying lens; or with a ×100 objective of numerical aperture 1.49 (Olympus). Samples were excited in TIRF illumination (Olympus IX2RFAEVA illuminator) with a 473 nm laser source (Cobolt). Emitted fluorescence was filtered with a 525/50 m filter (Chroma Technology). Images were acquired by an electron multiplying charge coupled device camera (EMCCD QuantEM:512SC, Roper Scientific) controlled by the software MetaVue 7.8 (Molecular Devices). Two-colour imaging was performed with a co-aligned 561 nm laser (Cobolt) with the same TIRF angle as the 473 nm laser. Emitted fluorescence was filtered with a 605/52 m filter (Chroma Technology). Red and green fluorescence images were obtained 200 ms apart using a filter wheel (Lambda 10-3, Sutter Instruments). To correct for x/y distortions between the two channels, images of fluorescently labelled beads (Tetraspeck, 0.2 μm; Invitrogen) were taken before each experiment and used to align the two channels. Time lapse images were acquired at 0.5 Hz with an integration time of 100 ms.</p>

Cells were alternatively perfused with HEPES or MES buffered saline solutions (HBS/MBS) containing (in mM): 135 NaCl, 5 KCl, 0.4 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1.8 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 D-glucose and 20 HEPES or MES.

      <title>Combined patch-clamp and imaging</title>
      <p id="Par37">Cells were patched with pipettes made of borosilicate glass (GC150F, Harvard Apparatus) and pulled with a vertical Narishige puller (World Precision Instruments). The solution contained (in mM): 130–140 KCH<sub>3</sub>SO<sub>3</sub>, 1 EGTA, 0.1 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 10–20 HEPES, 4 ATP (sodium or magnesium salt), 0.4 Na-GTP (or GTPγS when indicated), 5 phosphocreatine and 3 sodium ascorbate. pH was adjusted to 7.2 using KOH and osmolarity to ~300 mOsm L<sup>−1</sup>. Sodium ascorbate was omitted in earlier recordings but was added for better stability. Chloride ions either came from 2 mM KCl, 10 mM NaCl or 4 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> (when Na-ATP was used) in various trials. All salts were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Cells were voltage-clamped at −60 mV with an EPC10 amplifier (HEKA) with series resistance and cell capacitance estimation every 4 s in the whole cell mode. The digital triggers of the amplifier were used to drive the electrovalves for pH changes. Cell viability and dialysis efficiency were made sure of by monitoring three parameters throughout the recording using the Patchmaster software (HEKA): series resistance should remain below 10 MΩ and holding current should remain above −100 pA. If either of these criteria was not respected (except holding current for recordings in GTPγS, see Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3D</xref>), the recording was not considered for analysis. On a given experimental day at least one control recording (i.e. without any peptide) was performed to ensure recording quality. All these recordings were pooled in the ‘control’ condition (<italic>n</italic> = 63 on 42 experimental days). The nature of the peptide tested was unknown from the experimenter until the end of the recordings and analysis.</p>

      <title>Image analysis and data representation</title>
      <p id="Par38">The recruitment of dyn2-GFP or amphiphysin-mCherry were analysed by segmentation and tracking (multidimensional image analysis (MIA) developed for Metamorph by JB Sibarita, Bordeaux, France) as described before<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref></sup>. Briefly, each image was segmented with a B-spline wavelet decomposition of scale 4 pixels and with a fixed threshold of eight times local standard deviation. Objects that could be tracked for more than three frames (6 s) were retained for further analysis with scripts written in Matlab 2017. The fluorescence value at each time point represents the average intensity in a 2 pixel (300 nm) radius circle around the centre of mass of the object to which the local background intensity is subtracted. This local background is estimated in an annulus (5 pixels outer radius, 2 pixels inner radius) centred on the region to be quantified as the average intensity of pixel values between the 20th and 80th percentiles (to exclude neighbouring fluorescent objects). The frame of maximum intensity is used as the reference (time 0) for aligning and averaging all traces. Before (resp. after) tracking of an object the fluorescence is measured at the location of the first (resp. last) frame with the object tracked. Two colour alignment was performed using an image of beads (TetraSpeck microspheres, ThermoFisher T7280) taken before the experiment.</p>
      <p id="Par39">The detection, tracking, and quantification of endocytic events was performed using scripts developed previously and updated in Matlab 2018a (Mathworks)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Images were sorted according to the pH (7.4 or 5.5) into two movies. These two movies were segmented using MIA with fixed optimized parameters. Objects appearing in pH 5.5 images were then considered <italic>candidate</italic> CCVs if they were visible for more than three frames (8–12 s), if their signal to noise ratio was high enough, and if a cluster pre-existed where they appeared for at least five frames (20–24 s) in pH 7.4 images (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2B</xref>). Importantly, this automated method of detection had been characterised as missing ∼30% of all events but with a low percentage of false positives (∼20%)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>, making it ideal for comparative studies over large datasets. In rescue experiments in dynamin TKO cells all events were reviewed by eye. For the experiments of peptide dialysis, to handle the large dataset without reviewing all the events by eye, we developed a Support Vector Machine (SVM) type neural network by supervised learning. We used a dataset of 26 recordings obtained in 6 experimental sessions with 9631 candidate events reviewed by two different operators (MR and DP), leading to 7763 bona fide endocytic events. This gives 19.1 ± 0.1% of false positives, a percentage virtually identical to previous estimates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. The inputs of the SVM were sets of 15 × 15 pixel images centred on the candidate event, 5 frames before and 6 frames after the candidate event is detected, i.e., 15 × 15 × 11 = 2475 input values (pixel values) per candidate event. The output was binary, ‘accepted’ or ‘rejected’ (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2C, D</xref>). Once trained, the SVM model could sort correctly all events used for training. We tested it further with 7 recordings with 1224 candidate events sorted by the user in 1124 bona fide events. The SVM sorted 1095 bona fide events (98.4 ± 2.0% of the number of events accepted by the user). Finally, 93.5 ± 1.1% were the same as the events accepted by the users. We conclude from this analysis that the SVM trained by the 26 recordings is able to discriminate bona fide events with the same accuracy as a human operator, and probably with better consistency. In conclusion, we developed a fully automated analysis workflow to assess quantitatively the endocytic activity of cells in real time.</p>
      <p id="Par40">The cumulative frequency plots presented in Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5b, c</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6</xref> were obtained by plotting event detections against time. For each recording, the frequency of events in both cell attached (resp. control) and whole cell (resp. treatment) recordings were normalised to the basal frequency of the cell as monitored in cell attached configuration. In other words, the curves were normalised so that the number of detections at the 70th frame of cell attached recording (280 s) would be set to 100. In this way, several cells submitted to the same treatment could be pooled into a single curve despite a great variability in their basal endocytic activity.

      <title>Transferrin uptake assay and quantification</title>
      <p id="Par42">TKO cells were starved in pre-warmed HBS for 10 min, then incubated in cold (4 °C) HBS containing 10 µg/ml of transferrin Alexa 568 (Tfn-A568, Thermo Fischer). Cells were then incubated at 37 °C for 5 min for endocytosis to occur. Afterwards, cells were washed in cold HBS, then in cold acetate buffer (pH 4.5) for 2 min to strip Tfn-A568 remaining on the cell surface, rinsed, and fixed with paraformaldehyde (4% in PBS, 37 °C) for 15 min. Cells were then rinsed several times in PBS and kept at 4 °C until imaging. Fixed cells were then imaged at the Bordeaux Imaging Center with a spinning disk confocal microscope (Leica DMI 6000 microscope (Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany) equipped with a confocal head Yokogawa CSU-X1 (Yokogawa Electric Corporation, Tokyo, Japan), and a QuantEM camera (Photometrics, Tucson, USA), controlled with Metamorph (Molecular Devices)). The laser and camera parameters kept constant for the whole set of conditions. A stack of six images separated by 0.5 µm encompassing the bottom part adhering to the coverslip was taken for each cell. We used the maximal projection of the z-stack for quantification. For each cell, we traced around the dyn-GFP image (when applicable) a mask of the cell, as well as a background region with no cell. In non-transfected cells the mask was traced around the Tfn-A568 image. We detected Tfn-A568 clusters by wavelet segmentation using custom written Matlab programs. For each cell we computed the average fluorescence, the number of clusters and the cell surface. These numbers were normalized to 100 for the control condition (no OHT induction) for each of four independent internalization assays. The distribution of dyn-GFP was scored for each cell as entirely punctuate (1), punctuate on a homogenous background (2), mostly homogenous with some puncta (3), or entirely homogenous (4) (see Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1f</xref> for illustrations).
