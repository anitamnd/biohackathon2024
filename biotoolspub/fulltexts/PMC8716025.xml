      <p>The development of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines during the COVID-19 pandemic has prompted the emergence of COVID-19 vaccine data. Timely access to COVID-19 vaccine information is crucial to researchers and public. To support more comprehensive annotation, integration, and analysis of COVID-19 vaccine information, we have developed Cov19VaxKB, a knowledge-focused COVID-19 vaccine database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.violinet.org/cov19vaxkb/" id="ir005"><underline>http://www.violinet.org/cov19vaxkb/</underline></ext-link>). Cov19VaxKB features comprehensive lists of COVID-19 vaccines, vaccine formulations, clinical trials, publications, news articles, and vaccine adverse event case reports. A web-based query interface enables comparison of product information and host responses among various vaccines. The knowledge base also includes a vaccine design tool for predicting vaccine targets and a statistical analysis tool that identifies enriched adverse events for FDA-authorized COVID-19 vaccines based on VAERS case report data. To support data exchange, Cov19VaxKB is synchronized with Vaccine Ontology and the Vaccine Investigation and Online Information Network (VIOLIN) database. The data integration and analytical features of Cov19VaxKB can facilitate vaccine research and development while also serving as a useful reference for the public.</p>

    <title>Introduction</title>
    <p id="p0005">The emergence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has severely impacted human populations on a global scale. As of November 8, 2021, over 246 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 had been recorded worldwide since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in nearly 5 million deaths <xref rid="b0005" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. To reduce the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 within human populations, researchers worldwide have developed vaccines immunizing against SARS-CoV-2. Several vaccines, including Pfizer-BioNTech’s Comirnaty, Moderna’s mRNA-1273, and Oxford-AstraZeneca’s AZD1222, have been authorized for public use in at least one country, while many other vaccines are currently undergoing preclinical studies or Phase 1–3 clinical trials. These recent developments have generated an influx of new information about the composition, production, distribution, and effects of COVID-19 vaccines.</p>
    <p id="p0010">Many online resources on COVID-19 vaccine information currently exist, providing product-related information such as vaccine type, antigen, storage, adjuvant, and research status as well as host-related data regarding vaccine efficacy, immunogenicity, and safety. For instance, extensive clinical trial data for COVID-19 vaccines can be found on the website clinicaltrials.gov and other clinical trial record websites operated by governmental agencies. The CDC and FDA’s Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) contains a detailed repository of COVID-19 vaccine adverse event information (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://vaers.hhs.gov/" id="ir010"><underline>https://vaers.hhs.gov/</underline></ext-link>). As of November 8, 2021, PubMed contained 21,720 publications related to COVID-19 vaccines using the search query “(vaccine OR vaccination) AND (SARS-CoV-2 OR COVID-19)”. There are also several online COVID-19 vaccine trackers that provide an overview of vaccines that are undergoing development or have been authorized for public use, including the World Health Organization’s COVID-19 Vaccine Tracker and Landscape <xref rid="b0010" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine VaC tracker <xref rid="b0015" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, and the New York Times Coronavirus Vaccine Tracker <xref rid="b0020" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. However, these resources typically focus on one or a few of these vaccine-related topics for a specific group of users, such as adverse events, clinical trials, or general vaccine or vaccination information. As more relevant data is generated, an organized, accessible knowledge base that integrates COVID-19 vaccine information from various sources is necessary.</p>
    <p id="p0015">Existing data curation, integration, and analysis systems that focus on vaccine information include the Vaccine Investigation and Online Information Network (VIOLIN) database and Vaccine Ontology. VIOLIN is a web-based, publicly accessible vaccine database that includes information about over 4000 vaccines for over 200 pathogens and non-infectious diseases (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.violinet.org" id="ir015"><underline>http://www.violinet.org</underline></ext-link>) <xref rid="b0025" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. VIOLIN also includes many small databases and features such as the Vaxign2 vaccine design program <xref rid="b0030" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref> and VO-SciMiner, an ontology-based literature mining tool <xref rid="b0035" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Vaccine Ontology (VO) is a community-based ontology that covers different aspects of vaccines and vaccination, including vaccine components, formulations, and host responses <xref rid="b0040" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="b0045" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>.</p>
    <p id="p0020">To address the need for a publicly accessible and integrated repository of COVID-19 vaccine information, we have developed the COVID-19 Vaccine Knowledge Base (Cov19VaxKB). Developed as a relatively independent program under the umbrella of the VIOLIN system, Cov19VaxKB is focused on the collection, annotation, and integration of COVID-19 vaccine information encompassing vaccine development, production, safety, immunogenicity, efficacy, and more. Cov19VaxKB also contains features that allow users to analyze data related to vaccine efficacy, safety, and mechanisms. The knowledge base is freely available for public use and can be accessed at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.violinet.org/Cov19VaxKB" id="ir020"><underline>http://www.violinet.org/Cov19VaxKB</underline></ext-link>.</p>

    <sec id="s0015">
      <label>2.1</label>
      <title>Cov19VaxKB system and database design</title>
      <p id="p0025">Cov19VaxKB was established within the VIOLIN database system using two virtual servers in the University of Michigan Medical School virtual server system that runs the Redhat Enterprise Linux operating system <xref rid="b0025" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. It is developed with classical three-tier architecture. The knowledge base website features a series of comprehensive vaccine lists, a vaccine adverse event analysis program, a vaccine design tool, an automated literature search feature, a list of vaccine news updates, and links to other COVID-19 vaccine resources. <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> illustrates the workflow of the Cov19VaxKB/VIOLIN database design and implementation.<fig id="f0005"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Cov19VaxKB workflow and system design. COVID-19 vaccine data from peer-reviewed PubMed publications, clinical trial records, and the WHO “Draft landscape and tracker of COVID-19 candidate vaccines” was annotated and stored into the Cov19VaxKB and VIOLIN databases. Data sharing and transfer was enabled by Vaccine Ontology (VO) IDs assigned for COVID-19 vaccines. Adverse event case report data was extracted from VAERS and analyzed in Cov19VaxKB using a server-side script.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gr1"/></fig></p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="s0020">
      <label>2.2</label>
      <title>Annotation of vaccine information</title>
      <p id="p0030">Data in Cov19VaxKB is manually curated and annotated through two platforms: the knowledge base’s vaccine list web pages and the VIOLIN web-based data curation system.</p>
      <p id="p0035">The vaccine list pages are constructed using the PHP programming language. Data within the vaccine lists is primarily derived from the WHO’s “COVID-19 Vaccine Tracker and Landscape,” which contains an extensive list of all COVID-19 vaccines in all stages of development as well as their associated clinical trial IDs (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/draft-landscape-of-covid-19-candidate-vaccines" id="ir025"><underline>https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/draft-landscape-of-covid-19-candidate-vaccines</underline></ext-link>). This resource is used to gather information about vaccine names, vaccine type, manufacturer, route of administration, number of doses, length of time between doses, and clinical trial IDs. In addition, clinical trial record URLs, age subgroups, and location are derived from clinical trial websites such as clinicaltrials.gov. Relevant publications are identified by searching the name of the vaccine of interest on PubMed. Links to corresponding VIOLIN and Vaccine Ontology entries are also incorporated into these lists. When applicable, the date on which a vaccine was first authorized by a regulatory agency is sourced from a manual web search. All information from these resources is manually curated into PHP files, which are then uploaded to the Cov19VaxKB server for display. The vaccine list pages are organized according to vaccine development status, including preclinical studies, Phase 1–3 clinical trials, and authorization for emergency or full use. These lists are updated weekly to ensure that the information provided is up-to-date and accurate.</p>
      <p id="p0040">The VIOLIN data curation system is also utilized for manual curation of data in Cov19VaxKB <xref rid="b0025" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. VIOLIN entries for each vaccine contain product information, such as manufacturer, vaccine type, antigen, and immunization route, as well as host response data from preclinical and clinical studies, including vaccine efficacy, immune response, and side effects. These entries can be accessed through the Cov19VaxKB query feature described in the next section.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="s0025">
      <label>2.3</label>
      <title>Cov19VaxKB data query and result display</title>
      <p id="p0045">The Cov19VaxKB web interface includes a query for COVID-19 vaccine entries that are stored in the VIOLIN database. The query is submitted from the Cov19VaxKB web user interface (the presentation tier) and is then processed using PHP/SQL (the middle tier, application server) against a MySQL relational database (the data tier, database server). Query results are then displayed in an accessible web browser.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="s0030">
      <label>2.4</label>
      <title>Cov19VaxKB vaccine adverse event data analysis tool</title>
      <p id="p0050">The vaccine adverse event analysis tool in Cov19VaxKB contains a query for adverse event case report information derived from VAERS and a statistical analysis feature. Case report data for all vaccines is downloaded monthly from the CDC VAERS database and deposited into a local MySQL database. Through a server-side script, the data is parsed and filtered for COVID-19 vaccines. The resulting case report data is then formatted to include attributes such as vaccine name, USA state or territory, age and sex of vaccine recipient, year of vaccination, and VAERS report year. This formatting allows users to query and filter adverse events for a specific COVID-19 vaccine based on the attributes described above. Users can also select a specific adverse event to access comprehensive tables of individual VAERS case reports.</p>
      <p id="p0055">To display a potential association between a specific adverse event (AE) and a COVID-19 vaccine, three statistical measures are calculated: a Chi-squared value with its associated degrees of freedom and p-value, Proportional Reporting Ratio (PRR) <xref rid="b0050" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, and case report frequency <xref rid="b0055" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. An R script for a Pearson Chi-square test with Yates’ continuity correction uses a 2 × 2 frequency/contingency table to calculate the Chi-squared value, degrees of freedom, and p-value. The PRR represents the frequency of an adverse event for a vaccine of interest relative to all other case reports for all vaccines in the VAERS database. To determine whether a specific AE is significantly enriched for a specified COVID-19 vaccine, we have used a set of significance cutoffs as reported previously <xref rid="b0055" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, which includes three criteria: Chi-squared value &gt; 4, PRR &gt; 2, and number of case reports &gt; 0.2% of total case reports for the specified vaccine. All three criteria need to be met to identify the AE as significantly enriched for the vaccine.</p>
      <p id="p0060">Using the Cov19VaxKB statistical analysis tool and cutoff criteria, we generated a list of statistically significant adverse events for the Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, and Johnson &amp; Johnson (Janssen) vaccines. These adverse events were systematically compared and analyzed among the three vaccines.</p>

      <label>2.5</label>
      <title>Cov19VaxKB vaccine automated literature update tool</title>
      <p id="p0065">Cov19VaxKB features an automated literature update tool that lists COVID-19 vaccine-related publications that have been published within the current and previous months. Publications are extracted from PubMed via NCBI’s E-utilities data retrieval program and are formatted and displayed in HTML webpages using a PHP script <xref rid="b0060" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. One HTML webpage features 100 SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 vaccine publications and 100 coronavirus vaccine publications published during the current month that were extracted from PubMed. A second HTML webpage displays 100 SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 vaccine publications and 100 coronavirus vaccine publications from PubMed that were published in the previous month. The queries for the SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 and coronavirus vaccine publication lists use the keywords “(vaccine OR vaccination) AND (SARS-CoV-2 OR COVID-19)” and “(vaccine OR vaccination) AND (Coronavirus),” respectively. In all queries, the results are filtered by date. To update the publication lists automatically, the PHP script is run daily using a server-side cron job <xref rid="b0065" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Direct links to PubMed queries of COVID-19 vaccine and coronavirus vaccine publications are also included.</p>

      <title>Cov19VaxKB vaccine design tool</title>
      <p id="p0070">We have previously developed a web application for vaccine design (Vaxign2), which utilizes reverse vaccinology and machine learning to predict vaccine targets <xref rid="b0030" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. The Cov19VaxKB version of this vaccine design tool includes an embedded view of the SARS-CoV-2 results from Vaxign2. The SARS-CoV-2 Vaxign2 output includes the protein name and accession number, adhesin probability, number of trans-membrane helices, and a Vaxign-ML score derived from a machine learning-based prediction <xref rid="b0070" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>.</p>

      <title>Cov19VaxKB data transfer and download</title>
      <p id="p0075">To enable data transfer, Cov19VaxKB is synchronized with VO, which serves as an ontological storage system for information regarding vaccine names, vaccine type, route of administration, manufacturers, antigens, host species, and adjuvants <xref rid="b0045" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. VO entries for COVID-19 vaccines are manually created and updated using the Protégé ontology program in the Web Ontology Language (OWL). Links to these VO entries are manually incorporated into the knowledge base’s vaccine lists and VIOLIN entries. Excel files of the vaccine lists, Vaxign2 output, and adverse event analysis results are uploaded to the “Data Download” webpage for user download.</p>

      <title>Overall Cov19VaxKB system design and statistics</title>
      <p id="p0080">The Cov19VaxKB system is designed to focus on three aspects of COVID-19 vaccine data: vaccine development, product-side information, and host-side information.</p>

    <title>Discussion</title>
    <p id="p0130">To the best of our knowledge, Cov19VaxKB is the first web-based, publicly available knowledge base that targets the curation and analysis of COVID-19 vaccine information. The knowledge base can be used for a broad range of applications. Comparison of host responses and analysis of adverse events may reveal important statistics and enriched patterns that can promote further studies about COVID-19 vaccine development and safety. Cov19VaxKB’s vaccine lists can be openly accessed to learn about various features of COVID-19 vaccines, including vaccine types, clinical trial information, dates of authorization, vaccine safety information, and relevant publications. Users can predict vaccine targets using the vaccine design tool or utilize the adverse event data analysis feature to determine safety signals for specific COVID-19 vaccines.</p>
    <p id="p0135">The Cov19VaxKB web query enables users to compare product and host response information between various COVID-19 vaccines. Thus, the query can be a powerful tool for analyzing relationships between two or more vaccine properties or attributes. For instance, users can analyze the relationship between immune responses and vaccine type by comparing neutralizing antibody levels and protection rates among vaccines of different types. Vaccine efficacy rates can be compared across different vaccine types to assess any broad differences or similarities in vaccine efficacy.</p>
    <p id="p0140">The adverse event analysis tool can identify enriched adverse events in COVID-19 vaccines that can be analyzed for potential causal relationships in future studies. A statistically significant adverse event for a vaccine represents the enriched association between the vaccination and the adverse event at the population level, but it does not imply that the vaccination induced the adverse event for a specific individual. An adverse event is any undesirable experience that happens after vaccination which may or may not be caused by a vaccine <xref rid="b0080" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Overall, existing COVID-19 vaccines have been demonstrated to be safe <xref rid="b0085" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Further adverse event analysis is necessary to determine whether instances of adverse events such as death and thrombosis were directly caused by COVID-19 vaccines.</p>
    <p id="p0145">Although statistically significant adverse events occur more frequently for the vaccine of interest compared to other vaccines, these AEs occur at a very low frequency compared to the total number of vaccinations administered. For example, there were only 2736 reported occurrences of pulmonary embolism among the 3 FDA-authorized vaccines, in contrast to a total number of 428,006,540 COVID-19 vaccine doses administered in the United States as of November 6, 2021 <xref rid="b0090" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. In other words, pulmonary embolism occurred in only 0.0006% of all COVID-19 vaccinations in the US.</p>
    <p id="p0150">In conclusion, Cov19VaxKB provides a timely platform for the curation, sharing, and analysis of COVID-19 vaccine information. In the future, we aim to continue adding new features to the knowledge base to improve the user experience and meet the growing demand for relevant vaccine data analysis. As the volume of COVID-19 vaccine and vaccination data continues to grow, the knowledge base will be a useful and reliable reference for both researchers and the public.</p>
