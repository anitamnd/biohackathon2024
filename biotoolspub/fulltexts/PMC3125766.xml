      <p>RNA molecules can achieve a broad range of regulatory functions through specific structures that are in turn determined by their sequence. The prediction of mutations changing the structural properties of RNA sequences (a.k.a. deleterious mutations) is therefore useful for conducting mutagenesis experiments and synthetic biology applications. While brute force approaches can be used to analyze single-point mutations, this strategy does not scale well to multiple mutations. In this article, we present <monospace><bold>corRna</bold></monospace> a web server for predicting the multiple-point deleterious mutations in structural RNAs. <monospace><bold>corRna</bold></monospace> uses our <monospace><bold>RNAmutants</bold></monospace> framework to efficiently explore the RNA mutational landscape. It also enables users to apply search heuristics to improve the quality of the predictions. We show that <monospace><bold>corRna</bold></monospace> predictions correlate with mutagenesis experiments on the hepatitis C virus <italic>cis</italic>-acting replication element as well as match the accuracy of previous approaches on a large test-set in a much lower execution time. We illustrate these new perspectives offered by <monospace><bold>corRna</bold></monospace> by predicting five-point deleterious mutations—an insight that could not be achieved by previous methods. <monospace><bold>corRna</bold></monospace> is available at: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://corrna.cs.mcgill.ca">http://corrna.cs.mcgill.ca</ext-link>.</p>

    <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
    <p>RNA molecules can achieve a broad range of regulatory functions through specific self-folding structures that are in turn determined by their nucleotide sequence. Any modification in this sequence may result in a change in its structure and a loss of function. These deleterious mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>) can be the origin of metabolic disorders. For example, Halvorsen <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>) recently reported finding several mutations associated with diseases that were indeed deleterious. Since the role played by RNA molecules in various diseases is becoming evident (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>), the development of tools for predicting deleterious mutations could be helpful to predict pathogenic mutations especially in the absence of comparative genomic data.</p>
    <p>Geneticists could also benefit from such a predictor. Indeed, to understand the importance of specific nucleotides, mutagenesis experiments proceed by point-wise mutations in order to reveal modifications in the molecule's function. When this function is carried by the structure, these mutations can be associated with a structural change. These experiments, however, are time consuming and have a substantial cost. Since the number of possible mutations grows exponentially with the size of the sequence, exhaustive experimental studies are not feasible. It follows that the choice of which mutations to test is critical. An efficient prediction method that returns a small list of deleterious mutation candidates could help direct these experiments and generate better results.</p>
    <p>The prediction of deleterious mutations is also important in synthetic biology. Many recent models use RNA molecules as nano devices and require sequences designed to fold into specific shapes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). To be functional, the best candidate sequences should be robust to both thermodynamic and genetic perturbations. In this case, a deleterious mutation predictor can be used to filter out sequences which are too sensitive to nucleotide substitutions.</p>
    <p>In the last 4 years, three methods have been developed to predict deleterious mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). <monospace>RDMAS</monospace> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>) and <monospace>RNAmute</monospace> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>) have been designed to predict single deleterious mutations. However, in general, the structural instability carried by a single mutation is limited and may not produce significant changes. To address this challenge, Churkin and Barash extended their method and developed <monospace>MultiRNAMute</monospace>—a method searching for multiple-point mutations that greatly improves the scope and significance of the predicted deleterious candidates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). To date, <monospace>MultiRNAMute</monospace> is available as a stand-alone application and only <monospace>RDMAS</monospace> offers a web interface.</p>
    <p>All these previous methods combine a brute force exploration of the mutational landscape with a systematic usage of single sequence secondary structure predictors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). This approach is unfortunately computationally limiting as the algorithm must generate and individually fold a large number of mutants that grows exponentially with the length of the sequence and the number of mutations allowed. Efforts to circumvent this problem have led to heuristics using the structural properties of the wildtype to restrict the number of candidates considered. Unfortunately, even with these techniques, the search depth is very limited and the state-of-the-art approach (i.e. <monospace>MultiRNAMute</monospace>) cannot efficiently predict simultaneous deleterious mutations with more than three mutations.</p>
    <p>We have recently shown that we can simultaneously explore both the mutational and secondary structure landscape of an RNA sequence in both polynomial time and space complexity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). The resulting software, <monospace>RNAmutants</monospace>, has been implemented as a web server (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>) for general RNA mutational analysis. Although straightforward applications of <monospace>RNAmutants</monospace> can be used to predict deleterious mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>), the accuracy of these results is limited as <monospace>RNAmutants</monospace> does not implement any strategy to bias the search toward deleterious mutations, neither does it provide an evaluation function for quantifying the deleterious effect of the predicted mutations. Nevertheless, as noted in a recent review by Barash and Churkin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>), our statistical sampling algorithms provide the best perspectives for a time-efficient multiple-point deleterious mutation analysis.</p>
    <p>In this article, we describe <monospace>corRna</monospace>, a method for predicting multiple-point deleterious mutations in RNA sequences using our <monospace>RNAmutants</monospace> framework. Our approach enables us to predict deleterious mutations with a large number of substitution sites, while preserving the accuracy of a brute force approach. To achieve these results, we combined <monospace>RNAmutants</monospace> with the structural heuristic search introduced in Ref. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>), thus producing similar quality predictions in a much shorter time. In addition, we propose a novel mutational heuristic search and show that it also improves the accuracy of the mutation predictions.</p>
    <p>This article is organized as follows. First, we describe the web server input parameters and the prediction output provided by <monospace>corRna</monospace>. Then, in the ‘Definitions and methods’ section, we describe the algorithms and the search heuristics which have been used to improve the accuracy of the results. Finally, in the ‘Results’ section, we evaluate the performance of our methods. In particular, we (i) show that <monospace>corRna</monospace> predictions correlate with mutagenesis experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>), (ii) estimate the impact of various heuristics on the quality of the predictions, and (iii) compare our methods with previous approaches on a newly created test set extracted from the <monospace>Rfam</monospace> database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). We also illustrate the new perspectives offered by <monospace>corRna</monospace> by predicting five-point deleterious mutations—an insight that could not be achieved by any previous methods. <monospace>corRna</monospace> is the first web server that enables the prediction of deleterious multiple-point mutations for an RNA sequence.</p>

    <sec>
      <title>Hardware and compatibility</title>
      <p>The web server (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://corrna.cs.mcgill.ca">http://corrna.cs.mcgill.ca</ext-link>) runs Ubuntu-Server 10.04 on a Dell PE T610 2x Intel Quad core X5570 Xeon Processor, 2.93 GHz 8M Cache, 64 GB Memory (8 × 8 GB), 1333 MHz Dual Ranked RDIMMs for 2 Processor, Advanced ECC. The web server has been tested and is functional in Internet Explorer, Firefox and Google Chrome.</p>

      <title>Input</title>
      <p>The input form of <monospace>corRna</monospace> is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>. First, the user inputs an RNA sequence and an optional email address. Then, the user can choose between a ‘Structure’ (default) and a ‘Mutation’ heuristic to guide the mutational landscape exploration, or to simply decide to perform an unbiased search without using any heuristics. The structural heuristic explores mutations that favor alternate structures present in the suboptimal structural ensemble. The mutation heuristic performs successive searches while limiting the location at which mutations can occur along the RNA sequence. Details on these heuristics will be discussed in the ‘Definitions and methods’ section.
<fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><monospace>corRna</monospace> Input Form.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gkr358f1"/></fig></p>
      <p><monospace>corRna</monospace> also enables the user to choose between two methods for probing the mutational landscape. By default, it uses the the original <monospace>RNAmutants</monospace> algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). However, if no search heuristic is selected, the user may also use a novel extension of <monospace>RNAmutants</monospace> called <monospace>fixedCGSampling</monospace>, which enables us to compute multiple mutations while preserving the G + C content of the input sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). In both cases, the user can define the maximum number of k-point mutations allowed in the input sequence, using the field called ‘Mutation depth’.</p>
      <p>Finally, users are able to refine their search by modifying extra options, depending on the heuristic chosen. With the structure heuristic, the user can define the number of suboptimal base pairings that <monospace>corRna</monospace> will use. In the mutation heuristic, the user can define how many successive searches will be performed, as well as restrict results to mutation sequences that fall below a defined threshold. The user can also modify the dangling end energy setting used when running <monospace>RNAfold</monospace> to obtain the base pairing probability distribution.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec>
      <title>Output</title>
      <p>Upon submission of the input form, a link to the results page is posted at the top of the web site. If the user provided an email address, this link and the results will also be sent by email. Before the results are generated, the page will refresh every 5 s and display the status of the query, whether it be ‘Waiting in Queue’ or ‘Processing’. A sample of the results page for the HCV <italic>cis</italic>-acting replication element (5BSL3.2) is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>. The page consists of a table that displays all deleterious mutations predicted by <monospace>corRna</monospace>. The additional columns include the minimum free energy (MFE) secondary structure, the base pair correlation (i.e. a measure of the deleteriousness of the mutations described in the ‘Definitions and methods’ section), the MFE value of the mutant, the number of mutations and the significance of the candidate (i.e. an estimate of how likely this mutant can be found by chance. See ‘Definitions and methods’ section). If the structural heuristic is used, then the base pair constraint and its break number are also included. By clicking on the header of each column, the user can sort the results according to the value stored in this column.

Note that although <monospace>corRna</monospace> calculates the correlation based on the whole structural ensemble, only the MFE structure is displayed.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gkr358f2"/></fig></p>
      <p>Moreover, if a user clicks on a sequence in the table, the server will display a graphical representation of the associated secondary structure using the java applet <monospace>VARNA 3.7</monospace> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). This functionality is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref> and is useful to quickly compare the structural differences between the wildtype and the mutation candidate.

    <title>DEFINITIONS AND METHODS</title>
    <p>The core component of <monospace>corRna</monospace> is <monospace>RNAmutants</monospace>, an efficient mutational analysis tool that explores the complete mutational landscape of a given RNA sequence. Given an RNA sequence, <monospace>RNAmutants</monospace> uses a dynamic programming algorithm to compute, for each integer k, the minimum free energy MFE(<italic>k</italic>) and Boltzmann partition function Z(<italic>k</italic>) of all sequences with <italic>k</italic> mutations over all secondary structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). Then, <monospace>RNAmutants</monospace> uses a stochastic backtracking procedure to sample mutants and secondary structures.</p>
    <p><monospace>corRna</monospace> works in two steps. First, it uses <monospace>RNAmutants</monospace> to compute a sample set of candidate deleterious mutations. This search can be aided either by a structural or mutation heuristic to prune the RNA mutational landscape. Then, <monospace>corRna</monospace> ranks the samples by the strength of their deleterious effect.</p>
    <sec>
      <title>Structural heuristic</title>
      <p>The structural heuristic uses structural constraints on the base pairings allowed in the sequence to guide <monospace>corRna</monospace> in the exploration of the mutational landscape. <monospace>corRna</monospace> will first use the base pairing probability matrix generated by Vienna's <monospace>RNAFold</monospace> to find base pairing locations with significant probabilities that are not used in the MFE secondary structure. Then, it calculates the break number of each base pair, defined by the number of base pairs that must be removed from the wild-type sequence in order to insert the target base pair. Finally, <monospace>corRna</monospace> runs <monospace>RNAmutants</monospace> while constraining the search to mutations which preserve these identified base pairs. This strategy was inspired by and implemented from the method used in <monospace>MultiRNAMute</monospace> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>).</p>
    </sec>
    <sec>
      <title>Mutation heuristic</title>
      <p>The mutation heuristic uses constraints on the allowed mutation locations to guide <monospace>corRna</monospace>. In <monospace>RNAmutants</monospace>, the mutants with the lowest MFE are more likely to be sampled than other sequences. Thus, deleterious mutations that do not improve the free energy of the input sequence can be missed. To find other mutations, <monospace>corRna</monospace> performs successive runs of <monospace>RNAmutants</monospace> and progressively removes from the sample set, mutation locations that were explored in the previous runs (i.e. we constrain <monospace>RNAmutants</monospace> to not mutate the positions used in previous runs). This novel heuristic provides a way to explore the mutation space at locations that would otherwise be obscured by the more probable candidates provided by <monospace>RNAmutants</monospace>. This strategy thoroughly differs from the structural heuristic and enable us to explore regions of the mutational landscape that could have been otherwise missed.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec>
      <title>Measurement of ‘deleterious-ness’</title>
      <p>We quantify the “deleterious-ness” or destabilizing effect of a candidate mutation with a base pair correlation measure that compares the structural ensemble of the mutation sequence to that of the wildtype (i.e. the input sequence). Briefly, this correlation method computes the base pairing probabilities of the wild-type and a sampled mutant using <monospace>RNAfold</monospace> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). Then, it calculates the Pearson's correlation coefficient between the two distributions to estimate the deleterious effect of the mutation(s). This correlation value ranges between −1 and 1 and quantifies the deleterious effect of a mutation. Values close to 1 denote non-deleterious mutations, values close to −1 stand for highly deleterious mutations. This method was first proposed by Halvorsen <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>), who demonstrated that a comparison between ensembles of base pair probabilities more accurately predicts structural changes than a single point comparison between MFE structures. The implementation of this correlation method in <monospace>corRna</monospace> gives us an important analytical advantage over <monospace>MultiRNAMute</monospace>, which only uses the base pair or Hamming distance to quantify the “deleterious-ness” of a mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>).</p>
    </sec>
    <sec>
      <title>Bootstrap significance</title>
      <p>We use a bootstrap method to estimate the significance of a candidate sequence compared with a set of randomly generated sequences. Briefly, for each number of mutations <italic>k</italic>, we sample 1000 <italic>k</italic>-mutants of the input sequence <italic>uniformly</italic>. Then, we calculate the base pair correlation for each of these samples with the wildtype, and derive a distribution of correlation values for the whole set. Finally, <monospace>corRna</monospace> returns the percentile (between 0 and 1) of each candidate sequence by where it is ranked in this correlation distribution. A sequence with a significance value close to 0 would indicate that the candidate sequence has a low base pair correlation to wildtype that is significantly separated from a random sample of mutation sequences. It is worth noting that even if some rare random mutations may have a lower correlation value than <monospace>RNAmutants</monospace> samples, the latter have much more thermodynamically stable structures and thus provide better deleterious mutation candidates.</p>

      <title>Comparison with mutagenesis experiments</title>
      <p>To validate the accuracy in which this correlation method can predict mutation-based structural changes, we used a benchmark of mutations used by You <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>) on the Hepatitis C virus cis-acting replication element (5BSL3.2). These mutations were analyzed with our correlation method. Our results, shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>, found the C84A_U86G mutation to have the lowest correlation (0.290) with respect to wildtype. This result is consistent with the findings in Ref. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>), where the authors found that the most deleterious mutation was the C84A_U86G mutant and confirmed that the loss in viability was due to the disruption of the upper helix of the RNA secondary structure. This benchmark shows that the correlation calculation can accurately identify the most deleterious mutation among a set of candidate sequences that have been analyzed experimentally.

    <sec>
      <title>Predictive power</title>
      <p>To test the predictive power of <monospace>corRna</monospace>, we compared the predictive performance of <monospace>corRna</monospace> against <monospace>MultiRNAMute</monospace> over a benchmark set of 30 sequences obtained from the Rfam database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). Since the accuracy of our predictions is necessarily determined by the performance of the nearest neighbor energy model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>), we selected sequences on which the energy model performs well. This set was generated by first taking all the sequences in the Rfam database with a size &lt;100 nt. Then, for each sequence we computed the MFE structure together with its probability in the Boltzmann low energy ensemble. RNA sequences were selected if their MFE was equal to that of the consensus structure. If two sequences belonged to the same family, the more stable one (the structure with the highest probability in the ensemble) was selected. The lengths of the selected benchmark set ranged from 19 to 98 nt. This benchmark set is freely available on our web site and we encourage any future research on mutational analysis to include this benchmark set as a comparison between different methods.</p>
      <p>The sequences in the benchmark set were run with both <monospace>MultiRNAMute</monospace> and <monospace>corRna</monospace>. The parameters of <monospace>MultiRNAMute</monospace>, were set to: dist1 to 15, dist2 to 15, e range to 15, mutations to 3 and distance to ‘Hamming, method = Fast, stabilizing and destabilizing’. <monospace>corRna</monospace> was run using no heuristic, the structural heuristic and the mutation heuristic. We first predicted up to three-point mutations. However, to demonstrate the advantage offered by the efficient methods underlying <monospace>corRna</monospace>'s algorithm, we ran these sequences to predict up to five-point mutations. These five-point mutations could not be run in a reasonable time frame with <monospace>MultiRNAMute</monospace>. Once the candidate sequences were generated, the correlation values were computed for each candidate mutation sequence. The number of candidates predicted (including duplicates), average correlation to wildtype (excluding duplicates) and best candidate (defined by the lowest correlation) were then averaged across all the 30 sequences. During any trial, if no sequences were predicted, the number of candidates was set to 0 and the trial was given an average and minimum correlation of 1. Average results over all sequences in the set are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>. Detailed results are available on the web site.

      <p>The ‘Avg. cand.’ column indicates the average number of candidates generated by each method over all benchmark sequences. <monospace>MultiRNAMute</monospace> generated a large and varied number of candidates with an average of 16 982 and a range of 0–258 240 sequences. In addition, <monospace>MultiRNAMute</monospace> failed to find any predictions for four of the sequences. The number of candidates generated by any <monospace>corRna</monospace> method was both smaller and less varied. When calculating up to three-point mutations (m = 3), <monospace>corRna</monospace> with no heuristic had an average of 17 candidates and a range of 2–23. The structure heuristic had an average of 236 and a range of 94–489. Finally, the mutation heuristic had an average of 230 candidates with a range of <italic>199–238</italic>. Similar results were obtained when calculating up to five-point mutations (m = 5).</p>
      <p>Compared to <monospace>MultiRNAMute</monospace>, the lower number of candidates returned by <monospace>corRna</monospace> presents some advantages. From a user standpoint, it provides a simpler set of candidate sequences for consideration in mutagenesis experiments.</p>
      <p>The ‘Avg. corr.’ column indicates the average correlation of candidates given by each method over all sequences. At m = 3, the <monospace>corRna</monospace> structural, mutation and no heuristic methods obtained an average correlation of 0.575, 0.683 and 0.668, respectively. At m = 5, these values improved to 0.425, 0.570 and 0.551. The average correlation of <monospace>MultiRNAMute</monospace> was 0.366.</p>
      <p>Finally, the ‘Min. corr’ column indicates the average of the most deleterious mutation found for each sequence by each method. At m = 3 the <monospace>corRna</monospace> structural, mutation and no heuristic methods obtained an average correlation of 0.025, 0.244 and 0.479, respectively. At m = 5, these values improved to −0.098, 0.011 and 0.312. The average minimum correlation of <monospace>MultiRNAMute</monospace> was −0.007.</p>
      <p>These results indicate that both the structural and mutational heuristic improves the basic <monospace>corRna</monospace> method. Furthermore, the ability to search to higher k-point mutants improved the average correlation and min correlation. Overall, the structural heuristic performed better than the mutational heuristic. However, the performance of the mutational heuristic significantly improved when allowing up to five-point mutations. Indeed, there were some cases in the five-point mutation case where the mutation heuristic would find sequences with a markedly lower correlation than either the <monospace>corRna</monospace> structural heuristic or <monospace>MultiRNAMute</monospace> (data not shown).</p>
      <p>When comparing the results from <monospace>corRna</monospace> and <monospace>MultiRNAMute</monospace>, <monospace>MultiRNAMute</monospace> provided a lower average correlation. However, <monospace>corRna</monospace> matched the average minimum correlations found when using the structural heuristic at m = 3 and when using either heuristic at m = 5. In addition, <monospace>corRna</monospace> managed to predict deleterious mutations even when <monospace>MultiRNAMute</monospace> failed to find any. Although <monospace>corRna</monospace> had a slightly higher average correlation of sequences predicted, <monospace>corRna</monospace> guaranteed results and predicted at a similar accuracy the more interesting mutations – those mutations that were most likely to be deleterious.</p>

      <title>Running time</title>
      <p>The efficient algorithm used in <monospace>RNAmutants</monospace> gives <monospace>corRna</monospace> a runtime advantage over other mutational analysis applications such as <monospace>MultiRNAMute</monospace>. A running time comparison between <monospace>RNAmutants</monospace> and <monospace>MultiRNAMute</monospace> conducted by Barash and Churkin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>) showed that <monospace>RNAmutants</monospace> has a better scaling factor that becomes advantageous when extending searches to four-point and five-point mutations. This advantage becomes especially important when implementing a web server which would be expected to give prompt results. To illustrate this point, we plot in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref> the execution time of <monospace>corRna</monospace> and <monospace>multiRNAmute</monospace> on a sequence of size 40 used in Ref. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>) as a time benchmark. As expected, our results show that while the running time of <monospace>multiRNAmute</monospace> increases exponentially with the number of mutations allowed, <monospace>corRna</monospace> only requires an amount of time proportional to the square of the number of mutations. Here, this advantage becomes highly beneficial at mutation depth of 4. This phenomenon is amplified on longer sequences (data not shown).

    <title>CONCLUSION</title>
    <p>In conclusion, <monospace>corRna</monospace> provides (and <italic>guarantees</italic>) a smaller candidate mutation set than <monospace>MultiRNAMute</monospace>, while still maintaining predictive power. More importantly, these results come with a significant reduction of the computational complexity, which allows <monospace>corRna</monospace> to extend the mutational analysis to larger numbers of k-point mutations. Finally, <monospace>corRna</monospace> also implements a correlation method which gives <monospace>corRna</monospace> an analytical advantage over MFE structure comparison methods used by <monospace>MultiRNAMute</monospace>.</p>
    <p><monospace>corRna</monospace> is the first web server that predicts multiple-point mutations and analyzes their deleterious nature using a correlation of structural changes compared with the wildtype. One of the interesting implications of <monospace>corRna</monospace> is that it is possible for <monospace>corRna</monospace> to predict mutations that would cause greater structural changes than any mutation found experimentally. These predictions are accessible through our web server (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://corrna.cs.mcgill.ca">http://corrna.cs.mcgill.ca</ext-link>). We hope that <monospace>corRna</monospace> provides an avenue for new experimental research to test the deleterious nature of RNA mutations <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>
