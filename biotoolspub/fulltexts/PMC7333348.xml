      <title>Abstract</title>
      <p>T‐cell receptor (<styled-content style="fixed-case" toggle="no">TCR</styled-content>) ligation‐mediated protein phosphorylation regulates the activation, cellular responses, and fates of T cells. Here, we used time‐resolved high‐resolution phosphoproteomics to identify, quantify, and characterize the phosphorylation dynamics of thousands of phosphorylation sites in primary T cells during the first 10 min after <styled-content style="fixed-case" toggle="no">TCR</styled-content> stimulation. Bioinformatic analysis of the data revealed a coherent orchestration of biological processes underlying T‐cell activation. In particular, functional modules associated with cytoskeletal remodeling, transcription, translation, and metabolic processes were mobilized within seconds after <styled-content style="fixed-case" toggle="no">TCR</styled-content> engagement. Among proteins whose phosphorylation was regulated by <styled-content style="fixed-case" toggle="no">TCR</styled-content> stimulation, we demonstrated, using a fast‐track gene inactivation approach in primary lymphocytes, that the <styled-content style="fixed-case" toggle="no">ITSN</styled-content>2 adaptor protein regulated T‐cell effector functions. This resource, called LymphoAtlas, represents an integrated pipeline to further decipher the organization of the signaling network encoding T‐cell activation. LymphoAtlas is accessible to the community at: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://bmm-lab.github.io/LymphoAtlas">https://bmm-lab.github.io/LymphoAtlas</ext-link>.</p>

    <p>Cell‐surface receptors constantly detect and integrate signals emanating from the extracellular environment. In most cases, the conversion of extracellular stimuli into intracellular cues is encoded by post‐translational modifications (PTMs) of proteins occurring rapidly after receptor engagement. Among PTMs, phosphorylations propagate signaling by transiently regulating enzymatic activities, protein localizations, and protein–protein interactions (PPIs). Such signaling cascades play a major role in T cells, whose functionalities depend on signals delivered by the T‐cell receptor (TCR; Brownlie &amp; Zamoyska, <xref rid="msb209524-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>). In contrast to other receptors, which bind a predetermined ligand, the TCR recognizes a variety of major histocompatibility complex‐associated antigenic peptides (pMHC), thereby encoding extracellular signals into an adaptive immune response. TCR stimulation also conditions signaling emanating from auxiliary T‐cell sensors such as co‐stimulatory or cytokine receptors. Thus, the TCR is a master regulator of T‐cell functions and its dysfunction can lead to immune disorders (Fischer <italic>et al</italic>, <xref rid="msb209524-bib-0012" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>).</p>
    <p>Given the essential role of the TCR, tremendous efforts have been made over the last decades to map and characterize the molecular mechanisms responsible for signal propagation following its engagement. The TCR is associated with CD3 chains that bear immunoreceptor tyrosine‐based activation motifs (ITAMs) providing the entry point for downstream signal propagation (Chakraborty &amp; Weiss, <xref rid="msb209524-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>). Upon TCR engagement, signaling is initiated by the phosphorylation of these ITAMs by the tyrosine kinase LCK. Doubly phosphorylated ITAMs provide docking sites for the ZAP70 kinase, which in turn becomes tyrosine‐phosphorylated and activated. Those initial TCR signaling steps are followed by further downstream molecular events involving the recruitment of key adaptors such as LAT and SLP‐76 allowing signal diversification through the mobilization of additional proteins with diverse enzymatic activities, ultimately promoting the acquisition of T‐cell effector functions (Balagopalan <italic>et al</italic>, <xref rid="msb209524-bib-0002" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>; Gaud <italic>et al</italic>, <xref rid="msb209524-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>; Voisinne <italic>et al</italic>, <xref rid="msb209524-bib-0047" ref-type="ref">2019</xref>).</p>
    <p>Studies analyzing human immunodeficiencies, immortalized T‐cell lines, or genetically engineered mouse models have identified key proteins that are required for proper T‐cell activation along with important PTMs that can regulate the enzymatic activities of kinases, phosphatases or transcription factors. Despite these efforts, a global understanding of this complex signaling network is still lacking. Indeed, conventional approaches have often focused on a particular component of the TCR network and have not allowed a broad monitoring of the proximal or more distal parts of the signaling pathways mobilized by TCR stimulation. Furthermore, most available data do not include time‐resolved quantitative measurements. Finally, the heterogeneity of the experimental models used between different studies makes it difficult to obtain a coherent and global description of the TCR pathway and to predict the effects of genetic or drug perturbations in primary cells.</p>
    <p>Recent advances in mass spectrometry (MS) analysis promise to greatly improve our understanding of complex biological networks by allowing the identification of large sets of PPIs, and the quantitative comparison of proteomes and phosphoproteomes in a hypothesis‐free fashion (Aebersold &amp; Mann, <xref rid="msb209524-bib-0001" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>). Such large‐scale MS‐based approaches have been already used in a few studies to characterize protein phosphorylation and associated molecular mechanisms in primary T cells. Navarro <italic>et al</italic> (<xref rid="msb209524-bib-0024" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>) applied SILAC protein metabolic labeling on murine P14 cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) to analyze phosphorylation following long‐term (1‐h) stimulation of the TCR with its cognate peptide, and identified around 2,000 phosphorylated peptides, among which 22% were TCR‐regulated. Subsequently, to study the mechanisms of PKD2, a kinase important for effector cytokine production after TCR engagement, a similar strategy was implemented to compare the phosphoproteomes of wild‐type and PKD2‐deficient CTLs after 5 min of TCR activation (Navarro <italic>et al</italic>, <xref rid="msb209524-bib-0025" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>). This work led to a more extensive coverage of 15,000 site‐specific phosphorylations in antigen receptor‐activated CTLs, although no comparison was performed with unstimulated cells, precluding the identification of TCR‐regulated phosphorylation sites. In a recent study, Joshi <italic>et al</italic> (<xref rid="msb209524-bib-0018" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>) also used phosphoproteomics to analyze regulatory T‐cell (Treg) suppression mechanisms on primary human conventional T cells, upon TCR stimulation and Treg‐mediated suppression, respectively. Using a coculture system and a quantitative approach based on isotopic dimethyl labeling of peptides, the authors could detect around 2,000 phosphopeptides and quantify around 1,000 of them in three different T‐cell states (unstimulated, TCR‐stimulated with anti‐CD3/anti‐CD28 antibodies, and Treg‐suppressed). These studies, based either on metabolic protein labeling or on dimethyl peptide labeling, were limited in the number of conditions or time points that could be included and compared. In addition, they focused on the global phosphoproteome, composed mainly of phosphorylated serine and threonine sites. To overcome this limitation, Ruperez <italic>et al</italic> (<xref rid="msb209524-bib-0041" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>) introduced an additional step of purification to specifically enrich phosphorylated tyrosine residues. Using this approach, the authors identified a total of 2,883 phosphorylated peptides in CD4 human T cells stimulated for 5 min with anti‐CD3 antibodies, including 48 peptides phosphorylated on tyrosines. Altogether, the development of these methods paved the way for in‐depth analysis of signaling and phosphorylation induced during T‐cell activation.</p>
    <p>Here, our aim was to apply such unbiased, large‐scale MS‐based methods to provide a detailed and comprehensive picture of the basic mechanisms involving protein phosphorylation, in the first minutes following TCR activation in murine primary CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. We used a label‐free quantitative method, allowing to include several time points and replicates in our experimental setup, to quantify and monitor the phosphorylation dynamics of residues during the first 10 min after TCR stimulation. The use of a modern, fast‐sequencing Orbitrap MS instrument enabled us to mine the phosphoproteome at a depth of 13,000 unique phosphorylated peptides and around 7,000 phosphorylation sites with localization confidence. By including an additional step of enrichment of rare phosphotyrosine (pY)‐containing peptides, we were able to quantify a large collection of pY sites (&gt; 250) in primary T cells. In an effort to provide a useful descriptive resource, we performed a thorough computational analysis of this time‐resolved data set and also developed a Web interface for easy visualization of phosphosites kinetics. The analysis of phosphorylation time courses allowed us to identify TCR‐regulated phosphosites along with their different dynamic patterns. It highlighted a rapid mobilization of molecular components involved in cytoskeleton remodeling, transcription, and translation processes. Our data illustrate the phosphorylation dynamics of the well‐known upstream players of the TCR signaling pathway, as well as that of novel components. To follow‐up on one of them, we used a fast‐track gene extinction approach based on the CRISPR/Cas9 system in primary mouse T cells, and we demonstrated that the intersectin 2 (ITSN2) adaptor protein regulates T‐cell effector functions by controlling TCR surface down‐regulation upon antigenic stimulation.</p>

      <title>Mapping phosphorylation sites in primary T cells prior and over the first 10 min following TCR stimulation</title>
      <p>To generate an extensive data set of phosphorylation events taking place in primary T lymphocytes, CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells from wild‐type mice were purified and briefly expanded by stimulating them with anti‐CD3 plus anti‐CD28 antibodies <italic>in vitro</italic> (see <xref rid="msb209524-sec-0004" ref-type="sec">Materials and Methods</xref>). After 2 days in culture supplemented with interleukin 2 (IL‐2), effector T cells enter a state of quiescence characterized by their inability to further divide and proliferate in the absence of new TCR stimulation. At that stage, TCR engagement by anti‐CD3 plus anti‐CD4 antibodies leads to a transient increase in global tyrosine and serine/threonine phosphorylation, as shown by the analysis of total protein lysates immunoblotted with phospho‐specific antibodies (Fig <xref rid="msb209524-fig-0001ev" ref-type="fig">EV1</xref>A). To capture the molecular events induced by TCR engagement in a hypothesis‐free and site‐specific fashion, briefly expanded T cells (as described above) were left unstimulated or stimulated via their TCR for 15, 30, 120, 300, or 600 s prior to phosphoproteomic analysis (Fig <xref rid="msb209524-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>A). Four independent experiments were performed in which phosphopeptides were enriched using TiO<sub>2</sub> beads and analyzed by LC‐MS. In three of these experiments, an additional enrichment step using phosphotyrosine immunopurification (pY‐IP) was introduced to achieve a better mapping of pY peptides. Therefore, the TiO<sub>2</sub> data set and the pY‐IP data set correspond, respectively, to 24 and 18 independent samples, each analyzed in triplicate nano‐LC‐MS runs. These led to the identification of 13,009 unique phosphorylated peptides corresponding to 9,702 and 560 phosphosites—or combination of sites in the case of multiple phosphorylated peptides—in the TiO<sub>2</sub> and the pY‐IP data set, respectively (Fig <xref rid="msb209524-fig-0001ev" ref-type="fig">EV1</xref>B). From these peptides, we were able after filtering (PEP value &gt; 0.01, localization score &gt; 75%, elimination of sites with high number of missing values; see <xref rid="msb209524-sec-0004" ref-type="sec">Materials and Methods</xref>) to relatively quantify 7,180 phosphorylation sites or combinations of sites (<xref rid="msb209524-sup-0003" ref-type="supplementary-material">Dataset EV1</xref>). These correspond to 6,984 unique, non‐redundant sites (Fig <xref rid="msb209524-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>B and C), including 5,659 phosphoserines (pS), 1,070 phosphothreonines (pT), and 254 pY present on 2,118 proteins in primary T cells. The analysis of the number of phosphosites present per protein indicated that although some proteins were phosphorylated on more than ten residues (<italic>e.g.,</italic> ACIN1, ADD3), 77% of phosphoproteins displayed between one and three phosphosites (Fig <xref rid="msb209524-fig-0001ev" ref-type="fig">EV1</xref>C). We checked whether the probability of detection of phosphopeptides could be affected by the corresponding protein abundance or protein length. We found no relationship between the length of proteins and the number of detected phosphosites per protein (Fig <xref rid="msb209524-fig-0001ev" ref-type="fig">EV1</xref>D). In order to evaluate the protein relative abundances in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, we used a proteome generated using SDS–PAGE pre‐fractionation (Voisinne <italic>et al</italic>, <xref rid="msb209524-bib-0047" ref-type="ref">2019</xref>) and extracted the iBAQ values (sum of all the peptide intensities divided by the number of observable peptides of a protein) for each detected protein. Among the 2,181 unique proteins for which we quantified at least one phosphorylation site, we could quantify the abundance of 1,871 proteins (86%) in the proteome. Comparison of this proteomic data set with our phosphoproteomic data suggested that at least 29% of the proteins expressed in T cells were phosphorylated and that the detection of phosphoproteins was not biased toward highly abundant molecules (Fig <xref rid="msb209524-fig-0001ev" ref-type="fig">EV1</xref>E and F). Moreover, our analytical workflow allowed us to reproducibly track rare and transient molecular modifications in primary T cells. In particular, the pY enrichment allowed the proportion of phosphorylated tyrosines to reach nearly 4% in our data set, therefore constituting, to our knowledge, the largest collection of pY sites identified in primary mouse T cells. The analysis of annotations (UniProt keywords) within the set of identified phosphoproteins in the context of the CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell proteome revealed an enrichment of proteins involved in transcriptional regulation and cytoskeleton remodeling and also showed an association with other PTMs such as ubiquitination, methylation, and isopeptide bond formation (Fig <xref rid="msb209524-fig-0001ev" ref-type="fig">EV1</xref>G). Interestingly, a large fraction of phosphosites were already detected in the unstimulated condition (89% of detected phosphoproteins) and constitute a resource <italic>per se</italic> since some of these phosphoproteins could be required to maintain cell integrity and protein expression and stability. For example, multiple phosphorylations were detected on the ARFGEF1/2 proteins involved in vesicular trafficking and maintenance of the Golgi structure. As highlighted by annotations, high occurrences of constitutive phosphorylations were also observed on transcriptional repressors (NCOR1/2, SIN3A, HDAC1/4/5) involved in methylation and histone deacetylation leading to the formation of repressive chromatin structures. This data set contains more than 1,000 phosphosites that were not previously reported in the literature or in the dedicated database PhosphoSitePlus (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.phosphosite.org">www.phosphosite.org</ext-link>), accounting for 14% of our global data set (Fig <xref rid="msb209524-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>B and C). Collectively, these results constitute an extensive and quantitative resource mapping phosphosites specific to primary CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells.</p>

      <title>Identification of TCR‐regulated phosphorylation sites</title>
      <p>We next sought to identify sites whose phosphorylation was regulated by TCR stimulation. With this aim, we set up a workflow based on label‐free relative quantification of intensities across all time points, followed by an ANOVA‐based statistical analysis (see <xref rid="msb209524-sec-0004" ref-type="sec">Materials and Methods</xref>). In brief, the phosphosites presenting well‐resolved kinetics (a minimum of two biological replicates with three common time points) were considered regulated when they presented an absolute fold change ≥ 1.75 associated with a corrected <italic>P</italic>‐value ≤ 0.05 between two time points (<xref rid="msb209524-sup-0003" ref-type="supplementary-material">Dataset EV1</xref>). With this approach, we identified 731 phosphorylation sites (or combination of sites) that were regulated in the course of TCR stimulation, including 611 pS, 77 pT, and 52 pY (Fig <xref rid="msb209524-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>A and B). These regulated sites constituted around 10% of the phosphosites of the total data set and mapped to 492 regulated phosphoproteins (<italic>e.g.,</italic> around 7% of all the proteins expressed in T cells, according to the proteome described above) (Fig <xref rid="msb209524-fig-0002ev" ref-type="fig">EV2</xref>A). A similar strategy applied to the data obtained from the analysis of the peptides before phosphoenrichment allowed us to quantify more than 80% of the abundance of regulated phosphoproteins. Importantly, these data indicate that protein abundances were not impacted by TCR activation at these early time points (Figs <xref rid="msb209524-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>A and <xref rid="msb209524-fig-0002ev" ref-type="fig">EV2</xref>B, and <xref rid="msb209524-sup-0004" ref-type="supplementary-material">Dataset EV2</xref>) and that changes in phosphopeptide quantities directly reflected phosphorylation or dephosphorylation events. The analysis of annotations (UniProt keywords) enriched within the set of regulated phosphosites compared to the set of phosphosites of the total data set revealed that proteins associated with cytoskeletal organization (“Cytoskeleton”, “Actin‐binding”, and “Synapse”), ion transport (“Calcium transport”, “Chloride channel”) and with specific protein domains (“SH3 domain”, “SH2 domain”) were impacted by TCR stimulation (Fig <xref rid="msb209524-fig-0002ev" ref-type="fig">EV2</xref>C). Many major actors of the canonical TCR signaling pathway such as the TCR complex itself, the kinases LCK and ZAP70, the phospholipase C‐gamma‐1 (PLCg1), and the adaptors SLP76 and LAT also contained TCR‐regulated phosphosites (Fig <xref rid="msb209524-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>C). Regulated phosphosites also covered distal and ubiquitous pathways associated with cellular activation as illustrated by the identification of components of the MAPK signaling pathway (RAF1, BRAF, ERK1, ERK2, RSK2, and MAPK14) and of the calcium signaling pathway (ITPR3, STIM1/2). Regulation of these pathways through TCR activation is known to trigger active actin remodeling, leading to bulk membrane movements, morphological changes, and formation of the immunological synapse. Consistently with the analysis of annotations, important phosphorylation changes were detected on a large set of proteins involved in cytoskeleton remodeling, such as LCP‐1, VASP, Cofilin‐1, or STMN. In addition, TCR stimulation regulated the phosphorylation of sites on many proteins involved in transcriptional regulation, including important factors reported to control the gene expression program associated with T‐cell responses (HDAC7, NFATC1/2, FOXO3, BACH2). TCR stimulation also affected the phosphorylation of plasma membrane‐anchored proteins such as surface receptors (CCR7, leukosialin/CD43, LY9, CD97, and CD5) or the transmembrane molecule LIME1 providing additional docking sites for the recruitment of downstream effectors. Finally, TCR‐regulated phosphosites were identified on proteins known to negatively regulate the TCR signaling pathway, such as the ubiquitin ligases CBL and CBL‐B, phosphatases (PTPN1, PTPN6, PTPN22, PTPN7, UBASH3A), and the signal‐transducing adapter molecule 2 (STAM2). Noticeably, among the 730 phosphorylation sites that we identified as significantly regulated according to the criteria described above, some exhibited very strong regulation, with fold changes of high amplitude (shown as a list in <xref rid="msb209524-sup-0003" ref-type="supplementary-material">Dataset EV1</xref>). Additionally, Fig <xref rid="msb209524-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>C shows a schematic representation of phosphosites found to be significantly regulated following TCR stimulation in this study, and known from the literature to be functionally related to this pathway (also see <xref rid="msb209524-sup-0003" ref-type="supplementary-material">Dataset EV1</xref>). It covers many of the major previously reported regulators of T‐cell activation.</p>

      <title>Chronological orchestration of biological processes underlying T‐cell activation</title>
      <p>To tackle the complexity of the time‐resolved data set and extract additional biological insights, we sought to apply t‐distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t‐SNE) to transform the multi‐dimensional data (MS intensity per time points after stimulation for each phosphosite) into a two‐dimensional plot. Here, each point corresponds to a regulated phosphosite, which is located in the neighborhood of those with similar phosphorylation dynamics (Fig <xref rid="msb209524-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>D). Within the t‐SNE map, we identified 13 clusters containing 24 to 111 phosphosites using an approach based on maximum local densities (Rodriguez &amp; Laio, <xref rid="msb209524-bib-0035" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>; Fig <xref rid="msb209524-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>C and D). The variety of phosphokinetics displayed by these clusters revealed diverse TCR‐dependent phosphoregulations. The first two clusters (C1, 76 sites, and C2, 73 sites) displayed a very early and transient phosphorylation increase peaking at 15 or 30 s, respectively, followed by a rapid decrease. Similarly, clusters C3 (44 sites) and C4 (25 sites) displayed a rapid increase in phosphorylation levels also peaking at 15 or 30 s, but remained sustained (C3) or even quite stable (C4) for these groups. Other clusters showing increased phosphorylation (C5–C8) were characterized by a delayed phosphorylation peak. Indeed, maximum intensities of phosphorylation of C5 and C6 were at 120 s and were followed by either down‐regulation (C5) or maintenance (C6). For C7 and C8, we observed a gradual and continuous amplification of the phosphorylation signal all along the time course, which remained sustained (C7) or was even increasing (C8) at the later time points. Although most of the sites were up‐regulated upon TCR engagement (73% of them fell in clusters C1–C8), our analysis also revealed five clusters (C9–C13) displaying decreased phosphorylation upon TCR stimulation. Of note, while tyrosine residues were mainly involved in relatively persistent phosphorylation events (clusters C3, C6, and C7), serine and threonine residues exhibited a wider range of dynamic patterns with many examples of quick and transient phosphorylation (C1‐2), progressive and sustained modification (C8), or dephosphorylation (C9‐13; Fig <xref rid="msb209524-fig-0003ev" ref-type="fig">EV3</xref>A).</p>

      <p>Analysis of the annotations enriched within the set of phosphosites in a given cluster when compared to the set of all TCR‐regulated phosphosites revealed that clusters with very early and transient phosphoregulations (C1 and C2) were enriched with sites corresponding to proteins associated with “GTPase activation”, “Actin‐binding”, “Synaptosome”, and “Cell projection”, several terms that characterize the cytoskeletal remodeling process, a biological event required for T‐cell activation (Ritter <italic>et al</italic>, <xref rid="msb209524-bib-0034" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>; Fig <xref rid="msb209524-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>A and B). For example, quick and transient serine phosphorylations were observed within the EVH2 domains of EVL (S257, S258, S343) and VASP (S318, S319) (Fig <xref rid="msb209524-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>C). VASP EVH2 domain (310‐TTLPRMKSSSSVTTS‐324) contains actin‐binding sites, and phosphorylation of its serine residues has been shown to promote actin polymerization (Doppler <italic>et al</italic>, <xref rid="msb209524-bib-0011" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>). We also detected coincidental phosphorylation of the WAS/WASL‐interacting protein family member 1 (WIPF1) within (S330) or adjacent (S268) to the binding sites of NCK second SH3 domain (Fig <xref rid="msb209524-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>C). This protein–protein interaction is known to contribute to the release of the auto‐inhibited WASP conformation, which, in turn, activates Arp2/3 to induce actin filament assembly (Donnelly <italic>et al</italic>, <xref rid="msb209524-bib-0010" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>; Rohatgi <italic>et al</italic>, <xref rid="msb209524-bib-0037" ref-type="ref">2001</xref>). The functional enrichment analysis also highlighted the accumulation of phosphosites on protein kinases in clusters C3–C5 (Fig <xref rid="msb209524-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>A and B), particularly the crucial phosphosites characterizing the <italic>trans</italic>‐phosphorylation enzymatic activity of ZAP70 (Y491 and Y492), which reached a maximum of phosphorylation between 15 and 30 s and were progressively dephosphorylated after 120 s (Fig <xref rid="msb209524-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>D). Finally, the keyword “Receptor” was enriched in cluster C7, due to the over‐representation of sites from phosphorylated ITAMs of the CD3 chains. This revealed that phosphorylation of the TCR complex homogeneously increased up to 5 min and remained persistent ten minutes after initial TCR engagement despite the attenuation of the ZAP70 kinase activity (Fig <xref rid="msb209524-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>D). Whether early and late CD3 chain phosphorylations trigger distinct or similar downstream signals remains to be determined.</p>

      <title>Early TCR signals regulate the transcriptional and translational machinery</title>
      <p>In contrast to the terms analyzed above, which were enriched in specific kinetic clusters, other biological processes were associated with proteins presenting phosphosites more randomly distributed in the t‐SNE. This was the case for sites related to “Transcription regulation” (Fig <xref rid="msb209524-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>B), which indicates that the phosphoregulation events underlying this process were diverse and took place throughout the 10‐min TCR stimulation time course analyzed here. Their heterogeneous dynamics highlight the various molecular mechanisms that control transcription. One example is the polycomb‐repressive complex 1 (PRC1), which promotes transcription through chromatin remodeling. Several phosphorylation events were detected on the different components of this complex (Phc3‐T607, Cbx4‐S350, Rnf2‐S41), each with different kinetics (Fig <xref rid="msb209524-fig-0003ev" ref-type="fig">EV3</xref>B). TCR stimulation induced the progressive phosphorylation of Rnf2‐S41, an event preventing histone H2A ubiquitination and allowing its acetylation, thereby promoting transcription (Niessen <italic>et al</italic>, <xref rid="msb209524-bib-0027" ref-type="ref">2009</xref>; Rao <italic>et al</italic>, <xref rid="msb209524-bib-0033" ref-type="ref">2009</xref>). We also observed the early dephosphorylation of Phc3‐T607 and Cbx4‐S350 which suggests that these non‐previously reported events could also regulate the function of this complex. Another consequence of the phosphorylation affecting transcriptional regulators is to promote their localization in specific subcellular compartments. For example, protein phosphorylation on serine residues can induce their interaction with 14‐3‐3 proteins and result in their nuclear exclusion (Brunet <italic>et al</italic>, <xref rid="msb209524-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">2002</xref>). Accordingly, we identified phosphorylation events on factors previously reported to be regulated by such a mechanism (Fig <xref rid="msb209524-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>E), like the CREB‐regulated transcription coactivator 3 (Crtc3‐S370), the forkhead box protein O3 (Foxo3‐S252), and the forkhead/winged‐helix family k1 (Foxk1‐S406/S414/S431), all showing serine phosphosites regulated upon TCR stimulation (Clark <italic>et al</italic>, <xref rid="msb209524-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>; He <italic>et al</italic>, <xref rid="msb209524-bib-0015" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>; Singh <italic>et al</italic>, <xref rid="msb209524-bib-0042" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>). In particular, the increased phosphorylation characterizing the residue S252 localized in the NLS of FOXO3 indicates that the nuclear‐to‐cytosolic translocation and the 14‐3‐3 binding known to relieve the repression of mitogenic genes could occur &lt; 10 min after TCR stimulation (Figs <xref rid="msb209524-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>E and <xref rid="msb209524-fig-0003ev" ref-type="fig">EV3</xref>C; Brunet <italic>et al</italic>, <xref rid="msb209524-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">1999</xref>).</p>
      <p>A scattered t‐SNE distribution was also observed for sites on proteins associated with the terms “Translation regulation” and “Protein biosynthesis” (Fig <xref rid="msb209524-fig-0003ev" ref-type="fig">EV3</xref>D). Indeed, many subunits of complexes involved in the translation initiation (EIF3B, EIF4B, EIF4G1, EIF4G3, and EIF5B) and elongation (EEF1A1, EEF1B, EEF1D, and EEF2) were affected by distinct phosphorylation changes. However, these displayed synchronized phosphorylation dynamics within each protein complex (Fig <xref rid="msb209524-fig-0003ev" ref-type="fig">EV3</xref>E). The elevated number of regulated phosphosites within these complexes, and the fact that only few of them (Eef2‐T57, Eif4g3‐S1150) have already been characterized, highlights our lack of knowledge regarding the complexity and rapidity of the molecular mechanisms that regulate essential cellular processes such as protein translation (Rose <italic>et al</italic>, <xref rid="msb209524-bib-0039" ref-type="ref">2009</xref>; Srivastava <italic>et al</italic>, <xref rid="msb209524-bib-0044" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>).</p>
      <p>Overall, our analysis revealed the coherent orchestration of critical biological processes as early as a few minutes upon TCR engagement in primary mouse T lymphocytes.</p>

      <title>Profiling kinase activities in the course of TCR stimulation</title>
      <p>To gain insights into the dynamics of kinase activities underlying TCR‐mediated cell activation, we mapped kinase–substrate relationships from the PhosphoSitePlus database, which provides a data set containing experimentally determined substrates, sequences, cognate kinases, and metadata curated from the literature (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.phosphosite.org/">www.phosphosite.org/</ext-link>). We restricted our analysis to kinases that could be identified in our proteome of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (Voisinne <italic>et al</italic>, <xref rid="msb209524-bib-0047" ref-type="ref">2019</xref>). Analysis of substrate enrichment per cluster revealed significant associations between activity of kinases and specific clusters, thereby reflecting the temporal dimension in which kinases operate (Fig <xref rid="msb209524-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref>A). For example, substrates corresponding to ERK and AKT kinases were preferentially enriched in clusters C5‐C8 (Fig <xref rid="msb209524-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref>A–C). More specifically, we identified phosphorylation of STMN1, CEP55, DLGAP5 and ACLY, DNMT1, and FOXO3, known to be specific to the ERK and AKT signaling axis, respectively, although some of these kinase–substrate relationships have yet to be confirmed in primary T cells. Interestingly, phosphorylation of Pdcd4‐S457, Bad‐S155, and Rps6‐S236/379 is indistinctly attributed to the AKT or the ERK axis in the literature and databases (Fig <xref rid="msb209524-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref>C). This observation can reflect a crosstalk between the two signaling pathways or alternatively, may be due to the diversity of cell types or engaged receptors analyzed and reported in public databases. To better characterize these sites and refine the specificity of the signals associated with TCR engagement, we treated T cells with specific MEK (U0126) or AKT1/2 (AKTi VIII) inhibitors and analyzed phosphorylation of their substrates (Fig <xref rid="msb209524-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref>D). As expected, phosphorylation on specific sites of MEK substrates such as ERK1/2‐Y204/T202 and RSK1‐S369/S377 was selectively inhibited by U0126, while treatment with AKTi VIII specifically reduced FOXO3‐S252 and AKT‐T308 phosphorylations. Interestingly, in these inhibitory conditions, phosphorylation of PDCD4‐S457 was strongly reduced only by U0126, indicating a predominant dependence on the ERK signaling pathway for this site upon TCR activation in primary T cells (Fig <xref rid="msb209524-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref>D). PDCD4 phosphorylation on S457 has been shown to promote its degradation, thus preventing its translation inhibitory function. Therefore, this result suggests a rapid induction of translational processes within minutes of the TCR stimulation through PDCD4 and the ERK pathway. Similarly, we observed that the phosphorylation of RPS6 and P70S6K was strongly impaired upon inhibition of ERK but not of AKT. Although these substrates are mainly associated with the canonical AKT pathway, our results suggest that in the context of TCR signaling they could rather be regulated by ERK, potentially through RSK kinases (Roux <italic>et al</italic>, <xref rid="msb209524-bib-0040" ref-type="ref">2007</xref>).</p>

      <p>In addition, we found that substrates of CDK1, PRKAA1, and LIMK2 were over‐represented in dephosphorylated clusters C12 and C13 (Fig <xref rid="msb209524-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref>A and B). PRKAA1 (also AMPK1) is a central regulator of metabolism and energy balance in T cells, as in many other cell types. It negatively regulates mTORC1 signaling and promotes catabolic metabolism (Fig <xref rid="msb209524-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref>C). In addition, it has been shown that AMPK1 is required to generate effector memory responses upon a secondary antigen challenge (Rolf <italic>et al</italic>, <xref rid="msb209524-bib-0038" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>). We observed that TCR stimulation regulated the phosphorylation of AMPK1 substrates involved in processes that characterize proliferating T cells, such as fatty acid synthesis (acetyl‐CoA Carboxylase, ACACA), glucose uptake (TBC1 domain family member 1, TBC1D1), or mitochondrial metabolism (mitochondrial fission factor, MFF; Fig <xref rid="msb209524-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref>C). Given that these were dephosphorylated, we hypothesized that AMPK1 activity was reduced following TCR stimulation and assessed it by probing T172 phosphorylation, which is known to reflect AMPK1 kinase activity (Hurley <italic>et al</italic>, <xref rid="msb209524-bib-0017" ref-type="ref">2005</xref>). The phosphorylation of T172 observed in quiescent cells progressively decreased upon stimulation, a result consistent with the dephosphorylation of the non‐catalytic subunit β1 of AMPK1 (Prkab1−S108) identified by MS analysis (Fig <xref rid="msb209524-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref>C and E). Therefore, these results indicate that early TCR signaling represses AMPK1 enzymatic activity and suggest that T cells shift to aerobic glycolysis within minutes after TCR ligation.</p>

      <title>Intersectin 2 regulates T‐cell effector functions</title>
      <p>Proximity between phosphosites within the t‐SNE plot reflects temporal coincidence of phosphorylation and can reveal molecular and functional relationships. By focusing on phosphotyrosine sites, we noticed that pY sites of STAM2 and ITSN2 were close to those of the CD3 chains (Fig <xref rid="msb209524-fig-0005" ref-type="fig">5</xref>A). In the case of the STAM2 phosphosite Stam2‐Y371, this could be explained by the fact that this site is within an ITAM, possibly allowing its regulation by Src and ZAP70 kinases (Pandey <italic>et al</italic>, <xref rid="msb209524-bib-0031" ref-type="ref">2000</xref>). For the ITSN2 phosphosite (Itsn2‐Y554), it could suggest an alternative functional relationship with the CD3 chains. ITSNs (ITSN1 and 2) are multi‐modular scaffolding proteins, involved in the endocytosis pathway of various cell types (Tsyba <italic>et al</italic>, <xref rid="msb209524-bib-0045" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>). ITSNs are expressed under two splicing isoforms. The ITSN‐short (ITSN‐S) is composed of two Eps15 homology (EH) domains and a central coiled‐coil domain followed by a series of SH3 domains. The longer form (ITSN‐L) possesses an extended C‐terminal part encoding for an exchange factor (DBL), a pleckstrin (PH), and a C2 domain. Although ITSN2 is ubiquitously expressed, the exploration of mouse public databases showed that it is preferentially expressed in B and T lymphocytes (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.immgen.org">www.immgen.org</ext-link>). In B cells, ITSN2 is required to promote germinal center formation and antibody production to influenza virus infection (Burbage <italic>et al</italic>, <xref rid="msb209524-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>). In addition, we also detected this protein in the interactomes of the CBL and CBL‐B ubiquitin ligases in primary T cells, suggesting its involvement within the TCR signaling pathway (Voisinne <italic>et al</italic>, <xref rid="msb209524-bib-0046" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>).</p>

      <p>To confirm that Itsn2‐Y554 phosphorylation correlated with CD3 chain phosphorylations during TCR stimulation with a cognate antigen, we generated an independent phosphoproteome data set from OT‐I CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells that express a TCR specific for the ovalbumin (OVA)‐derived SIINFEKL (N4) peptide bound to H‐2Kb MHC‐I molecules. OT‐I T cells were stimulated with pMHC‐I tetramers laden with N4 peptide for 15, 30, 120, 300, and 600 s. Globally, analysis of this data set showed results very comparable to those obtained with CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (Fig <xref rid="msb209524-fig-0004ev" ref-type="fig">EV4</xref>, <xref rid="msb209524-sup-0005" ref-type="supplementary-material">Dataset EV3</xref>). In brief, 59% of the phosphosites identified and 88% of the phosphosites regulated by TCR stimulation in the CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells were also detected in OT‐I CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (Fig <xref rid="msb209524-fig-0004ev" ref-type="fig">EV4</xref>A–C). Moreover, phosphorylation kinetics of phosphosites regulated by TCR stimulation were remarkably conserved across both data sets (Fig <xref rid="msb209524-fig-0004ev" ref-type="fig">EV4</xref>B and C). Notably, the phosphoproteins and their regulations we previously focused on were unambiguously confirmed by this data set (Fig <xref rid="msb209524-fig-0004ev" ref-type="fig">EV4</xref>D). Importantly, OT‐I‐based data also confirmed that Itsn2‐Y554 phosphorylation was regulated upon TCR activation with a dynamic similar to those of the CD3 chains, suggesting that the potential functional relationship between ITSN2 and the TCR observed in the CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells is preserved in CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells.</p>

      <p>To investigate the role of ITSN2 in primary T cells, OT‐I TCR transgenic mice were crossed onto constitutive Cas9‐EGFP‐expressing mice (Platt <italic>et al</italic>, <xref rid="msb209524-bib-0032" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>), and purified CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells from their progenies were transfected with specific sgRNA to selectively inactivate <italic>Egfp</italic> (control) or the <italic>Itsn2</italic> gene. With EGFP sgRNA, this procedure routinely resulted in the fluorescent protein extinction in 80‐85% of transfected cells (Fig <xref rid="msb209524-fig-0005ev" ref-type="fig">EV5</xref>A). Accordingly, targeting <italic>Itsn2</italic> with two different guides (sgITSN2‐1 and sgITSN2‐2) showed a drastic reduction in ITSN2 abundance compared with EGFP‐targeted cells, indicating that one or both copies of the <italic>Itsn2</italic> gene were knock‐out in a large fraction of cells (Fig <xref rid="msb209524-fig-0005ev" ref-type="fig">EV5</xref>B). These cells were stimulated with pMHC‐I tetramers conjugated with the SIINFEKL (N4) peptide in the absence or presence of anti‐CD28 antibody. The abundance of surface markers such as CD69, CD5, and CD44 significantly increased after 48 h of stimulation in <italic>Itsn2</italic>‐targeted cells compared with control cells revealing an enhanced activation of cells deprived of the adaptor (Figs <xref rid="msb209524-fig-0005" ref-type="fig">5</xref>B and <xref rid="msb209524-fig-0005ev" ref-type="fig">EV5</xref>C). Next, we assessed the impact of <italic>Itsn2</italic> inactivation on proliferation and cytokine production upon TCR activation. Interestingly, stimulation of ITSN2‐targeted cells exhibited contrasting phenotypes whether cells were incubated with low or high doses of agonist peptide (0.01 nM or 0.1 nM). Indeed, the addition of a low concentration of tetramers induced increased proliferation and IFN‐γ production of <italic>Itsn2‐</italic>targeted cells compared with EGFP‐targeted cells, while an opposite effect was observed at a high tetramer concentration (Fig <xref rid="msb209524-fig-0005" ref-type="fig">5</xref>C and D). To obtain a finer resolution, we stimulated cells with a range of increasing doses of pMHC‐I tetramers and identified a breaking point between 10<sup>−11</sup> and 2 × 10<sup>−11</sup> M of agonist peptide (Fig <xref rid="msb209524-fig-0005" ref-type="fig">5</xref>E). These results indicate that ITSN2‐targeted cells have a lower activation threshold compared with wild‐type cells. Additionally, reduced effector functions of <italic>Itsn2‐</italic>targeted cells with high doses of peptides could result from an over‐activation of induced cell death (AICD) mechanism (Green <italic>et al</italic>, <xref rid="msb209524-bib-0014" ref-type="ref">2003</xref>) or an exaggeration of the regulatory mechanisms responsible for the bell‐shaped dose response observed in T cells (Rogers &amp; Croft, <xref rid="msb209524-bib-0036" ref-type="ref">1999</xref>; Lever <italic>et al</italic>, <xref rid="msb209524-bib-0020" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>).</p>

      <p>To explore the molecular mechanisms by which ITSN2 regulates T‐cell functions, we stimulated <italic>Egfp</italic>‐ and <italic>Itsn2</italic>‐targeted T cells with N4‐laden pMHC‐I tetramers and analyzed the phosphorylation of TCR downstream effectors by immunoblot and single‐cell mass cytometry. Short‐time stimulations induced a similar magnitude of total tyrosine phosphorylation and phosphorylation of ZAP70, CBL, AKT, and ERK molecules in both control and <italic>Itsn2‐</italic>targeted cells (Fig <xref rid="msb209524-fig-0006" ref-type="fig">6</xref>A). Moreover, no significant difference was observed with the mass cytometry analysis covering a larger panel of proteins and phosphoproteins (Fig <xref rid="msb209524-fig-0006" ref-type="fig">6</xref>B and <xref rid="msb209524-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">Appendix Fig S1A</xref>). The normal early signaling events but dysregulated proliferation and cytokine secretion in ITSN2‐targeted T cells suggested that signaling differences could emerge on longer time scales. Since ITSN2 has been reported to regulate endocytosis, we tested the impact of its deficiency on cell‐surface TCR levels (McGavin <italic>et al</italic>, <xref rid="msb209524-bib-0022" ref-type="ref">2001</xref>). Unstimulated sgITSN2‐treated CD8<sup>+</sup> OT‐I T cells displayed comparable amounts of surface TCR to those of control cells (Fig <xref rid="msb209524-fig-0006" ref-type="fig">6</xref>C and <xref rid="msb209524-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">Appendix Fig S1B</xref>). However, incubation of cells with increasing doses of N4 peptide for 2 and 4 h showed a reduced TCR down‐modulation in ITSN2‐targeted cells compared with control cells (Fig <xref rid="msb209524-fig-0006" ref-type="fig">6</xref>C and <xref rid="msb209524-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">Appendix Fig S1B</xref>). Accordingly, further analysis of phosphoproteins by mass and flow cytometry after a prolonged stimulation revealed a sustained and enhanced activity of different signaling pathways in ITSN2‐targeted T cells, with a predominant impact on molecules involved in the ERK1/2 signaling axis (Fig <xref rid="msb209524-fig-0006" ref-type="fig">6</xref>D and <xref rid="msb209524-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">Appendix Fig S1C</xref>). Altogether, these results demonstrate that ITSN2 plays a critical role in the regulation of the T‐cell effector functions by controlling stimulation‐dependent TCR internalization.</p>

    <title>Discussion</title>
    <p>Pioneering phosphoproteomic studies have identified molecular events induced by receptor ligation (Nguyen <italic>et al</italic>, <xref rid="msb209524-bib-0026" ref-type="ref">2009</xref>; Brockmeyer <italic>et al</italic>, <xref rid="msb209524-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>; Humphrey <italic>et al</italic>, <xref rid="msb209524-bib-0016" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>; Navarro <italic>et al</italic>, <xref rid="msb209524-bib-0024" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>). LymphoAtlas complements these studies by focusing for the first time on early phosphorylation events triggered by receptor ligation in primary cells. This study provides a time‐resolved, quantitative atlas of protein phosphorylations before and during the first 10 min of TCR stimulation. We quantified and determined the relative changes in phosphorylation on 7,180 sites (unique sites plus combination of sites quantified together on the same peptides) corresponding to more than 2,000 proteins. A number of these phosphosites (1,777 out of 7,180) were not reported in previous studies, thus highlighting the deep coverage of this data set. By specifically enriching pY‐bearing peptides, we quantified the phosphorylation of 349 phosphotyrosine sites, thereby providing the largest collection of such sites in primary T cells. Analyzing phosphorylation kinetics in the course of TCR stimulation, we identified 731 phosphosites that significantly varied upon TCR engagement.</p>
    <p>Analysis of our time‐resolved data set revealed a coordinated and chronological induction of essential biological processes that constitute the first steps of T‐cell activation. In particular, it suggested a more rapid mobilization of the effectors involved in the cytoskeleton remodeling, transcription, translation, and metabolic processes than initially thought. For example, the phosphorylation of Foxo3‐S252 involved in its nuclear export (Brunet <italic>et al</italic>, <xref rid="msb209524-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">1999</xref>) was induced as early as 15 s after TCR stimulation. Interestingly, although we observed that tyrosine residue phosphorylations were mainly transient, very early events such as the phosphorylation of the TCR complex CD3 chains persisted over the entire course of stimulation. The kinase activities of ZAP70 and LCK/FYN began to decrease 2 min after stimulation, which could support the model where binding of ZAP70 to the TCR ITAMs prevents their access to phosphatases, and their dephosphorylation (Labadia <italic>et al</italic>, <xref rid="msb209524-bib-0019" ref-type="ref">1996</xref>; Sjolin‐Goodfellow <italic>et al</italic>, <xref rid="msb209524-bib-0043" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>).</p>
    <p>One of the most challenging issues in studies generating high‐throughput data is to validate relevant biological hypothesis inferred by computational approaches. Here, using a fast‐track CRISPR/Cas9 gene‐editing system in primary cells, we assessed the function of selected components of the TCR signaling network in a particular transgenic background and independently of potential effects of gene deletion during T‐cell development and selection. Such an approach was conducted for the <italic>Itsn2</italic> gene and revealed that the corresponding coding protein plays an essential role through regulating TCR down‐modulation upon engagement. Consistently, prolonged TCR expression resulted in sustained TCR signaling, as demonstrated by enhanced activation of the ERK1/2 pathway. Although the precise mechanism by which ITSN2 regulates TCR surface expression remains to be determined, several prospective lines can be investigated. We previously showed that ITSN2 constitutively interacts with CBL and in a TCR‐inducible manner with CBL‐B (Voisinne <italic>et al</italic>, <xref rid="msb209524-bib-0046" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>). Among interaction partners shared by CBL and CBL‐B, other proteins with similar interaction dynamics, such as EPS15L1 and SH3KBP1 (also CIN85), have been reported as molecular partners of ITSN molecules (Nikolaienko <italic>et al</italic>, <xref rid="msb209524-bib-0028" ref-type="ref">2009</xref>; Wong <italic>et al</italic>, <xref rid="msb209524-bib-0048" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>). Interestingly, all these proteins are components of the endocytic machinery present in various cell types. Thus, it has been proposed that ITSNs could act as stabilizing scaffolds for the recruitment of endocytic proteins to the surface receptor activation sites. Such molecular cooperativity has been illustrated with ITSN1 that promotes CBL ubiquitin ligase activity, thereby enhancing EGFR ubiquitination and internalization (Martin <italic>et al</italic>, <xref rid="msb209524-bib-0021" ref-type="ref">2006</xref>; Okur <italic>et al</italic>, <xref rid="msb209524-bib-0030" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>). In lymphocytes, past studies have shown that CBL and CBL‐B have redundant functions in peripheral T cells and are required to promote ligand‐induced TCR down‐modulation (Naramura <italic>et al</italic>, <xref rid="msb209524-bib-0023" ref-type="ref">2002</xref>). Therefore, it is possible that a similar mechanism to the one at play during EGFR internalization involving the formation of endocytic vesicles composed of EPS15L1, SH3KBP1, CBLs, and ITSN2 might account for TCR down‐modulation at the T‐cell surface following TCR engagement.</p>
    <p>LymphoAtlas is a unique resource to explore the phosphorylation events underlying TCR signaling initiation in primary T cells. To facilitate the exploration of this data set by the scientific community, a Web application that interactively displays phosphorylation kinetics of selected sites from the LymphoAtlas database is available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://bmm-lab.github.io/LymphoAtlas/">https://bmm-lab.github.io/LymphoAtlas/</ext-link> (see also <xref rid="msb209524-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">Appendix Fig S2</xref>). By quantitatively capturing changes in phosphorylation dynamics, LymphoAtlas provides a rationale to the identification of therapeutic targets to advance immunotherapies based on T‐cell reprogramming. Finally, the approach developed here lays the foundation for further systematic explorations of dysregulated signaling networks underlying diseases or resulting from molecular perturbations or gene inactivation in genetically engineered mice.</p>

      <p>Peptides and phosphopeptides were analyzed by nano‐LC‐MS/MS using an UltiMate 3000 RSLCnano system (Dionex, Amsterdam, The Netherlands) coupled to a Q‐Exactive Plus mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific, Bremen, Germany). Dried samples were resuspended in 5% acetonitrile, 0.05% TFA spiked‐in with iRT standard peptides (Biognosys) (1× final concentration of iRT in the case of pre‐enriched peptides and TiO<sub>2</sub>‐enriched phosphopeptides; 0.1× final in the case of pY‐enriched peptides). Pre‐enriched peptides were resuspended at a theoretical concentration of 5 μg/μl according to initial protein assay, and 1 μl of sample was injected for each LC‐MS analysis. Phospho‐enriched peptides (pY and TiO2) were resuspended in 21 μl of solvent, and 5 μl of sample was injected for each LC‐MS analysis. Samples were loaded onto a C18 precolumn (300 μm inner diameter × 5 mm, Dionex) at 20 μl/min in 5% acetonitrile, 0.05% TFA. After 5 min of desalting, the precolumn was switched online with a 75 μm inner diameter × 50 cm C18 column (in‐house packed with Reprosil C18‐AQ Pur 3 μm resin, Dr. Maisch; Proxeon Biosystems, Odense, Denmark) equilibrated in 95% solvent A (0.2% formic acid) and 5% solvent B (80% acetonitrile, 0.2% formic acid). The pre‐enriched peptides and TiO<sub>2</sub>‐enriched phosphopeptide samples were eluted at 300 nl/min flow rate using a 240 min gradient of solvent B (4–12% in 44 min, 12–30% in 184 min, 30–40% in 12 min). The pY‐enriched peptides were eluted at 300 nl/min flow rate using a 110‐min gradient of solvent B (5% to 25% in 80 min, 25% to 50% in 30 min). The mass spectrometer was operated in data‐dependent acquisition mode with the XCalibur software. The survey MS scans were acquired in the Orbitrap over m/z 400–1,600 with a resolution of 70,000 (at 200 m/z), an automatic gain control (AGC) target value of 1e<sup>6</sup>, and a maximum injection time of 200 ms. The 10 most intense ions per survey scan were selected at 3 m/z and fragmented by higher‐energy collisional dissociation (HCD) using a normalized collision energy of 30. MS/MS scans were collected at 17,500 resolution with an AGC target value of 1e<sup>5</sup> and a maximum injection time of 50 ms for peptide and TiO<sub>2</sub>‐enriched phosphopeptide samples, and an AGC target value of 1e<sup>6</sup> and a maximum injection time of 250 ms for pY‐enriched samples. A dynamic exclusion of 30 s was applied, and the “peptide match” option was set to “Preferred”. For internal calibration, the m/z 445.120025 ion was used as lock mass.</p>

The search included methionine oxidation, protein N‐terminal acetylation, and serine, threonine, and tyrosine phosphorylation as variable modifications, and carbamidomethylation of cysteines as a fixed modification. Specificity of trypsin digestion was set for cleavage after lysine or arginine, and three missed cleavages were allowed. The precursor mass tolerance was set to 20 ppm for the first search and 4.5 ppm for the main Andromeda database search, and the mass tolerance in MS/MS mode was set to 25 mmu. Validation was performed through a false discovery rate set to 1% at protein and peptide‐spectrum match (PSM) level determined by target‐decoy search in MaxQuant (with additional filters for peptide validation: minimum length of 6 amino acids and a minimum Andromeda score of 40 for modified peptides). MaxQuant processing of files from phosphorylated peptides was performed independently for each enrichment step (TiO<sub>2</sub>, pY‐IP) and each biological series of experiment (replicates 1–4), with the “match between runs” option of MaxQuant enabled for label‐free relative quantification of peptide ions across stimulation time points and injection replicates.

      <p>Antibody‐based TCR stimulation of primary mouse CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells was repeated four independent times with distinct pools of mice.

N4‐based TCR stimulation of OT1 CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells was repeated three independent times with distinct pools of mice. For each condition (experiment, time point after stimulation, sample type), three MS injection replicates were performed, leading to 108 raw files considered for statistical analysis.

The quantitative proteomic analysis was performed using the statistical package R (R Development Core Team, 2012; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.R-project.org/">http://www.R-project.org/</ext-link>) and R scripts related to the analysis can be found online: The antibody‐based stimulation of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells can be found on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/mlocardpaulet/TCR_ABStim2018">https://github.com/mlocardpaulet/TCR_ABStim2018</ext-link>; the N4 stimulation of OT1 CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://zenodo.org">https://zenodo.org</ext-link> with the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3556731">https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3556731</ext-link>; and the source code of the shiny‐web application on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/mlocardpaulet/LymphoAtlas_App">https://github.com/mlocardpaulet/LymphoAtlas_App</ext-link>. Phosphorylation site relative quantification was performed independently on the TiO<sub>2</sub> and the phosphotyrosine IP samples with the intensities of the “Phospho (STY).txt” tables of MaxQuant. We treated independently the quantification values from mono‐ and multi‐phosphorylated peptides in order to discriminate their regulation patterns upon TCR signaling. Intensities were first normalized for instrument variation using the MS intensities of the iRT spiked‐in standards. Protein entries identified as potential contaminants by MaxQuant were eliminated from the analysis, as well as PSM with a PEP value &gt; 0.01. Log<sub>2</sub>‐transformed values of technical replicates were averaged, and missing values were replaced as follows: If for a given condition (time point), a phosphorylation site was not quantified in any replicate experiment or quantified in only one of the replicates, missing values for that condition were imputed with a low‐intensity value, obtained from a draw around the 5% quantile, and the standard deviation of the entire data set. At this stage, only the phosphosites with a localization score ≥ 75% in a minimum of one replicate were kept, and the phosphoserines and phosphothreonines were removed from the phosphotyrosine IP samples. Conversely, the phosphotyrosines quantified in the pY‐IP were removed from the TiO<sub>2</sub> data set. Moreover, for statistical analysis, phosphosites with high numbers of missing values were not considered: Only phosphorylation sites that were detected in at least 3 conditions (time points), and presenting in each of them a minimum of two quantification values from independent replicate experiments, were retained. For those, kinetics were normalized between biological replicates before being subjected to an ANOVA with Tukey's correction. To avoid biases coming from the random draw of replacement values, this statistical process was performed 200 independent times and phosphosites were considered statistically significant if they presented a p‐value of the ANOVA ≤ 0.05 and a minimum of one couple of time points with more than 2 points per condition and a corrected <italic>P</italic>‐value ≤ 0.05 with an associated absolute fold change &gt; 1.75 in a minimum of 90% of the iterations. Protein relative quantification was performed in a similar way with the normalized LFQ intensities from the “proteinGroups.txt” table of MaxQuant. Proteins identified with &lt; 2 unique peptides were removed from the analysis.</p>

For flow cytometry experiments and cell proliferation analyses, statistical significances were calculated using two‐sided paired Welch Student's <italic>t</italic>‐test. t‐SNE analysis was performed on means of intensities of phosphosites that were calculated between biological replicates and scaled by the maximal value observed over the course of TCR stimulation. Determination of the clusters was performed with the ClusterX function with default parameters from the R package ClusterX (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/JinmiaoChenLab/ClusterX">https://github.com/JinmiaoChenLab/ClusterX</ext-link>) based on Rodriguez <italic>et al</italic>'s algorithm (Rodriguez &amp; Laio, <xref rid="msb209524-bib-0035" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>).
