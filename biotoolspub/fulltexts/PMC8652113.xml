    <title>1 Introduction</title>
    <p>Personalized therapy has revolutionized clinical treatment of cancer. Many high-throughput functional screening studies have been performed in search of subtype-specific vulnerabilities—pharmacogenomics screenings for new agents and gene dependency screenings for new targets. The consistency among data generated from these screens has been a hot topic of interest with sometimes inconsistent findings from different assessments (<xref rid="btab423-B6" ref-type="bibr">Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia and Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer, 2015</xref>; <xref rid="btab423-B9" ref-type="bibr">Dempster <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2019</xref>; <xref rid="btab423-B13" ref-type="bibr">Haibe-Kains <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="btab423-B15" ref-type="bibr">Haverty <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>; <xref rid="btab423-B22" ref-type="bibr">Morgens <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>; <xref rid="btab423-B27" ref-type="bibr">Safikhani <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>). All of these reproducibility assessments performed to-date only examined two datasets at a time and conclusions of consistency were often based on a limited set of carefully selected features. It is important to realize that in the broad distribution of consistency measures, poor concordance can still be observed for a large part of the data even when selected features are highly consistent. Such discordance may arise from variations in experimental design or result from the lack of differential sensitivity among the cell lines. For researchers interested in a specific compound or gene, it has been a daunting task to identify relevant information about data consistency from the existing screens. To enable efficient re-use of these valuable datasets, we have assembled nine pharmacogenomics screening datasets and three gene essentiality screening datasets and have derived consistency measures on a per-feature basis. We also developed a user-friendly web application for result retrieval and visualization.</p>

    <title>2 Materials and methods</title>
    <sec>
      <title>2.1 Compound sensitivity data download and processing</title>
      <p>‘NCI60’ compound sensitivity screening data was downloaded from <ext-link xlink:href="https://discover.nci.nih.gov/cellminer/loadDownload.do" ext-link-type="uri">https://discover.nci.nih.gov/cellminer/loadDownload.do</ext-link>, the CellMiner website (<xref rid="btab423-B26" ref-type="bibr">Reinhold <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>) as ‘DTP_NCI60_ZSCORE.xlsx’ on August 15, 2020. Cell lines ADR-RES, MDA-N were removed due to contamination as noted by cell line database Cellosaurus (<xref rid="btab423-B2" ref-type="bibr">Bairoch, 2018</xref>). Some cell line names were manually corrected to match names used in other datasets. For example, ‘786O’ (last character being letter ‘O’) was changed to ‘7860’ (last character being number ‘0’). ‘CCLE’ compound sensitivity screening (<xref rid="btab423-B3" ref-type="bibr">Barretina <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>) data was downloaded from the DepMap portal as ‘CCLE_NP24.2009_Drug_data_2015.02.24.csv’. The associated annotation file was downloaded as ‘CCLE_NP24.2009_profiling_2012.02.20.csv’. ‘GDSC’ compound sensitivity screening (<xref rid="btab423-B16" ref-type="bibr">Iorio <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>; <xref rid="btab423-B23" ref-type="bibr">Picco <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2019</xref>) data ‘sanger-dose-response.csv’ (Release 8.1, October 2019) was downloaded on November 27, 2020 from the DepMap portal. Duplicated AUC data from GDSC1 and GDSC2 for the same cell line and same compound were averaged. CCLE_ID was mapped from DepMap_ID based on ‘sample_info.csv’ downloaded from 20Q2 data release. The associated annotation file was downloaded as ‘screened_compounds_rel_8.0.csv’ on August 12, 2019. ‘CTRP’ compound sensitivity screening (<xref rid="btab423-B30" ref-type="bibr">Seashore-Ludlow <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>) data was downloaded from the DepMap portal as ‘v20.data.curves_post_qc.txt’ extracted from ‘<ext-link xlink:href="http://ctrpv2.0_2015_ctd2_expandeddataset.zip" ext-link-type="uri">http://ctrpv2.0_2015_ctd2_expandeddataset.zip</ext-link>’, ‘v20.meta.per_compound.txt’ was used as compound annotation. Replicate data for the same cell lines were averaged. Majority of the cell line names were replaced by matching CCLE_ID. The remaining cell lines were renamed with the CCLE_ID naming convention in NAME_DISEASE format. PRISM compound sensitivity screening (<xref rid="btab423-B8" ref-type="bibr">Corsello <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2020</xref>) datasets were downloaded from the DepMap portal 19Q4 release. For ‘PRISM_1ST’ (the primary screen), the compound sensitivity data was downloaded as ‘primary-screen-replicate-collapsed-logfold-change.csv’. Compound annotation was downloaded as ‘primary-screen-replicate-collapsed-treatment-info.csv’. For ‘PRISM_2nd’ (the secondary screen), the compound sensitivity data was downloaded as ‘secondary-screen-dose-response-curve-parameters.csv’. Compound annotation was downloaded as ‘secondary-screen-replicate-collapsed-treatment-info.csv’. ‘POPS’ data was previously published (<xref rid="btab423-B21" ref-type="bibr">McMillan <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2018</xref>) as Supplementary Table ‘table6_chemical_screen_data.xlsx’. ‘ChenNSCLC’ data was previously published (<xref rid="btab423-B7" ref-type="bibr">Chen <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2019</xref>) as Supplementary Table ‘S4_NSCLC_data’. ‘PolleySCLC’ data (<xref rid="btab423-B24" ref-type="bibr">Polley <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>) was downloaded as ‘data_nciSclc_act.txt’ from <ext-link xlink:href="https://discover.nci.nih.gov/SclcCellMinerCDB/" ext-link-type="uri">https://discover.nci.nih.gov/SclcCellMinerCDB/</ext-link> (<xref rid="btab423-B35" ref-type="bibr">Tlemsani <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2020</xref>). Compound annotation was downloaded as ‘Table_Drugs_Synonyms_cdb.txt’.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec>
      <title>2.2 Compound name mapping</title>
      <p>R package ‘webchem’ was used to query PubChem (<xref rid="btab423-B17" ref-type="bibr">Kim <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>) for mapping compounds to PubChem IDs. For each dataset, compound names and all associated synonyms (if available) were used for mapping first, then SMILES strings were used for mapping the remaining unmapped compounds. For the NCI60 compounds that still failed to map, Substance IDs were used to query PubChem for matching PubChemIDs. After queries were made for all compound sensitivity datasets, the results were combined to identify groups of compound annotation entries with shared compound names or PubChemIDs. For each of these groups, the most frequent compound name and PubChemID were chosen to represent the other members of the group. The compound names in each dataset were then updated with the new representative compound names. Compound with more than one records has ‘(n)’ appended to its name for each record. The original names used for the compound and the associated annotations were still retained in the metadata file for each compound sensitivity datasets.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec>
      <title>2.3 Cell line name mapping</title>
      <p>For datasets downloaded from DepMap, RRID provided from the metadata table was used. For other datasets without RRIDs in the metadata, RRIDs and disease were retrieved from the Cellosaurus API(<xref rid="btab423-B2" ref-type="bibr">Bairoch, 2018</xref>) through queries and data conversion using R packages ‘httr’ and ‘jsonlite’. Disease status annotated by Cellosaurus were matched to cancer lineage defined by DepMap and appended to the cell line name. Groups of cell line synonyms matched to the same RRID were identified and replaced with a unique cell line name.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec>
      <title>2.4 Gene dependency data download and processing</title>
      <p>Gene dependency data were all downloaded from the DepMap portal. RNAi gene dependency data ‘demeter’ was downloaded as ‘D2_combined_gene_dep_scores.csv’ from DEMETER2 Data v6 (<xref rid="btab423-B20" ref-type="bibr">McFarland <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2018</xref>), CRISPR gene dependency data ‘achilles’ was downloaded as ‘Achilles_gene_effect.csv’ from the 20Q4 data release (2020), ‘sanger’ was downloaded as ‘gene_effect.csv’ (2019).</p>
    </sec>
    <sec>
      <title>2.5 Generation of consistency measure ‘r.summary’</title>
      <p>We filtered out pairwise correlations from less than 10 cell lines. For compound screening datasets that have within-study replicates, when multiple pairwise inter-study correlations are available for a specific study pair, z-score transformation is applied and only the correlation corresponding to the largest z-score is retained. After this filtering, if there is only one pair of correlation left, this is used as the r.summary; otherwise meta-analysis is performed with R package ‘metacor’ to implement the DerSimonian-Laird (DSL) random-effect meta-analytical approach with correlation coefficients as effect sizes, as described by <xref rid="btab423-B29" ref-type="bibr">Schulze (2004)</xref>. For indirect consistency assessment, while a secondary correlation calculation was performed for two sets of compound/gene feature-versus-transcriptome correlation coefficients from the paired studies, instead of using the number of genes from the transcriptome as the sample size for meta-analysis input, we used the number of overlapping cell lines from the dataset pair with transcriptomic data available as the substitute sample size so that the weight for the random effect model would be similar to the direct assessment.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec>
      <title>2.6 Bimodal distribution determination</title>
      <p>To dichotomize samples into two groups, R package ‘mclust’ was use to implement Gaussian mixture modeling with assumption of two clusters with equal variance. Bimodal index (BI) is determined for the same model, following the method described by <xref rid="btab423-B36" ref-type="bibr">Wang <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> (2009)</xref>. A higher BI value is indicative of a stronger bimodal distribution.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec>
      <title>2.7 Determination of drug market status</title>
      <p>We performed literature search and found WITHDRAWN—a database of withdrawn and discontinued drugs (<xref rid="btab423-B31" ref-type="bibr">Siramshetty <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>). We downloaded lists of 270 ‘withdrawn’ compounds and 308 ‘discontinued’ compounds from with WITHDRAWN web page. According to WITHDRAWN, ‘withdrawn’ drugs are those recalled from market in at least one country due to toxic/side effects whereas ‘discontinued’ drugs are those recalled due to reasons other than safety, such as ineffectiveness of drug. 44 of the withdrawn and 45 of the discontinued compounds could be found in our summary consistency measure table. For all the remaining drugs, we used the drug group annotation from DrugBank (<xref rid="btab423-B37" ref-type="bibr">Wishart <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). We excluded compounds with missing annotation or with annotations as ‘vet_approved’ or ‘nutraceutical’, and we combined ‘experimental’ and ‘investigational’ into one group.</p>

From the expression data, genes with variance of zero were removed from the dataset. As the standard method, only RNA-seq data was used; to apply the GRACE method as we previously described (<xref rid="btab423-B5" ref-type="bibr">Cai <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>), for every gene we use the copy number as the predictor variable and the RNA-seq gene expression as the response variable to fit a linear regression model. The residuals from the resulting fit were saved as copy number-adjusted gene expression data. For each indirect assessment, we first computed the Pearson correlation coefficients between the functional data features and the expression data for each dataset, and then for each pair of datasets, we performed correlation of the previously computed correlation coefficients to get a single correlation coefficient for each functional data feature.</p>

      <p>A schematic diagram that summarizes the work in this study is provided as <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S1</xref>. To begin, we collected nine compound screening datasets and three dependency datasets for analyses. Among the compound screening datasets, ‘CCLE’ (<xref rid="btab423-B3" ref-type="bibr">Barretina <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>), ‘CTRP’ (<xref rid="btab423-B4" ref-type="bibr">Basu <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>), ‘GDSC’ (<xref rid="btab423-B16" ref-type="bibr">Iorio <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>), ‘NCI-60’ (<xref rid="btab423-B26" ref-type="bibr">Reinhold <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>), ‘PRISM_1st’ and ‘PRISM_2nd’ (<xref rid="btab423-B8" ref-type="bibr">Corsello <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2020</xref>) are pan-cancer screens. The remaining compound screening datasets are specific for lung cancer cell lines: ‘POPS’ (<xref rid="btab423-B21" ref-type="bibr">McMillan <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2018</xref>) is a high-throughput screening (HTS) dataset for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines; ‘PolleySCLC’ (<xref rid="btab423-B24" ref-type="bibr">Polley <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>) is an HTS dataset for small cell lung cancer (SCLC) cell lines; ‘ChenNSCLC’ (<xref rid="btab423-B7" ref-type="bibr">Chen <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2019</xref>) is a dataset from manual screening of NSCLC cell lines. As summarized in <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table S1</xref>, while multiple measures are often available from a screen, we used the area under the dose response curve (AUC) whenever possible. There are generally fewer missing values with AUC data as it does not require extrapolation and can always be estimated from the dose-response curve. It has also been shown that better agreement is observed between datasets from AUC-based correlation compared to that from IC50 (<xref rid="btab423-B13" ref-type="bibr">Haibe-Kains <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). As indicated in <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table S1</xref>, we processed the datasets to make the lower value in each dataset always correspond to higher sensitivity. For the compound screening datasets, we identified the corresponding PubChem IDs (see material and methods) for each compound. The map rates for the nine datasets are between 80% and 100% (<xref rid="btab423-F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>). For dependency datasets, unique gene symbols were used as feature names. We also mapped the cell lines to Research Resource Identifiers (RRID) from cell line database Cellosaurus (<xref rid="btab423-B2" ref-type="bibr">Bairoch, 2018</xref>) and derived names with lineage suffix (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table S2</xref>). These standardization procedures allow us to maximize the identification of overlapping compounds and cell lines across datasets (<xref rid="btab423-F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>).</p>

      <title>3.2 Compound screening data consistency is stable from intra-study and inter-study measures</title>
      <p>Several compound screening datasets contain replicate measures for the same drug. We identified these replicates and assessed within-study consistency. As expected, the pairwise correlation from these replicates are generally more positive than all other pairwise correlations from the same dataset (<xref rid="btab423-F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>). We then assessed inter-study consistency by pairing all possible studies and performed correlation of functional data with the shared cell lines. Generally positive correlations were observed for all pairs of studies (<xref rid="btab423-F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>). However, for both intra-study and inter-study assessments, we observed that some compounds are always more consistent than others. We highlighted the EGFR inhibitor ‘Erlotinib’ as a more consistent example and c-Met inhibitor ‘PHA-665752’ as a less consistent example. For each example compound, similar degrees of consistency were seen across all pairwise assessments (<xref rid="btab423-F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref> and d and <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. S2a</xref> and b). Using meta-analysis of the Pearson correlation coefficients, we generated ‘r.summary’ values for 1707 compounds that were found in at least two datasets (<xref rid="btab423-F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2e</xref>). Erlotinib has an r.summary of 0.62, at the 98th percentile ranked by consistency, whereas PHA-665752 has an r.summary of 0.1 at the 40<sup>th</sup> percentile. We further compared the ‘r.summary’ from inter-study assessments to that from intra-study assessments on 384 compounds and observed good agreement (<xref rid="btab423-F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2f</xref>). These findings suggest the degree of consistency is rather stable for compound screening data.</p>

      <title>3.3 Perturbations against functionally important targets result in more bimodally distributed data and better consistency across studies</title>
      <p>We next examined gene dependency data. Replicates are not available from such studies, so we only examined inter-study consistency. We made the assessment separately for a group of cancer driver genes annotated as oncogenes by the COSMIC Cancer Gene Census (<xref rid="btab423-B32" ref-type="bibr">Sondka <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2018</xref>) versus all other genes. Consistency for these cancer genes is generally higher than the remaining genes (<xref rid="btab423-F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>). We examined the distribution of dependency scores for the top 10 most consistent cancer genes in all three datasets and observed skewed and bimodal distribution (<xref rid="btab423-F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>). In contrast, with the same kind of assessment for 10 inconsistent genes that do not belong to the oncogene panel, we did not observe such distribution (<xref rid="btab423-F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c</xref>). We reasoned that in functionally relevant subsets of cancer cell lines defined by a particular oncogenic driver, functional perturbation with drug or gene silencing against that pathway should result in biomodally distributed data. We derived the bimodal index (BI) as previously defined (<xref rid="btab423-B36" ref-type="bibr">Wang <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>), for all genes in each datasets to represent the level of bimodal distribution. The relationship between inter-data consistency and bimodal distribution were assessed and comparison was made between cancer genes and the rest of the genes (<xref rid="btab423-F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3d</xref>). We observed a positive correlation between the consistency measure ‘r.summary’ and bimodal indices from each of the three datasets, and these associations are more prominent for the cancer genes. Agreements among the bimodal indices from different datasets were also stronger for cancer genes (<xref rid="btab423-F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3d</xref>). Similar relationships were observed for compound screening datasets as well (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. S3a</xref>). In particular, in the dataset ‘PRISM_1st’ where compound annotations by disease area were available, we further compared the relationship in oncology drugs and non-oncology drugs. The data for oncology drugs were found to be more consistent with the other datasets and also more bimodally distributed (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. S3b</xref> and <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">c</xref>). These observations suggest that in functional screens, chemical or genetic perturbation of functionally important targets often result in bimodally distributed data and are more likely to be consistent across different studies. To see if the degree of consistency also associates with success rate of the drug, we also examined the compound consistency by market status (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. S3d</xref>). Lower ‘r.summary’ was observed for compounds that were withdrawn or discontinued from the market, compared to those in the ‘approved’, ‘experimental’ or ‘investigation’ status (<xref rid="btab423-B31" ref-type="bibr">Siramshetty <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>; <xref rid="btab423-B37" ref-type="bibr">Wishart <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>).</p>

      <title>3.4 Transcriptomic association-based correlation provides a useful indirect assessment of functional data consistency</title>
      <p>Having performed direct assessments by correlating response measurements from datasets, we also conducted indirect assessments by first deriving correlation between gene expression and functional screening data, then correlating the resulting correlation coefficients for all the genes, between pairs of datasets. This was performed with two methods, a standard approach using only the gene expression data and a copy number-adjusted gene expression data. We previously demonstrated that this ‘genomic regression analysis of coordinated expression’ (GRACE) denoising approach improves association analyses involving cancer transcriptomic data (<xref rid="btab423-B5" ref-type="bibr">Cai <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>). In the analysis for the compound sensitivity screening datasets, we found that in some cases, indirect assessments resulted in better agreement than direct assessments, and such improvement is more dramatic by the GRACE method compared to the standard method (<xref rid="btab423-F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref>). For example, vorinostat, a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor clinically used to treat cutaneous T-cell lymphoma has an r.summary of 0.37 from direct correlations, whereas this value increases to 0.56 from GRACE indirect correlations (<xref rid="btab423-F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b and c</xref>). In particular, the correlation between CTRP and GDSC datasets increased from 0.59 to 0.97. It turns out that CTRP and GDSC are the only two studies that have screened a large number of leukemia cell lines for sensitivity against vorinostat (<xref rid="btab423-F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4d</xref>), and these cell lines of hematopoietic lineage were consistently sensitive in both screens (<xref rid="btab423-F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4e</xref>). The association between vorinostat and gene expression from CTRP and GDSC are highly consistent, likely explained by the robust association between drug sensitivity and to lineage-specific gene expression patterns (<xref rid="btab423-F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4f</xref>).</p>

      <title>3.5 A Functional data consistency explorer</title>
      <p>We constructed a web application, ‘Functional Data Consistency Explorer’ (FDCE, at <ext-link xlink:href="https://lccl.shinyapps.io/FDCE/" ext-link-type="uri">https://lccl.shinyapps.io/FDCE/</ext-link>), to provide tools for users to assess data consistency on a per-feature basis. Tutorial slides are provided to introduce users to the three main functions of the app—‘Overall Consistency’ for reviewing the consistency measures we derived with global and feature-specific views; ‘Pairwise Scatterplots’ for reviewing the actual pairwise relationship between datasets; and ‘Datasets’ for view and downloading data and metadata used in this study.</p>
      <p>In the ‘Overall Consistency’ page, users can examine and download the overall consistency results for 1707 compounds across 9 compound screening datasets or 17 966 genes across 3 dependency screening datasets, with both the direct and indirect assessments we described in this paper (<xref rid="btab423-F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). As an example to showcase the web application, we highlight vorinostat (as examined in <xref rid="btab423-F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a–f</xref>). Upon submission of this feature of interest, and specification of the type of input correlation for meta-analysis, the density plots are updated to mark the vorinostat inter-study correlation coefficients. This also generates a forest plot from meta-analysis and pulls out a table to display all inter-study pairwise correlations for this feature. Along with this example, we also examined belinostat, a compound with similar mechanism of actions (moa) (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. S4a</xref>). Similar degree of consistency could be found for bellinostat, and like vorinostat, between CTRP and GDSC datasets, the indirect correlation is also much higher than direct correlation. Similar analyses could also be performed for dependency screening results, as shown in <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S4b</xref>.</p>

Under the ‘Overall Consistency’ tab panel, users may choose to assess data consistency for compound or dependency screening data. Both distribution of direct and indirect (by GRACE method) assessment results are visualized. The top density plot panel represents distribution of ‘r.summary’, summarized from all inter-study correlations, whereas the bottom panel with multiple subplots visualizes distribution for each study pair. Upon submission of a feature to highlight and specification of the type of input pairwise correlation for meta-analysis, the datapoints corresponding to the inter-study correlation coefficients associated with the feature of interest are added to the plots and a forest plot showing results from meta-analysis will be shown below. On the right side of the web page, the top table lists the consistency summary statistics for all overlapping features across the dataset, as well as additional information about the features. Left of the table are column options for display. In this particular table, as vorinostat is a HDAC inhibitor, we checked to display the ‘moa’ and searched ‘chromatin’ as a keyword to identify additional compounds with similar moa. The bottom table contains pairwise correlation results for all study pairs specific to the feature of interest and is only rendered when user submits a feature to highlight. Annotations for column names in overall consistency table for drug screening data: ‘target’, the drug target; ‘target.source’, the source of ‘target’ annotation; ‘moa’, mechanism of drug action; ‘moa.source’, source of ‘moa’ annotation; the ‘direct’ statistics are from direct correlations of functional screening data; the ‘indirect’ statistics are from correlations of correlations between copy number-adjusted gene expression data and functional screening data; ‘pairs’ refer to the number of dataset pairs for which correlation was calculated; ‘meta-analysis’ indicates whether the feature-specific statistics is based on meta-analysis. Annotations for column names in pairwise consistency table for a specific drug: ‘cid’, PubChem ID; ‘unique_Drug_Name.1’ or ‘unique_Drug_Name.2’, compound name used for ‘dat1’ or ‘dat2’, note that when replicates exist for the same study, these names will end with ‘(n)’; ‘n.cell’, number of cell lines in the pairwise correlation; ‘n.feature’, number of features overlapping for the two datasets</p>

    <title>4 Discussion</title>
    <p>In this study, we integrated multiple functional screening datasets for assessment of consistency. Across datasets, we observed that some features are more consistent than others and that the degree of consistency is rather stable. There could be several underlying reasons for consistent inconsistency. Variations in experimental conditions, such as cell growth conditions or types of assays, are a common concern. In the case of compound screening, drug concentration ranges and definition of output measures could affect data reproducibility (<xref rid="btab423-B14" ref-type="bibr">Hatzis <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>). In the case of dependency screening, discordance could arise from differences in gene deactivation approach (RNAi versus CRISPR-Cas9) (<xref rid="btab423-B19" ref-type="bibr">Lin and Sheltzer, 2020</xref>), differences in sgRNA library and duration of the screen (<xref rid="btab423-B9" ref-type="bibr">Dempster <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2019</xref>). But we believe a key reason is that many targets are functionally unimportant, therefore many measurements are idiosyncratic within an individual experiment rather than true signals. This is supported by our observation that compound screening data are more consistent for oncology drugs and gene dependency screening data are more consistent for oncogenes. Therefore, for wet lab scientists who want to pursue a compound or gene of interest with functional studies, the degree of data consistency could help them gauge the necessity of careful assay optimization and the validity of the target itself in the in vitro setting. For dry lab scientists who devise algorithms to predict functional outcomes, the degree of data consistency could help set the expectation for prediction accuracy.</p>
    <p>In our compound screening dataset collection, we have three lung cancer-specific datasets and six pan-cancer datasets. This predominance is a result of the successful lung cancer cell line development and research efforts (<xref rid="btab423-B11" ref-type="bibr">Gazdar <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>) in confrontation with this most deadly cancer. In an attempt to evaluate data consistency in a lineage-specific manner, we found the consistency measures are inadvertently noisier for lineage-specific subsets compared to those from complete pan-cancer datasets, due to the much smaller sample size (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. S7</xref>). For this reason, we based our analyses on the full datasets.</p>
    <p>We also used the correlation between functional data and denoised gene expression data to derive indirect consistency measures. As gene expression data are often used for chemosensitivity prediction (<xref rid="btab423-B33" ref-type="bibr">Staunton <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>); and association between basal gene expression data and functional screening data can also elucidate the moa (<xref rid="btab423-B25" ref-type="bibr">Rees <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>), this indirect measure of consistency may help infer the likelihood of establishing successful predictive signatures or identification of bona fide mechanism of action. In addition, missing values are common in functional screening data. For certain features, this could result in a very small overlap of cell lines with direct measures. With gene expression data available for most of the cell lines used for functional screens, indirect assessment also partly alleviates this problem.</p>
    <p>In conclusion, assessment of data consistency should be made on a per-feature basis. We demonstrated the importance and feasibility of such approach and devised web tools for users to make such assessments and develop further insights.</p>
