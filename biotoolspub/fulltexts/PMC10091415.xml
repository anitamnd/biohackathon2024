      <p>Recently, cyclic peptides have been considered breakthrough
drugs
because they can interact with “undruggable” targets
such as intracellular protein–protein interactions. Membrane
permeability is an essential indicator of oral bioavailability and
intracellular targeting, and the development of membrane-permeable
peptides is a bottleneck in cyclic peptide drug discovery. Although
many experimental data on membrane permeability of cyclic peptides
have been reported, a comprehensive database is not yet available.
A comprehensive membrane permeability database is essential for developing
computational methods for cyclic peptide drug design. In this study,
we constructed CycPeptMPDB, the first web-accessible database of cyclic
peptide membrane permeability. We collected information on a total
of 7334 cyclic peptides, including the structure and experimentally
measured membrane permeability, from 45 published papers and 2 patents
from pharmaceutical companies. To unambiguously represent cyclic peptides
larger than small molecules, we used the hierarchical editing language
for macromolecules notation to generate a uniform sequence representation
of peptides. In addition to data storage, CycPeptMPDB provides several
supporting functions such as online data visualization, data analysis,
and downloading. CycPeptMPDB is expected to be a valuable platform
to support membrane permeability research on cyclic peptides. CycPeptMPDB
can be freely accessed at <uri xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="http://cycpeptmpdb.com">http://cycpeptmpdb.com</uri>.</p>

    <title>Introduction</title>
    <p>The average costs associated with developing
a new drug from discovery
to market far exceed one billion dollars, and the process can take
more than 12 years.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref></sup> One of the difficulties
is the decreasing number of targets for conventional small-molecule
and antibody drugs. It has been reported that approximately 80% of
all disease-relevant human proteins, including those involved in intracellular
protein–protein interactions (PPIs), cannot be tackled by conventional
small-molecule drugs and antibody drugs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref></sup> Cyclic peptides have recently emerged as a promising pharmaceutical
modality because they can access the targets which have traditionally
been considered “undruggable.” Cyclic peptides exhibit
several pharmacological characteristics that distinguish them from
other classes of therapeutic molecules.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref></sup> For example,
cyclic peptide drugs have a broader interaction surface than small-molecule
drugs and thus may function as inhibitors with high affinity and selectivity
for PPIs. Moreover, these drugs can be produced relatively inexpensively
compared to antibody drugs due to their synthetic accessibility. Previously,
cyclic peptide drugs were primarily natural peptides or mimics of
those peptides.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref></sup> The random nonstandard
peptides integrated discovery (RaPID) system has made it possible
to synthesize a large number of cyclic peptides from an extremely
diverse amino acid library and quickly select strong binders against
arbitrarily chosen therapeutic targets.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref></sup> Using this approach, numerous research teams and pharmaceutical
companies are actively engaged in cyclic peptide drug discovery. Currently,
at least one cyclic peptide is approved for clinical use every year
on average.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref></sup></p>
    <p>However, the cell membrane
permeabilities of common cyclic peptides
are lower than the desired range for drugs, which severely limits
their biological applicability.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref></sup> Cell membrane
permeability is one of the most important indicators for assessing
oral bioavailability and the possibility of intracellular targeting.
In general, relatively large cyclic peptides exceeding 10 amino acid
residues have high target affinity; however, they tend to have low
membrane permeability due to their large size. Although cyclic peptides
have a variety of membrane permeation mechanisms, passive diffusion
driven by differences in concentration is one of the most prevalent
mechanisms.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref></sup> Even for passive diffusion,
the process by which cyclic peptides permeate membranes is not well
understood. In contrast to linear peptides, many cyclic peptides have
an environment-dependent property called the “chameleonic”
property, namely, the ability to change their molecular conformation
and hydrophobicity in response to the surrounding environment. These
chameleonic cyclic peptides prefer an “open” conformation
in aqueous environments, where the polar groups are exposed to the
outside and interact with water molecules to enhance water solubility,
and a “closed” conformation in hydrophobic environments,
where the polar groups are shielded with intramolecular hydrogen bonds
or lipophilic side chains, leading to improved membrane permeability.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>−<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref></sup> Therefore, the most common strategy to increase membrane permeability
has been to allow cyclic peptides to have a “closed”
structure inside the cell membrane by shielding the exposed NH group
with backbone <italic>N</italic>-methylation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref></sup> In addition, some strategies have been tested to improve membrane
permeability by amide-to-ester substitution<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref></sup> or changing the structure of the side chain to form an intramolecular
hydrogen bond with the main chain.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref></sup></p>
    <p>In the early stages of drug development, it is important to select
candidate compounds with high membrane permeability; however, it is
a costly process to randomly measure large numbers of peptides using
biochemical assays such as the parallel artificial membrane permeability
assay (PAMPA). Hence, a rapid computational method for predicting
membrane permeability is required. Computational approaches for predicting
the permeability of cyclic peptides have primarily been developed
on the basis of molecular dynamics (MD) simulation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>−<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref></sup> Most MD research
involves identifying conformations in aqueous solutions or organic
solvents. Furthermore, there are complex studies simulating the membrane
permeation process of cyclic peptides across a lipid bilayer.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref></sup> Cyclic peptides tend to exist in various conformations, resulting
in slow conformational transitions relative to simulation time scales.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref></sup> As a result, many accelerated sampling techniques
have been used, such as replica exchange MD (REMD).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref></sup> In addition, analyzing simulation results by methods such
as Markov state models (MSMs) can provide information on the behavior
of cyclic peptides that are important for elucidating the mechanism
of membrane permeation and structural optimization to increase membrane
permeability.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref></sup> However, the computational
cost of the MD simulation method is still high.</p>
    <p>In contrast
to previously used methods, machine learning-based
prediction methods can provide rapid predictions. However, previous
reports using machine learning prediction methods did not yield a
reliable level of generalization performance due to insufficient training
data.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref></sup> For instance, Digiesi et al. used 62 cyclic
hexapeptides that have very similar structures to each other.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref></sup> The topological polar surface area (TPSA) of
these peptides ranged from approximately 150 to 250 Å<sup>2</sup>, which could only cover a very narrow chemical space. The lack of
available databases that collect structurally diverse cyclic peptides
is a major reason for poor generalization performance and is currently
the greatest obstacle to developing comprehensive machine learning
predictions. The combinations of amino acids that comprise cyclic
peptides are numerous; therefore, the chemical space of possible cyclic
peptides is very large. Furthermore, even a single residue change
in the amino acid sequence can lead to drastic changes in membrane
permeability.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref></sup> Most studies using the
available data fixed the majority of structures and measured changes
in membrane permeability with very few residue changes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref></sup> Therefore, building a machine learning prediction model with high
generalization performance requires a large amount of structurally
diverse training data collected from a larger body of publications
than employed in previous studies.</p>
    <p>In this study, we constructed
CycPeptMPDB, a comprehensive membrane
permeability database for cyclic peptides with the aim of developing
a machine learning-based prediction model and a computational method
for cyclic peptide drug design. Because several previous publications
reported various measurement experiments for the permeability data,
information such as the measurement experiment system was recorded.
We generated basic 2D SMILES representations and 3D structures (not
crystal structures but computationally generated conformations) of
cyclic peptides. Furthermore, to unambiguously represent cyclic peptides,
we organized the sequence information from each source and unified
the name of the monomer (substructure, such as the residue). Then,
we used the hierarchical editing language for macromolecules (HELM)
notation to generate sequence representations for all peptides.</p>

      <title>Overview of CycPeptMPDB Framework</title>
      <p>As shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref></xref>, CycPeptMPDB is
a comprehensive database recording the membrane permeability of cyclic
peptides based on data obtained from published papers and pharmaceutical
patents. It mainly contains two types of data for cyclic peptides:
(1) property information, i.e., experimental values of membrane permeability
and physical quantities such as LogP (an index of lipophilicity) estimated
from chemical structure, and (2) chemical structure information, i.e.,
sequence information described by HELM and monomers as partial structures
constituting the cyclic peptides. CycPeptMPDB provides several functions
such as data storage, statistics and visualization, searching and
analysis, and downloading.</p>

      <title>Data Collection</title>
      <p>We collected a total of 7334 structurally
diverse cyclic peptide data points (the number of peptides including
duplicated structures from all publication sources was 7451) and their
measured membrane permeability from 45 published papers and 2 patents
from pharmaceutical companies. The source list of CycPeptMPDB is shown
in the <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.jcim.2c01573/suppl_file/ci2c01573_si_001.pdf">Table S1</ext-link>. Membrane permeability
in CycPeptMPDB was expressed as a log-scaled value LogP<sub>exp</sub>. For peptides whose membrane permeability could not be measured
due to the detection limit, etc., LogP<sub>exp</sub> was set to the
minimum value, −10.0 (1.0 × 10<sup>–10</sup> cm/s,
detailed records such as the detection limit can be viewed on the
peptide detail page). The structures of peptides were recorded in
CycPeptMPDB using the SMILES notation. Structural errors in the original
publication were corrected (for example, when the SMILES structure
attached to the publication differs from the sequence described in
the publication, the structure was corrected based on the sequence
information). When there was a new source directly citing the membrane
permeability values of the old source, the number of these data was
counted only in the old source. As shown in <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.jcim.2c01573/suppl_file/ci2c01573_si_001.pdf">Table S1</ext-link>, most previously reported studies included a relatively
small number of peptides, with only six publications reporting on
over 100 peptides. In addition, as mentioned above, most of the publications
deal with structurally similar cyclic peptides; therefore, the molecular
weight range of peptides reported in a single paper is relatively
narrow. By collecting more than 40 publications, we were able to build
a database of cyclic peptides covering a wide range of molecular weights
(from 342.4 to 1777.7) and TPSA (from 73.0 to 702.0 Å<sup>2</sup>). Molecular weight and TPSA were the MolWt and TPSA descriptor calculated
by RDKit software, respectively. In the selected publications, there
were 6941 measurements by PAMPA, 649 measurements by Caco-2 assay,
40 measurements by Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) assay, and 186
measurements by Ralph Russ canine kidney (RRCK) assay. All measured
values were recorded when measurements obtained by multiple assays
were reported in a single publication. Of all identified peptides,
the membrane permeability measurements of 365 peptides were determined
using two different assays. When a peptide was measured by two assays
in a single publication, the permeability of the assay with more data
was used as the representative membrane permeability measurement.
If the permeabilities from both assays were similar, the representative
value was determined according to the following assay rank: (1) PAMPA,
(2) Caco-2, (3) RRCK, and (4) MDCK. Furthermore, a detailed description
of the assay protocol used in each study was also recorded as experimental
conditions such as reaction time and initial concentration affect
membrane permeability measurements.</p>
      <p>Moreover, to improve the
readability of the list display, collected cyclic peptides were classified
into two types by membrane permeability (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>). Cyclic peptides with LogP<sub>exp</sub> higher than or equal to −6.00 (1.0 × 10<sup>–6</sup>cm/s) are generally considered to have good permeability and were
classified as high (5113 peptides). Conversely, cyclic peptides with
LogP<sub>exp</sub> below −6.00 were classified as low (2338
peptides).</p>

      <title>3D Structure Generation of Cyclic Peptides</title>
      <p>Chemical
structural information on the collected cyclic peptides was recorded
in SMILES notation. Additionally, as conformation generation for cyclic
peptides is computationally expensive, we generated the 3D structure
of each cyclic peptide using RDKit software (version 2020.09.1) allowing
users to quickly start relevant research. We generated 5000 conformations
per peptide and removed redundant conformations with RMSD less than
1.0 Å. Next, the structure optimization of each conformation
was performed using the UFF force field, and the top structure with
the lowest potential energy was selected. This approach provided a
computationally efficient way to obtain the 3D structure of cyclic
peptides. However, it should be noted that the minimum energy conformation
obtained by molecular mechanics force fields may not necessarily reflect
the true conformations of the peptides in biological systems. Furthermore,
most peptides are likely to populate conformational ensembles rather
than a single conformation. The 3D structure of the cyclic peptide
can be viewed online and downloaded in SDF format.</p>

    <sec id="sec2.4">
      <title>Sequence Representation of Cyclic Peptides by HELM</title>
      <p>Cyclic peptides are relatively large compared to small molecules,
and appropriate sequence representation is essential for good readability.
Therefore, we used the HELM notation to generate a unified sequence
representation of collected cyclic peptides. HELM can hierarchically
represent complex structures with relatively high molecular weights,
such as antisense oligonucleotides, short interference RNAs, peptides,
proteins, and antibody drug conjugates.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref></sup> HELM consists of four level hierarchies: complex polymer, simple
polymer, monomer, and atom (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref></xref>(A)). First, a complex polymer expresses information
about the chemical structure of the entire macromolecule. Its components
are simple polymers and their connections (including hydrogen bonds
and attributes). Second, a simple polymer is composed of monomers
of the same polymer type. A simple polymer is defined as a single
linear chain; branching and cycling structures are not covered in
this hierarchy. Certain polymer types have explicit rules for connections
between monomers, and the position and rules of connections can express
the direction of monomer sequences (e.g., PEPTIDE notation represents
amino acid sequences from N-terminus to C-terminus). Moreover, monomers
are composed of atoms and bonds and can be represented in formats
such as Molfile and CXSMILES (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref></xref>(B), Chemaxon Extended SMILES). Each monomer was given
a unique symbol similar to the amino acid code represented in the
peptide sequences (e.g., A, G). Here, the definition of monomer also
includes the positions of its connections (i.e., attachment points).
When describing linear peptides, the original HELM definition dictates
that monomers are connected by peptide bonds. The attachment point
R1 is defined as the N atom of the amino group, and R2 is defined
as the C atom of the carboxyl group (the attachment points after R3
is the branch of the side chain). R1 and R2 in the terminal can only
be used to form the main chain of the linear peptide (R1 and R3, R2
and R3 can form a ring). Contrary to the original definition, the
N-terminus and C-terminus of linear peptides are often connected in
the case of cyclic peptides. Therefore, in this study, N-terminal
R1 and C-terminal R2 were able to be used to form a ring (like 1:R1–6:R2
in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref></xref>(A), HELM
in PubChem and ChEMBL databases is also like our definition). In addition,
the O atom changed from the N atom was also set as R1 because there
were many cyclic peptides with amide-to-ester substitutions.</p>

      <title>Monomer Definition in CycPeptMPDB</title>
      <p>As mentioned in the
previous section, the method used to define monomers that comprise
peptides is important and should be standardized for all entries in
the database. However, many of the selected publications did not record
sequence representations, and even when records were available, the
representation of special amino acids tended to differ notably between
these publications. Therefore, we defined the partial structure obtained
after cleaving the peptide bonds and ester bonds of the cyclic peptide
as a monomer (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref></xref>(B), CycPeptMPDB has no peptide containing disulfide bonds). As a
result, a total of 312 types of monomers were obtained. There were
305 monomers with the backbone monomer type (having two or more attachment
points) and 7 monomers with the terminal monomer type (used for terminal
modification of peptide sequences with only one attachment point).
Monomers were described in CXSMILES to represent positions of attachment
points. For monomers included in the PubChem database, their general
compound and International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC)
names were recorded. When not included in the PubChem database, their
IUPAC names were generated from SMILES using STOUT software (version
2.0, <uri xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://github.com/Kohulan/Smiles-TO-iUpac-Translator">https://github.com/Kohulan/Smiles-TO-iUpac-Translator</uri>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref></sup> Furthermore, when setting the symbol (the monomers
short display name in HELM) and natural analog of monomers, we referred
the PubChem database and the monomer library of ChEMBL database (version
29, contained 2851 types of monomers). At this stage, there were 112
types of monomers that did not have suitable symbols, and their symbols
were set as Mono1 to Mono112. The explanation of the naming method
of symbol is shown in the <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="other">Table <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="other">1</xref></xref>. Additionally, we defined two types of peptide molecule
shapes: Circle and Lariat. This classification was based on HELM sequence
information. Peptides with cyclization positions at both the N- and
C-terminal ends of the sequence were considered Circle peptides, and
peptides with cyclization positions not at the end of the sequence,
i.e., cyclized between a terminal and a side chain, were considered
Lariat peptides. Moreover, when calculating descriptors for monomers,
the presence of hydrogen bond donors and acceptors for the amide and
carboxyl groups may not accurately represent the partial physicochemical
properties of the cyclic peptide before cleavage. Therefore, if the
original attachment point atom was N or O (amide-to-ester substitution),
it was capped with methyl (CH3). If the original attachment point
atom was C, a hydrogen atom (H) was added. All monomer descriptors
shown in CycPeptMPDB were calculated from such processed molecules.
Similar to the method of classifying cyclic peptides by membrane permeability
described in the <xref rid="sec2.2" ref-type="other">Data Collection</xref> section,
monomers were classified into four types by LogP (Wildman–Crippen
atom-based LogP value, MolLogP descriptor calculated by RDKit software)
based on the LogP values of natural amino acids (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref></xref>). Monomers with LogP &lt;
−0.60 were set as extremely hydrophilic (35 monomers, lower
than G: −0.60). Those with −0.60 ≤ LogP &lt;
0.40 were set as hydrophilic (66 monomers, lower than V: 0.43, general
hydrophilic amino acids, such as G: −0.60, A: −0.21,
and P: 0.28). Those with 0.40 ≤ LogP &lt; 1.40 were set as
hydrophobic (127 monomers, general hydrophobic amino acids, such as
V: 0.43, I: 0.82, L: 0.82, and F: 1.02). Those with 1.40 ≤
LogP were set as extremely hydrophobic (84 monomers, extremely hydrophobic
amino acids, such as W: 1.50).</p>

      <title>Peptide Browsing Function</title>
      <p>As mentioned previously,
CycPeptMPDB includes 7334 structurally diverse cyclic peptides (the
number including duplicated structures from all publications was 7451)
from 45 papers and 2 pharmaceutical company patents. As shown in <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.jcim.2c01573/suppl_file/ci2c01573_si_001.pdf">Table S1</ext-link>, only six publications reported more
than 100 peptides, 2020_Townsend<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref></sup> with
3086 peptides accounting for more than 40% of the total. In addition,
when browsing peptides, we prepared three classification methods in
addition to browsing by data source: assay type, monomer length, and
molecule shape (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref></xref>(A)). When classified by monomer length (peptide sequence length),
according to the monomer splitting method used in this study (cleavage
of peptide and ester bond), the monomer length ranged from 2 to 15.
Furthermore, the behavior of side chains of cyclic peptides, and the
formation of hydrogen bonds between side chains and the main chain,
can have a significant impact on membrane permeability; therefore,
it may be necessary to separate the treatment of Circle and Lariat
peptides. Circle peptides accounted for under 70% (5115) of the total
and Lariat peptides for about 30% (2336). Moreover, detailed information
for the source can also be accessed if browsed by data source, as
shown in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref></xref>(B).
After navigating to the corresponding subset list page, the brief
table of peptides displays basic information on peptides, including
CycPeptMPDB ID, 2D structure image, HELM, permeability, molecular
weight, monomer length, and LogP (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref></xref>(B)). If users want to further refine the
list of accessed peptides, the search function on the upper right
of the table can be used. This search function differs from the search
function described in the <xref rid="sec3.2" ref-type="other">Peptide Search Function
for Quick Data Retrieval</xref> section in that it can filter peptides
that partially match the contents of the table (data source name,
publication year of source, original name in source, and molecule
shape are provided in addition to the table contents).</p>

      <title>Visualization Functions on Peptide Detail Page</title>
      <p>We incorporated
several useful functions in the peptide detail page for peptides and
monomers. First, for peptides of the same structure reported in multiple
sources, we listed all published membrane permeability measurements
in the peptide information section (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref></xref>(A)). In addition to measurements from different
assays of the same source, the measured membrane permeabilities between
each source are also different. This function allows users to quickly
select the measured membrane permeability values obtained under different
measurement environments. Because the number of 3D structures that
cyclic peptides can take is enormous, the generation of 3D structures
requires a large amount of computational resources. Therefore, to
facilitate the use of CycPeptMPDB, we generated 5000 conformations
per peptide with RDKit software as described in the <xref rid="sec2.3" ref-type="other">3D Structure Generation of Cyclic Peptides</xref> section. The most
stable single conformation was selected and stored (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref></xref>(B)). Finally, to increase
the readability of the HELM representation and support sequence-based
analysis, we also created HELM image and LogP and TPSA transition
diagrams for the sequence (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref></xref>(B)). By using these functions, users can quickly capture
the change in peptide sequence and partial characterization.</p>

      <title>Browsing and Visualization Functions of Monomers</title>
      <p>A
total of 312 monomers were defined as substructures that comprise
the peptides, and they were classified into 21 categories by their
natural analog (20 natural amino acids and unknown (X)). Natural analogs
were established by referring to the description of each monomer in
PubChem and the monomer library of ChEMBL. Among these 21 categories,
categories F (38) and G (38) included the most monomers, and there
were other two categories with more than 20 monomers: A (25) and S
(26). We provided a browsing function for monomers by natural analog
(<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref></xref>(A)). After
navigating to the corresponding subset list page, the brief table
displays basic information on monomers, including symbol, 2D structure
image, monomer type (backbone or terminal), natural analog, attachment
points (R1–R3), molecular weight, and LogP (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref></xref>(B)). Next, as shown in <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref></xref>(A), we included
the PubChem CID of the monomer and created a link to PubChem in the
monomer detail page. Users can obtain more diverse information on
the monomer from PubChem. Moreover, the monomer detail page lists
the distribution of the number of peptides containing each monomer

    <title>Conclusion</title>
    <p>This study reports our development of CycPeptMPDB,
a comprehensive
database of membrane permeability measurements of cyclic peptides
with a web interface, consisting of 7334 cyclic peptides collected
from 47 publications. In addition to providing a peptide’s
component information, sequence representations essential for cyclic
peptide drug discovery were created using HELM notation, and monomers
that comprise cyclic peptides were constructed. Browsing and searching
functions are incorporated to facilitate the rapid acquisition of
targeted peptides. CycPeptMPDB provides several additional functions
such as online data visualization, data analysis, and downloading,
making it a useful platform to support membrane permeability studies.
We will continue to collect membrane permeability data of cyclic peptides
and record them in CycPeptMPDB. Future improvements to the CycPeptMPDB
online analysis platform will include an improved user-friendly interface
and more integrative functions. We collected over 7000 structurally
diverse cyclic peptide data and have enabled the development of a
machine learning-based membrane permeability prediction model with
reliable generalization performance. Next, we intend to develop a
prediction model that accounts for mechanisms specific to cyclic peptide
membrane permeation, such as the “chameleonic” property.
At that time, it may be necessary to generate conformers not only
from a single environment but from both water and membrane-mimicking
environments (such as chloroform).</p>

for 3D structure generation of cyclic peptides, descriptor calculation
of cyclic peptides and monomers, and 2D structures image generation
of cyclic peptides and monomers. Furthermore, as mentioned in the <xref rid="sec2" ref-type="other">Methods</xref> section, the IUPAC names of monomers referred
to the PubChem database (<uri xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/">https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/</uri>) were included, and some
