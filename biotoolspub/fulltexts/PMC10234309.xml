      <p>Alternative polyadenylation (APA) enables a gene to generate multiple transcripts with different 3′ ends, which is dynamic across different cell types or conditions. Many computational methods have been developed to characterize sample-specific APA using the corresponding RNA-seq data, but suffered from high error rate on both polyadenylation site (PAS) identification and quantification of PAS usage (PAU), and bias toward 3′ untranslated regions. Here we developed a tool for APA identification and quantification (APAIQ) from RNA-seq data, which can accurately identify PAS and quantify PAU in a transcriptome-wide manner. Using 3′ end-seq data as the benchmark, we showed that APAIQ outperforms current methods on PAS identification and PAU quantification, including DaPars2, Aptardi, mountainClimber, SANPolyA, and QAPA. Finally, applying APAIQ on 421 RNA-seq samples from liver cancer patients, we identified &gt;540 tumor-associated APA events and experimentally validated two intronic polyadenylation candidates, demonstrating its capacity to unveil cancer-related APA with a large-scale RNA-seq data set.</p>

<body>
  <p>In eukaryotes, the transcription termination is mediated by cleavage of the nascent RNA and followed by the synthesis of non-genomic-templated polyadenosines (poly(A)) to the 3′ end of the RNA, which is known as polyadenylation. This process is controlled by a set of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) that recognizes <italic>cis</italic> elements surrounding the polyadenylation site (PAS). The PAS motif, a hexamer located 15–40 nt upstream of the cleavage site, is one of the most important core elements for PAS definition (<xref rid="GR277177LONC30" ref-type="bibr">Proudfoot and Brownlee 1976</xref>). PAS motifs include AAUAAA that is present in more than half of the PASs, and its variants (AUUAAA et al.), which have been found in nearly 80% of the remaining PASs in the human and mouse genome (<xref rid="GR277177LONC35" ref-type="bibr">Tian et al. 2005</xref>). Other elements located within 100 base-pair (bp) flanking PASs also contribute to the formation of polyadenylation (<xref rid="GR277177LONC14" ref-type="bibr">Hu et al. 2005</xref>).</p>
  <p>Most mammalian genes use multiple sites for polyadenylation, a phenomenon termed alternative polyadenylation (APA), to generate RNA isoforms with different 3′ ends. For instance, &gt;70% of human genes and 60% of mouse genes use multiple PASs (<xref rid="GR277177LONC6" ref-type="bibr">Derti et al. 2012</xref>; <xref rid="GR277177LONC40" ref-type="bibr">Xiao et al. 2016</xref>). This APA mechanism not only enables a single gene to encode multiple protein isoforms but also greatly increases the complexity of gene expression regulations via different 3′ untranslated regions (3′ UTRs) at the terminal exon. The choice of using a different PAS for each gene is distinct across different cell types. For instance, cells in the brain tissue tend to use the distal PAS to generate long isoforms, whereas proliferating cells prefer short isoforms by using proximal PASs (<xref rid="GR277177LONC32" ref-type="bibr">Sandberg et al. 2008</xref>; <xref rid="GR277177LONC25" ref-type="bibr">Miura et al. 2013</xref>). Moreover, even for the same type of cells, APA alterations have also been observed under different conditions or upon stimulation (<xref rid="GR277177LONC3" ref-type="bibr">Chang et al. 2015</xref>; <xref rid="GR277177LONC47" ref-type="bibr">Zheng et al. 2018</xref>).</p>
  <p>Dysregulation of APA could be associated with human diseases, including cancer. It has been shown that APA-mediated 3′ UTR shortening could activate oncogene expression via escaping from microRNA regulation, whereas RNA transcripts with shortened 3′ UTRs could also inhibit other transcripts from tumor suppressor by disrupting the competition for shared microRNA binding (<xref rid="GR277177LONC24" ref-type="bibr">Mayr and Bartel 2009</xref>; <xref rid="GR277177LONC27" ref-type="bibr">Park et al. 2018</xref>). Therefore, it is of the utmost interest to identify the expressed/used PASs and quantify their usages for each gene in different cells and samples. Numerous computational methods have been developed to predict PASs solely based on DNA sequence (<xref rid="GR277177LONC5" ref-type="bibr">Cheng et al. 2006</xref>; <xref rid="GR277177LONC41" ref-type="bibr">Xie et al. 2013</xref>; <xref rid="GR277177LONC39" ref-type="bibr">Xia et al. 2019</xref>), but they are very unlikely to accurately identify sample-specific APA simply because different cells share almost the identical DNA sequence. On the other hand, experimental technologies have been developed for the identification and quantification of sample-specific APA events in a transcriptome-wide manner by enriching the 3′ end of RNA transcripts, followed by high-throughput sequencing (3′ end-seq), such as 3P-seq, Aseq, Poly(A)-seq, and 3′ READS (<xref rid="GR277177LONC16" ref-type="bibr">Jan et al. 2011</xref>; <xref rid="GR277177LONC6" ref-type="bibr">Derti et al. 2012</xref>; <xref rid="GR277177LONC23" ref-type="bibr">Martin et al. 2012</xref>; <xref rid="GR277177LONC13" ref-type="bibr">Hoque et al. 2013</xref>). However, these methods are rather laborious, and more time and/or material consuming compared to conventional RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). More importantly, 3′ end-seq data are almost impossible to be used for studying other post-transcriptional RNA processes beyond APA, such as splicing and RNA editing.</p>
  <p>Accordingly, many tools have also been developed for the identification and quantification of APA based on RNA-seq data. Almost all of them are designed to detect the drops in RNA-seq read coverage along the gene body. However, due to high fluctuation of the sequencing coverage potentially caused by heterogenous reads mappability, as well as biased amplification efficiency of different RNA fragments during sequencing library preparation, these methods tend to suffer from high false positive rates and low recall on PAS identification. A recent study benchmarking multiple computational tools for APA analysis, including TAPAS (<xref rid="GR277177LONC1" ref-type="bibr">Arefeen et al. 2018</xref>), QAPA (<xref rid="GR277177LONC11" ref-type="bibr">Ha et al. 2018</xref>), DaPars2 (<xref rid="GR277177LONC21" ref-type="bibr">Li et al. 2021</xref>), GETUTR (<xref rid="GR277177LONC19" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al. 2015</xref>), and APATrap (<xref rid="GR277177LONC42" ref-type="bibr">Ye et al. 2018</xref>), using 3′ end-seq and Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) Iso-Seq data, found that essentially none of them could achieve 50% recall, whereas the false positive rate (FPR) ranges from 30% to 50% (<xref rid="GR277177LONC33" ref-type="bibr">Shah et al. 2021</xref>). In addition, these computational methods mainly focus on APA within 3′ UTR. This might be due to the fact that drop of RNA-seq coverage across exon–intron boundaries impacts their detection of splicing-coupled APA, such as intronic polyadenylation (IPA). Nevertheless, it has been reported that IPA is widespread in leukemia to inactivate tumor suppressor by generating truncated protein isoforms (<xref rid="GR277177LONC20" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al. 2018</xref>).</p>
  <p>Recently, IPAFinder that specifically identifies IPA and compares its usage between two conditions from RNA-seq has been developed (<xref rid="GR277177LONC46" ref-type="bibr">Zhao et al. 2021b</xref>). However, a method for comprehensive PAS identification at transcriptome remains largely an unmet need. In addition to PAS identification, current methods for APA quantification also have substantial error rates and they usually rely on the annotation of UTR and PAS in the database, such as QAPA and APAlyzer (<xref rid="GR277177LONC11" ref-type="bibr">Ha et al. 2018</xref>; <xref rid="GR277177LONC37" ref-type="bibr">Wang and Tian 2020</xref>). To date, the most comprehensive PAS annotation data sets, including PolyA_DB and PolyASite, are mainly derived from common cell lines or tissues (<xref rid="GR277177LONC038" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al. 2018</xref>; <xref rid="GR277177LONC12" ref-type="bibr">Herrmann et al. 2020</xref>). There might be tremendous unannotated PASs used in less explored biological samples, such as primary tumor samples from individual patients.</p>
  <p>Here, to address the above-mentioned limitations, we developed APAIQ, a computational tool that is capable of sample-specific <underline>APA</underline>
<underline>i</underline>dentification and <underline>q</underline>uantification (APAIQ) from RNA-seq data in a transcriptome-wide manner.</p>

      <title>Identification and quantification of APA from RNA-seq data with APAIQ</title>
      <p>APAIQ integrates coverage information from RNA-seq data with genomic sequence through a convolutional neuron network (CNN). It contains two modules, including one for PAS identification and another one that is a regression model for the quantification of expression based on the coverage around the identified or provided PAS position. For PAS identification, a hybrid deep-learning model taking RNA-seq read coverage and DNA sequence was first implemented to predict PAS score at each genomic locus, followed by a customized postprocessing strategy to identify accurate PAS position. To quantify the expression of transcripts using each PAS, a regression model was further trained by taking RNA-seq coverage at its flanking regions (−500 bp to 500 bp) as independent variables/covariates and the expression quantified by 3′ end-seq as dependent variable/response (Methods; <xref rid="GR277177LONF1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>A).</p>

      <p>We performed RNA 3′ end-seq (QuantSeq 3′ mRNA-seq, Lexogen) on four cell lines, including K562, HepG2, THLE2, and SNU398, to comprehensively characterize the expressed/used PAS in these four samples, respectively. To avoid internal primming potentially caused by the 3′ end-seq, we only used the annotated PAS from GENCODE and PolyA_DB (v3) that is derived from 3′ READS, which claimed to have the ability to overcome the internal primming problem (<xref rid="GR277177LONC13" ref-type="bibr">Hoque et al. 2013</xref>). An average of 20,335 PASs in each cell line with a sufficient expression level (reads per million [RPM] &gt; 0.1 and PAU &gt; 0.05) was identified (Methods), in which 10,382 PASs were commonly used among the four cell lines and each cell line has 3500–4000 sample-specific PASs (<xref rid="GR277177LONF1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>B). Among the 35,395 PASs expressed in at least one cell line, 35,064 are located within 14,959 protein-coding genes (without any extension), in which 58.9% of the genes use multiple PASs (<xref rid="GR277177LONF1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>C). We noted that the RNA-seq read coverage indeed tended to drop downstream from these PASs compared to the upstream regions (<ext-link xlink:href="http://genome.cshlp.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1101/gr.277177.122/-/DC1" ext-link-type="uri">Supplemental Fig. S1A</ext-link>). In addition, 87% of the used PASs have canonical PAS motif (AAUAAA) and its variants are located within 100 bp upstream of the cleavage site, whereas the frequency is only ∼20% in the same number of randomly selected genomic loci are at least 50 bp away from any annotated PAS (<ext-link xlink:href="http://genome.cshlp.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1101/gr.277177.122/-/DC1" ext-link-type="uri">Supplemental Fig. S1B</ext-link>). These suggested that both RNA-seq read coverage and DNA sequence contain useful information for distinguishing true used PASs from the background.</p>

      <title>APAIQ predicts PAS accurately in a genome-wide manner</title>
      <p>We first built a binary classification model by integrating RNA-seq coverage and DNA sequence. Using the expressed/used PASs in each cell line as the positive data set, and the same number of randomly selected genomic loci (see definition above) as the negative data set (Methods), we trained a model for binary classification. To evaluate the performance, we applied a cross-validation approach, in which we trained the model using 4/5 of the data sets and made predictions on the rest. As expected, the integrated model achieved 96% TPR/recall with false positive discovery rate (FDR) &lt;7%, which is better than the model that used only RNA-seq coverage (coverage-only) and slightly better than the model that used only DNA sequence (sequence-only) (<ext-link xlink:href="http://genome.cshlp.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1101/gr.277177.122/-/DC1" ext-link-type="uri">Supplemental Table S1</ext-link>). It is noteworthy that the sequence-only model achieves a performance similar to that of the integrated model, possibly due to the fact that the negative data set consists of the random regions rather than the unused/unexpressed PASs in each cell line.</p>
      <p>Although the model achieves good performance in distinguishing true PASs from random genomic loci, PAS identification at the whole genome remains challenging because even a very low false positive rate would result in a huge number of false positive predicted loci. For instance, among 3 billion loci in the human genome, only around 20,000 of them were defined as expressed/used PASs with sufficient expression level in each single cell line. To further reduce the false positive rate, we developed an enhanced model for genome scanning by introducing three strategies. We first limited the loci for the prediction by requiring the average of RNA-seq coverage at its upstream 100 bp to be higher than RPM of 0.1. In this way, we reduced the total number of scanning loci from 3 billion to several million. Second, we introduced a data augmentation strategy to increase the complexity of the training data set by randomly shifting several bp from true PAS (−12 bp to 12 bp) to augment the positive data set. Finally, we implanted a circular-training-based method, in which we repeatedly replaced the negative data set by the false positive predictions from the previous round, which further increased the power of the model to distinguish positive from negative PAS (<xref rid="GR277177LONF1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>A; Methods).</p>
      <p>With the enhanced model using these three strategies, we made predictions at each locus in each sample and got a raw prediction score ranging from 0 to 1 that represented the probability of a locus to be a truly used/expressed PAS in this sample. As we considered the locus at the vicinity of each true PAS as positive during data augmentation, the prediction score at these loci could also be relatively high. Accordingly, we designed a postprocessing strategy by scanning the prediction scores to pinpoint the final positions of the true PAS. In this way, we were able to accurately pinpoint the final PAS position (<xref rid="GR277177LONF1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>A; Methods). At the end, our model was able to identify ∼70% of true PAS (overlapped with predicted PAS within 25 bp) and &gt;80% of the PAS identified by APAIQ was located within 25 bp away from the annotated PAS (3′ end-seq RPM &gt; 0), suggesting that our method achieves both high recall and precision (72.4% with PAS from the ground truth in average) for PAS identification (<xref rid="GR277177LONF2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>A). As expected, we also found that the PAS with higher expression levels has higher probabilities to be identified. For instance, &gt;80% of PASs with relatively high expression level (RPM &gt; 5, PAU &gt; 0.05) were successfully identified (<xref rid="GR277177LONF2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>B). Even though 20%–30% of the PAS we identified are not from the ground truth, almost half of them (10%–15% of the total identified PASs) are still annotated (within 25 bp), but the expression levels did not pass our threshold (<xref rid="GR277177LONF2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>C). Overall, ∼85% of the predictions are PAS detected by 3′ end-seq.</p>

      <p>As shown in <xref rid="GR277177LONF2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>D, as an example, there are more than 19 annotated PASs from gene <italic>ELP5</italic>. However, only one was expressed/used in K562 and THLE2, and two of them were expressed/used in HepG2 and SNU398 according to the 3′ end-seq data. Our model successfully identified them in each cell line, including an intronic PAS that is specifically expressed/used in HepG2 and SNU398 (<italic>ELP5</italic>-i1). The IPA has also been identified by IPAFinder in a previous study (<xref rid="GR277177LONC46" ref-type="bibr">Zhao et al. 2021b</xref>), indicating the high reliability of this PAS. To be noted, solely using 3′ end-seq data enabled the identification of these two sample-specific APA events, whereas it was impossible to distinguish isoform <italic>ELP5</italic>-i3 from <italic>ELP5</italic>-i2 because they used the same terminal PAS, whereas <italic>ELP5</italic>-i2 has a retained intron (<xref rid="GR277177LONF2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>D). In comparison, by applying APAIQ on RNA-seq data, we could not only identify these two PASs but also retain the ability to determine the splicing patterns of different isoforms, which further highlighted the power of APAIQ in the study of APA coupled with other post-transcriptional RNA processes, such as splicing.</p>

      <title>APAIQ outperforms current methods on PAS identification</title>
      <p>Next, we compared APAIQ with several publicly available methods, including Aptardi, DaPars2, mountainClimber, and SANPolyA (<xref rid="GR277177LONC2" ref-type="bibr">Cass and Xiao 2019</xref>; <xref rid="GR277177LONC44" ref-type="bibr">Yu and Dai 2020</xref>; <xref rid="GR277177LONC21" ref-type="bibr">Li et al. 2021</xref>; <xref rid="GR277177LONC22" ref-type="bibr">Lusk et al. 2021</xref>), by using our 3′ end-seq data as the benchmark. All these methods were published recently, and they represented different strategies for the identification of PASs, including purely using RNA-seq coverage, DNA sequence, as well as using both coverage and sequence. Among them, DaPars2 and mountainClimber were based on the drops in RNA-seq read coverage, whereas SANPolyA used only DNA sequence and Aptardi used a deep-learning framework with both RNA-seq coverage and DNA sequence features. As SANPolyA was designed for binary classification only, for fair comparisons, we applied our postprocessing strategy to enable it also for genome-wide scanning. First, we performed a simple comparison by using the top 10,000 predictions from each method. We found that APAIQ captured the highest number of true PASs and the distance between the predictions and the ground truth is mainly within 25 bp. Aptardi ranks as the second if the threshold of distance is set to 100 bp (<xref rid="GR277177LONF3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>A). As these two methods shared a similar strategy, this result suggests that using deep-learning and integrating RNA-seq coverage and DNA sequence could greatly improve the performance compared with other traditional methods.</p>

        <graphic xlink:href="644f03" position="float"/>
      </fig>
      <p>Next, we used 25 bp to the ground truth as the distance threshold to calculate recall, FPR, and precisions for more comprehensive evaluation (<ext-link xlink:href="http://genome.cshlp.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1101/gr.277177.122/-/DC1" ext-link-type="uri">Supplemental Method S1</ext-link>). As shown in <xref rid="GR277177LONF3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>B, none of the used published methods achieved 60% recall with 10% FPR, which is consistent with the recent study that benchmarked computational methods for APA analysis based on 3′ end-seq and Iso-Seq data (<xref rid="GR277177LONC33" ref-type="bibr">Shah et al. 2021</xref>). As Aptardi scanned PAS at a 300 bp window with a 100 bp stepwise, we further relaxed the distance threshold to 100 bp to the ground truth for the evaluation. In this way, Aptardi exhibited a much better performance, whereas its recall was still much lower (∼20% lower) than APAIQ with the same FPR, and the same hold (∼10% lower) for SANPolyA method coupled with our postprocessing strategy. As both Aptardi and DaPars2 were designed for APA analysis within the last exon, we further evaluated them by only using the PAS within the terminal exon. Again, APAIQ has the highest recall with the same FPR (<ext-link xlink:href="http://genome.cshlp.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1101/gr.277177.122/-/DC1" ext-link-type="uri">Supplemental Fig. S1C</ext-link>).</p>
      <p>We further analyzed the true positive (TP) predictions of the five methods and found that 18.4% of the PASs in the ground truth were not found by any method. As expected, among those TP specifically predicted by each method, APAIQ has the highest number (1646), followed by Aptardi (1126). Both the TP predicted by Aptardi and SANPolyA are highly overlapped with APAIQ, indicating high consistencies between the deep-learning-based methods (<xref rid="GR277177LONF3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>C). Moreover, we classified the PASs into seven categories based on their genomic localization, including terminal exon (including 3′ UTR), upstream exonic regions, intronic regions, transcription start site (TSS) upstream antisense, extended regions, ncRNA, and intergenic regions. Similar to the previous study (<xref rid="GR277177LONC40" ref-type="bibr">Xiao et al. 2016</xref>), PAS located within the terminal exon was the most abundant category (73.7%), followed by intronic PAS (17.0%). We found that APAIQ was able to identify PAS from all these categories, whereas PAS from the terminal exon and intronic region has the highest identification rates (<xref rid="GR277177LONF3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>D), indicating a higher generalization ability compared to other methods that only focus on 3′ UTR. We also checked the precision of the predictions in each category region and found that the precision for PAS from terminal exons is above 0.8 and precisions for PAS from other genic regions, including intron, upstream exon, and ncRNA, are around 0.6 (<ext-link xlink:href="http://genome.cshlp.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1101/gr.277177.122/-/DC1" ext-link-type="uri">Supplemental Fig. S1D</ext-link>). Moreover, the frequency of AAUAAA and other poly(A) signal motifs upstream of the predicted PAS are quite consistent across different types of regions, with ∼50% of them containing AAUAAA, and 80% containing at least one poly(A) signal motif (<ext-link xlink:href="http://genome.cshlp.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1101/gr.277177.122/-/DC1" ext-link-type="uri">Supplemental Fig. S1E</ext-link>). PAS from TSS upstream antisense, extended regions, and intergenic regions have relatively low precisions and motif frequency, which might be due to unstable and low expression of RNA products using these PASs. However, this would not impact the general APA analysis, which mainly focuses on PAS from genic regions. Finally, as shown in <xref rid="GR277177LONF3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>E, only APAIQ was able to successfully identify two PASs from intronic regions of gene <italic>NAXE</italic>.</p>

      <title>Synergistic effect of RNA-seq read coverage and DNA sequence on PAS identification</title>
      <p>To dissect the contribution of RNA-seq read coverage and DNA sequence to the model, we also compared the integrated model with the coverage-only and the sequence-only models. We found that using two features not only improved precision but also reduced false positive predictions (<ext-link xlink:href="http://genome.cshlp.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1101/gr.277177.122/-/DC1" ext-link-type="uri">Supplemental Fig. S1F</ext-link>). As shown in <xref rid="GR277177LONF3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>F, the sequence-only model identified several annotated PASs from gene <italic>DKK1</italic> that are not expressed/used at all, whereas when adding RNA-seq coverage features, the integrated model successfully discarded those unused PASs. Another example was shown in <ext-link xlink:href="http://genome.cshlp.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1101/gr.277177.122/-/DC1" ext-link-type="uri">Supplemental Figure S1G</ext-link>, in which using only RNA-seq coverage falsely identified two PASs from gene <italic>ACOT2</italic> due to the drop of coverage, whereas they were successfully excluded by the integrated model. In addition, a proximal PAS from gene <italic>PHKB</italic> truly used in SNU398 was identified by neither the sequence-only nor the coverage-only model, but was successfully detected by the integrated model (<ext-link xlink:href="http://genome.cshlp.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1101/gr.277177.122/-/DC1" ext-link-type="uri">Supplemental Fig. S1H</ext-link>), further demonstrating a synergistic effect by combining these two features together for PAS identification.</p>

      <title>High transferability of APAIQ across different cell lines, species, and data sets</title>
      <p>To examine whether APAIQ could be applied to samples differing from that used in the training data set, we tested the transferability of our model across different cell lines. Alternately, we trained the model in each of the four cell lines, made predictions on the other three cell lines, and then compared their performances to that in this cell line. We found that the predictions across different cell lines could still achieve a similar recall and precision as that over data from the same cell line (<ext-link xlink:href="http://genome.cshlp.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1101/gr.277177.122/-/DC1" ext-link-type="uri">Supplemental Fig. S2A,B</ext-link>). To further test whether APAIQ could be even applied across different species, we tested the model on a data set from the mouse fibroblast (<xref rid="GR277177LONC40" ref-type="bibr">Xiao et al. 2016</xref>). The performance is similar to those across different human cell lines (<ext-link xlink:href="http://genome.cshlp.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1101/gr.277177.122/-/DC1" ext-link-type="uri">Supplemental Fig. S2C</ext-link>), indicating the generalization power of our method and suggesting potential applications on different RNA-seq samples using the pretrained model.</p>
      <p>To further confirm the transfer capacity of APAIQ using the pretrained model, we applied APAIQ to an independent public data set (<ext-link xlink:href="http://genome.cshlp.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1101/gr.277177.122/-/DC1" ext-link-type="uri">Supplemental Method S2</ext-link>), which has been used to benchmark computational methods for APA analysis (<xref rid="GR277177LONC33" ref-type="bibr">Shah et al. 2021</xref>). It turned out that &gt;80% of the predicted PASs are within 25 nt to the PAS from annotation (union between GECODE and PolyA_DB), whereas &gt;60% of the predicted PASs are located within 25 nt to PAS in the ground truth and ∼70% are within 100 nt (<ext-link xlink:href="http://genome.cshlp.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1101/gr.277177.122/-/DC1" ext-link-type="uri">Supplemental Fig. S2D</ext-link>). This is slightly lower than the precision achieved from the four cell lines (precision of around 0.72 using 25 nt as the threshold). We noticed that in general the sequencing depth of these LCL RNA-seq samples are lower than that of the four cell lines (∼100 M). Thus, we inspected the precision in samples with different sequencing depth. We found that the precision is positively correlated with sequencing depth, for which the samples with sequencing depth higher than 50 M have precisions above 0.7 using 100 nt as the threshold (<ext-link xlink:href="http://genome.cshlp.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1101/gr.277177.122/-/DC1" ext-link-type="uri">Supplemental Fig. S2E</ext-link>).</p>
      <p>Because the PASs in the ground truth are derived from the integration of more than 50 3′-seq samples, we further checked the recall by cumulating the predicted PASs from multiple RNA-seq samples. With the increasing number of RNA-seq samples, the predictions could reach 70% recall for the PASs shared by Elife_PAS and GB_PAS (<ext-link xlink:href="http://genome.cshlp.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1101/gr.277177.122/-/DC1" ext-link-type="uri">Supplemental Fig. S2F</ext-link>). The relative low recall for Elife_PAS is likely due to its high false positive rate as only 65.4% (27,347 out of 41,784) of the Elife_PAS are overlapped with annotation. Overall, using LCL data as an independent resource, we showed that APAIQ could achieve similar performance as that from the four cell lines with our pretrained model, indicating the robustness and good transfer capacity of APAIQ for PAS identification based on canonical RNA-seq data.</p>

    <sec id="s1f">
      <title>Accurate quantification of PAS usage by APAIQ</title>
      <p>After the identification of PASs, we further aimed to quantify the expression of each PAS based on RNA-seq data. To do so, we introduced a regression model, in which we considered the expression of the PAS (Y) as a dependent variable/response and the coverages at each locus within 500 bp flanking the PAS (X) as predictors/covariates. The expression Y was estimated by using 3′ end-seq data and the coverage X was derived from RNA-seq data (<xref rid="GR277177LONF1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>A). Our prediction achieved an average Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.75 in the four cell lines. Furthermore, we trained the model from each cell line and made predictions in the other three cell lines separately. It turned out that the correlation coefficients derived between different cell lines were comparable to those from the same cell line. This result is expected as RNA-seq coverage around each PAS should be determined by its expression profile in each sample and the features in coverage variations learned by the model should be consistent across different samples. Overall, this result also suggests a good transferability of the regression model (<xref rid="GR277177LONF4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>A).</p>

For these genes, we calculated the PAU by using its expression divided by the total expression of all the PASs from the corresponding gene. In a recent study, a metric (error) was introduced by summing up the PAU difference across all the PASs from each gene, to measure the concordance of PAU between prediction and quantification by 3′ end-seq data (<xref rid="GR277177LONF4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>B). With this method, it showed that QAPA achieved the lowest error in APA quantification (<xref rid="GR277177LONC33" ref-type="bibr">Shah et al. 2021</xref>). Therefore, we further calculated the error of our predictions and compared to the results from QAPA.

Compared to the identified PASs that are overlapped with annotation, those unannotated ones are most frequently located within intronic regions (30.2%), with only 16.2% from terminal exon, suggesting that PASs within terminal exon might be better annotated than those from other regions, and IPA annotation needs improvement (<xref rid="GR277177LONF5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>B). Higher frequency of unannotated PASs identified in intronic regions could also be due to the fact that the precision for the predicted PASs in intronic region is lower than that in terminal exon. To further evaluate the quality of these identified PASs, we checked the frequency of canonical PAS motif (AAUAAA) and its variants and found that &gt;90% of the identified PASs have the motifs, which is even higher than that from annotation (<ext-link xlink:href="http://genome.cshlp.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1101/gr.277177.122/-/DC1" ext-link-type="uri">Supplemental Fig. S3B</ext-link>). In addition, the motif frequency for predictions across multiple genomic locations is quite similar (<ext-link xlink:href="http://genome.cshlp.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1101/gr.277177.122/-/DC1" ext-link-type="uri">Supplemental Fig. S3C</ext-link>), which is consistent with the results in the cell line.</p>
      <p>To quantify APA events and compare them between tumor and normal, we further applied APAIQ to calculate the expression level of each PAS. In total, 36,904 PASs from 15,326 protein-coding genes were sufficiently expressed (predicted RPM &gt; 1) in more than one sample. Among these genes, 59.3% used multiple PASs (<xref rid="GR277177LONF5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>C), which is slightly higher than 46% that has been reported in a recent study based on 3′ end-seq data from lung cancer patients (<xref rid="GR277177LONC48" ref-type="bibr">Zingone et al. 2021</xref>). For PASs located within terminal exon, we defined weighted 3′ UTR length index (WULI), a metric to evaluate 3′ UTR length for each gene in each sample (<xref rid="GR277177LONF5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>D). Compared to a previous method using only the two most highly expressed PASs (distal and proximal) to measure 3′ UTR lengthening and shortening (<xref rid="GR277177LONC13" ref-type="bibr">Hoque et al. 2013</xref>), WULI calculated an average of lengths by taking into account both the UTR length and usage of each isoform. To check the feasibility of the method, we first applied WULI to identify 3′ UTR shortening and lengthening events by comparing two liver cancer cell lines (HepG2 and SNU398) to normal liver cell line (THLE2) separately. A consistent 3′ UTR shortening trend was observed in these two comparisons (HepG2 vs. THLE2 and SNU398 vs. THLE2) (<ext-link xlink:href="http://genome.cshlp.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1101/gr.277177.122/-/DC1" ext-link-type="uri">Supplemental Fig. S3D</ext-link>).</p>
      <p>Next, we analyzed the data from 50 matched tumor and normal samples, in which 245 shortening and 155 lengthening events were identified. As shown in <ext-link xlink:href="http://genome.cshlp.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1101/gr.277177.122/-/DC1" ext-link-type="uri">Supplemental Figure S3E</ext-link> as an example, there are 16 annotated PASs located within the terminal exon of gene <italic>RAB11A</italic> and four of them have been used. The identified 3′ UTR shortening was mainly contributed by the increased usage of two proximal PASs in tumor samples compared to that in normal samples. We found that those genes with 3′ UTR shortening were enriched for functions related to platelet alpha granule and response to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress (<xref rid="GR277177LONF5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>E), whereas no significant functional enrichment was identified for genes with 3′ UTR lengthening. ER stress is frequently observed in cancer, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), due to its high demand of protein synthesis. Our finding is consistent with previous observations that genes related to the response of ER stress are activated in HCC and correlated with poor prognosis (<xref rid="GR277177LONC34" ref-type="bibr">Shuda et al. 2003</xref>; <xref rid="GR277177LONC28" ref-type="bibr">Pavlović and Heindryckx 2021</xref>). On the other hand, platelet alpha granule might be critical for tumor favored microenvironment (<xref rid="GR277177LONC29" ref-type="bibr">Pavlovic et al. 2019</xref>).</p>
      <p>For each intronic PAS, we calculated its PAU and compared that between tumor and normal samples. As a result, 68 up-regulated and 73 down-regulated IPA events were identified and the genes with the dysregulated IPA are enriched in protein activation cascade GO term (GO:0072376, odds ratio = 9.86, FDR = 0.001) and complement and coagulation cascades pathway (hsa04610, odds ratio = 8.32, FDR = 0.001).</p>

      <title>Validation of the predicted tumor-associated APA events in a liver cancer cell line</title>
      <p>To experimentally validate APAIQ predictions, we selected 20 identified PASs that are not overlapped with any annotated transcript 3′ ends and performed 3′ RACE experiments to examine whether these PASs were expressed/used in a liver colon cancer cell line, HepG2 (<ext-link xlink:href="http://genome.cshlp.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1101/gr.277177.122/-/DC1" ext-link-type="uri">Supplemental Table S2</ext-link>). Seventeen out of 20 of them were successfully validated and the failed three candidates might be due to their relative low expression level in the cell line (<ext-link xlink:href="http://genome.cshlp.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1101/gr.277177.122/-/DC1" ext-link-type="uri">Supplemental Fig. S4A,B</ext-link>). Furthermore, we conducted a ligation-based assay and confirmed that 16 out of the 17 candidates indeed have poly(A) tail, whereas the only failed one has the lowest expression among these 17 candidates (<ext-link xlink:href="http://genome.cshlp.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1101/gr.277177.122/-/DC1" ext-link-type="uri">Supplemental Fig. S4C,D</ext-link>).</p>
      <p>In addition, among the tumor-associated IPA events, the top significant one enriched in cancer is from the gene flavin adenine dinucleotide synthetase 1 (<italic>FLAD1</italic>), which is overexpressed in multiple cancer types, including gastric, breast, and liver cancer, and correlated with poor prognosis (<xref rid="GR277177LONC17" ref-type="bibr">Jia et al. 2019</xref>; <xref rid="GR277177LONC15" ref-type="bibr">Hu et al. 2020</xref>; <xref rid="GR277177LONC43" ref-type="bibr">Ye et al. 2020</xref>). We found that the identified IPA is barely or almost not used in normal samples, whereas usage of the IPA in tumor samples is comparable to the canonical PAS (<xref rid="GR277177LONF6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>A). Compared to the full-length isoform, transcripts with this IPA encode a much shorter protein isoform with distinct amino acids (294 amino acids vs. 587 amino acids). The canonical protein isoform encoded by <italic>FLAD1</italic> is a key enzyme in flavin adenine dinucleotide biosynthesis, whereas for the short protein isoform, it awaits future investigation to explore its functions in cancer.</p>

      <p>Another IPA candidate that is highly used in tumor samples but barely used in normal samples is from the gene <italic>ERCC1</italic>, which encodes a protein with DNA repair functions (<xref rid="GR277177LONF6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>B). The transcripts using this intronic PAS could generate a protein with a varied C-terminal (ERCC1-201) compared to canonical protein isoforms (ERCC1-202). Using Alpha-fold (<xref rid="GR277177LONC18" ref-type="bibr">Jumper et al. 2021</xref>), we predicted structures of these two proteins-isoforms and found that a typic alpha helix structure at the C-terminal of ERCC1-202 would be disrupted in ERCC1-201 (<ext-link xlink:href="http://genome.cshlp.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1101/gr.277177.122/-/DC1" ext-link-type="uri">Supplemental Fig. S5</ext-link>), which might impact its function. Indeed, a previous study reported that the C-terminal of ERCC1-202 contains the domain for double-strand DNA binding and interacts with its cofactor ERCC4 (previously known as XPF), and therefore only ERCC1-202 has full capacity for nucleotide excision repair (<xref rid="GR277177LONC10" ref-type="bibr">Friboulet et al. 2013</xref>). These results suggested that tumor cells with IPA of <italic>ERCC1</italic> would have dysregulated DNA repair functions, which might contribute to HCC development.</p>
      <p>Finally, we validated these two candidates by performing a 3′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends (3′ RACE) experiment in the liver cancer cell line HepG2. As shown in <xref rid="GR277177LONF6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>C–F, we successfully detected the IPA transcript from both genes. Moreover, using real-time quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR), we showed that the relative expression levels of the transcript isoforms using IPA compared to the canonical ones are consistent with what we estimated by APAIQ with tumor samples from the TCGA-LIHC data set (<xref rid="GR277177LONF6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>C,D). These results further confirmed the reliability of APAIQ. Taken together, our results demonstrated that APAIQ is a powerful tool to facilitate APA analysis and its functional understanding using large-scale public RNA-seq data sets, such as that from TCGA, the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx), and the ENCyclopedia Of DNA Elements (ENCODE) projects.</p>

    <title>Discussion</title>
    <p>There are only around 20,000 genes in the human genome, whereas 10 times or even more numbers of transcripts were transcribed from these gene loci, which are mainly mediated by a series of RNA metabolic processes, including alternative transcriptional start site (TSS), alternative splicing, and APA. With the emerging of high-throughput sequencing technology, gene expression, alternative splicing, and RNA editing have been extensively studied by directly using the RNA-seq data. However, utilization of conventional RNA-seq data for comprehensive APA analysis remains limited due to the shortage and limitations of current methods for APA identification and quantification. The main limitations of the current methods include the following: (1) RNA-seq coverage-based methods are impacted by frequent fluctuation of coverages in transcriptome, resulting in high false positives and bias toward 3′ UTR; (2) DNA sequence-based methods are unable to distinguish PAS expressed versus unexpressed in specific samples; (3) the recently published method, Aptardi, which is the first method to integrate both RNA-seq coverage and DNA sequence, was designed for scanning 3′ UTR with a 300 bp window. Thus, it can only determine whether or not a window contains truly expressed/used PASs and this resolution for PAS identification is relatively low.</p>
    <p>A recent systematic evaluation of 11 methods using simulated and public 3′ end-seq data showed that TAPAS has the best performance, followed by DaPars (<xref rid="GR277177LONC4" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al. 2020</xref>). Based on a more recent study that benchmarked five computational methods for APA analysis with 3′ end-seq and Iso-Seq, none of them were able to identify &gt;50% of the expressed PAS except QAPA which requires the annotated PAS as input. Among the five, the second generation of DaPars (DaPars2) identified slightly more annotated PAS than TAPAS. For the quantification of PAS usage, this study showed that QAPA has the lowest error rate (<xref rid="GR277177LONC33" ref-type="bibr">Shah et al. 2021</xref>).</p>
    <p>Here, we generated a data set for benchmarking, which includes the matched 3′ end-seq and RNA-seq data from four human cell lines. To be noted, the in-house 3′ end-seq data have two independent sources. The 3′ end sequencing of HepG2, SNU398, and THLE2 cell lines was performed in one lab and K562 in another lab. The matched RNA-seq data of the four cell lines were from four independent sources (Methods). However, the performance of APAIQ on these four cell lines is quite consistent (<xref rid="GR277177LONF2" ref-type="fig">Figs. 2</xref>A,B, 4A,C), indicating the robustness of our methods. By using 3′ end-seq data as the benchmark, we showed that APAIQ can identify &gt;70% of the expressed PAS with FPR &lt;10%. As we found that PASs with higher expression level achieved higher recall (<xref rid="GR277177LONF2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>B), suggesting that the false negatives could be enriched for lowly expressed PASs. The false positives without 3′ end-seq supports could be due to either strong PAS-related <italic>cis</italic>-elements around these loci or the RNA-seq read coverage having clear drop patterns. The former would not become false positive anymore in the differential APA analysis as the input DNA sequences are identical, whereas the latter might be due to some biases introduced by RNA-seq, which still needs further detailed analysis.</p>
    <p>Apart from PAS identification, APAIQ also achieves a much lower error rate on APA quantification compared to QAPA (<xref rid="GR277177LONF4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>C). For instance, with APAIQ more than half of genes have an error margin of PAU &lt;0.4%, and ∼75% of the PASs have an error margin lower than 0.6. In comparison, these error margins were 0.6 (50% genes) and 0.95 (75% genes), respectively, when using QAPA, the best tool thus far for APA quantification (<xref rid="GR277177LONC33" ref-type="bibr">Shah et al. 2021</xref>). For a major PAS with PAU &gt; 0.65, the probability to falsely determine it as a minor PAS (PAU &lt; 0.35, error &gt; 0.6) is &lt;25% using APAIQ, whereas this could be as high as 50% using QAPA. Therefore, using the same RNA-seq data, APAIQ could improve the accuracy of APA quantification compared to current methods.</p>
    <p>As we used the common human genome assembly (hg38) to extract DNA sequence for PAS identification, the genetic variations and polymorphisms were neglected. This could be a limitation of our current method, especially when applying it on tumor samples that frequently harbored a large number of DNA mutations. A later version incorporating small nucleotide variation (SNV) and structure variations could identify PASs more accurately, and meanwhile potentially provide direct links to the identification of APA-related variations.</p>
    <p>Most of the previous methods, such as DaPars2 (<xref rid="GR277177LONC21" ref-type="bibr">Li et al. 2021</xref>), GETUTR (<xref rid="GR277177LONC19" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al. 2015</xref>), QAPA (<xref rid="GR277177LONC11" ref-type="bibr">Ha et al. 2018</xref>), and Aptardi (<xref rid="GR277177LONC22" ref-type="bibr">Lusk et al. 2021</xref>), were designed for APA analysis within the terminal exon, in which APA has been extensively studied. For instance, utilizing RNA-seq data from TCGA, the landscape of APA regulating 3′ UTR lengthening and shortening has been characterized by several previous studies (<xref rid="GR277177LONC38" ref-type="bibr">Xia et al. 2014</xref>; <xref rid="GR277177LONC9" ref-type="bibr">Feng et al. 2018</xref>). On the other hand, global studies of APA using RNA-seq data from other regions, such as intronic regions, that could alter coding sequence (CDS) and the coding potential, have just recently been addressed (<xref rid="GR277177LONC45" ref-type="bibr">Zhao et al. 2021a</xref>). APAIQ could greatly facilitate such a kind of analysis as it can identify and quantify APA in a transcriptome-wide manner, which was demonstrated by the application of APAIQ on RNA-seq data from the TCGA-LIHC cohort. Indeed, we identified more than 100 tumor-associated/specific IPA events, including the validated FLAD1-IPA and ERCC1-IPA, which likely contribute to liver cancer development by altering the coding sequence of functional domains. Future applications of APAIQ on the complete TCGA data set would build a comprehensive atlas of RNA transcript 3′ ends in human cancer, which would facilitate a complete understanding of the functional relevance of APA regulation in tumor development.</p>

      <title>Positive and negative data set preparation</title>
      <p>To get training and testing data sets for the deep-learning model, we first built the general annotation using 289,565 PASs from polyADB3 and 184,617 PASs extracted from the transcript end based on GENCODE annotation. Next, in each cell line, we mapped the reads from 3′ end sequencing data to the annotation with “BEDTools” to get the expressed PAS in each sample (sample-specific PASs). In brief, for each PAS, any reads with 3′ end located within 25 bp were counted and then normalized to RPM using total uniquely mapped reads. If two annotated PASs were located within 50 bp, only the one with higher expression was kept. Because the used 3′ end-seq might introduce internal primming, we only include the expressed and annotated PASs in downstream analysis. Next, in each sample, by overlapping the PAS with gene annotation, we calculated the relative usage of each PAS by dividing the expression of the PAS to the sum of all the PASs from the same gene. Any PAS with expression level higher/no less than 0.1 RPM and usage higher/no less than 0.05 was considered as expressed/used.</p>
      <p>For each expressed PAS in each cell line, we extracted the DNA sequence and the RNA-seq coverage from 100 bp upstream to 100 bp downstream regions. To avoid discrepancy between RNA-seq and 3′ end-seq data from the same sample/cell line, we further filtered out the PAS by requiring that the average RNA-seq coverage at 100 bp upstream should be no less than 0.05 RPM. In this way, we finally got ∼20,000 used/expressed PASs as the positive data set (ground truth) in each cell line (<xref rid="GR277177LONF1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>B). The same number of sites with average RNA-seq coverage no less than 0.05 RPM at 100 bp upstream regions, and meanwhile being at least 50 bp far away from any true PAS, was randomly selected from the genome as negative data set.</p>

      <title>A hybrid deep-learning model using both DNA sequence and RNA-seq coverage</title>
      <p>As shown in <xref rid="GR277177LONF1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>A, we built a hybrid deep-learning model that contains two independent convolutional neuron networks, which take DNA sequence and RNA-seq coverage as input, respectively. The DNA sequence underwent one-hot encoding to 201 × 4 matrix and the normalized RNA-seq coverage (RPM values) was converted to 201 × 1 matrix. Both of them went through a convolutional layer consisting of 32 filters with a kernel size of 6. These were followed by a group normalization layer with group size 4. A rectified linear unit (ReLU) was applied to the normalized results as the activation function. After a max-pooling layer with pooling window setting as 6, features were flattened into one-dimensional array and fed to the fully connected layer. Then, two features were concatenated together and fed into another fully connected layer followed by a softmax activation function to approximate the probability function. The final output is a prediction score between 0 and 1, whereas dropout was introduced after the max-pooling layer as regularization to reduce over-fitting problems (<ext-link xlink:href="http://genome.cshlp.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1101/gr.277177.122/-/DC1" ext-link-type="uri">Supplemental Method S3</ext-link>).</p>

      <title>Training and evaluation of the deep-learning model on binary classification</title>
      <p>In each sample, we applied a cross-validation strategy to evaluate our learning model, in which we trained the model with 80% of the positive data set and negative data set and tested it in the rest of the data set. We measured a series of metrics, including accuracy, recall, FPR, and FDR, for the evaluation.</p>

      <title>An enhanced model for genome scanning</title>
      <p>Because our model achieved extraordinary performance on binary classification (<ext-link xlink:href="http://genome.cshlp.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1101/gr.277177.122/-/DC1" ext-link-type="uri">Supplemental Table S1</ext-link>), we wanted to apply it for genome scanning. We introduced a data augmentation strategy, in which we set the training epoch as 500 and the mini-batch size as 32. In each epoch, the sites randomly shifted from the true PAS from −12 to 12 bp were considered as the positive samples, whereas the sites more than 50 bp away from any true PAS were considered as negatives. To evaluate the model in each epoch, we split the genome into blocks with length of about one million base pair (bp) and we got ∼3000 blocks in each sample. These blocks were further divided into five groups and a fivefold cross-validation was applied for the evaluation.</p>
      <p>Eventually, we selected the model with the highest accuracy, and utilized it to scan the genome with a stepwise one bp. Any site with coverage lower than 0.05 RPM at the upstream 100 bp was ignored. In this way, for each site, we used the window from upstream 100 bp to downstream 100 bp as input and obtained a score between 0 and 1.</p>
      <p>As the model was trained by randomly shifting from −12 to 12 bp to the true PAS, sites close to the true PAS would also get a relatively high score (&gt;0.5). To further find the precise position of the PAS and reduce the total number of the predicted sites, we introduced a clustering method to convert site-based score (Sc) to a cumulative cluster-based score (Cc). In brief, we first scanned the prediction score at each site in the forward direction based on genomic coordinates. The initial Cc was set as 0 and any continuous sites with prediction score higher than 0.5 were merged into the cluster and Cc would be accumulated with the prediction score of the site, whereas any sites with score lower than 0.5 would give a penalty P (default = 1) to Cc. The cluster was ended when Cc dropped to 0 and the site that obtained maximum Cc within each cluster was reported as the peak summit. We found that these summits showed a systematic bias toward the downstream of the true PAS. To correct this bias, we repeated the scanning in the reverse direction based on genomic coordinates, which reported summits showing bias toward the upstream of the true PAS. We finally used the middle position between the forward scanned summit and the backward scanned summit as the putative PAS.</p>

      <title>Benchmarking computational methods for APA analysis with 3′ end-seq data</title>
      <p>For APA identification, any predicted PAS within 25 bp away from the ground truth (annotated PAS with expression &gt; 0.1 RPM and usage &gt; 0.05) was considered as true positive, whereas any annotated PAS that is not expressed (RPM = 0) while covered with RNA-seq reads (average RPM at 100 bp upstream &gt; 0.05), and meanwhile not being detected by the method, was defined as true negative (TN). The false positives (FP) are those predicted PASs located &gt;25 bp away from the ground truth. A ROC curve was generated to illustrate the performance of APAIQ and four other methods, including Aptardi, DaPars2, mountainClimber, and SANPolyA. As SANPolyA is designed for binary classification, we did the prediction at each locus and implemented the same forward and backward scanning strategy to pinpoint the final PAS. As Aptardi scanned PAS with a 300 bp window and stepwise is 100 bp, we further relaxed the definition of TP and FP for those PASs within 100 bp and apart from the ground truth, respectively, and repeated the comparative analysis again.</p>
      <p>For APA quantification, we used the same metric, termed as error, as described in the previous study (<xref rid="GR277177LONC33" ref-type="bibr">Shah et al. 2021</xref>), to measure the concordance between the prediction of the PAS usage and the quantification from the 3′ end-seq. In brief, we calculated the usage of each PAS (PAU) by using its expression divided by the total expression of all the PASs from the corresponding gene. Next, the difference between the predicted PAU and the PAU quantified by 3′ end-seq was calculated (delta PAU). For each gene, error was derived by summing up the absolute value of delta PAU of all the PASs from each gene. Cumulative distribution of error among all the genes with multiple PASs was generated and the results from APAIQ were further compared to those from QAPA.</p>

      <title>Analysis of TCGA RNA-seq data with APAIQ</title>
      <p>RNA-seq data of 421 samples from the TCGA-LIHC cohort were downloaded from the Genomic Data Commons (GDC) using the GDC Data Transfer Tool (<uri xlink:href="https://gdc.cancer.gov/access-data/gdc-data-transfer-tool">https://gdc.cancer.gov/access-data/gdc-data-transfer-tool</uri>) and aligned to the reference human genome (hg38) using STAR (v2.7.9) with two pass model (<xref rid="GR277177LONC7" ref-type="bibr">Dobin et al. 2013</xref>). RNA-seq coverage at each genomic locus was derived from the BAM file by using BEDTools (<xref rid="GR277177LONC31" ref-type="bibr">Quinlan and Hall 2010</xref>). For each sample, APAIQ was conducted to predict the PAS, and any PASs detected in more than one sample were kept and merged to build a comprehensive reference. For each PAS in the reference, regression model was further applied to quantify the expression level.</p>
      <p>Based on the quantified expression level (TPM) of each PAS, we calculated the PAS usage (PAU). For each PAS in each gene, we divided the expression of the PAS by the sum of expression of all the PASs from this gene to get the PAU. To evaluate the effect of PAS usage on 3′ UTR length, instead of using all PASs, we calculated the usage only for the PAS located on the terminal exon (expression of the PAS divided by the sum of the expression of all the PASs located on the same terminal exon). We further defined weighted 3′ UTR length index (WULI) by using usage of each PAS within the terminal exon and their corresponding terminal exon length. In this way, each gene was assigned a WULI, which is a value from 0 to 1, and the larger value indicates that the isoforms with greater 3′ UTR length were used.</p>
      <p>We further compared PAU of each PAS or WULI of each gene in the 50 TCGA tumor samples to that in the 50 matched adjacent normal samples with Wilcoxon test. The Benjamini–Hochberg method was applied to adjust the <italic>P</italic>-values from multiple comparisons. The significant PAU or 3′ UTR changes were obtained by requiring the BH-adjusted <italic>P</italic>-value (FDR) to be smaller than 0.1. As we only used the matched tumor and normal samples from the same patient, the age, gender, ethnicity, and other variables are matched between tumor and normal samples, which are unlikely to confound the results.</p>
