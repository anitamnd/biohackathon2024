      <p id="Par1">Activation of regulatory elements is thought to be inversely correlated with DNA methylation levels. However, it is difficult to determine whether DNA methylation is compatible with chromatin accessibility or transcription factor (TF) binding if assays are performed separately. We developed a fast, low-input, low sequencing depth method, EpiMethylTag, that combines ATAC-seq or ChIP-seq (M-ATAC or M-ChIP) with bisulfite conversion, to simultaneously examine accessibility/TF binding and methylation on the same DNA. Here we demonstrate that EpiMethylTag can be used to study the functional interplay between chromatin accessibility and TF binding (CTCF and KLF4) at methylated sites.</p>

    <title>Introduction</title>
    <p id="Par2">The role of DNA methylation (DNAme) in gene regulation has been widely described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. In general, methylation is thought to reduce accessibility and prohibit TF binding at enhancers and promoters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Nevertheless, TFs are also known to bind methylated DNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], but due to limitations in the techniques available for this kind of analysis, few genome-wide studies have been performed. As a result, we still know very little about the DNA sequence and chromatin context of TF binding at methylated sites and its significance to gene regulation.</p>
    <p id="Par3">Several techniques have been developed to measure DNAme, some more comprehensive than others. Whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) covers all genomic regions; however, to achieve sufficient sequencing, coverage is costly. The alternative, reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS), which requires less sequencing depth, preferentially captures CpG-dense sequences known as CpG islands that can potentially act as regulatory elements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Nevertheless, both techniques require additional assays on different batches of cells to elucidate the interplay between DNAme, DNA accessibility, and TF binding, and this does not satisfactorily address the issue of compatibility. Current techniques that simultaneously analyze methylation together with TF binding or accessibility (NOME-seq [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], HT-SELEX [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], ChIP-bisulfite [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], BisChIP-seq [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], ChIP-BisSeq [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]) have drawbacks such as analysis of DNA rather than chromatin orÂ the requirement of large amounts of input DNA or high sequencing costs.</p>
    <p id="Par4">To circumvent the high input and sequencing expenses associated with WGBS and existing ChIP combined with bisulfite conversion protocols [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], we developed âEpiMethylTag.â This technique combines ATAC-seq or ChIPmentation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] with bisulfite conversion (M-ATAC or M-ChIP, respectively) to specifically determine the methylation status of accessible or TF-bound regions in a chromatin context. EpiMethylTag is based on an approach that was originally developed for tagmentation-based WGBS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. It involves use of the Tn5 transposase, loaded with adapters harboring cytosine methylation (AdditionalÂ fileÂ <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Table S1).</p>
    <p id="Par5">For M-ATAC or M-ChIP, tagmentation occurs respectively on nuclear lysates as per the conventional ATAC-seq protocol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], or during chromatin immunoprecipitation as per the ChIPmentation protocol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Following DNA purification, the sample is bisulfite converted and PCR amplified for downstream sequencing (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a). As shown in Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a, EpiMethylTag can determine whether DNAme and accessibility/TF binding are mutually exclusive (scenario 1) or can coexist in certain locations (scenario 2). The protocol requires lower levels of immunoprecipitated DNA, requires less sequencing depth, is quicker than existing methods, and can be analyzed using a pipeline we developed that is publicly available online on Github (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/skoklab/EpiMethylTag">https://github.com/skoklab/EpiMethylTag</ext-link>).

      <p id="Par6">M-ATAC and CTCF M-ChIP were performed in duplicate on murine embryonic stem cells (mESC). As controls, we collected aliquots before bisulfite conversion, ATAC-seq, and CTCF ChIPmentation with Nextera transposase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Sequencing metrics are shown in Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b and AdditionalÂ fileÂ <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Table S2. The price is around 10 times lower than WGBS given that fewer reads are necessary. As shown in Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> a and b, genome coverage was highly reproducible between M-ATAC replicates and highly correlated with regular ATAC-seq and M-ATAC signal before bisulfite treatment. Thus, bisulfite treatment, or the use of a different transposase does not result in signal bias. High reproducibility was also seen for CTCF M-ChIP, and we observed consistency between our results and data generated by CTCF ChIP-BisSeq, a similar technique that was performed using 100âng of immunoprecipitated DNA (as opposed to less than 1âng using our method) and sequenced more deeply at a higher cost [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a, b, AdditionalÂ fileÂ <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Table S2). Of note, bisulfite conversion does not affect the number of peaks detected, the Jaccard index of peak overlap (AdditionalÂ fileÂ <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S1a-b), or the signal within peaks (AdditionalÂ fileÂ <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S1c, Pearson correlations above 0.8), although it leads to shorter reads (AdditionalÂ fileÂ <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S2). Of note, average methylation was higher at the edges of the peaks than at the midpoint (AdditionalÂ fileÂ <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S3). Comparable DNA methylation levels were found in M-ATAC and CTCF M-ChIP replicates, Pearson correlationâ=â0.76 and 0.84, respectively (AdditionalÂ fileÂ <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S4a and S4b).

      <p id="Par7">In order to get higher coverage for subsequent DNA methylation analysis, peaks were called from merged M-ATAC and M-ChIP replicates and we focused our analysis only at CpGs within those peak regions covered by at least five reads, as methylation outside of M-ATAC and M-ChIP peaks has low coverage and is less reliable. We observe positive correlations between DNA methylation from WGBS and M-ATAC (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>c, top panel, Pearson correlationâ=â0.69) and between methylation levels in M-ChIP and WGBS (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>c, bottom panel, Pearson correlationâ=â0.74). Similar results were observed with the previously published CTCF ChIP-BisSeq method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] (GSE39739) (Pearson correlationâ=â0.83, AdditionalÂ fileÂ <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S4c) and when taking peaks that overlap between duplicates (AdditionalÂ fileÂ <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S4d-e). In Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b, we highlight the <italic>Klf4</italic> gene, which harbors a peak of chromatin accessibility in the promoter and CTCF binding in the intragenic region associated with low methylation from both EpiMethylTag and WGBS assays (left panel, and AdditionalÂ fileÂ <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Table S3). In contrast, the <italic>Pisd-ps1</italic> intragenic region contains accessible chromatin that coexists with high levels of DNA methylation as detected by both M-ATAC and WGBS (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b, middle panel). Of note, the methylation observed comes from a bedGraph file, output from Bismark (see â<xref rid="Sec9" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref>â section for details), which does not filter for cytosines with low read coverage. Therefore, high methylation observed in CTCF M-ChIP may not be reliable as this region harbors a weak CTCF signal with a low read coverage (AdditionalÂ fileÂ <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Table S4). Interestingly, a proportion of M-ATAC peaks exhibited an intermediate-to-high average methylation level in deeply sequenced WGBS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], but low methylation in M-ATAC (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>c, top panel, top left corner) as illustrated at the <italic>Slc5a8</italic> locus (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b, right panel, AdditionalÂ fileÂ <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Table S5). The peak highlighted within the <italic>Slc5a8</italic> locus harbors an average methylation of 18.685% for M-ATAC and 85.041% for WGBS. These data suggest that as expected open regions are less methylated than closed regions within a population of cells, but that accessibility and methylation can coexist at a small subset of genomic locations, which are depleted for promoter regions and associated with low transcription (AdditionalÂ fileÂ <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S4f-g). Importantly, M-ATAC is able to identify methylation levels within ATAC peaks, information that cannot be retrieved integrating data from separate WGBS and ATAC-seq experiments.</p>

      <title>M-ATAC reveals a complex interplay between accessible chromatin and DNA methylation</title>
      <p id="Par8">For further analysis, we separated CpGs in M-ATAC peaks according to percentage of methylation (low 0â20%, intermediate 20â80%, and high &gt;â80%) and read coverage (high &gt;â50 reads and low 5â50 reads) as follows: #1: Low methylation/High coverage (22,932 CpGs); #2: Low Methylation/Low coverage (1,348,931 CpGs); #3: Intermediate methylation/Low coverage (39,321 CpGs); #4: High methylation/Low coverage (1652 CpGs) (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a). As expected, coverage and methylation from M-ATAC are anticorrelated, and we did not detect any CpGs with intermediate or high methylation with high ATAC coverage (&gt;â50 reads). A similar pattern was observed while taking only CpGs present in peaks that overlap between M-ATAC replicates (AdditionalÂ fileÂ <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S5a). Of note, this pattern was not detected in WGBS where a more stable coverage is observed independent of methylation levels resulting in only three groups (Additional fileÂ <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S5b) as opposed to the four groups seen with methyl-ATAC (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a). CpGs in low methylation M-ATAC groups 1 and 2 were enriched at promoters, while CpGs in intermediate and high methylation M-ATAC groups 3 and 4 were enriched in intragenic and intergenic regions, as compared to the full set of M-ATAC peaks (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>b). The average methylation was more negatively correlated with transcriptional output for CpGs at promoters (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>c) than for intragenic CpGs (AdditionalÂ fileÂ <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S5c). Heatmaps for M-ATAC read coverage intensity highlight the reproducibility of signal between individual replicates. Merged replicates were used for downstream analysis (AdditionalÂ fileÂ <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S5d). Intriguingly, H3K4me1 showed a pronounced enrichment at CpGs with high levels of methylation (group 4) at promoter regions (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>d and AdditionalÂ fileÂ <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S5e). In contrast, H3K27ac and H3K4me3 were enriched at CpGs with low levels of methylation (groups 1 and 2), for both promoters and non-promoters.

      <title>CTCF M-ChIP enables analysis of DNA methylation of distinct CpGs in the CTCF motif</title>
      <p id="Par9">As a case study, CTCF M-ChIP was used to analyze the impact of DNAme on CTCF binding in M-ATAC peaks harboring a CTCF motif (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>a, top panel). M-ATAC groups 2 and 3 comprise the vast majority of CpGs, more CTCF peaks, motifs, and a proportionally higher number of CpGs within CTCF motifs (AdditionalÂ fileÂ <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S5f). However, the percentage of CpGs within CTCF motifs in each group is fairly constant: between 1.26 and 1.93% of CpGs). Of note, de novo CTCF motifs in CTCF ChIP-seq and Methyl-ChIP peaks were comparable to the MA0139.1 motif from the Jaspar database (AdditionalÂ fileÂ <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S6a). CTCF occupancy has been inversely correlated with DNA methylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. This finding is consistent with our analyses (AdditionalÂ fileÂ <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S6b-d). Although CTCF peaks are associated with all levels of CpG methylation within CTCF motifs, as illustrated in AdditionalÂ fileÂ <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S6e, the majority of CTCF peaks harbor reduced methylation (AdditionalÂ fileÂ <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S6f). In the context of CpGs in M-ATAC peaks, our data also demonstrates that the CTCF motif has an enriched CTCF intensity at CpGs with low and intermediate levels of methylation (groups 2 and 3) compared to CpGs with low and high levels of methylation (groups 1 and 4) (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>a, bottom panel). The highest binding is found in groups 2 and 3, compared to groups 1 and 4 that harbor reduced CTCF enrichment. Group 2 displays a wide range of accessibility (AdditionalÂ fileÂ <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S5d-e), with the most open regions of group 2 resembling group 1, and the most closed regions of this group being similar to that of group 3. Interestingly, even though there are more CpGs in CTCF motifs in group 1 compared to group 4 (AdditionalÂ fileÂ <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S5f, 288 versus 25 CpGs), group 1 shows a lower level of CTCF enrichment than group 4. This may be due to the confidence of attributing CpGs to a specific group. As shown in AdditionalÂ fileÂ <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S6g, for all clusters, more than half of the CpGs have a high probability of being in the assigned group (&gt;â72%). These data provide insight into CTCF binding and suggest an anticorrelation between high accessibility and high methylation.

      <p id="Par10">The MA0139.1 CTCF motif incorporates two CpGs: C2 and/or C12 (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>b, top panel). According to the CTCF logo, we identified more CpGs at position C12 than C2 in the CTCF M-ChIP peaks (4884 versus 921 CpGs, respectively, considering only the CpGs covered by at least 5 reads in both M-ChIP and WGBS). Consistent with the findings from a recent study that analyzed CTCF binding using oligonucleotides rather than genomic DNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], CTCF M-ChIP detected higher levels of methylation at C12 compared to C2 (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>b, bottom panel, compare CTCF M-ChIP C2 versus C12, <italic>p</italic> valueâ=â1.02eâ12). Importantly, CTCF M-ChIP is more suitable than WGBS for detecting the differences (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>b, bottom panel, compared to CTCF M-ChIP versus WGBS, <italic>p</italic> valueâ=â0.023). In addition, we found that bi-methylation at both CpGs within the same read is slightly enriched compared to what is expected by random chance (0.97% versus 0.05%) (AdditionalÂ fileÂ <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S7a, <italic>Ï</italic><sup>2</sup>â=â1531, <italic>p</italic> value &lt;â0.001). CTCF signal intensity is relatively comparable at the four combinations of methylation, with a slight increase for C2 being methylated and C12 unmethylated (AdditionalÂ fileÂ <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S7b); however, the biological significance of this remains to be determined.

      <title>KLF4 M-ChIP enables characterization of WT versus mutant KLF4 R462A binding</title>
      <p id="Par11">Pioneer transcription factors need to access target genes that are inaccessible and whose enhancer and promoter sequences may be methylated. A recent study has shown that a minority of transcription factors (47 out of 1300 examined) including KLF4 can bind to methylated CpG sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. A scatter plot of KLF4 M-ChIP in WT mESC shows that the majority of CpGs in KLF4 peaks display low peak intensity and low methylation (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>c). However, in contrast to CTCF, the small fraction of peaks with the highest peak intensity also display the highest methylation levels. The study mentioned above [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] revealed that distinct zinc fingers on KLF4 mediate KLF4âs binding activity with methylated and unmethylated DNA. Residue arginine 458 on human KLF4 was shown to be important for binding to the methylated motif CCmCpGCC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] (similar to the Jaspar motif MA0039.2 for mouse KLF4). In the mouse protein, the equivalent arginine residue lies at position 462.</p>
      <p id="Par12">In order to investigate the binding of KLF4 to methylated DNA, we used <italic>Klf4</italic><sup>â/â</sup> mESC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] that express either a WT or mutant version of KLF4 in which arginine 462 has been replaced by alanine (R462A) (AdditionalÂ fileÂ <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S8a-b). We performed KLF4 M-ChIP in both WT and mutant expressing mESC in duplicates. Intersections between replicates were used to identify peaks specific to (i) WT or (ii) mutant versions of KLF4 and (iii) those that were common to both (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>d). Heatmaps confirm the binding specificity of the two versions of KLF4 and reveal the high reproducibility between duplicates (AdditionalÂ fileÂ <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S8c).</p>
      <p id="Par13">We searched for mouse KLF4 motifs from the Jaspar database, using the FIMO tool from the MEME suite. The two motifs that were identified, MA0039.2 and MA0039.1, can be distinguished by the presence and absence of a CpG dinucleotide, respectively (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>e, top). The wild-type version of KLF4 has a strong preference for motif MA0039.2 while the mutant loses this preference. Overall, the mutant protein has reduced binding to both motifs (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>e, bottom).</p>
      <p id="Par14">Because of the low numbers of consensus KLF4 motifs in common and KLF4 mutant-specific peaks, we decided to focus our downstream analysis only on WT-specific peaks. M-ATAC experiments conducted in duplicates in both WT and Mutant KLF4 expressing cells show that KLF4 peaks present only in the WT condition are accessible, while Mutant only KLF4 peaks are found at inaccessible sites (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>f). This result together with the motif findings (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>e) suggests that the Mutant KLF4 binding alone occurs at inaccessible sites where there is no consensus KLF4 motif. Thus, this mutation abrogates binding at consensus KLF4 motifs. The functional significance of binding of Mutant KLF4 at ectopic sites remains to be investigated. WT-specific KLF4 peaks harbor similar DNA accessibility in both WT and Mutant conditions so it is not clear why the Mutant protein does not bind. To investigate, we analyzed DNA methylation at these sites using M-ATAC, M-ChIP, and public WGBS from WT mESC. The levels of methylation obtained from M-ATAC were also compared for cells expressing WT and Mutant KLF4 within the WT-specific KLF4 M-ChIP peaks. In the scatter plots shown in Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>g and AdditionalÂ fileÂ <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S8d, most of the CpGs display low levels of methylation in any condition (bottom left corner). Thus, methylation levels do not explain the absence of Mutant KLF4 binding at these sites.</p>

    <title>Discussion</title>
    <p id="Par15">We developed a new method, âEpiMethylTag,â that allows the simultaneous analysis of DNA methylation with ChIP-seq or ATAC-seq. EpiMethylTag can be used to analyze the methylation status and coincident accessibility or binding of other chromatin-bound transcription factors. Importantly our approach is a fast, low-input, low sequencing depth method that can be used for smaller cell populations than existing methods and can be adapted for rare cell populations. Specifically, our M-ChIP protocol significantly reduces the input for DNA-binding factors such as CTCF. The only published genome-wide ChIP-Bis-Seq for CTCF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] used 100âng of immunoprecipitated DNA. Using a Tn5 transposase successfully allowed us to use less than 1âng of immunoprecipitated DNA followed by bisulfite conversion. The number of cells required to obtain 1âng of ChIPped DNA will vary depending on the protocol and the antibody used. ChIP-bisulfite [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] and BisChIP-seq [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] use lower cell numbers for H3K27me3. However, such histone modifications in general require less cells for ChIP thanÂ TFs such as CTCF or KLF4 because they cover a higher portion of the genome. Although it has not been tested, our protocol may also lower the number of cells required for M-ChIP of histone modifications.</p>
    <p id="Par16">EpiMethylTag confirmed that as a general rule, DNA methylation rarely coexists with DNA accessibility or TF binding. Nonetheless, we found M-ATAC peaks of low signal intensity that overlapped with DNA methylation. These peaks were located predominantly in intragenic and intergenic regions and associated with low transcriptional output at gene promoters. This data identifies a class of promoters with high accessibility, high levels of methylation, high H3K4me1, low K3K4me3, and low H3K27ac (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>d). The biological relevance of such âpoised promoters,â remains to be determined.</p>
    <p id="Par17">Of note, a recent publication used the same design for the Methyl-ATAC aspect of EpiMethylTag method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. As with our approach, they show that mATAC-seq detects methylation patterns that agree with both WGBS and Omni-ATAC (improved normal ATAC-seq [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]). By comparing parental withÂ DNMT1 and DNMT3B double knockout HCT116 cells, they identified ATAC peaks with increased accessibility that were bound by TFs only in the demethylated cells. However, they did not adapt their approach to analysis of methylated ChIP-seq peaks as we have done. Here we used M-ChIP to characterize the binding of both CTCF and KLF4 to motifs in the context of DNA methylation.</p>
    <p id="Par18">Methylation within CTCF motifs is known to be anticorrelated with CTCF binding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Our analysis revealed that M-ATAC peaks containing a CTCF motif have an enriched CTCF intensity at CpGs with intermediate levels of methylation as opposed to low and high levels of methylation. In addition, CTCF M-ChIP revealed that methylation at CpG C2 is lower than at CpG C12, a finding that suggests methylation at C2 could have a stronger negative impact on CTCF binding than methylation at C12. Differences of this sort could not be detected by integrating CTCF ChIP-seq with WGBS (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>b).</p>
    <p id="Par19">We further demonstrate that M-ChIP could be used to characterize the profiles and methylation status of common WT and mutant KLF4 R462A binding sites. Methylation levels do not explain the absence of Mutant KLF4 binding at these sites, and it appears that the mutant does not bind the consensus motif so we cannot investigate the relationship between methylation in the KLF4 motif and binding of WT versus Mutant KLF4 (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>f, g). While the biological significance of such differences remains to be investigated, our data demonstrate that EpiMethylTag can be used to provide information about the methylation status of the binding sites for WT and mutant proteins. This information could not be obtained by performing separate methylation and ChIP-seq experiments.</p>

    <title>Conclusion</title>
    <p id="Par20">In sum, M-ATAC and CTCF M-ChIP demonstrate a complex interplay between accessible chromatin, DNA methylation, and TF binding that could not be detected by WGBS. EpiMethylTag can be used to provide information about the DNA sequence and chromatin context of TF binding at methylated sites and its significance to gene regulation and biological processes. This technique can also be adapted for single-cell analysis.</p>

Finally, the cells were pre-seeded (30Â min) to remove the feeders, and the ES cells were processed as described in the â<xref rid="Sec10" ref-type="sec">Cell culture</xref>â section. KLF4 protein expression has been checked by western blot using an antibody from Santa Cruz (#sc-20691, now discontinued) and using H3 as a loading control (anti-H3, Abcam, ab1791).</p>

ChIP-seq for histone modifications in mESC were downloaded from GEO (H3K4me1: GSM1000121, H3K27ac: GSM1000126, H3K4me3: GSM1000124).

Heatmaps and average profiles were performed on merged bigwig files using Deeptools/2.3.3. Default parameters from Bismark/0.18.1 (Bowtie2) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] were used to generate coverage files containing methylation information. Only cytosines in a CpG context were used for subsequent analysis. For Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>d and AdditionalÂ fileÂ <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S5d, e, the plots were centered on CpGs in M-ATAC peaks from the different groups highlighted in Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a. For Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>a, lists of CpGs were subsampled using BEDTools [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] to consider only the CpGs inside CTCF motifs, and the average plots were centered on those CpGs. Genomic annotations were performed using ChIPseeker [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. CTCF motif locations in CTCF M-ChIP/ChIP and M-ATAC, and KLF4 motifs in M-ChIP peaks were determined using the FIMO tool from MEME [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], with the motif PWM from Jaspar database (MA0139.1 for CTCF and MA0039.1 and MA0039.2 for KLF4). PWM was manually modified to look at methylation frequency at different combinations of C2 and C12 dinucleotides of CTCF motif. Scripts are available on Github (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/skoklab/EpiMethylTag">https://github.com/skoklab/EpiMethylTag</ext-link>). In order to account for possible lack of specificity of the anti-KLF4 antibody, we filtered out ChIP-seq peaks present in <italic>Klf4</italic><sup><italic>â/â</italic></sup> cells. Peaks shared or specific to either WT or mutant KLF4 were identified using BEDTools [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. For the ChIP enrichment versus CpG methylation plots, we plotted the peak score versus the beta values of the CpG probes within the peaks, using peaks called via MACS2 for CTCF (AdditionalÂ fileÂ <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S6b) and via PeaKDEck for KLF4 (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>c).</p>
      <p id="Par34">To quantify the probability of clustering CpG probes into low, medium, and highly methylated groups, we assumed that beta values (i.e., the sampling mean) are normally distributed with the mean beta value (<italic>b</italic>) and variance (<italic>b</italic> (1âââ<italic>b</italic>))/((<italic>n</italic>âââ1)) where <italic>n</italic> is the total number of reads. This allows us to quantify the probability that each probe belongs to its designated cluster as <italic>P</italic>(<italic>b</italic>â&lt;â<italic>C</italic><sub><italic>h</italic></sub>)âââ<italic>P</italic>(<italic>b</italic>â&lt;â<italic>C</italic><sub><italic>l</italic></sub>) where <italic>C</italic><sub><italic>h</italic></sub> and <italic>C</italic><sub><italic>l</italic></sub> are the high and low thresholds of the cluster respectively. In AdditionalÂ fileÂ <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S6g, the points and corresponding contours are colored based on their designated cluster. The <italic>x</italic>-axis is the beta value and the <italic>y</italic>-axis is the probability that beta lies within the cluster limits. For all clusters, more than half of the CpGs have a high probability of being in the assigned group (&gt;â72%).</p>
