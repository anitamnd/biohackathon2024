      <p>Molecular beacons are nucleic acid oligomers labeled with a fluorophore and a quencher that fold in a hairpin-shaped structure, which fluoresce only when bound to their target RNA. They are used for the visualization of endogenous mRNAs in live cells. Here, we report a Python program (<italic>PinMol</italic>) that designs molecular beacons best suited for live cell imaging by using structural information from secondary structures of the target RNA, predicted via energy minimization approaches. <italic>PinMol</italic> takes into account the accessibility of the targeted regions, as well as the inter- and intramolecular interactions of each selected probe. To demonstrate its applicability, we synthesized an <italic>oskar</italic> mRNA-specific molecular beacon (osk1236), which is selected by <italic>PinMol</italic> to target a more accessible region than a manually designed <italic>oskar</italic>-specific molecular beacon (osk2216). We previously demonstrated osk2216 to be efficient in detecting <italic>oskar</italic> mRNA in in vivo experiments. Here, we show that osk1236 outperformed osk2216 in live cell imaging experiments.</p>

    <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
    <p>Currently, there are a few methods that are used to image RNA in live tissues and cells, and each has its advantages and disadvantages (<xref rid="RNA069542BAYC29" ref-type="bibr">Weil et al. 2010</xref>). We use the molecular beacon technology for live cell imaging of mRNA transport and localization in the fruit fly egg chamber (<xref rid="RNA069542BAYC2" ref-type="bibr">Bratu et al. 2003</xref>). Molecular beacons are oligonucleotides labeled with a fluorophore at the 5′ end and a quencher at the 3′ end that are designed to fold into a hairpin shape (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="RNA069542BAYF1">Fig. 1</xref>). In this study, we use the terms “probe” and “stem” to refer to the loop or single-stranded region of the hairpin with a sequence complementary to the mRNA target (18–26 nucleotides [nt]), and to the double-stranded region (five G/C-rich base pairs), respectively. In the presence of target, the hybridization of the probe region with the target is energetically more favorable than preserving the duplex in the stem, which leads to the separation of the fluorophore/quencher pair and a significant increase in the fluorescence signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="RNA069542BAYF1">Fig. 1</xref>). One major advantage of using this technology is that molecular beacons allow direct visualization of endogenous mRNAs. However, not many groups have reported in vivo mRNA imaging using molecular beacons. One reason is the difficulty in finding an efficient delivery method for the chosen live specimen. We have successfully introduced nuclease-resistant molecular beacons in fruit fly egg chambers via microinjection, to study transport and localization of endogenous maternal mRNAs (<xref rid="RNA069542BAYC2" ref-type="bibr">Bratu et al. 2003</xref>). Others have described the use of toxin-based membrane permeabilization and microporation for efficient cytoplasmic delivery of molecular beacons (<xref rid="RNA069542BAYC7" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al. 2011</xref>), and more recently, gold nanoparticles were shown to efficiently deliver molecular beacons into live breast cancer cells for multiplex detection of mRNAs (<xref rid="RNA069542BAYC11" ref-type="bibr">Jackson et al. 2016</xref>). Another reason for the limited in vivo use of molecular beacons is the challenge to design them, as several properties need to be optimized to ensure specific and efficient detection of the target RNA. Here, we describe a new open-source Python-based application that allows fast and easy prediction of molecular beacons tailored for live cell imaging.</p>

However, freely available programs for designing molecular beacons focus on their application for quantitative PCR (qPCR) primer design and analysis, and they usually limit the target region to less than 1200 bases (<xref rid="RNA069542BAYTB1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).</p>

        <p>To assess target-site accessibility, it is common to evaluate the predicted secondary structure of the RNA target of interest, which is generated using either phylogenetic analysis or free energy minimization algorithms. The efficiency of a candidate probe is directly correlated to the accuracy of the predicted secondary structure of the target RNA. When using results from free energy minimization algorithms, it is recommended to consider the global structure of a target RNA rather than a local structure prediction of a limited region within that target (<xref rid="RNA069542BAYC16" ref-type="bibr">Lu and Mathews 2008a</xref>). <italic>mfold</italic>, a software commonly used to predict the secondary structure of nucleic acids using experimentally derived thermodynamic parameters, yields a minimum free energy (MFE) structure and a user-selected number of suboptimal (SO) structures (<xref rid="RNA069542BAYC30" ref-type="bibr">Zuker 2003</xref>). <italic>mfold</italic>, <italic>RNAstructure</italic>, and the Vienna <italic>RNAfold</italic> package use similar algorithms, and although they use different sets of RNA thermodynamic parameters (<italic>mfold</italic>: 1999 Turner set; <italic>RNAstructure</italic>: 2004 Turner set; Vienna <italic>RNAfold</italic>: choice of 1999 or subset of 2004 Turner set, 2007 Andronescu set) that result in slightly different predictions, their accuracy in performance are comparable. <italic>mfold</italic> and <italic>RNAstructure</italic> predict MFE and suboptimal RNA secondary structures, while the <italic>RNAfold</italic> generates an MFE secondary structure (<xref rid="RNA069542BAYC30" ref-type="bibr">Zuker 2003</xref>; <xref rid="RNA069542BAYC24" ref-type="bibr">Reuter and Mathews 2010</xref>; <xref rid="RNA069542BAYC15" ref-type="bibr">Lorenz et al. 2011</xref>). <italic>PinMol</italic> uses as input the “ss-count” file generated by <italic>mfold</italic> upon folding the RNA target sequence of interest. This file lists, for each nucleotide in the target RNA, the number of structures out of the total number predicted (comprising the MFE and suboptimal structures) in which the corresponding nucleotide is single-stranded.</p>

        <title><italic>PinMol</italic> probe ranking and selection</title>
        <p>Initially, all possible probes for the user-selected probe length are sorted according to a target “ss-count fraction” (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="RNA069542BAYF2">Fig. 2</xref>: <italic>#4</italic>, “sort by ss-count fraction,” “<italic>all_probes_ sorted_ss.csv</italic>”).

</p>
        <p>Therefore, <italic>f</italic><sub>ss-count</sub> is equal to one for a fully single-stranded target region, and zero for a fully double-stranded target region. From these sorted probes, the program filters out the probes with a percentage of GC nucleotides smaller than 31 or greater than 55 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="RNA069542BAYF2">Fig. 2</xref>: <italic>#6</italic>, “skip”; <xref rid="RNA069542BAYC3" ref-type="bibr">Bratu et al. 2011</xref>). For the probes that meet these requirements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="RNA069542BAYF2">Fig. 2</xref>: <italic>#5</italic>, “filter for 30 &lt; %GC &lt; 56”), <italic>PinMol</italic> calculates the free energy of unimolecular (ΔG<sub>unimol</sub>) and bimolecular (ΔG<sub>bimol</sub>) folding using the <italic>oligoscreen</italic> subroutine of the <italic>RNAstructure</italic> text interface application (<xref rid="RNA069542BAYC19" ref-type="bibr">Mathews 2006</xref>; <xref rid="RNA069542BAYC24" ref-type="bibr">Reuter and Mathews 2010</xref>).
</p>
        <p>Molecular beacons used in live cell imaging experiments are often synthesized with a 2′-<italic>O</italic>-methyl RNA (2′OMe) modified backbone to ensure resistance to cellular nucleases. Therefore, we used RNA parameters to calculate folding free energies, as they more closely match 2′OMe/RNA hybridization profiles when compared to DNA parameters (<xref rid="RNA069542BAYC27" ref-type="bibr">Tsourkas et al. 2002</xref>). To find probes with maximum efficiency for target detection, <italic>PinMol</italic> filters out probes that have a ΔG<sub>unimol</sub> ≤ −2.5 kcal/mol and ΔG<sub>bimol</sub> ≤ −7.5 kcal/mol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="RNA069542BAYF2">Fig. 2</xref>: <italic>#6</italic>, “skip”), in order to minimize probe-target hybridization constraints that might be imposed by a highly structured probe region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="RNA069542BAYF2">Fig. 2</xref>: <italic>#5</italic>, “ΔGuni &gt; −2.5 and ΔGbi &gt; −7.5”).</p>

        <title>Stem design (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="RNA069542BAYF2">Fig. 2</xref>: #12, “stem design/Final Probes”)</title>
        <p>After the probes have been selected, the stem is designed to form five G/C-rich base pairs. The program takes into consideration if any of the end nucleotides of the selected probe sequence are complementary to each other (up to three on each end), in which case the stem is adjusted to incorporate them. This means that when such complementarity is found, the probe region that is single-stranded may be shorter than the originally selected probe length.</p>
        <p>The <italic>PinMol</italic> stem design function also searches for possible complementarity of the newly added stem sequence with the selected probe sequence. When such complementarity is found, the stem sequence is redesigned to ensure that the molecular beacon will fold into a hairpin shape. After the stem is added, each probe is folded and the MFE structure is drawn using the <italic>fold</italic> and <italic>draw</italic> subroutines of <italic>RNAstructure</italic>, respectively (<xref rid="RNA069542BAYC19" ref-type="bibr">Mathews 2006</xref>; <xref rid="RNA069542BAYC24" ref-type="bibr">Reuter and Mathews 2010</xref>). Highly structured molecular beacons are discarded by filtering out the structures with a folding MFE ≤ −7.2 kcal/mol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="RNA069542BAYF2">Fig. 2</xref>). In addition, a few molecular beacons that do not fold in the desired hairpin conformation can be obtained, especially for shorter probe lengths. Therefore, after the above described filtering steps, <italic>PinMol</italic> also filters out probes for which the first and the last nucleotides of the molecular beacon sequence are not base-paired in the MFE structure listed in the corresponding “ct” output files generated by the <italic>fold</italic> subroutine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="RNA069542BAYF2">Fig. 2</xref>: <italic>#12</italic>, “Final Probes,” “<italic>Final_molecular_beacons.csv</italic>,” “<italic>Seqi.ct</italic>,” and “<italic>Seqi.svg</italic>”).</p>
        <p>Although <italic>PinMol</italic> does not include the selection of the fluorophore/quencher pair, when designing molecular beacons it should also be taken into consideration that some pairs have a stabilizing effect (e.g., for the same molecular beacon sequence Cy5/BHQ-2 increases the melting temperature [Tm] by 5°C as compared to Cy5/Dabcyl) (<xref rid="RNA069542BAYC18" ref-type="bibr">Marras et al. 2002</xref>).</p>

        <p>To define an optimum number of probes without limiting the <italic>f</italic><sub>ss-count</sub>, we determined the number of probes that have a <italic>f</italic><sub>ss-count</sub> &gt; 0.5 for <italic>oskar</italic> (<italic>osk</italic>) mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="RNA069542BAYF3">Fig. 3</xref>A), a maternal mRNA that we have successfully visualized in live fruit fly egg chambers using molecular beacons (<xref rid="RNA069542BAYC2" ref-type="bibr">Bratu et al. 2003</xref>; <xref rid="RNA069542BAYC22" ref-type="bibr">Mhlanga et al. 2009</xref>; <xref rid="RNA069542BAYC5" ref-type="bibr">Catrina et al. 2016</xref>). We determined the <italic>f</italic><sub>ss-count</sub> for all <italic>osk</italic> probes with a probe length ranging between 14 and 28 nt using target structural information from two different <italic>PinMol</italic> input files, which were obtained with <italic>mfold</italic> (MFE, 31STR). The maximum number of <italic>osk</italic> probes with a <italic>f</italic><sub>ss-count</sub> &gt; 0.5 was obtained for the 31STR input for a probe length of 14 nt (725 probes). The minimum number of <italic>osk</italic> probes with a <italic>f</italic><sub>ss-count</sub> &gt; 0.5 was obtained for the 31STR input for a probe length of 28 nt (511 probes). We found that limiting the number of probes to 50, although it may reduce the number of unique probes, ensures a high <italic>f</italic><sub>ss-count</sub> for target RNAs of an average length (e.g., 2200 nt for mammalian mRNAs). For shorter RNA targets, we recommend that the <italic>f</italic><sub>ss-count</sub> corresponding to the regions targeted by the selected molecular beacons be evaluated on a case-by-case basis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="RNA069542BAYF2">Fig. 2</xref>: <italic>#5</italic>, “<italic>probes_ sortedby5.csv</italic>” output file).</p>

        <p>Next, we determined the number of probes for <italic>osk</italic> mRNA that meet the GC-content (GC-probes) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="RNA069542BAYF2">Fig. 2</xref>: <italic>#5</italic>, “<italic>GC_probes.csv</italic>” output file), or both the GC-content and the folding energy (ΔG-probes) requirements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="RNA069542BAYF2">Fig. 2</xref>: <italic>#5</italic>, “<italic>probes_sortedby5.csv</italic>” output file), as described above, for probe lengths between 14 and 28 nt (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="RNA069542BAYF3">Fig. 3</xref>B), and we found that more than 50 probes meet all the design criteria, for each probe length. Since probes are not selected or eliminated based on their <italic>f</italic><sub>ss-count</sub>, the number of probes that meet the GC-content requirement, or meet the GC-content and energetic requirements was independent of the number of structures taken into consideration in the input file (MFE or 31STR) used to run <italic>PinMol</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="RNA069542BAYF3">Fig. 3</xref>A vs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RNA069542BAYF3">3</xref>B).</p>

      <title>Cross homology with other RNAs</title>
      <p>In microarray assays using 50 nt-long oligonucleotides, in order to avoid false-positive signals, the maximum allowed cross complementarity is 16 consecutive nucleotides (<xref rid="RNA069542BAYC10" ref-type="bibr">He et al. 2005</xref>). From studies with mismatched molecular beacons, it was shown that the molecular beacon/target hybrids are destabilized even with a single nucleotide mismatch, usually placed in the center of the probe sequence (<xref rid="RNA069542BAYC28" ref-type="bibr">Tyagi et al. 1998</xref>; <xref rid="RNA069542BAYC6" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al. 2007</xref>). When considering that the maximum probe length allowed by <italic>PinMol</italic> is 26 nt, such overlap should be less than 13 consecutive nucleotides for molecular beacons of maximum probe length, and this requirement can be relaxed for molecular beacons with probe lengths shorter than 26 nt. Additional information, specific to the model system of interest, should also be taken into consideration. For example, when imaging transcripts expressed in the fruit fly ovary, any homology overlap with other mRNAs not expressed in this tissue can be disregarded. Although <italic>PinMol</italic> includes an optional ranking of the chosen probes using the “xml” output file from a BLAST alignment search, it does not take into account the cell/tissue expression levels of the target. The probe ranking using BLAST alignment results is performed after the desired number of probes are selected, thus these probes are re-sorted in ascending order of the maximum number of positives found for a complementary match between each of the selected probe sequences and an mRNA other than the target of interest. Therefore, this feature is convenient when designing probes targeting ubiquitously expressed mRNAs, but may not be needed if the target mRNA has tissue-restricted expression levels. <italic>PinMol</italic> generates a file containing a list of the selected number of probes in the “FASTA” format (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="RNA069542BAYF2">Fig. 2</xref>: <italic>#9</italic>, “<italic>blast_picks.fasta</italic>” output file), which can be uploaded in the NCBI BLAST form. For mRNA targets, “<italic>blastn</italic>” search is recommended, using the reference RNA sequences or refseq_rna database for the organism of interest and default parameters. For other RNA targets, the “<italic>blastn</italic>” search with the nucleotide collection (nr/nt) and default parameters should be used, as the program will prematurely terminate if it does not find at least one fully complementary match to each probe sequence.</p>
      <p><italic>PinMol</italic> provides ranks of the selected number of probes before and after BLAST alignment. Therefore, if BLAST is performed for the chosen probes, it is recommended that the target's tissue expression level for the corresponding organism is also taken into consideration, and that probes that are ranked based on cross homology results are carefully compared with the pre-BLAST ranking results. This comparison will identify candidate probes that rank highly before BLAST, but which are placed lower on the list after BLAST due to a cross homology with an mRNA that is not expressed in the tissue of interest.</p>

      <title>Comparison with experimental data</title>
      <p>Molecular beacons have been demonstrated to be highly specific probes, which are able to discriminate against a single nucleotide mismatch between a probe and a target region (<xref rid="RNA069542BAYC28" ref-type="bibr">Tyagi et al. 1998</xref>; <xref rid="RNA069542BAYC2" ref-type="bibr">Bratu et al. 2003</xref>). A false-positive signal resulting from a probe hybridizing to a different target is likely to occur in conditions where such mismatches are tolerated. These conditions are minimized in classical RNA-FISH (fluorescence in situ hybridization) experiments by using denaturing reagents and increasing the experimental temperature. However, for shorter probes, such as molecular beacons (18–26 nt), the penalty for mismatches greatly increases, and when combined with the energy requirement to open the stem of a hairpin, it allows for specific hybridization at physiological conditions, with target accessibility as the limiting factor.</p>
      <sec id="s2c1">
        <title>Molecular beacons specific to <italic>osk</italic> mRNA</title>
        <p>We have successfully visualized and analyzed <italic>osk</italic> mRNA transport and localization within the <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> egg chamber using fluorescence confocal microscopy coupled with molecular beacons (<xref rid="RNA069542BAYC22" ref-type="bibr">Mhlanga et al. 2009</xref>). The <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> egg chamber goes through 14 stages of development, from germarium to stage 14, and it is composed of somatic (follicle) and germline (one oocyte and 15 nurse cells) cells (<xref rid="RNA069542BAYC21" ref-type="bibr">McLaughlin and Bratu 2015</xref>). Several mRNAs have been reported to asymmetrically localize in the oocyte during oogenesis, and these processes are essential for the development and survival of the future embryo (<xref rid="RNA069542BAYC13" ref-type="bibr">Lasko 2012</xref>). <italic>osk</italic> mRNA is responsible for germplasm determination (<xref rid="RNA069542BAYC8" ref-type="bibr">Ephrussi et al. 1991</xref>), and it is one of the most studied mRNAs in fruit flies. It is actively transported from the nurse cells, and localized and anchored at the oocyte's posterior during mid- and late oogenesis (stages 7–9) (<xref rid="RNA069542BAYC8" ref-type="bibr">Ephrussi et al. 1991</xref>; <xref rid="RNA069542BAYC12" ref-type="bibr">Kim-Ha et al. 1991</xref>). Therefore, we selected <italic>osk</italic> mRNA as our target mRNA to compare the ranking of molecular beacons designed using <italic>PinMol</italic> with our previously manually designed molecular beacons (<xref rid="RNA069542BAYC2" ref-type="bibr">Bratu et al. 2003</xref>), using both in vitro and in vivo experiments.</p>
        <p>After design, synthesis, and purification, the performance of a molecular beacon that is to be used in live cell imaging experiments is characterized by analyzing its (i) thermal denaturation profile and (ii) hybridization reaction with a complementary DNA oligonucleotide target and/or in vitro transcribed mRNA target. The thermal denaturation indicates whether the molecular beacon is properly folded into a hairpin shape, while the hybridization analysis estimates the binding efficiency of the probe to its target, as well as the fluorescence signal-to-background ratio (<xref rid="RNA069542BAYC3" ref-type="bibr">Bratu et al. 2011</xref>). The efficiency to hybridize with the target of molecular beacons that were manually designed to target several distinct regions within <italic>osk</italic> mRNA was determined using in vitro hybridization reactions with in vitro transcribed and folded full-length <italic>osk</italic> mRNA (<xref rid="RNA069542BAYTB2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>; <xref rid="RNA069542BAYC2" ref-type="bibr">Bratu et al. 2003</xref>).</p>

        <p>We also compared the top ten 24-nt-long probe sequences designed when using MFE or 31STR input files with previous experimental results, and found that probes selected for 31STR were from four different regions (10s, 1200s, 2200s, and 2800s) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="RNA069542BAYF5">Fig. 5</xref>B). Overall, our analysis suggests that the ranking of <italic>PinMol</italic> designed molecular beacons was better aligned with experimental data when 30SO structures were considered in addition to the MFE structure (<xref rid="RNA069542BAYTB2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RNA069542BAYF4">Fig. 4</xref>). Moreover, the <italic>PinMol</italic> rank of the top experimental probe improved when using 31STR versus MFE (<xref rid="RNA069542BAYTB2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>; osk2216), while probes with poor experimental performance were eliminated during the filtering steps (<xref rid="RNA069542BAYTB2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>; osk544, osk1853, and osk1667).</p>
        <p>For detection of low abundance targets, it may be necessary to increase the number of fluorophores per RNA molecule by using multiple molecular beacons that bind to different regions along the target RNA. We found that the 50 designed probes were almost entirely encompassed within 10, strongly supported experimentally, and predicted to be accessible regions (each 100 nt long) of <italic>osk</italic> mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="RNA069542BAYF4">Fig. 4</xref>). This indicates that our program selected some “redundant” probes that showed differences of only a few nucleotides (e.g., osk2216 and osk2215). While it may be tempting to eliminate these redundant probes, we advise that this should not be done prior to performing BLAST alignment for determining cross homology with other mRNAs. Moreover, it should be considered that the <italic>f</italic><sub>ss-count</sub> value decreases for probes ranked low in the initially filtered probe list (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="RNA069542BAYF2">Fig. 2</xref>: <italic>#8</italic>, “<italic>DG_probes.csv</italic>” <italic>PinMol</italic> output file). Although the stem design is limited to 50 total probes, <italic>PinMol</italic> saves the intermediate files containing all sorted probes after filtering (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="RNA069542BAYF2">Fig. 2</xref>: <italic>#5</italic>, “<italic>probes_sortedby5.cvs</italic>”), which can be used to further inspect the results, and if desired, to select smaller target regions, and then to redesign the probes.</p>
        <p>As an example, we selected the region between 1301 and 1600 nt of <italic>osk</italic> mRNA, for which 24 nt-long probes were not selected in the top 50 probes designed using <italic>PinMol</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="RNA069542BAYF5">Fig. 5</xref>A). For this region, when using 31STR as input file the total number of possible probes that are 24 nt-long was 278, out of which 231 met the GC-content requirement, and of which 36 also met the folding energy requirements, but only 15 probes had a <italic>f</italic><sub>ss-count</sub> &gt; 0.5. The top choice before applying any filters was at base number 1381 with a <italic>f</italic><sub>ss-count</sub> of only 0.547, which was ranked 324th in the list of all probes sorted in descending order by <italic>f</italic><sub>ss-count</sub>, but osk1381 was eliminated during the initial filtering steps. The final top choice for this region was the probe at base number 1308, with a <italic>f</italic><sub>ss-count</sub> of 0.520, and ranked 448th when considering all the probes sorted by <italic>PinMol</italic> for the full-length target <italic>osk</italic> mRNA. Our analysis showed that even the best molecular beacon that <italic>PinMol</italic> designed for this region targets a stretch that consists of single-stranded nucleotides for only approximately half of its length. This confirms that the selected target region was predicted to be highly structured, and therefore it is not suitable for targeting <italic>osk</italic> mRNA in both in vitro and in vivo experiments.</p>

      <title>Optimizing the molecular beacon design for live cell imaging</title>
      <p>Ideally, when designing molecular beacons for live cell imaging experiments, the in vivo target mRNA secondary structure should be taken into consideration when selecting the probe sequence. While in vivo mapping has been proven useful in determining mRNA secondary structure in live cells and tissues (<xref rid="RNA069542BAYC20" ref-type="bibr">Mathews et al. 2004</xref>; <xref rid="RNA069542BAYC25" ref-type="bibr">Rouskin et al. 2014</xref>), due to the scarcity of such data, molecular beacon design relies on mRNA secondary structures predicted via free energy minimization approaches. Moreover, it was reported that active unfolding of mRNA structures occurs in vivo (<xref rid="RNA069542BAYC25" ref-type="bibr">Rouskin et al. 2014</xref>). For <italic>osk</italic> mRNA probe design, when including structural information from 31STR versus MFE, <italic>PinMol</italic> allowed identification of additional regions that are viable targets in in vivo experiments, by taking into consideration the mRNA's folding flexibility.</p>
      <p>Three popular RNA folding programs, <italic>mfold</italic>, <italic>RNAstructure</italic>, and Vienna <italic>RNAfold</italic>, use different thermodynamic parameter sets and therefore, do not predict identical structures, but they are accepted to have similar prediction accuracies. As a consequence, probe ranking using <italic>PinMol</italic> is also expected to differ when using input files generated with each of these programs. However, regardless of the program used to generate the <italic>PinMol</italic> input file, valid molecular beacon candidates will be obtained. Although we recommend using the ss-count file generated by <italic>mfold</italic>, analyzing and comparing target structures predicted by both <italic>mfold</italic> and <italic>RNAstructure</italic> may reveal regions that are consistently predicted to be more accessible, which will maximize the chances of designing highly efficient molecular beacons for live cell imaging experiments. <italic>RNAstructure</italic> does not yield an ss-count output file, but we converted the “.ct” output file into an ss-count formatted file using a Python script, which is available upon request.</p>
      <p>To test the ranking accuracy of <italic>PinMol</italic> selected probes when using <italic>mfold</italic>-generated input files, we selected molecular beacon osk1236 with a probe length of 24 nt (for which the 5′ end of the stem coincidently includes three additional nucleotides matching the target) to compare it to osk82 and osk2216 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="RNA069542BAYF6">Fig. 6</xref>A). We chose the probe length of 24 nt in order to be consistent with the probe length for both, osk82 and osk2216. Probe osk1236 was the highest ranking probe that is complementary to a target region that is distinct from the regions targeted by the experimental probes osk82 and osk2216 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.rnajournal.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1261/rna.069542.118/-/DC1">Supplemental Table S1</ext-link>). osk1236 was ranked 6th by <italic>PinMol</italic>, behind five probes (80, 2223, 81, 82, and 2222) that are all positioned very closely to the target regions where the two experimental probes hybridize. The osk2216 molecular beacon had the best performance, while osk82 placed third in in vitro hybridization experiments (<xref rid="RNA069542BAYTB2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>; <xref rid="RNA069542BAYC2" ref-type="bibr">Bratu et al. 2003</xref>), and osk2216 was also efficient in detecting endogenous <italic>osk</italic> mRNA in in vivo experiments (<xref rid="RNA069542BAYC4" ref-type="bibr">Catrina et al. 2012</xref>). When comparing their <italic>f</italic><sub>ss-count</sub> values, osk1236 was predicted to outrank osk2216 for both <italic>mfold</italic>-generated input files (MFE and 31STR, <xref rid="RNA069542BAYTB3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). However, osk82 outranked osk1236 when using the 31STR ss-count file.</p>

      <p>We synthesized and purified osk1236 (Materials and Methods) and when comparing the thermal denaturation profiles for these three molecular beacons, we found that osk1236 had a slightly lower Tm than osk2216 and osk82, consistent with predicted <italic>mfold</italic> results (82°C vs. 88°C and 86°C, <xref rid="RNA069542BAYTB4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RNA069542BAYF6">Fig. 6</xref>B). For thermal denaturation profiles of molecular beacon in the presence of DNA oligonucleotide target, there was a similar trend with osk1236/DNA having a lower Tm than osk2216/DNA, but not osk82/DNA (55°C vs. 59°C and 53°C, <xref rid="RNA069542BAYTB4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RNA069542BAYF6">Fig. 6</xref>B), although osk1236/DNA contains a higher percentage of G/C base pairs when compared to osk2216/DNA (GC%: osk82, 37.5, osk1236, 41.7, and osk2216, 33.3). The thermal denaturation profile of osk2216 with its DNA oligonucleotide complement is complicated by the combination of the probes’ low percentage of GC nucleotides and moderately favorable ΔG<sub>bimol</sub> (−17.4 kcal/mol for the osk2216 molecular beacon sequence and −4.4 kcal/mol for the probe sequence). When using a DNA oligonucleotide target, the intermolecular interaction of osk2216 molecular beacon is favored over the formation of osk2216/DNA hybrid, and as a result the molecular beacon falls off the target DNA at temperatures lower than 43°C, which led to a sharp decrease in fluorescence signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="RNA069542BAYF6">Fig. 6</xref>B). Because RNA/RNA hybrids are energetically more stable than RNA/DNA hybrids, this behavior is less likely to occur when the molecular beacon hybridizes with its intended mRNA target region. We found that the hybridization half-life of osk1236 with the corresponding DNA oligonucleotide target is slightly longer than that of osk2216 and osk82 molecular beacon (12.6 vs. 1.2 and 2.6 sec) (<xref rid="RNA069542BAYTB4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RNA069542BAYF7">Fig. 7</xref>A).

      <p>We analyzed and quantified the in vivo performance of each molecular beacon, osk82, osk1236, and osk2216. Quantification of molecular beacon in vivo target detection efficiency is not trivial due to several variables that need to be controlled that are expected to result in a wide variation in the final results, which we observed for osk1236 (<xref rid="RNA069542BAYTB5" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>). We took into account some of these variables:

      <p>Despite osk1236's less efficient in vitro performance with target RNA when compared to that of osk2216 and osk82, osk1236 presented a superior fluorescence signal in in vivo experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="RNA069542BAYF8">Fig. 8</xref>; <xref rid="RNA069542BAYTB5" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>: 0.84 vs. 0.16 and 0.13 relative detection efficiency; Materials and Methods; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.rnajournal.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1261/rna.069542.118/-/DC1">Supplemental Movies S1–S4</ext-link>). Although we used the same fluorophore for all molecular beacons (Cy5), the two previously synthesized molecular beacons (osk82 and osk2216) had an aged fluorophore, which could result in a decreased fluorescence signal as compared to osk1236. To evaluate if this could have impacted our quantitative analysis, we determined how the performance of the three <italic>osk</italic> molecular beacons compared in in vitro hybridization experiments with <italic>osk</italic> RNA target. We determined the average maximum fluorescence for each molecular beacon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="RNA069542BAYF7">Fig. 7</xref>D), and calculated the normalized fluorescence after 4 min, which is the time point when the in vivo fluorescence signal was quantified. This value is the fraction of the fluorescence signal at 4 min after the RNA target was added from the possible maximum in the presence of RNA target for each molecular beacon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="RNA069542BAYF7">Fig. 7</xref>B; osk82: 0.8, osk1236: 0.19, and osk2216: 1). After 4 min, the maximum raw fluorescence signal (CPS) was obtained for osk2216, followed by osk82 and osk1236 (37% and 35% of osk2216 CPS, respectively). Although based on the in vitro RNA hybridization results of the three <italic>osk</italic> molecular beacons, we would expect osk2216 to yield the highest raw fluorescence signal in vivo, we found that osk1236 outperformed both, osk2216 and osk82. This was evident when comparing in vivo imaging results for stage 8 egg chambers microinjected with similar amounts of the corresponding molecular beacon solution, which were acquired and processed using the same parameters, and where a bright fluorescence signal is observed only for osk1236 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.rnajournal.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1261/rna.069542.118/-/DC1">Supplemental Movie S1</ext-link>).</p>

      <p>It is possible that the regions targeted by osk82 and osk2216 are not as easily accessible in vivo due to binding of protein factors to <italic>osk</italic> mRNA, which would lead to a decreased detection efficiency as compared to in vitro results. It is also possible that the RNA region targeted by osk1236 is more rigid in solution than in vivo, which leads to a longer osk1236/RNA hybridization half-life. We found that when using <italic>mfold</italic>-generated input files, osk2216 is highly ranked by <italic>PinMol</italic> (25th probe) when also taking into consideration target suboptimal structures, but it is not selected in the top 50 probes when using MFE as <italic>PinMol</italic> input file (52nd probe).</p>
      <p>Taken together, these results suggest that when incorporating information from predicted target RNA suboptimal secondary structures in addition to the MFE structure, the design of molecular beacon probes for in vivo experiments improves (<xref rid="RNA069542BAYTB2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>).</p>

      <title>Selecting the probe length</title>
      <p><italic>PinMol</italic> allows the design of up to 50 probes with lengths in a range of 18–26 nt. How does one decide what probe length will work best for a particular target or target region? This should not pose a problem when the targeted region is thousands of nucleotides long, but when using a short target, probe selection will be constrained by additional factors. The number of probes meeting all criteria (ΔG-probes) significantly decreased for probe lengths larger than 22 nt (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="RNA069542BAYF3">Fig. 3</xref>B), indicating that this number may be an optimal length. However, if A/T- or G/C-rich regions are targeted, in order to meet all requirements as implemented in <italic>PinMol</italic>, a longer or shorter probe length should be selected, respectively.</p>
      <p>Ultimately, the main consideration for designing the probe sequence was target accessibility, which was taken into account by sorting all possible probes in descending order of the <italic>f</italic><sub>ss-count</sub>. <italic>PinMol</italic> does not limit the <italic>f</italic><sub>ss-count</sub> to a lower bound (e.g., consider only probes that target a region with a <italic>f</italic><sub>ss-count</sub> &gt; 0.5) because it limits the total number of selected probes to 50, or the maximum number of possible probes, whichever is smaller. Taking into consideration our previous experimental results, optimization of other parameters (e.g., probe length) is also required for the selection of the most efficient probe(s) for live cell imaging. Therefore, it is important to know which factors are most useful in predicting highly efficient probes. We first analyzed our previous experimental data, and we found that only two molecular beacons showed high efficiency in detecting the target region in in vitro experiments, while the remaining nine molecular beacons were all under the 50% hybridization efficiency as compared to osk2216, our best experimental probe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="RNA069542BAYF9">Fig. 9</xref>; <xref rid="RNA069542BAYC2" ref-type="bibr">Bratu et al. 2003</xref>). When we compared the top two probes, the <italic>f</italic><sub>ss-count</sub> appeared to be sufficient to predict their rank (0.694 vs. 0.616, 31STR) (<xref rid="RNA069542BAYTB2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). When we compared the first two probes with the third (osk82), although they have similar probe lengths, osk82 had the highest <italic>f</italic><sub>ss-count</sub> (0.76) when considering 30SO structures in addition to the MFE structure, but it also had a more stable bimolecular folding (<xref rid="RNA069542BAYTB2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RNA069542BAYF9">Fig. 9</xref>). This suggests that the ΔG<sub>bimol</sub> may be another important determinant of probe efficiency for probe lengths in the range of 21–24 nt. The probes ranked experimentally as 4th, 5th, 9th, 10th, and 11th were not selected by <italic>PinMol</italic> because they have a ΔG<sub>bimol</sub> &lt; −7.5 kcal/mol, and the first two probes also have a ΔG<sub>unimol</sub> &lt; −2.5 kcal/mol. Therefore, these in vitro data support our assessment that probes with favorable uni- and/or bimolecular folding will perform poorly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="RNA069542BAYF9">Fig. 9</xref>). Of the remaining probes (<xref rid="RNA069542BAYTB2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>), osk2585 ranked 6th and osk1220 ranked 7th showed a decrease in performance that was directly related to their <italic>f</italic><sub>ss-count</sub>, with osk2585 (0.76) having a larger <italic>f</italic><sub>ss-count</sub> than osk1220 (0.68), and also presented a more stable bimolecular folding energy (<xref rid="RNA069542BAYTB2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RNA069542BAYF9">Fig. 9</xref>). However, osk2585 showed a slightly lower efficiency than two probes that were filtered out by <italic>PinMol</italic> (osk358 and osk720, experimentally ranked 4th and 5th, <xref rid="RNA069542BAYTB2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). It is possible that the shorter probe length (16 vs. 21 and 23 nt) strongly impacted the performance of the former, and thus we chose 18 nt as the minimum length of probe sequence. Finally, the molecular beacon experimentally ranked 8th (osk544) presented the second lowest <italic>f</italic><sub>ss-count</sub> (0.512), which explains its poor performance in in vitro hybridization experiments with full-length <italic>osk</italic> mRNA (<xref rid="RNA069542BAYTB2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>).</p>

      <p>Inter- or bimolecular folding is correlated with the molecular beacon's concentration, and it may negatively impact purification of the probe when using concentrated stock solutions. However, its impact on in vivo experiments is expected to be somewhat reduced since lower concentrations are used. Therefore, instead of setting a stringent cut-off for ΔG<sub>bimol</sub>, we chose a moderately low value of −7.5 kcal/mol. For comparison, the ΔG<sub>bimol</sub> folding of the osk2216 probe region with a fully complementary RNA oligonucleotide was predicted using the <italic>oligoscreen</italic> subroutine to be −35.3 kcal/mol (ΔG<sub>duplex</sub> in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RNA069542BAYF2">Fig. 2</xref>: <italic>#5</italic>, “<italic>probes_ sortedby5.csv</italic>” <italic>PinMol</italic> output file).</p>

      <title>In vitro thermal denaturation and hybridization experiments</title>
      <p>Thermal denaturation reactions were run with 300 ng (∼190 nM) of molecular beacon alone or with 3 μg (∼2.3 µM) complementary DNA oligonucleotide target. For molecular beacon thermal denaturation, the reaction was cooled down from 95°C to 25°C, at a rate of 1°C/30 sec. For thermal denaturation experiments in the presence of complementary DNA oligonucleotide target, 3 μL of DNA oligonucleotide target were added to 120 μL containing 300 ng molecular beacon in hybridization buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1.5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> and 100 mM NaCl). Experiments were performed in a FluoroMax-4 photon counting spectrofluorometer (Horiba-Jobin Yvon), and for each temperature, three time points were acquired every 15 sec, after 0.2 min temperature equilibration with an integration occurring over 0.5 sec. The average of the three readings for each temperature was graphed using GraphPad Prism. The absolute fluorescence intensity (CPS) was normalized for each molecular beacon to the maximum CPS signal obtained for the thermal denaturation of molecular beacon with DNA oligonucleotide target. The excitation and emission slit widths were each 3 nm and 2 nm, respectively, with excitation/emission wavelengths of 649/670 nm.</p>
      <p>For in vitro hybridization reactions using complementary DNA oligonucleotide targets, 100 ng (∼130 nM; 60 µL reaction volume) of the molecular beacon was incubated with 500 ng (∼780 nM) of the corresponding complementary DNA oligonucleotide target. The fluorescence signal was acquired using a FluoroMax-4 photon counting spectrofluorometer (Horiba-Jobin Yvon), and was monitored at 25°C, first with just the hybridization buffer, then with the molecular beacon, and lastly with the corresponding complementary DNA oligonucleotide target. It was recorded every 2 sec, with an integration occurring over 0.5 sec. The excitation and emission slit widths were each 2 nm, with excitation/emission wavelengths of 649/670 nm. The signal-to-background ratio was calculated by dividing the maximum fluorescence signal (CPS) by the difference between the fluorescence signal of the molecular beacon alone and the buffer background.</p>
      <p>In vitro transcription of full-length <italic>osk</italic> RNA, and hybridization reactions with molecular beacons and <italic>osk</italic> RNA were performed as previously described (<xref rid="RNA069542BAYC4" ref-type="bibr">Catrina et al. 2012</xref>). Briefly, the hybridization reaction was performed in hybridization buffer (60 µL total volume: 80 nM molecular beacon was incubated with 60 nM folded <italic>osk</italic> RNA), and the change in fluorescence signal was recorded at 25°C every 10 sec, with 2 sec integration time and using 3 nm and 2 nm excitation (649 nm) and emission (670 nm) slit widths, respectively. The RNA was folded in hybridization buffer two ways: (i) incubation at 95°C for 10 sec and immediately placed on ice, and (ii) incubation at 70°C for 10 min, followed by slow cooling over 30 min to 30°C and placed on ice until ready to use. The sense strand of full-length <italic>osk</italic> mRNA was in vitro transcribed using a T7MegaScript Ambion Kit (ThermoFisher-Ambion), following the manufacturer's instructions using a PCR fragment amplified from a plasmid containing <italic>osk</italic> cDNA inserted into a pBluescript KS+ vector (kind gift from R. Lehmann, NYU Medical School). After the RNA hybridization reaction reached a first plateau (for osk82 and osk2216) we added 3 µg of complementary DNA oligonucleotide and continued the acquisition until a maximum plateau was reached. For DNA hybridization analysis, the raw fluorescence signal (CPS) was normalized the maximum fluorescence signal, and data were fitted using nonlinear regression for binding kinetics of one phase association (GraphPad Prism). For RNA hybridization analysis, the raw fluorescence signal (CPS) was normalized the maximum fluorescence signal with target <italic>osk</italic> RNA using the first plateau obtained from fitting the hybridization data as described above, or using the maximum fluorescence signal when adding complementary DNA oligonucleotide to the RNA hybridization reaction after it reached the first plateau. The graphs show representative curve profiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="RNA069542BAYF6">Fig. 6</xref>) or nonlinear fit using GraphPad Prism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="RNA069542BAYF7">Fig. 7</xref>) from three or more independent thermal denaturation, or hybridization experiments, respectively. The average maximum fluorescence signal (CPS) from in vitro RNA hybridization data was calculated with GraphPad Prism using the values fitted for the first plateau, as described above.</p>

      <p>In order to compare the detection efficiency of the three molecular beacons, we quantified the Cy5 fluorescence signal accumulated at the posterior of the oocyte at the initiation of acquisition (<italic>t</italic>1 = 0 min) and after 4 min (<italic>t</italic>3 = 4 min), for three developmental stages (stage 8, 9, and late 9). We used identical acquisition parameters (laser power, and exposure time, gain and sensitivity for high-quality camera acquisition mode) for all microinjections, and found that when using parameters necessary for a detectable fluorescence signal for osk82 and osk2216 molecular beacons, time points after 4 min presented a saturated fluorescence signal for osk1236. We cropped the posterior ROI for both time points and measured the ROI area and the raw intensity density (RID) for each of the 14 optical slices at each of the two time points for 16-bit <italic>Z</italic>-stacks, using an ImageJ custom macro. We calculated the average optical density (AOD<sub>Cy5</sub> = RID<sub>Cy5</sub>/Area<sub>ROI_Cy5</sub>) for the optical slice that showed the maximum RID at 4 min post-injection. To account for any delay in the initiation of the acquisition protocol, we calculated the increase in AOD<sub>Cy5</sub> from <italic>t</italic>1 to <italic>t</italic>3. To correct for variations in the quantity of solution injected, we similarly calculated the AOD<sub>TMR</sub> for an ROI<sub>TMR</sub> selected from the TMR stack acquired at 40×, for the optical slice with the maximum RID<sub>TMR</sub>. To correct for differences in the development stage of the injected oocytes, we measured the oocyte length from the anterior to the posterior of each injected egg chamber, and calculated a correction factor (<italic>f</italic><sub>A→P</sub>) by dividing this distance by the minimum distance of all measured oocytes. The final relative detection efficiency of each injection was calculated using Equation <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="RNA069542BAYM2">2</xref>. The images shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RNA069542BAYF8">Fig. 8</xref> are for the microinjections that presented the highest target detection efficiency for each molecular beacon, and the white rectangles highlight the ROIs used to quantify each microinjection.
