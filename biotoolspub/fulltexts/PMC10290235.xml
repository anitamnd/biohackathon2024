It allows users to search for potential inhibitors that target a gene (Module 1) or multiple genes (Module 2), mechanisms of action of a known drug (Module 3) and drugs with similar biochemical features to an investigational compound (Module 4). We performed a validation analysis to confirm the capability of our tool to link the effects of drug treatments to knockouts of the drug’s annotated target genes. By querying with a demonstrating example of <italic toggle="yes">CDK6</italic>, the tool identified well-studied inhibitor drugs, novel synergistic gene and drug partners and insights into an investigational drug.

    <title>1 Introduction</title>
    <p>With revolutionizing techniques in high-throughput screening and genomic profiling, large-scale cancer dependency maps, also known as the DepMaps, are rapidly growing, providing insights into genetic vulnerabilities and pharmacologic sensitivities of pan-cancer cell lines. These dependency maps are generated by observing the changes in cancer cell viability induced by systematically knocking out genes using genome-wide CRISPR screens (<xref rid="vbad076-B1" ref-type="bibr">Behan <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2019</xref>; <xref rid="vbad076-B3" ref-type="bibr">Dempster <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2021</xref>) or by treating cells with small compounds using multiplexed drug screens (<xref rid="vbad076-B2" ref-type="bibr">Corsello <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2020</xref>; <xref rid="vbad076-B4" ref-type="bibr">Iorio <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>). Focused on the molecular effects of treatments, the NIH Library of Integrated Network-based Cellular Signatures (LINCS) Consortium generated ‘molecular signatures’ of perturbations, i.e. changes in gene expression profiles induced by a treatment, at an unprecedented scale (<xref rid="vbad076-B8" ref-type="bibr">Subramanian <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>). These projects play a significant role in propelling precision oncology by identifying and targeting the ‘Achilles heel’ of cancer (<xref rid="vbad076-B9" ref-type="bibr">Vazquez and Sellers, 2021</xref>). Several interactive web servers have been developed to make these data resources more accessible to broad cancer research community. For example, shinyDepMap is a web browser that visualizes gene clusters with similar dependency profiles (<xref rid="vbad076-B7" ref-type="bibr">Shimada <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2021</xref>). The Data Explorer tool accompanying the DepMap data of the Broad Institute visualizes the correlation between two user-selected genes or compounds. However, current tools do not support systematic analyses across all genes or drugs. It also remains lacking user-friendly software, which meaningfully links and visualizes heterogeneous screening and molecular datasets to investigate similar mechanisms behind perturbations triggered by genes or compounds. To address this issue, here, we present the DepLink web application to answer two important questions in cancer biology:</p>
    <list list-type="bullet">
      <list-item>
        <p>Which drugs can be potential surrogates to knockout of a gene in cancer cells?</p>
      </list-item>
      <list-item>
        <p>Which genes are potential targets or mechanisms of action of a drug?</p>
      </list-item>
    </list>
    <p>DepLink is an R Shiny app designed to integrate large-scale data of genetic and drug screens, molecular signatures and cheminformatics. The goal is to enable researchers to identify genetic (gene knockouts) and pharmacologic perturbations (drug treatments) that induce similar effects in terms of cell viability or molecular changes. DepLink has four interconnected modules that allow bi-directional query scenarios from a gene or multiple genes to a drug, or from a known drug or new compound to a gene. Query results are presented via a user-friendly interface of interactive networks and figures, as well as easy-to-operate data tables, enabling meaningful analyses with no requirement of programming skills.</p>

    <p>As shown in <xref rid="vbad076-F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>, DepLink integrates heterogeneous screening and molecular datasets of three categories: (i) genome-wide CRISPR loss-of-function screens: Broad and Sanger DepMap projects, each covering genome-wide gene knockouts (<xref rid="vbad076-B1" ref-type="bibr">Behan <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2019</xref>; <xref rid="vbad076-B3" ref-type="bibr">Dempster <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2021</xref>); (ii) high-throughput drug screens: Profiling Relative Inhibition Simultaneously in Mixtures (PRISM; primary screen) (<xref rid="vbad076-B2" ref-type="bibr">Corsello <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2020</xref>) and Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer (GDSC) (<xref rid="vbad076-B4" ref-type="bibr">Iorio <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>); and (iii) molecular signatures of perturbations: The LINCS collection of molecular (gene expression) signatures induced by drug treatments (<xref rid="vbad076-B8" ref-type="bibr">Subramanian <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>). Four complementary and interconnected modules are designed in DepLink to integrate the datasets for different query needs (<xref rid="vbad076-F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>):</p>

      <title>3.2 Global correlation network of gene knockouts and drugs</title>
      <p>We started by building and examining a global correlation network among all gene knockouts and drugs. Gene–drug, gene–gene and drug–drug correlation coefficients were calculated based on 456 common cell lines between the Broad DepMap (Chronos gene-effect scores that infer gene fitness effects) and PRISM (log-fold changes in cell counts associated with drug treatments) datasets. We set cutoffs on correlation coefficients to yield a visualizable size of network with the largest average node degree of 6.3, comprising 123 genes, 396 drugs and 1630 edges (cutoffs, 0.61, 0.61 and 0.27 on gene–gene, drug–drug and gene–drug correlations; see <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. S2</xref> and <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Methods</xref>). The network contained clusters of drugs that were designed to inhibit important oncogenic and cancer progression pathways, such as MEK inhibitors (e.g. selumetinib and cobimetinib) with genes in the BRAF-MAPK pathway (e.g. <italic toggle="yes">BRAF</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">MAPK1</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">MAP2K1</italic>) and inhibitors of the ErbB family (gefitinib, osimertinib and dacomitinib) (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. S3</xref>). Genes involved in the mitochondrial respiratory chain formed a dense cluster that included cytochrome c oxidase genes (<italic toggle="yes">COX5B</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">COX6B</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">COX7C</italic>) and NADH: ubiquinone enzymes (<italic toggle="yes">NDUFA2</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">NDUFS1</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">NDUFS2</italic>). <italic toggle="yes">MDM2</italic> inhibitors (nutlin-3 and idasanutlin) formed a cluster with many DNA repair genes that govern cell apoptosis (<italic toggle="yes">TP53</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">CHEK2</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">ATM</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">MDM2</italic>). Two key players of the cell cycle, <italic toggle="yes">CDK6</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">CCND1</italic>, were connected to palbociclib, the first CDK4/6 inhibitor approved for cancer therapy. The results are available under the ‘Global Network’ tab of DepLink.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec>
      <title>3.3 Validation analysis using annotated drug targets</title>
      <p>To validate the correlation analysis implemented in DepLink, we analyzed 11 008 drug–target gene annotations collected from PRISM, comprising 3464 drugs and 1796 target genes. Broad DepMap gene-effect scores of the target genes were available in 98.2% (10 811) pairs that corresponded to 3443 drugs. Treatment responses to 774 (22.5%) drugs were significantly correlated with gene-effect scores of at least one intended target of the drug (with Pearson correlation <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &lt; 0.05). We also calculated an observed-to-expected (O/E) ratio of annotated drug–target pairs passing a threshold on gene–drug correlation coefficients (see <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Methods</xref>). All thresholds we tested (0–0.7) yielded statistically significant results (right-tailed Fisher’s exact test <italic toggle="yes">P</italic>-values &lt;0.05; <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. S4</xref>). The cutoff of 0.27 on gene–drug correlation used to construct the global network achieved a significant O/E ratio (512.0; <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 5.7 × 10<sup>−174</sup>). Phase 3 drugs demonstrated an even more evident O/E ratio of 1555.9 (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 2.1 × 10<sup>−40</sup>). Thus, our validation analysis demonstrated the capability of DepLink in recapitulating known drug–target gene relationships.</p>

      <title>3.4 Use case—identification of drugs and genes associated with <italic toggle="yes">CDK6</italic> knockout</title>
      <p>As a use case of DepLink, we further investigated <italic toggle="yes">CDK6</italic>, as it is one of the most promising targets of cell cycle-based cancer therapy. Here, we summarized results from Modules 1–3 and focused our analyses on the Broad DepMap and PRISM screens to study similarities in cell viability inhibition induced by <italic toggle="yes">CDK6</italic> knockout, other gene knockouts, CDK4/6 inhibitors and other drugs. <italic toggle="yes">CDK6</italic> was found to be an essential gene in 109 of the 1054 cell lines assayed by the Broad DepMap (<xref rid="vbad076-F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). In particular, viability of myeloma, leukemia and neuroblastoma cells was strongly dependent on <italic toggle="yes">CDK6</italic> (median scores, −1.02, −0.90 and −0.78; <xref rid="vbad076-F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). We calculated a Pearson correlation coefficient between the gene-effect scores of <italic toggle="yes">CDK6</italic> and log-fold changes of cell viability induced by each drug assayed by PRISM across 456 common cell lines. Two clusters were formed among the top 10 drugs achieving similar effects with <italic toggle="yes">CDK6</italic> knockout (<xref rid="vbad076-F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref> and <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Methods</xref>). One included two CDK4/6 inhibitors, palbociclib and ribociclib (<italic toggle="yes">ρ</italic> = 0.30 and 0.18), as well as ponatinib (which promotes G1 cell cycle arrest and synergizes with palbociclib) (<xref rid="vbad076-B5" ref-type="bibr">Liu <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2019</xref>; <xref rid="vbad076-B6" ref-type="bibr">Schneeweiss-Gleixner <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2019</xref>). Palbociclib and ribociclib showed highly similar effects in cell viability (<italic toggle="yes">ρ</italic> = 0.58 across 568 cell lines; <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. S5A</xref>), well beyond many other known <italic toggle="yes">CDK4</italic> and/or <italic toggle="yes">CDK6</italic> inhibitors (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. S5B</xref>).</p>

(<bold>A</bold>) Pan-cancer distribution of Chronos gene-effect score of <italic toggle="yes">CDK6</italic> across 1054 cancer cell lines in the Broad DepMap dataset. A greater negative score indicates a stronger dependency on <italic toggle="yes">CDK6</italic>. Dashed line denotes the cutoff of −1 for identifying <italic toggle="yes">CDK6</italic> as an essential gene in a cell line. (<bold>B</bold>) Distribution of <italic toggle="yes">CDK6</italic> gene-effect scores across 27 cancer lineages and 2 other groups. (<bold>C</bold>) Correlation network of <italic toggle="yes">CDK6</italic>. We calculated pairwise correlation coefficients between a gene knockout (gene-effect scores from Broad DepMap) and a drug response (log-fold changes from PRISM). With <italic toggle="yes">CDK6</italic> as the hub gene, the network was constructed by the 10 drugs with the strongest correlation coefficients to the <italic toggle="yes">CDK6</italic> knockout. To further illuminate potential mechanisms of action, for each drug, we identified the top 10 correlated gene knockouts and incorporated them into the network. Color and width of edges denote the direction and magnitude of correlation, respectively. The gene names in bold correspond to significant molecular biological processes (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &lt; 0.05) corresponding to G2-M Checkpoint, Myc Targets V1 and Notch signaling for CDK6 inhibitors and Glycolysis and PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling for MEK inhibitors.

      <p>The other cluster of drugs correlated with <italic toggle="yes">CDK6</italic> knockout was composed of seven MEK inhibitors (<xref rid="vbad076-F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>). Cobimetinib is FDA-approved to treat <italic toggle="yes">BRAF</italic>-mutated metastatic melanoma in combination with vemurafenib. Among all types of cancer, skin cancer cells responded best to cobimetinib (median of log-fold changes in viability = −1.93 among 43 cell lines; <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. S5C</xref>). The seven MEK inhibitors formed an interconnected network (<xref rid="vbad076-F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>). All were among the top 10 highly correlated drugs of cobimetinib (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table S1</xref>), with correlation coefficients ranging between 0.88 (PD-0325901) and 0.69 (selumetinib). Our data revealed potential synergistic effects between CDK and MEK inhibitors (see <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Discussion</xref>).</p>

      <title>3.5 Use case—examination of a novel inhibitor of <italic toggle="yes">CDK6</italic></title>
      <p>The ‘Query New Drug’ module of DepLink allows users to investigate a novel drug by a SMILES code and analyze its proximity to known drugs based on molecular fingerprints. As an example, we analyzed an investigational CDK4/6 inhibitor in Phases 2 and 3 clinical trials, namely SHR6390, with its canonical SMILES code. DepLink calculated Tanimoto similarities (<italic toggle="yes">S</italic><sub>Tanimoto</sub>) between SHR6390 and all drugs screened by PRISM based on 1047 binary-state biochemical features of PubChem and MACCS. Palbociclib and ribociclib were the top and third most similar drugs (<italic toggle="yes">S</italic><sub>Tanimoto</sub>=0.96 and 0.82, respectively). Palbociclib and SHR6390 shared 237 common biochemical features out of 244 and 239 features present in palbociclib and SHR6390, respectively (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. S6</xref>). TGX-221, a PI3K inhibitor targeting <italic toggle="yes">PIK3CB</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">PIK3CD</italic>, was the second most similar drug to SHR6390 (<italic toggle="yes">S</italic><sub>Tanimoto</sub>, 0.82).</p>

    <title>4 Conclusion</title>
    <p>Large-scale genetic and pharmacologic dependency maps demand a platform where one can navigate, visualize and link information across these complex datasets. DepLink is, as far as we know, the first a user-friendly analysis workflow designed to address the research gap by querying across a gene or multiple genes, and a drug. Moreover, it enables researchers to analyze biochemical features of a new compound and to study its potential mechanisms of action through known drugs with similar biochemical features. We expect DepLink to continuously evolve with rapidly growing high-throughput screening data resources.</p>

We performed a validation analysis to confirm the capability of our tool to link the effects of drug treatments to knockouts of the drug’s annotated target genes. By querying with a demonstrating example of <italic toggle="yes">CDK6</italic>, the tool identified well-studied inhibitor drugs, novel synergistic gene and drug partners and insights into an investigational drug.

    <title>1 Introduction</title>
    <p>With revolutionizing techniques in high-throughput screening and genomic profiling, large-scale cancer dependency maps, also known as the DepMaps, are rapidly growing, providing insights into genetic vulnerabilities and pharmacologic sensitivities of pan-cancer cell lines. These dependency maps are generated by observing the changes in cancer cell viability induced by systematically knocking out genes using genome-wide CRISPR screens (<xref rid="vbad076-B1" ref-type="bibr">Behan <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2019</xref>; <xref rid="vbad076-B3" ref-type="bibr">Dempster <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2021</xref>) or by treating cells with small compounds using multiplexed drug screens (<xref rid="vbad076-B2" ref-type="bibr">Corsello <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2020</xref>; <xref rid="vbad076-B4" ref-type="bibr">Iorio <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>). Focused on the molecular effects of treatments, the NIH Library of Integrated Network-based Cellular Signatures (LINCS) Consortium generated ‘molecular signatures’ of perturbations, i.e. changes in gene expression profiles induced by a treatment, at an unprecedented scale (<xref rid="vbad076-B8" ref-type="bibr">Subramanian <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>). These projects play a significant role in propelling precision oncology by identifying and targeting the ‘Achilles heel’ of cancer (<xref rid="vbad076-B9" ref-type="bibr">Vazquez and Sellers, 2021</xref>). Several interactive web servers have been developed to make these data resources more accessible to broad cancer research community. For example, shinyDepMap is a web browser that visualizes gene clusters with similar dependency profiles (<xref rid="vbad076-B7" ref-type="bibr">Shimada <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2021</xref>). The Data Explorer tool accompanying the DepMap data of the Broad Institute visualizes the correlation between two user-selected genes or compounds. However, current tools do not support systematic analyses across all genes or drugs. It also remains lacking user-friendly software, which meaningfully links and visualizes heterogeneous screening and molecular datasets to investigate similar mechanisms behind perturbations triggered by genes or compounds. To address this issue, here, we present the DepLink web application to answer two important questions in cancer biology:</p>
    <list list-type="bullet">
      <list-item>
        <p>Which drugs can be potential surrogates to knockout of a gene in cancer cells?</p>
      </list-item>
      <list-item>
        <p>Which genes are potential targets or mechanisms of action of a drug?</p>
      </list-item>
    </list>
    <p>DepLink is an R Shiny app designed to integrate large-scale data of genetic and drug screens, molecular signatures and cheminformatics. The goal is to enable researchers to identify genetic (gene knockouts) and pharmacologic perturbations (drug treatments) that induce similar effects in terms of cell viability or molecular changes. DepLink has four interconnected modules that allow bi-directional query scenarios from a gene or multiple genes to a drug, or from a known drug or new compound to a gene. Query results are presented via a user-friendly interface of interactive networks and figures, as well as easy-to-operate data tables, enabling meaningful analyses with no requirement of programming skills.</p>

    <p>As shown in <xref rid="vbad076-F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>, DepLink integrates heterogeneous screening and molecular datasets of three categories: (i) genome-wide CRISPR loss-of-function screens: Broad and Sanger DepMap projects, each covering genome-wide gene knockouts (<xref rid="vbad076-B1" ref-type="bibr">Behan <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2019</xref>; <xref rid="vbad076-B3" ref-type="bibr">Dempster <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2021</xref>); (ii) high-throughput drug screens: Profiling Relative Inhibition Simultaneously in Mixtures (PRISM; primary screen) (<xref rid="vbad076-B2" ref-type="bibr">Corsello <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2020</xref>) and Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer (GDSC) (<xref rid="vbad076-B4" ref-type="bibr">Iorio <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>); and (iii) molecular signatures of perturbations: The LINCS collection of molecular (gene expression) signatures induced by drug treatments (<xref rid="vbad076-B8" ref-type="bibr">Subramanian <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>). Four complementary and interconnected modules are designed in DepLink to integrate the datasets for different query needs (<xref rid="vbad076-F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>):</p>

      <title>3.2 Global correlation network of gene knockouts and drugs</title>
      <p>We started by building and examining a global correlation network among all gene knockouts and drugs. Gene–drug, gene–gene and drug–drug correlation coefficients were calculated based on 456 common cell lines between the Broad DepMap (Chronos gene-effect scores that infer gene fitness effects) and PRISM (log-fold changes in cell counts associated with drug treatments) datasets. We set cutoffs on correlation coefficients to yield a visualizable size of network with the largest average node degree of 6.3, comprising 123 genes, 396 drugs and 1630 edges (cutoffs, 0.61, 0.61 and 0.27 on gene–gene, drug–drug and gene–drug correlations; see <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. S2</xref> and <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Methods</xref>). The network contained clusters of drugs that were designed to inhibit important oncogenic and cancer progression pathways, such as MEK inhibitors (e.g. selumetinib and cobimetinib) with genes in the BRAF-MAPK pathway (e.g. <italic toggle="yes">BRAF</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">MAPK1</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">MAP2K1</italic>) and inhibitors of the ErbB family (gefitinib, osimertinib and dacomitinib) (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. S3</xref>). Genes involved in the mitochondrial respiratory chain formed a dense cluster that included cytochrome c oxidase genes (<italic toggle="yes">COX5B</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">COX6B</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">COX7C</italic>) and NADH: ubiquinone enzymes (<italic toggle="yes">NDUFA2</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">NDUFS1</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">NDUFS2</italic>). <italic toggle="yes">MDM2</italic> inhibitors (nutlin-3 and idasanutlin) formed a cluster with many DNA repair genes that govern cell apoptosis (<italic toggle="yes">TP53</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">CHEK2</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">ATM</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">MDM2</italic>). Two key players of the cell cycle, <italic toggle="yes">CDK6</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">CCND1</italic>, were connected to palbociclib, the first CDK4/6 inhibitor approved for cancer therapy. The results are available under the ‘Global Network’ tab of DepLink.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec>
      <title>3.3 Validation analysis using annotated drug targets</title>
      <p>To validate the correlation analysis implemented in DepLink, we analyzed 11 008 drug–target gene annotations collected from PRISM, comprising 3464 drugs and 1796 target genes. Broad DepMap gene-effect scores of the target genes were available in 98.2% (10 811) pairs that corresponded to 3443 drugs. Treatment responses to 774 (22.5%) drugs were significantly correlated with gene-effect scores of at least one intended target of the drug (with Pearson correlation <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &lt; 0.05). We also calculated an observed-to-expected (O/E) ratio of annotated drug–target pairs passing a threshold on gene–drug correlation coefficients (see <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Methods</xref>). All thresholds we tested (0–0.7) yielded statistically significant results (right-tailed Fisher’s exact test <italic toggle="yes">P</italic>-values &lt;0.05; <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. S4</xref>). The cutoff of 0.27 on gene–drug correlation used to construct the global network achieved a significant O/E ratio (512.0; <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 5.7 × 10<sup>−174</sup>). Phase 3 drugs demonstrated an even more evident O/E ratio of 1555.9 (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 2.1 × 10<sup>−40</sup>). Thus, our validation analysis demonstrated the capability of DepLink in recapitulating known drug–target gene relationships.</p>

    <sec>
      <title>3.4 Use case—identification of drugs and genes associated with <italic toggle="yes">CDK6</italic> knockout</title>
      <p>As a use case of DepLink, we further investigated <italic toggle="yes">CDK6</italic>, as it is one of the most promising targets of cell cycle-based cancer therapy. Here, we summarized results from Modules 1–3 and focused our analyses on the Broad DepMap and PRISM screens to study similarities in cell viability inhibition induced by <italic toggle="yes">CDK6</italic> knockout, other gene knockouts, CDK4/6 inhibitors and other drugs. <italic toggle="yes">CDK6</italic> was found to be an essential gene in 109 of the 1054 cell lines assayed by the Broad DepMap (<xref rid="vbad076-F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). In particular, viability of myeloma, leukemia and neuroblastoma cells was strongly dependent on <italic toggle="yes">CDK6</italic> (median scores, −1.02, −0.90 and −0.78; <xref rid="vbad076-F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). We calculated a Pearson correlation coefficient between the gene-effect scores of <italic toggle="yes">CDK6</italic> and log-fold changes of cell viability induced by each drug assayed by PRISM across 456 common cell lines. Two clusters were formed among the top 10 drugs achieving similar effects with <italic toggle="yes">CDK6</italic> knockout (<xref rid="vbad076-F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref> and <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Methods</xref>). One included two CDK4/6 inhibitors, palbociclib and ribociclib (<italic toggle="yes">ρ</italic> = 0.30 and 0.18), as well as ponatinib (which promotes G1 cell cycle arrest and synergizes with palbociclib) (<xref rid="vbad076-B5" ref-type="bibr">Liu <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2019</xref>; <xref rid="vbad076-B6" ref-type="bibr">Schneeweiss-Gleixner <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2019</xref>). Palbociclib and ribociclib showed highly similar effects in cell viability (<italic toggle="yes">ρ</italic> = 0.58 across 568 cell lines; <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. S5A</xref>), well beyond many other known <italic toggle="yes">CDK4</italic> and/or <italic toggle="yes">CDK6</italic> inhibitors (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. S5B</xref>).</p>

Among all types of cancer, skin cancer cells responded best to cobimetinib (median of log-fold changes in viability = −1.93 among 43 cell lines; <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. S5C</xref>). The seven MEK inhibitors formed an interconnected network (<xref rid="vbad076-F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>). All were among the top 10 highly correlated drugs of cobimetinib (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table S1</xref>), with correlation coefficients ranging between 0.88 (PD-0325901) and 0.69 (selumetinib). Our data revealed potential synergistic effects between CDK and MEK inhibitors (see <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Discussion</xref>).</p>

      <title>3.5 Use case—examination of a novel inhibitor of <italic toggle="yes">CDK6</italic></title>
      <p>The ‘Query New Drug’ module of DepLink allows users to investigate a novel drug by a SMILES code and analyze its proximity to known drugs based on molecular fingerprints. As an example, we analyzed an investigational CDK4/6 inhibitor in Phases 2 and 3 clinical trials, namely SHR6390, with its canonical SMILES code. DepLink calculated Tanimoto similarities (<italic toggle="yes">S</italic><sub>Tanimoto</sub>) between SHR6390 and all drugs screened by PRISM based on 1047 binary-state biochemical features of PubChem and MACCS. Palbociclib and ribociclib were the top and third most similar drugs (<italic toggle="yes">S</italic><sub>Tanimoto</sub>=0.96 and 0.82, respectively). Palbociclib and SHR6390 shared 237 common biochemical features out of 244 and 239 features present in palbociclib and SHR6390, respectively (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. S6</xref>). TGX-221, a PI3K inhibitor targeting <italic toggle="yes">PIK3CB</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">PIK3CD</italic>, was the second most similar drug to SHR6390 (<italic toggle="yes">S</italic><sub>Tanimoto</sub>, 0.82).</p>

    <title>4 Conclusion</title>
    <p>Large-scale genetic and pharmacologic dependency maps demand a platform where one can navigate, visualize and link information across these complex datasets. DepLink is, as far as we know, the first a user-friendly analysis workflow designed to address the research gap by querying across a gene or multiple genes, and a drug. Moreover, it enables researchers to analyze biochemical features of a new compound and to study its potential mechanisms of action through known drugs with similar biochemical features. We expect DepLink to continuously evolve with rapidly growing high-throughput screening data resources.</p>
