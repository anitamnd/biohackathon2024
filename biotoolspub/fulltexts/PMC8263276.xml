        <title>Background</title>
        <p>Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common malignant brain tumour among adult patients and represents an almost universally fatal disease. Novel therapies for GBM are being developed under the orphan drug legislation and the knowledge on the molecular makeup of this disease has been increasing rapidly. However, the clinical outcomes in GBM patients with currently available therapies are still dismal. An insight into the current drug development pipeline for GBM is therefore of particular interest.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec002">
        <title>Objectives</title>
        <p>To provide a quantitative clinical-regulatory insight into the status of FDA orphan drug designations for compounds intended to treat GBM.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec003">
        <title>Methods</title>
        <p>Quantitative cross-sectional analysis of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration Orphan Drug Product database between 1983 and 2020. STROBE criteria were respected.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec004">
        <title>Results</title>
        <p>Four orphan drugs out of 161 (2,4%) orphan drug designations were approved for the treatment for GBM by the FDA between 1983 and 2020. Fourteen orphan drug designations were subsequently withdrawn for unknown reasons. The number of orphan drug designations per year shows a growing trend. In the last decade, the therapeutic mechanism of action of designated compounds intended to treat glioblastoma shifted from cytotoxic drugs (median year of designation 2008) to immunotherapeutic approaches and small molecules (median year of designation 2014 and 2015 respectively) suggesting an increased focus on precision in the therapeutic mechanism of action for compounds the development pipeline.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec005">
        <title>Conclusion</title>
        <p>Despite the fact that current pharmacological treatment options in GBM are sparse, the drug development pipeline is steadily growing. In particular, the surge of designated immunotherapies detected in the last years raises the hope that elaborate combination possibilities between classical therapeutic backbones (radiotherapy and chemotherapy) and novel, currently experimental therapeutics may help to provide better therapies for this deadly disease in the future.</p>

    <title>Introduction</title>
    <p>High grade gliomas account for the majority of brain tumour related deaths in children and adults. Considering all age groups together, glioblastoma represents the most common malignant brain tumour (43,5% of all malignant brain tumours [<xref rid="pone.0252924.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]).</p>
    <p>Albeit being rare in absolute numbers, glioblastomas represent a universally fatal disease class for approximately 15,000 patients per year in the United States [<xref rid="pone.0252924.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. While the last years have seen a surge in publications that highlight intertumoural and intratumoural diversity [<xref rid="pone.0252924.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0252924.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] in these tumours, our growing understanding of the pathophysiological processes that underlie the disease could so far not yet be translated into therapeutic success.</p>
    <p>To date, a wealth of studies has identified the typical genetic alterations that occur in glioblastoma: Mutations in <italic toggle="yes">IDH1</italic> or, for paediatric glioblastomas, the two frequently occurring histone <italic toggle="yes">H3</italic>.<italic toggle="yes">3</italic> gene mutations (<italic toggle="yes">H3</italic>.<italic toggle="yes">3</italic>: pK27M and <italic toggle="yes">H3</italic>.<italic toggle="yes">3</italic>: pG34R/V) are just three examples of common genetic mutations that define distinct molecular classes of glioblastoma. The well-known mutations identified in glioblastoma have subsequently lead to the identification of epigenetic and transcriptomic mechanisms which perpetuate the disease: examples of this are the hypermethylation of CpG islands in IDH1-mutant glioblastoma [<xref rid="pone.0252924.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] and the loss of histone H3.3 K27me3 in H3.3 mutant glioblastomas [<xref rid="pone.0252924.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p>
    <p>Despite the vast increase in knowledge about the genome, epigenome and transcriptome of glioblastoma, clinical outcomes have not changed and drug development in glioblastoma is lagging behind the significant advances in glioblastoma (epi)genomics. While some of these genetic targets can be used therapeutically, the majority of them are unsuitable as a drug targets although they may offer the prospect of use in immunotherapy.</p>
    <p>Thus, there is an unequivocal medical need for novel compounds or combinations of compounds that are able to put a hold on disease progression.</p>
    <p>The U.S. Orphan Drug Act of 1983 was intended to incentivize drug development in rare diseases including rare cancers by providing protocol assistance, orphan grants programs, tax credit for 50% of clinical trial costs, U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) fee waiver, and 7 years of marketing exclusivity [<xref rid="pone.0252924.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Between 1983 and 2015, more than a third of all orphan drug approvals (N = 177 out of a total of 492, i.e., 36%) were related compounds intended to treat rare cancers [<xref rid="pone.0252924.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p>
    <p>While there may be manifold reasons for a clinical failure of novel drugs, a comprehensive view on the status of designated compounds for the indication glioblastoma is still lacking.</p>
    <p>In particular, it remains unclear which substance classes and therapeutic principles for glioblastoma have entered the market or are under development. This knowledge is instructive as the pharmacological principles which underlie the designated drugs may have changed over time and thus may mirror the different directions of brain tumour research. We aim to analyse the lessons that we have learned by assessing successes and failures in orphan drug development in glioblastoma. Therefore, we present a cross-sectional, quantitative clinical-regulatory insight into the status of FDA orphan drug designations for compounds intended to treat GBM. This study covers the period between January 1983 and August 2020.</p>

    <title>Methods</title>
    <p>STROBE criteria (<xref rid="pone.0252924.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Checklist</xref>) were respected for planning, conduct, analysis, and reporting of this study [<xref rid="pone.0252924.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. We accessed the Orphan Drug Product designation database on 30 July 2020 at <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/opdlisting/oopd/" ext-link-type="uri">https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/opdlisting/oopd/</ext-link> and downloaded the information on all designated drugs using the search term “Glioblastoma”. The list of drugs was then manually cleared from non-oncological indications. An allocation to the field of "paediatric oncology" or "adult oncology" was performed by a board-certified paediatric oncologist.</p>
    <p>Disease entities which typically occur both in adult age and in the field of paediatric oncology (such as lymphomas and osteosarcoma for instance) were allocated to both categories. Others which almost typically occur in paediatric oncology such as ALL were considered only for this area.</p>
    <p>Subsequently, designated drugs that were intended to treat glioblastoma were characterized according to their mode of action in the pharmacological classes “cytostatics”, “cellular/viral immunotherapy”, “targeted therapies” or “others”. Targeted therapies were defined as substances for which at least one molecular target could be identified by literature research [<xref rid="pone.0252924.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Compounds that could not be classified unequivocally were categorized as "others"–this class also contained compounds that are being used as diagnostics.</p>
    <p>In order to independently verify whether there were approved drugs for the treatment of glioblastoma that were not listed in the U.S. Food and Drug Administration Orphan Drug Product database, we conducted a full text search in the FDA drug label database (FDALabel, <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://nctr-crs.fda.gov/fdalabel/ui/search" ext-link-type="uri">https://nctr-crs.fda.gov/fdalabel/ui/search</ext-link>). Search terms were “glioblastoma” in the section “indications and usage”. The database was accessed on 28 October 2020. Findings were juxtaposed to the approved compounds identified from the search in Orphan Drug Product designation database as described above. In addition, we cross-validated whether or not the compounds identified from the search in FDALabel were registered as orphan drugs.</p>
    <p>Standard methods of descriptive statistics were applied. In particular, continuous variables were summarized with mean, standard deviation, and median, minimum, and maximum values whereas categorical variables were summarized with frequencies and percentages. Analyzed groups included 1) approved and 2) designated compounds intended to treat glioblastoma.</p>
    <p>In order to determine the number of approved drugs, we first queried the downloaded data from the Food and Drug Administration Orphan Drug Product database for FDA approved drugs and curated the list by eliminating duplicate terms. Likewise, the data were analyzed for designated compounds. In addition, we analyzed number and characteristics of orphan drug designations for glioblastoma that were subsequently withdrawn. In order to put our findings on orphan drug designations for glioblastoma into perspective within a global oncological context we analysed orphan drug designations for all oncological indications currently listed in the US Food and Drug Administration Orphan Drug Product database. For the review of compounds which have been used in Glioblastoma trials, we accessed the clintrials.gov database (URL: <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/" ext-link-type="uri">https://clinicaltrials.gov/</ext-link>) on 07<sup>th</sup> of April 2021 and downloaded all interventional trials that were completed for the search term “glioblastoma” and for which data have been published. The compounds that were used in these trials were classified into the same categories that were applied for the designated compounds.</p>
    <p>For statistical analysis and graphical display, we used the software R (version 3.5.0). For plots, the program library ggplot2 was employed. We used the CONSORT checklist when writing our report [<xref rid="pone.0252924.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</p>

      <p>These results were in line with the findings of the FDALabel database query: bevacizumab, carmustine, and temozolomide list the indication "glioblastoma" on their FDA approved labels. All of these drugs have been used in the clinical setting, however with discouraging results and no improvement in the outcome of glioblastoma [<xref rid="pone.0252924.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p>

      <title>Designated drugs in glioblastoma</title>
      <p>Given the low number of approved drugs that can be used in the clinical setting, we next sought to get an overview on the drug development landscape in glioblastoma, trying to quantify and qualify the drugs that are in the pipeline for this indication.</p>
      <p>Overall, 162 compounds had an orphan drug designation for glioblastoma. Until 2016, the number of drugs designated for the indication glioblastoma varied, but on average displayed an increasing trend (<xref rid="pone.0252924.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>). For the last four years, this tendency seems to have reversed and the number of designated compounds per year displays a downward trend. To be able to put these findings in GBM into a global oncological drug development context, we assessed the spectrum of all oncological—and paediatric oncological diseases with orphan drug designations.</p>

      <p>Our analysis here yielded 4618 compounds (out of a total of 5513 orphan drug designations for any rare disease = 83%, <xref rid="pone.0252924.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>) that were designated for either a paediatric or an adult oncological entity. As in glioblastoma, since 1984, the number of orphan drug designations for adult oncology per year varied with an increasing trend and showed a peak of 342 compounds in 2016. As expected, the number of compounds targeting typical disease entities from adult oncology was consistently higher than in paediatric oncology (on average 37% higher). The numeric pattern over time appeared to be similar in paediatric and adult orphan drug designations.</p>

      <p>To better understand the intended indications of these designated compounds, we then analyzed, which tumour entities are targeted by these drugs.</p>

Most oncological orphan drug designations for the adult patient population were granted for lymphoma, pancreatic cancer, and glioblastoma. In contrast, lymphomas, glioblastoma and AML received the majority of orphan drug designations for paediatric cancers.</p>

      <p>(<xref rid="pone.0252924.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A and 3B</xref>). Although some of these categories are quite heterogeneous and comprise different entities (such as lymphomas which are in fact a group of genetically heterogeneous diseases associated with divergent outcome), the predominance of these groups is remarkable as they do not represent the oncological indications which occur most frequently but which are associated with a high mortality. Thus, the designated compounds in fact address the unmet medical need of cancers which are associated with a high mortality despite not being the most frequent ones [<xref rid="pone.0252924.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p>

      <p>Studying the compounds designated for glioblastoma which were subsequently withdrawn from the market is instructive as it may highlight potential mechanistically interesting substances that never reached the clinic.</p>
      <p>Our search in the FDA approved drugs database revealed 14 designated compounds which were subsequently withdrawn from the drug development pipeline. Some of these drugs were classical cytostatics, others displayed more innovative modes of action: cilengitide, for instance, an integrin inhibitor [<xref rid="pone.0252924.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] was among the withdrawn substances. Other, less well-known substances included the glutamate receptor inhibitor talampanel and cintredekin besudotox, an IL13 conjugated toxin, specifically targeting glioblastoma. Reasons for these withdrawals were not published and are therefore, unfortunately, not known.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec012">
      <title>Pharmacological classes of designated drugs in glioblastoma</title>
      <p>We next characterized the pharmacological classes which were designated per year. We therefore allocated the designated compounds into the broad categories "cytostatics", "targeted therapy", "Cellular product/ Virus" and "others". The latter constitutes a heterogeneous group of substances comprising intraoperative fluroescent dyes (as diagnostics), peptide vaccinations or repurposed drugs such as cannabinoids which are approved for other indications and were subsequently found to display anti-neoplastic properties (“repurposing”).</p>
      <p>When regarding the designation per compound class over time, we found that the median year of designation for cytostatic drugs was 2008 (<xref rid="pone.0252924.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A</xref>). With an increasing knowledge on both the genetic makeup of glioblastomas and the resulting therapeutic targets, the years 2010–2020 saw an increase in small molecule inhibitors, directed against specific molecular structures (<xref rid="pone.0252924.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A</xref>). An investigation on the nature of these therapeutic targets revealed a high diversity: Compounds directed against VEGF or the VEGFR were most frequently found, but there were also molecules directed against EGFR—a molecule prototypically mutated in subsets of adult glioblastoma [<xref rid="pone.0252924.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p>

      </fig>
      <p>Similarly, immunotherapeutic approaches including dendritic cell vaccinations, or NK cell/T-cell based therapies represents a focus of the last years compound designations. As cellular and viral therapies represent a very diverse group, we dissected this category further (<xref rid="pone.0252924.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4B</xref>): Remarkably, 45% (9/20) of all therapeutics proved to be virus based, the majority of which being oncolytic viruses. In dendritic cell based therapies, the second largest group, the dendritic cells were mostly stimulated with autologous tumour lysates or with synthetic peptides derived from glioblastomas, aiming to elicit an anti-tumour immune response in the host. The glioma-based therapeutics mainly consist of autologous tumour cells, which were engineered to express immunogenic peptides/antigenes (such as an aberrant IGF1-R receptor).</p>
      <p>Although none of the latter therapeutics has been approved for glioblastoma so far, the number of designated drugs in this category points to a high potential of these compounds in the clinic.</p>
      <p>To examine which designated drugs have been used in recently in the frame of completed and ongoing clinical studies, we classified compounds that were contained in interventional studies from the portal clintrials.gov (<xref rid="pone.0252924.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Table</xref>). Among the completed drug trials, the majority (102/141; 72,3%) included at least one compound designated or approved for the indication “glioblastoma”. Notably many of these studies combined an approved compound (such as bevacizumab or temozolomide) with a more experimental drug. Among the completed studies, only very few (5/141, 3,54%) made use of immunotherapeutic approaches either alone or in combination with cytostatics, a number that may possibly rise in the future.</p>

      <title>Approved drugs in glioblastoma</title>
      <p>The overall increase in orphan drug designations for the whole oncological field is also seen in the case of glioblastoma (with an average of six designated drugs per year). In stark contrast to the number of designations, only six compounds were approved for this entity in the last 30 years—the most recent substance being bevacizumab, an antibody that targets VEGF, which however did not show a survival benefit in large, placebo-controlled studies [<xref rid="pone.0252924.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Thus, considerable discussions are ongoing about whether the FDA-approval of bevacizumab should be withdrawn again.</p>
      <p>Other approved compounds for GBM include cytostatic drugs such as carmustine or temozolomide. Temozolomide has become a frequently used standard therapy due to its generally favourable toxicity profile. It is one of few drugs for which a biomarker has been identified: The MGMT promoter governs expression of the corresponding gene. It represents the most important resistance mechanism to an alkylating therapy and its hypermethylation has been associated with a better outcome [<xref rid="pone.0252924.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p>
      <p>It is remarkable that so far no cellular or virus based immunotherapy has been granted approval by the FDA, although there have been promising preclinical and clinical [<xref rid="pone.0252924.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] studies suggesting a potential benefit.</p>
      <p>Of particular during the last years, the number of designated cellular therapies has increased. Some of them employ T-cells with chimeric antigen receptors, others back on dendritic cell vaccinations.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec015">
      <title>Spectrum of indications for designated drugs</title>
      <p>Overall, our study revealed a wealth of compounds designated for oncological indications and an average increase in drug designations per year over time. However, this trend seemed to continue only until the year 2016 which marked a turning point with a decrease in designated compounds per year from then on. Reasons for this decline in the last years may be manifold. While the Corona-pandemic may have influenced the number of designated drugs in 2020, the reasons for the receding numbers in the years 2017–2019 could be a lack of novel anti-neoplastic agents that successfully undergo testing in clinical studies. Other reasons that could negatively influence the process of compound designation are a lack of funding, changes in the regulatory environment, or unsustainable businesses which may have grown in these years.</p>
      <p>While some of the substances that we highlight here were already discussed and contained in a review by Lassen et al. [<xref rid="pone.0252924.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], the surge in immunotherapeutic approaches which we highlight here seems noteworthy. For many of these novel, immunotherapeutic products, no efficacy data in the sense of randomized, placebo-controlled trials have been published. However, safety of administration and first-in-human data are available for a number of medications: The oncoloytic HSV-1 (G207) has demonstrated safety in a phase I study with a median survival of 7,5 months (after inoculation of the virus) [<xref rid="pone.0252924.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] and good tolerability of the modified virus. For another virus based immunotherapy (employing the genetically modified HSV M032), a clinical protocol and non-human primate data on safety have been published, however Phase I data are not available to date [<xref rid="pone.0252924.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p>
      <p>Similar data exist for other immunotherapeutic products that use modified progenitor cells: Hematopoietic progenitor cells, transfected with a mutant MGMT-receptor to enhance temozolomide resistance of the hematopoietic system, were used within the frame of a phase I and demonstrated a reasonable safety profile [<xref rid="pone.0252924.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p>
      <p>Overall, none of these medications has demonstrated ground-breaking progress in overall survival in these preliminary data. However, promising Phase 1 data exists which is worthwhile to be pursued further.</p>
      <p>It is remarkable, that the majority of designated compounds in adult oncology targeted lymphomas, pancreatic cancer and glioblastoma. This does not necessarily reflect the epidemiological spectrum of malignant diseases with breast cancer, lung cancer and prostate cancer being the most frequent cancers. When, however, considering cancer mortality from these entities, the designations certainly do meet a medical need.</p>

    <sec id="sec016">
      <title>Withdrawn drugs in glioblastoma</title>
      <p>Several orphan drug designations for glioblastoma were subsequently withdrawn without ever having been approved. Unfortunately, the precise reason for these withdrawals is not known. It would be interesting to capture this information transparently in public or even in the clinicaltrials.gov database as this would allow the scientific community to learn from previous experiences, and potentially avoid unnecessary exposure of subjects to clinical research. Possible reasons for failure may include a flawed scientific rationale, flawed trial design or unsustainable business (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://termeerfoundation.org/collaborations" ext-link-type="uri">https://termeerfoundation.org/collaborations</ext-link> accessed 06 October 2020 [<xref rid="pone.0252924.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]).</p>

      <title>Drug safety considerations and innovative aspects of drug development in glioblastoma</title>
      <p>Usually orphan drug development programs involve fewer patients and fewer clinical trials than non-orphan drug development programs. No approved drug for glioblastoma was withdrawn. This indicates that there were no major safety issues in the orphan drug development process in this area that were detected in the post-approval pharmacovigilance process. With respect to innovation in the process of granting approval to novel drugs, there is certainly room to expedite this process: The only targeted drug among the approved compounds remains bevacizumab. Until today, the impact of the US orphan drug act on the drug development for glioblastoma has been limited: There are only four FDA orphan approvals for the treatment of glioblastoma—one of them (5-aminolevulinic acid.) is a diagnostic compound. There is, however, hope for progress. It is possible that more compounds may successfully reach the clinic, because 60 orphan drug designations have been granted with an increasing tendency in the last 5 years.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec018">
      <title>Barriers to a successful translation of preclinical findings to the clinic</title>
      <p>GBM represents a genetically highly complex disease: When progressing, these tumours undergo a complex, molecular evolution that results in an increase of genetic aberrations. Thus, therapies which target only one specific molecular lesion fall short in controlling the diverse number of other pathways which may contribute to tumour growth. However even combination therapies (including small molecule inhibitors and classical cytotoxic compounds) did not show the desired effects in clinical studies).</p>
      <p>Further problems which are encountered in the management of glioblastoma include its invasive nature and the impossibility to achieve a gross total resection owing to the infiltrative growth, its high proliferation rate and the associated speed by which resistance mechanisms toward applied therapies emerge. Despite a growing number of designated compounds and molecular directed therapeutics only few of them address the molecular characteristics of the genetic and epigenetic glioblastoma subgroups. As an example, the molecular mechanism that drives H3K27M mutant glioblastomas is well described by now: A sequestration of the enzyme PRC2 [<xref rid="pone.0252924.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] leads to a global loss of the repressive histone mark H3K27me3. An inhibitor of enzymes (GSK-J4) that catalyze the demethylation of H3K27me3, thus restoring this mark, has been tested [<xref rid="pone.0252924.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] but so far has not reached the status as a designated drug.</p>
      <p>There is hope that immunotherapy- either antibody based on the inhibition of PD(L)1 or by using cellular products such as CAR-T cells [<xref rid="pone.0252924.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] or dendritic cells—may ultimately improve the outcome for patients with glioblastoma. At the least, these agents represent combination partners that may expand the portfolio of classically used cytotoxic drugs.</p>

      <title>Limitations</title>
      <p>This analysis of orphan drug development in the field of oncology is limited to the data provided in U.S. Food and Drug Administration Orphan Drug Product database. Other geographic regions were not included in this study because the FDA database is considered comprehensive. As orphan drug development is generally a global endeavour, we consider the results of this analysis to be generalizable within the context of these limitations.</p>
      <p>In summary, we conclude despite the fact that current pharmacological treatment options in GBM are sparse, the drug development pipeline in GBM has been growing steadily until 2016 and the number of designated drugs is still at a high level since then [<xref rid="pone.0252924.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. In particular, the surge of designated immunotherapies during the last years raises the hope that elaborate combination therapies between classical therapeutic backbones (i.e. radiotherapy and chemotherapy) and these novel, currently experimental interventions may help to provide better treatment options for this deadly disease in the future.</p>

    <p>The drug development pipeline for glioblastoma - a cross sectional assessment of the FDA Orphan Drug Product designation database</p>
    <p>PLOS ONE</p>
    <p>Dear Dr. Johann,</p>
    <p>Thank you for submitting your manuscript to PLOS ONE. After careful consideration, we feel that it has merit but does not fully meet PLOS ONE’s publication criteria as it currently stands. Therefore, we invite you to submit a revised version of the manuscript that addresses the points raised during the review process.</p>
    <p>The essential points that require addressing are as follows:</p>
    <p>Provide a Supplementary Table summarizing drug trials in both pediatric and adult GBM use for analysis, including all vaccines in the same cellular product/virus category, and renaming that category appropriately (see reviewers 1 &amp; 4 remarks pertaining to Figure 4A, below).</p>
    <p>Correct all errors and clarify all points (including captions) raised by each reviewer in Table and Figures.</p>
    <p>Revise the main conclusion that the number of orphan drugs being developed is escalating as per reviewer 3's comment on Figure 1, which shows a peak in 2016 and a downward trend since.</p>
    <p>There were no significant conflicts between reviewers. Addressing all other points raised by them is therefore also strongly recommended.</p>
    <p>I believe that your manuscript represents an informative summary of the US orphan drug development program for glioblastoma. If appropriately revised, it will be particularly useful for researchers working on new drug development, as well as for clinicians treating patients afflicted with this devastating tumor.</p>
    <p>Please submit your revised manuscript by April 30, 2021. If you will need more time than this to complete your revisions, please reply to this message or contact the journal office at <email>plosone@plos.org</email>.

    <p>5. Review Comments to the Author</p>
    <p>Please use the space provided to explain your answers to the questions above. You may also include additional comments for the author, including concerns about dual publication, research ethics, or publication ethics. (Please upload your review as an attachment if it exceeds 20,000 characters)</p>
    <p>Reviewer #1: The authors relay information obtained from a searchable FDA orphan drug database of compounds approved or being investigated for the treatment of glioblastoma brain tumor.</p>
    <p>The authors identified four compounds approved for use in treatment or diagnosis or glioblastoma. 162 additional compounds had an orphan drug designation not FDA approved for glioblastoma. The authors also found a steady increase of orphan drug designations over time from 2016.</p>
    <p>Mention is made of the main categories of investigated compounds for glioblastoma. The manuscript would benefit from more in-depth analysis of the promising compounds and mechanisms of action to understand the main directions that investigators are taking in search of a more successful treatment approach to glioblastoma. .</p>
    <p>Reviewer #2: This article provides an informative summary of the status of FDA orphan drug designations GBM. However, there are many errors both grammatical and content that need to be addressed before publication.</p>
    <p>Please clarify whether reporting for GBM only or high-grade glioma.</p>
    <p>Provide Supplementary Table summarizing drug trials in both pediatric and adult GBM use for analysis, and list designated categories (cytostatic, antibody, cellular/virus, targeted therapy, other)</p>
    <p>Suggest including all vaccines in the same category, peptide and dendritic cell. It would seem most appropriate to include in the cellular/virus category and to rename appropriately.</p>
    <p>Table 1: There are many errors in this table, including 1) Content errors, 2) misspellings “ame”, “copound”. Consider editing “Target Structure” to “Description”. Also, it is not clear what year of designation refers to. Is this the year approved by the FDA or year of orphan drug designation? Please clarify and check all dates. Further, there are 5 approved drugs for GBM (not 4): 5-aminolevulinic, bevacizumab, temozolomide, lomustine and carmustine.</p>
    <p>- 5-aminolevulinic: better described as an “intraoperative optical imaging agent” vs “diagnostic” or “fluorescent dye”. Also, it received ODD by the FDA in , and FDA approval in 2017. It is not clear what specific regulatory event is being listed as 2002.</p>
    <p>- Bevacizumab: This is an anti-VEGF antibody not a radioconjugate small molecule. Also, bev was approved by the FDA in 2009 so again it is not clear the regulatory event being listed as 2014.</p>
    <p>- Prolifeprosan 20 with carmustine (GLIADEL) is an implant to deliver the approved drug carmustine. This needs to be clarified.</p>
    <p>- Temozolomide: check year of designation date.</p>
    <p>Overuse of “:”. In most contexts it would be more appropriate to replace the “:” and instead start a new sentence. If the authors choose to use a “:” to join 2 related sentences, then the second sentence should not be capitalized.</p>
    <p>Review should be carefully proof-read.</p>
    <p>Reviewer #3: The authors present a cross sectional assessment of the US orphan drug development program with regards to glioblastoma. This original research provides a helpful overview of the evolving treatment landscape for GBM, even while highlighting the relative paucity of approved therapies thus far.</p>
    <p>The statistical analysis in this article is largely descriptive and not problematic. However, the authors' main conclusion that the number of orphan drugs being developed is escalating is not supported by Figure 1, which shows a peak in 2016 and a downward trend since. (2020 results could be affected by COVID-19, but there isn't a clear explanation for 2017-2019.) This doesn't invalidate the analysis, but it should modify the conclusion.</p>
    <p>Other comments:</p>
    <p>- The official WHO term is now "glioblastoma" not glioblastoma multiforme.</p>
    <p>- Clinical outcomes for glioblastoma HAVE improved, just not much.</p>
    <p>- Table 1 is not accurate. Bevacizumab is the angiogenesis inhibitor, BCNU wafers are not.</p>
    <p>- Might be worth noting in the discussion that of these approved therapies, usage of 5-ALA and BCNU wafers is not universal, thus further highlighting the need for more progress.</p>
    <p>- Characterizing cilengitide as "well known" and other drugs as "less well-known" seems somewhat arbitrary and akin to a personal opinion.</p>
    <p>- "Cannaboids" is misspelled.</p>
    <p>- "Temozolomide" is misspelled.</p>
    <p>- I don't think it's accurate to "assume" that CAR T-cells or dendritic cell vaccines will ultimately be approved for GBM. There is no evidence to support this at this time.</p>
    <p>- Might be worth discussing that although bevacizumab is still FDA-approved for recurrent GBM, there was considerable discussion about pulling this approval when phase 3 trials demonstrated the absence of a strong survival benefit.</p>
    <p>- The GSK-J4 example doesn't seem to fit this article, as it is not a orphan designated drug.</p>
    <p>Reviewer #4: This manuscript gives a comprehensive overview of the landscape of designated and approved orphan drugs to treat glioblastoma multiforme. The information provided is useful for researchers who work on developing new drugs for GBM or clinicians interested in approved drugs and recent trends. However, the paper has several flaws that need to be corrected (see below).</p>
    <p>The conclusion that the rate of designated (but not yet approved) drugs per year has steadily increased is not supported by figures 1 and 2, which show a rapid rise in new designated drugs starting about 10 years ago, reaching a maximum in 2016 and then declining to the level of the beginning of the decade. The authors should discuss this trend and potential reasons for the reversal in the Discussion section.</p>
    <p>A similar review, entitled "Orphan drugs in glioblastoma multiforme: a review," was published by Lassen et al. in 2014 (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.2147/ODRR.S46018" ext-link-type="uri">https://doi.org/10.2147/ODRR.S46018</ext-link>). The authors should reference that paper and make it clear that their review adds new information.</p>
    <p>Table 1 has many errors, including typos (ame, copound) and wrong drug information under Target structure and Year of Designation. Please correct these errors.</p>
    <p>The caption of Figure 1 should be "Barplot shows the number of new orphan drug designations for the indication glioblastoma per year. Years without a new designation are not shown.</p>
    <p>The vertical axis label of Figure 1 should be "Number of new drugs per year." Make the same changes to FIgure 2.</p>
    <p>In Figure 3A, it seems that the Lymphoma category does not have a bar.</p>
    <p>In Figure 3A and B, the authors included non-oncological, rare diseases such as Thalassemia and SCD (Sickle Cell Disease). They should carefully check each category and remove all non-oncological classifications.</p>
    <p>In Figure 4 A, I suggest replacing 'Cellular product/Virus' with 'Cellular/Viral Immunotherapy' for clarity.</p>
    <p>In Figure 4 A, the individual plots are 'dot plots' not 'boxplots'; no need to capitalize that phrase.</p>
    <p>In the Abbreviations table, the entries PNH Paroxysmal nightly hemoglobinuria and SCD Sickle cell disease should be removed because they are rare genetic diseases; also see comment about Figure 3 A and B above.</p>
    <p>In the Abbreviations table, replace 'Vasoendothelial growth factor' with 'Vascular endothelial growth factor'.</p>
    <p>In the Abbreviations table, add VEGFR - Vascular endothelial growth factor receptor.</p>

    <p>The drug development pipeline for glioblastoma - a cross sectional assessment of the FDA Orphan Drug Product designation database</p>
    <p>PLOS ONE</p>
    <p>We thank the editor and the reviewers for their thoughtful comments that were very helpful to further strengthen our manuscript.</p>
    <p>We took all the issues raised into account and address each of them point-by-point in the following section: </p>
    <p>Editor</p>
    <p>Comment 1: Provide a Supplementary Table summarizing drug trials in both pediatric and adult GBM use for analysis, including all vaccines in the same cellular product/virus category, and renaming that category appropriately (see reviewers 1 &amp; 4 remarks pertaining to Figure 4A, below).</p>
    <p>Correct all errors and clarify all points (including captions) raised by each reviewer in Table and Figures.</p>
    <p>Answer 1: This has now been changed: We have generated a supplementary Table (Supplementary Table 3) that gives an overview on completed drug trials in GBM and classifies the compounds that are used in these interventional studies. We have inserted the category “cellular/viral immunotherapy” for that purpose. </p>
    <p>Comment 2: Revise the main conclusion that the number of orphan drugs being developed is escalating as per reviewer 3's comment on Figure 1, which shows a peak in 2016 and a downward trend since.</p>
    <p>Answer 2: We have now corrected this statement (p. 9: “Until 2016, the number of drugs designated for the indication glioblastoma varied, but displayed an increasing trend (Figure 1). (…)””. Moreover, we have inserted a reference pointing to Figure 1 in the text.</p>
    <p>Comment 3: There were no significant conflicts between reviewers. Addressing all other points raised by them is therefore also strongly recommended. I believe that your manuscript represents an informative summary of the US orphan drug development program for glioblastoma. If appropriately revised, it will be particularly useful for researchers working on new drug development, as well as for clinicians treating patients afflicted with this devastating tumor.</p>
    <p>Answer 3: Thank you very much for this encouraging comment. We are addressing all points raised by the reviewers.</p>

    <p>Answer 4: Thank you very much for this comment, this is now also implemented at the end of the manuscript</p>
    <p>Reviewer #1: </p>
    <p>Comment 1: The authors relay information obtained from a searchable FDA orphan drug database of compounds approved or being investigated for the treatment of glioblastoma brain tumor.</p>
    <p>The authors identified four compounds approved for use in treatment or diagnosis or glioblastoma. 162 additional compounds had an orphan drug designation not FDA approved for glioblastoma. The authors also found a steady increase of orphan drug designations over time from 2016.</p>
    <p>Mention is made of the main categories of investigated compounds for glioblastoma. The manuscript would benefit from more in-depth analysis of the promising compounds and mechanisms of action to understand the main directions that investigators are taking in search of a more successful treatment approach to glioblastoma. </p>
    <p>Answer 1: We are very grateful to the reviewer for the positive overall feed-back of our work. To present a more detailed discussion of promising, recently designated compounds, we have now improved the discussion section by providing a more detailed analysis on some of the designated compounds and compound categories (section “Spectrum of indications for designated drugs”). In particular, we focus on the data of the immunotherapeutic approaches which are currently being pursued. </p>
    <p>Reviewer #2</p>
    <p>Comment 1: This article provides an informative summary of the status of FDA orphan drug designations GBM. However, there are many errors both grammatical and content that need to be addressed before publication. Please clarify whether reporting for GBM only or high-grade glioma.</p>
    <p>Answer 1: We thank the reviewer for this important remark. The analysis is to glioblastoma although many of the compounds presented here may be applicable to other high grade gliomas as well. We have clarified this in the "Methods" section of the manuscript.</p>
    <p>Comment 2: Provide Supplementary Table summarizing drug trials in both pediatric and adult GBM use for analysis, and list designated categories (cytostatic, antibody, cellular/virus, targeted therapy, other)</p>
    <p>Suggest including all vaccines in the same category, peptide and dendritic cell. It would seem most appropriate to include in the cellular/virus category and to rename appropriately.</p>
    <p>Answer 2: We have now made the required changes and summarized all vaccines in one category. Moreover, we have generated a table (Supplementary Table 3) based on the clintrials.gov database that lists completed and ongoing trials in GBM and highlights whether any of the FDA-designated compounds are used in these.</p>
    <p>Comment 3: Table 1: There are many errors in this table, including 1) Content errors, 2) misspellings “ame”, “copound”. Consider editing “Target Structure” to “Description”. Also, it is not clear what year of designation refers to. Is this the year approved by the FDA or year of orphan drug designation? Please clarify and check all dates. Further, there are 5 approved drugs for GBM (not 4): 5-aminolevulinic, bevacizumab, temozolomide, lomustine and carmustine.</p>
    <p>- 5-aminolevulinic: better described as an “intraoperative optical imaging agent” vs “diagnostic” or “fluorescent dye”. Also, it received ODD by the FDA in , and FDA approval in 2017. It is not clear what specific regulatory event is being listed as 2002.</p>
    <p>- Bevacizumab: This is an anti-VEGF antibody not a radioconjugate small molecule. Also, bev was approved by the FDA in 2009 so again it is not clear the regulatory event being listed as 2014.</p>
    <p>- Prolifeprosan 20 with carmustine (GLIADEL) is an implant to deliver the approved drug carmustine. This needs to be clarified.</p>
    <p>- Temozolomide: check year of designation date.</p>
    <p>Comment 3: We thank the reviewer for pointing out these issues. Indeed, we have now renewed this table, corrected the spelling and content errors, “Target structure” was corrected to “description”. “Year of designation” has now been corrected to “Year of approval” which is a more important category in the context of our paper.</p>
    <p>Comment 4: Overuse of “:”. In most contexts it would be more appropriate to replace the “:” and instead start a new sentence. If the authors choose to use a “:” to join 2 related sentences, then the second sentence should not be capitalized.</p>
    <p>Answer 4: We have now proof-read the manuscript carefully and changed the “:” to a full stop in many instances which was deemed to be more appropriate.</p>
    <p>Comment 5: Review should be carefully proof-read.</p>
    <p>Answer 5: The review was carefully proof-read. In addition, the manuscript was checked for language by a native speaker with a PhD degree in science as mentioned in the acknowledgement section.</p>
    <p>Reviewer #3: </p>
    <p>Comment 1: The authors present a cross sectional assessment of the US orphan drug development program with regards to glioblastoma. This original research provides a helpful overview of the evolving treatment landscape for GBM, even while highlighting the relative paucity of approved therapies thus far. The statistical analysis in this article is largely descriptive and not problematic. However, the authors' main conclusion that the number of orphan drugs being developed is escalating is not supported by Figure 1, which shows a peak in 2016 and a downward trend since. (2020 results could be affected by COVID-19, but there isn't a clear explanation for 2017-2019.) This doesn't invalidate the analysis, but it should modify the conclusion.</p>
    <p>Answer 1: We are very grateful for the overall assessment of our work and have modified/corrected the conclusion that the number of designated drugs is escalating. </p>
    <p>Comment 2: The official WHO term is now "glioblastoma" not glioblastoma multiforme. Clinical outcomes for glioblastoma HAVE improved, just not much.</p>
    <p>Answer 2: These two aforementioned points have now been modified in the manuscript and changed accordingly. </p>
    <p>Comment 3: Table 1 is not accurate. Bevacizumab is the angiogenesis inhibitor, BCNU wafers are not.</p>
    <p>Answer 3: corrected.</p>
    <p>Comment 4: Might be worth noting in the discussion that of these approved therapies, usage of 5-ALA and BCNU wafers is not universal, thus further highlighting the need for more progress.</p>
    <p>Answer 4: we have clarified this. </p>
    <p>Comment 5: - Characterizing cilengitide as "well known" and other drugs as "less well-known" seems somewhat arbitrary and akin to a personal opinion.</p>
    <p>Answer 5: we have clarified this.</p>
    <p>Comment 6: - "Cannaboids" is misspelled.</p>
    <p>Answer 6: corrected </p>
    <p>Comment 7: - "Temozolomide" is misspelled.</p>
    <p>Answer 7: corrected</p>
    <p>Comment 8: - I don't think it's accurate to "assume" that CAR T-cells or dendritic cell vaccines will ultimately be approved for GBM. There is no evidence to support this at this time.</p>
    <p>Answer 8: Thank you very much for this important comment, we have clarified this.</p>
    <p>Comment 9: - Might be worth discussing that although bevacizumab is still FDA-approved for recurrent GBM, there was considerable discussion about pulling this approval when phase 3 trials demonstrated the absence of a strong survival benefit.</p>
    <p>Answer 9: we have added this statement into the discussion section.</p>
    <p>Comment 10: The GSK-J4 example doesn't seem to fit this article, as it is not a orphan designated drug.</p>
    <p>Answer 10: We thank you very much for this comment, we have amended the text accordingly.</p>
    <p>Reviewer #4: </p>
    <p>Comment 1: This manuscript gives a comprehensive overview of the landscape of designated and approved orphan drugs to treat glioblastoma multiforme. The information provided is useful for researchers who work on developing new drugs for GBM or clinicians interested in approved drugs and recent trends. However, the paper has several flaws that need to be corrected (see below). The conclusion that the rate of designated (but not yet approved) drugs per year has steadily increased is not supported by figures 1 and 2, which show a rapid rise in new designated drugs starting about 10 years ago, reaching a maximum in 2016 and then declining to the level of the beginning of the decade. The authors should discuss this trend and potential reasons for the reversal in the Discussion section.</p>
    <p>Answer 1: Thank you very much for this important comment. We have corrected the description of the curve’s kinetics accordingly. In addition, we have added a paragraph about potential reasons.</p>
    <p>Comment 2: A similar review, entitled "Orphan drugs in glioblastoma multiforme: a review," was published by Lassen et al. in 2014 (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.2147/ODRR.S46018" ext-link-type="uri">https://doi.org/10.2147/ODRR.S46018</ext-link>). The authors should reference that paper and make it clear that their review adds new information.</p>
    <p>Answer 2: Thank you very much for pointing out this important paper. We have added it to the references and included a contextual statement into the manuscript’s discussion section as suggested. </p>
    <p>Comment 3: Table 1 has many errors, including typos (ame, copound) and wrong drug information under Target structure and Year of Designation. Please correct these errors.</p>
    <p>Answer 3: This is a very well taken point which has also been brought up by reviewer 2. We have now corrected the table (and added lomustine as a still missing approved compound). </p>
    <p>Comment 4: The caption of Figure 1 should be "Barplot shows the number of new orphan drug designations for the indication glioblastoma per year. Years without a new designation are not shown.</p>
    <p>The vertical axis label of Figure 1 should be "Number of new drugs per year." Make the same changes to FIgure 2.</p>
    <p>Answer 4: corrected</p>
    <p>Comment 5: In Figure 3A, it seems that the Lymphoma category does not have a bar.</p>
    <p>Answer 5: corrected</p>
    <p>Comment 6: In Figure 3A and B, the authors included non-oncological, rare diseases such as Thalassemia and SCD (Sickle Cell Disease). They should carefully check each category and remove all non-oncological classifications.</p>
    <p>Answer 6: done</p>
    <p>Comment 7: In Figure 4 A, I suggest replacing 'Cellular product/Virus' with 'Cellular/Viral Immunotherapy' for clarity.</p>
    <p>Answer 7: this has been changed in Figure 4</p>
    <p>Comment 8: In Figure 4 A, the individual plots are 'dot plots' not 'boxplots'; no need to capitalize that phrase.</p>
    <p>Answer 8: corrected</p>
    <p>Comment 9: In the Abbreviations table, the entries PNH Paroxysmal nightly hemoglobinuria and SCD Sickle cell disease should be removed because they are rare genetic diseases; also see comment about Figure 3 A and B above.</p>
    <p>Answer 9: corrected</p>
    <p>Comment 10: In the Abbreviations table, replace 'Vasoendothelial growth factor' with 'Vascular endothelial growth factor'.</p>
    <p>Answer 10: done</p>
    <p>Comment 11: In the Abbreviations table, add VEGFR - Vascular endothelial growth factor receptor.</p>
    <p>Answer 11: done</p>
