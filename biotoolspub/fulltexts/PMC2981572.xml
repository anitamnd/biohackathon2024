        <title>Background</title>
        <p>Gene-set enrichment analysis is a useful technique to help functionally characterize large gene lists, such as the results of gene expression experiments. This technique finds functionally coherent gene-sets, such as pathways, that are statistically over-represented in a given gene list. Ideally, the number of resulting sets is smaller than the number of genes in the list, thus simplifying interpretation. However, the increasing number and redundancy of gene-sets used by many current enrichment analysis software works against this ideal.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>Principal Findings</title>
        <p>To overcome gene-set redundancy and help in the interpretation of large gene lists, we developed “Enrichment Map”, a network-based visualization method for gene-set enrichment results. Gene-sets are organized in a network, where each set is a node and edges represent gene overlap between sets. Automated network layout groups related gene-sets into network clusters, enabling the user to quickly identify the major enriched functional themes and more easily interpret the enrichment results.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>Conclusions</title>
        <p>Enrichment Map is a significant advance in the interpretation of enrichment analysis. Any research project that generates a list of genes can take advantage of this visualization framework. Enrichment Map is implemented as a freely available and user friendly plug-in for the Cytoscape network visualization software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://baderlab.org/Software/EnrichmentMap/">http://baderlab.org/Software/EnrichmentMap/</ext-link>).</p>

    <title>Introduction</title>
    <p>High-throughput genomic experiments often lead to the identification of large gene lists <xref rid="pone.0013984-Allison1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0013984-Calarco1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0013984-Nesvizhskii1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Gene lists are typically defined using statistical methods appropriate to the experimental design. For instance, a frequently applied method is to score genes by their differential expression between two biological states (such as healthy vs. diseased). Especially in more mature fields, like gene expression microarrays, the statistical models used for gene scoring are well established <xref rid="pone.0013984-Allison1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0013984-Quackenbush1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. For instance, gene expression values are ranked to identify the top-most list of expressed genes, based on an arbitrary expression threshold, or a set of gene expression experiments are clustered, each cluster defining a potentially large gene list. However, these methods for finding interesting genes often do not help the interpretation of the resulting gene lists and the formulation of consistent biological hypotheses from these results still poses a major challenge for experimentalists. Searching for sets of predefined functionally related genes (e.g. pathways) that are enriched in a gene list is a popular method designed to solve this problem. However, as gene-set collections get larger and more complex, users may experience longer lists of results and increased redundancy between sets. We have developed a visualization method for gene set enrichment results, called Enrichment Map, which helps quickly find general functional themes in genomics data. In the next sections, we introduce enrichment analysis, the gene set redundancy problem and then explain how Enrichment Map works using typical analysis scenarios.</p>
    <sec id="s1a">
      <title>Enrichment analysis</title>
      <p>Early approaches to gene list interpretation relied on choosing a handful of high scoring genes, and then building rather subjective, anecdotal interpretations. Enrichment analysis is an automated and statistically rigorous technique to analyze and interpret large gene lists using <italic>a priori</italic>-knowledge <xref rid="pone.0013984-Nam1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Enrichment analysis assesses the over- (or under-) representation of a known set of genes (e.g. a biological pathway) within the input gene list <xref rid="pone.0013984-Khatri1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0013984-Robinson1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0013984-Draghici1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. If a statistically significant number of genes from the known set are present in the gene list, it may indicate that the biological pathway plays a role in the biological condition under study. This analysis is repeated for all available known gene-sets, which could number in the thousands.</p>
      <p>Over 60 enrichment analysis methods and tools have been developed in the last few years <xref rid="pone.0013984-Nam1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0013984-Huang1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0013984-Khatri2" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. They mainly differ in (a) their database of known gene-sets and (b) the statistical method used to assess enrichment. In the following paragraphs, we briefly review existing approaches for enrichment analysis considering these two facets.</p>
      <p>Most enrichment tools derive gene-sets from Gene Ontology (GO) annotations <xref rid="pone.0013984-Ashburner1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, because they are readily accessible for many organisms and cover many genes, yet many other sources of gene-sets exist and are used by some tools in addition to GO <xref rid="pone.0013984-Robinson1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0013984-Dennis1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0013984-Subramanian1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Gene-sets can be defined based on participation in a metabolic or signaling pathway (e.g. KEGG <xref rid="pone.0013984-Ogata1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, Reactome <xref rid="pone.0013984-JoshiTope1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>), targeting by gene expression regulators (e.g. microRNA, transcription factors), protein features such as domains, chromosomal location and association to specific diseases, stimuli, or genetic perturbations. Gene-sets from multiple sources are collected in resources such as MSigDB <xref rid="pone.0013984-Subramanian1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref> or WhichGenes <xref rid="pone.0013984-GlezPena1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Not all organisms are well covered by gene-sets and many tools only support specific organisms.</p>
      <p>Statistical methods to determine enrichment are usually either threshold-dependent or whole-distribution <xref rid="pone.0013984-Huang1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Threshold-dependent techniques require the user to input a discrete list of top-ranking genes, which may require setting a threshold on the gene scoring statistic. The one-tail <italic>Fisher's Exact Test</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0013984-Fisher1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, based on the <italic>hypergeometric distribution</italic>, was the first method proposed to address this problem <xref rid="pone.0013984-Tavazoie1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, and continues to be one of the most used testing methods of this type <xref rid="pone.0013984-Rivals1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. These methods are useful for naturally discrete lists, but have major drawbacks when utilized with continuous gene scores. Specifically, results may not be stable to choice of threshold <xref rid="pone.0013984-Pan1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, and there is loss of information caused by treating gene scores in a binary way (they either pass the threshold or not). On the other hand, whole-distribution methods are threshold-free, as they test gene-sets by comparing their score distribution versus the background distribution. For this reason they are often preferred over threshold-dependent methods for gene lists associated with a continuous score. GSEA (Gene-Set Enrichment Analysis) <xref rid="pone.0013984-Subramanian1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, which utilizes the gene rank derived from differential expression or other statistics, is one of the most popular techniques in this group, though other whole-distribution testing models have been proposed <xref rid="pone.0013984-Nam1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0013984-Huang1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="s1b">
      <title>The gene-set redundancy problem</title>
      <p>The growing number of available gene-sets, due to the increased availability of functional annotations, makes enrichment analysis a powerful tool to help researchers gain interesting insights from their high-throughput data. However, this comes at a cost: as gene-set collections get larger and more complex, there may be longer lists of results and increased redundancy between sets. Redundancy is particularly problematic with gene-sets derived from hierarchical functional annotation systems, like GO, as children terms are partially redundant with their parents by definition. Gene-set redundancy constitutes a major barrier for the interpretability of enrichment results, limiting the full exploitation of its analytic power.</p>
      <p>This problem can be addressed by modifying either the statistical test or the gene-sets to minimize the effect of redundancy and produce more concise enrichment results. Existing methods usually take advantage of the hierarchical structure of Gene Ontology to reduce redundancy, a solution that is only effective for GO or other hierarchically organized gene sets and not applicable to many others, such as pathways, experimental signatures and regulator targets. POSOC <xref rid="pone.0013984-Lewin1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref> exploits the GO hierarchy to merge single sets into clusters, which can then be tested for enrichment. Ontologizer <xref rid="pone.0013984-Grossmann1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref> defines a modified <italic>Fisher's Exact Test</italic> for hierarchical vocabularies, termed the <italic>parent-child approach</italic>. Enrichment of a given gene-set is calculated with respect to the parent gene-set, instead of the list of genes in the experiment (the experimental universe set), in order to downplay uninformative child enrichment (i.e. enrichment merely “inherited” from the parent set enrichment). GOstats <xref rid="pone.0013984-Falcon1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref> and elim <xref rid="pone.0013984-Alexa1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref> adopt a reverse strategy: child terms (i.e. leaves in the hierarchy) are tested first, then parent nodes are modified so as not to include the genes present in their enriched children. Ontologizer tends to penalize smaller gene-sets, whereas GOstats and elim tend to penalize larger gene-sets. This problem is overcome by the weight algorithm <xref rid="pone.0013984-Alexa1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, which reweights genes based on how many children gene sets they are part of, but this is however limited to hierarchical vocabularies and requires using <italic>Fisher's Exact Test</italic>.</p>
      <p>If test and gene-set modification methods are not completely satisfactory solutions to the gene-set redundancy problems, what else is available? A different strategy relies on visualizing the redundancy relations among gene-sets to help the user recognize redundancy while they explore enrichment results. Tools such as Onto-Express <xref rid="pone.0013984-Draghici2" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, the Cytoscape <xref rid="pone.0013984-Cline1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref> plugin BiNGO <xref rid="pone.0013984-Maere1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref> and WebGestalt <xref rid="pone.0013984-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref> display the hierarchical structure of enriched GO terms. This helps identify parent-child relationships between terms, but the applicability is again confined to hierarchical vocabularies. Other tools are more flexible. They neglect any a-priori gene-set structure and compute a similarity score among gene-sets, capturing inter gene-set redundancy. DAVID <xref rid="pone.0013984-Dennis1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0013984-Huangda1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0013984-Huangda2" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref> utilizes fuzzy gene clusters, pre-computed on the basis of annotation similarity among all genes, to sort enriched gene-sets into different yet partially overlapping groups; results are then displayed in a tabular format. Molecular Concept Maps (MCM) software <xref rid="pone.0013984-Rhodes1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref> and the ClueGO <xref rid="pone.0013984-Bindea1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref> Cytoscape plugin offer a richer visualization solution than DAVID, displaying enriched gene-sets as a network, where each gene-set is represented as a node and edges connect similar gene-sets. MCM utilizes the <italic>Fisher's Exact Test</italic> p-value as a similarity score between gene-sets. The MCM network includes the input gene list together with the enriched gene-sets. Colors are used to differentiate the gene-set sources. ClueGO determines gene-set similarity according to Cohen's kappa statistic. Gene-sets are then clustered using an iterative merging approach; nodes, representing enriched gene-sets, are colored according to cluster membership or alternatively according to the proportion of up- and down-regulated genes; node size represents enrichment significance. ClueGO and MCM are useful, as they offer an expressive and intuitive organization of gene-sets, applicable to any gene-set source. Unfortunately, all the tools mentioned so far incorporate only one enrichment test (the <italic>Fisher's Exact Test</italic>) and are not designed to work with enrichments computed using other methods, limiting their power and flexibility. Many tools only use GO annotation as a source of gene-sets, and do not take advantage of the many types of other useful gene-sets that exist. The landscape of available solutions to gene-set redundancy is summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0013984-t001">Table 1</xref>.</p>

            <p><italic>Gene-set redundancy correction methods</italic> typically utilize modified gene-sets (<italic>Modified gene-sets</italic>) or rely on a modified enrichment test (<italic>Modified test</italic>), but usually require hierarchically structured gene-sets; consequently, they usually do not support gene-sets from resources other than Gene Ontology.

      <p>To overcome the above limitations, we developed the Enrichment Map visualization method, which organizes gene-sets into a similarity network, where nodes represent gene-sets, links represent the overlap of member genes, and node color encodes the enrichment score. ClueGO and MCM create similar networks, however, Enrichment Map uses a visual style that we find more intuitive and offers improved functionality: two different enrichment experiments can be comparatively analyzed by displaying them in the same map; new query gene-sets (e.g. disease genes, targets of regulators) can be compared to existing gene-sets post-analysis; a heat-map can be used to explore the data underlying the enrichment results (e.g. gene-expression patterns) for any gene-set; finally, Enrichment Map is modular, enabling use with any type of enrichment test or gene-set source. Enrichment Map is implemented as a freely available and open-source plugin for the Cytoscape network visualization and analysis software <xref rid="pone.0013984-Cline1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>.</p>

    <title>Results</title>
    <p>To simplify the navigation and interpretation of enrichment results, we have developed Enrichment Map, a network-based gene-set enrichment result visualization method. Gene-sets are first analyzed for enrichment significance using a method of choice, e.g. GSEA <xref rid="pone.0013984-Subramanian1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, and then organized as a weighted similarity network, where nodes represent gene-sets and weighted links (i.e. edges) between the nodes represent an “overlap” score depending on the number of genes two gene-sets share. Nodes are automatically arranged so that highly similar gene-sets are placed close together; these clusters can be easily identified manually and related to biological functions. Gene-set enrichment results are graphically mapped to the Enrichment Map: node size represents the number of genes in the gene-set; edge thickness is proportional to the overlap between gene-sets, calculated using the Jaccard or overlap coefficients (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>). The enrichment score (specifically, the enrichment p-value) is mapped to the node color as a color gradient. In a typical enrichment test for a single set of genes (one-class), node color ranges from white (no enrichment) to red (high enrichment). In a two-class experiment design, node color ranges from red (high enrichment in one class e.g. case) to white (no enrichment) to blue (high enrichment in the second class e.g. control). In the specific case of a gene expression experiment where a condition of interest is compared to a baseline control, red is interpreted as up-regulation and blue as down-regulation. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013984-g001">Figure 1</xref> summarizes the information flow from gene scoring to Enrichment Map analysis for a typical, two-class experiment.</p>

        <title>From ranked gene lists to the enrichment map.</title>
        <p>High-throughput genomic experiments often output large gene lists, which are typically ranked according to a statistic measuring difference in one experimental condition versus another. Ranked lists are analyzed for enrichment in known sets of functionally related genes (e.g. pathways) from publicly accessible databases. An enrichment map is drawn, representing the enrichment results as a network of gene-sets (nodes) related by their similarity (edges), with enrichment significance encoded by the node color gradient, where color intensity represents significance and color hue (red / blue) represents the class (i.e. biological condition) of interest. Node size represents the gene-set size and edge thickness represents the degree of overlap between two gene-sets.</p>

    <p>In the next sections, we give examples of typical analysis scenarios where Enrichment Map is used to analyze gene-expression experiments. For simplicity, only Gene Ontology derived gene-sets are used, although any gene-sets can be used in practice. <italic>Use case 1</italic> presents the most basic application of Enrichment Map, the analysis of a two-class experiment. We analyze a gene expression data set of MCF7 breast cancer cells, in presence or absence of estrogen treatment at 24 hours of culture. In <italic>Use case 2</italic>, we compare the estrogen response at two time-points, 12 and 24 hours, to evaluate changes over time. In <italic>Use case 3</italic>, we analyze a gene expression study of colon cancer and use the query set feature of Enrichment Map to investigate the relationship between the gene expression signature and known genes associated with colon cancer.</p>
    <sec id="s2a">
      <title>Use case 1: One enrichment (estrogen treatment of breast cancer cells)</title>
      <p>Here, we analyzed the changes in gene expression associated with estrogen treatment of a breast cancer cell line (MCF7) at 24 hours of culture <xref rid="pone.0013984-Lin1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. Enrichment results were generated after scoring genes for differential expression using the <italic>t-test</italic> statistic, comparing the estrogen-treated versus the untreated samples. GSEA was then used to find enriched GO gene-sets in up- or down-regulated genes. Only gene-sets passing conservative significance thresholds (p-value&lt;0.001, False Discovery Rate (FDR)&lt;5%) were selected for display in the Enrichment Map, resulting in 156 total gene-sets (out of 2378) significantly enriched in treated (148 gene-sets) or untreated cells (8).</p>
      <p>The output of GSEA, like many other enrichment methods, consists of a table of gene-sets and their enrichment statistics. This organization is not helpful for enrichment interpretation if too many gene-sets pass the significance threshold, as is the case here. Although the table can be ranked according to enrichment significance (nominal p-value, FDR, or other scores, in the case of GSEA), it is difficult to identify gene-sets belonging to a common functional group, because they are typically scattered throughout the table. To demonstrate this problem, multiple microtubule cytoskeleton-related gene-sets are highlighted in the enrichment table for estrogen-treated cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0013984.s001">Table S1</xref>, first tab).</p>
      <p>A simple approach to this problem consists of visualizing enriched GO gene-sets according to the hierarchical relations defined in the ontology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013984-g002">Figure 2</xref>). The resulting network is composed of several, disconnected sub-networks (i.e. clusters). These are not interconnected because gene-sets failing the enrichment significance threshold were removed to limit the network size, which otherwise would be too large for visualization purposes. Clusters typically map to one or a few functional groups, as displayed by the manually added annotation labels in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013984-g002">Figure 2</xref>, hence they can be successfully used to summarize enrichment results. However, gene-sets relating to the same biological function (e.g. <italic>Microtubule cytoskeleton</italic>) but defined in different GO partitions (e.g. <italic>Cellular Component</italic> and <italic>Biological Process</italic>) are systematically split into different clusters. In a few cases, this occurs even for functionally related gene-sets from the same GO partition (e.g. <italic>tRNA Processing</italic> from <italic>Molecular Function</italic>).</p>

Nodes represent gene-sets and edges represent GO defined relations (<italic>Is-a</italic>, <italic>Part-of</italic>, <italic>Regulates</italic>). Gene-sets that did not pass the enrichment significance threshold are not shown. Nodes are colored according to enrichment results: red represents enrichment in estrogen-treated cells (i.e. up-regulation after estrogen treatment), whereas blue represents enrichment in untreated cells (i.e. down-regulation after estrogen treatment). Color intensity is proportional to enrichment significance. Since conservative thresholds were used to select gene-sets, most of the node colors are intense (corresponding to highly significant gene-sets). Subnetworks (i.e. clusters) are annotated according to the corresponding function. The acronym in brackets represents the specific GO ontology the gene-sets belong to: Molecular Function (MF), Cellular Component (CC), Biological Process (BP). Microtubule cytoskeleton (purple labels) and tRNA processing (green labels) were highlighted to show absence of connections between related gene-sets.</p>

      <p>The Enrichment Map for the same data displayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013984-g003">Figure 3</xref> overcomes these problems. Gene-sets are organized according to their mutual overlap. Minimal editing, such as minor repositioning of nodes and removal of few exceedingly generic gene-sets (e.g. <italic>Protein Complex Assembly</italic>, <italic>Biopolymer Catabolism</italic>), was done to optimize the map layout. Clusters were manually circled and labeled to highlight the prevalent biological functions among a set of related gene-sets. Functionally related gene-sets are highly connected, to a larger extent than in the purely hierarchical visualization, as exemplified in the case of <italic>Microtubule cytoskeleton</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013984-g004">Figure 4</xref>). Most importantly, the overall functional “landscape” fits with the known role of estrogen hormones as activators of cell proliferation <xref rid="pone.0013984-DoisneauSixou1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. In fact, gene-sets enriched in estrogen-treated cells (in red) relate to increased protein synthesis and RNA processing (left side of the map) and to the execution and regulation of mitotic cell cycle (right side of the map). Gene-sets found enriched in untreated cells (blue) constitute a minor portion of the map and relate to membrane and cell adhesion (namely, MHC-II receptors, tight junctions and lipid transport). The down-regulation of these functions may have a role in supporting proliferation or it may be associated with relatively undifferentiated cellular states.</p>

      <p>The approach described in this use-case can be applied to any genomic experiment generating a ranked list of genes. For example, genes can be ranked by their likelihood of being regulated by a given transcription factor, according to ChIP-chip or ChIP-seq experiments (<italic>Chromatin Immunoprecipitation</italic> of genomic DNA followed by chip hybridization or sequencing) and then GSEA, or any whole-distribution method, can be used to test gene-set enrichment in top-ranking genes.</p>

      <title>Use case 2: Two enrichments (estrogen treatment of breast cancer cells)</title>
      <p>Enrichment Map can be used to analyze experiments with more complex designs than the basic two-class described above. In the previous use case, gene expression was analyzed looking for changes associated with estrogen treatment at 24 hours of culture. Here we evaluate differences in the estrogen response kinetics by additionally considering gene expression enrichment at 12 hours of culture. Genes were scored for differential gene expression (<italic>t-test</italic>) by comparing treated and untreated cells at matching culture time-points (12 and 24 hours, respectively). GSEA was used to find enriched GO gene-sets in up- or down-regulated genes, as in the previous use case. Applying the same conservative significance thresholds (p-value&lt;0.001, FDR&lt;5%), 188 total gene-sets (out of 2378) were found significantly enriched in treated (179) or untreated cells (9). The enrichment map was generated by mapping the 12 hour enrichment to the node center and the 24 hour enrichment to the node border (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013984-g005">Figure 5</xref>). This two-enrichment visualization is useful, as we can see gene-set groups that have the same (all red or all blue) or different enrichment across the two data sets. It is immediately apparent that the agreement between the 12 and 24 hours estrogen response is very high - most nodes are all one color and no nodes are both blue and red, which would indicate a gene-set with opposite enrichment in the two time points. In certain cases there are nodes that are significantly enriched at one time-point, but not at the other.</p>

As in the previous figures, red represents enrichment in estrogen-treated cells (i.e. up-regulation after estrogen treatment), whereas blue represents enrichment in untreated cells (i.e. down-regulation after estrogen treatment); color intensity is proportional to enrichment significance.

      <p>Gene-sets with stronger enrichment at 24 compared to 12 hours are present in most of the functional groups. These results suggest that the transcriptional response to estrogen treatment is globally stronger at 24 hours and that the functional groups induced or repressed are essentially the same. Further, the four clusters relating to DNA metabolism, Cell cycle, Microtubule cytoskeleton and Ubiquitin-dependent protein degradation present an interesting pattern: gene-sets relating to DNA synthesis (such as <italic>Replication fork</italic>, <italic>DNA polymerase activity</italic>) are characterized by stronger enrichment at 12 hours, whereas gene-sets relating to G2/M phase components and processes (such as <italic>Chromosome condensation</italic>, <italic>Spindle</italic> and <italic>Anaphase Promoting Complex (APC)-dependent protein degradation</italic>) prevail at 24 hours. First, we investigated if differences in enrichment significance at 12 and 24 hours are consistent with differential gene expression patterns, utilizing heat-maps generated by the Enrichment Map software. The <italic>APC-dependent protein degradation</italic> (GO:0031145, full name: Anaphase-promoting complex-dependent proteasomal ubiquitin-dependent protein catabolic process) gene-set is characterized by a markedly stronger induction after estrogen treatment at 24 compared to 12 hours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013984-g006">Figure 6</xref>, left pane), which is consistent with enrichment results. We next investigated a gene-set exhibiting the opposite enrichment pattern, <italic>Replication Fork</italic> (GO:0005657) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013984-g006">Figure 6</xref>, right pane). Gene expression in estrogen-treated cells is moderately higher at 24 than 12 hours, but there is a comparable increase in the untreated cell expression levels. Since enrichments were computed by comparing estrogen treated and untreated cells at the same time-point, the different enrichment observed for DNA metabolism gene-sets is likely due to the estrogen-independent increase of gene expression levels in untreated cells. This suggests that G2/M phase execution could be more dependent on estrogen signaling than G1 phase, at least for MCF7 breast cancer cells.</p>

For <italic>APC-dependent protein degradation</italic> (left), there is a marked increase of gene expression in estrogen treated cells at 24 hours compared to 12 hours, whereas the gene levels for untreated cells are substantially the same at the two time points; the pattern observed is consistent with the presence of significant enrichment only at 24 hours. On the other hand, for <italic>Replication fork</italic> (right), gene expression in estrogen treated cells at 12 and 24 hours is globally at similar levels, whereas there is an increase of gene levels in untreated cells. This suggests an explanation of why <italic>Replication fork</italic> is enriched only at 12 hours.</p>

Known colon cancer genes were obtained from the DiseaseHub database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://zldev.ccbr.utoronto.ca/~ddong/diseaseHub/">http://zldev.ccbr.utoronto.ca/~ddong/diseaseHub/</ext-link>), which integrates data from OMIM (Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man), GAD (Genetic Association Database), HGMD (Human Gene Mutation Database), PharmGKB (Pharmacogenomics Knowledge Base), CGP (Cancer Genome Project) and GWAS (Genome Wide Association Studies). Most of the disease genes in this database harbor rare mutations or polymorphisms linked to colon cancer either by causation or by statistical association. Overlap was scored using <italic>Fisher's Exact Test</italic> p-value. Nominal p-values (i.e. not adjusted) smaller than 10<sup>−4</sup> were deemed significant, and visualized as pink edges with thickness indicating significance level (proportional to −log (p-value)) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013984-g007">Figure 7</xref>).</p>

      <p>Overall, the enrichment map has a smaller number of up-regulated than down-regulated gene-sets (125 and 234, respectively). Many down-regulated gene-sets map to metabolic processes, with clusters relating to functions such as phospholipid and steroid biosynthesis, metabolic cofactors, amino acid metabolism and oxidative metabolism (specifically, citric acid cycle, mitochondrion, electron transport chain). This is not surprising, as it is well known that cancer cells undergo major metabolic shifts, such as the <italic>Warburg Effect</italic>, consisting of dramatically reduced oxidative metabolism and mitochondrial activity <xref rid="pone.0013984-Kim1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. Compared to up-regulated gene-sets, however, only a few down-regulated sets significantly overlap with known disease genes. This is reasonable since the metabolic switch observed in cancer is likely a downstream consequence of neoplastic transformation, neither specific for colon cancer nor having a causal role in its development. We decided to evaluate the gene expression patterns of the three metabolic gene-sets with the most significant connections to known disease genes: <italic>Iron ion binding</italic> (GO:0005506), p-value 5.3×10<sup>−13</sup>, in the <italic>Metal ion cluster binding cluster</italic>, <italic>Alkyl/aryl transferase activity</italic> (GO:0016765, full name: Transferase activity, transferring alkyl or aryl (other than methyl) groups) p-value 8.2×10<sup>−11</sup>, in the <italic>Alkylation</italic> cluster, and <italic>Electron carrier activity</italic> (GO:0009055), p-value 1.3×10<sup>−10</sup>, in the <italic>Metabolic cofactor</italic> cluster. Disease genes from <italic>Iron ion binding</italic> and <italic>Electron carrier activity</italic> are highly overlapping (union size: 31, intersection size: 20), hence they were considered together. Most of these genes belong to the cytochrome P450 family (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0013984.s002">Table S2</xref>), which is important for xenobiotic metabolism. Mutations in this gene family have been associated with cancer either because of the impaired capability to neutralize toxic chemicals, or because of the acquired capability to activate the toxicity of otherwise inert compounds <xref rid="pone.0013984-Gonzalez1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. However, none of the cytochrome P450 genes is characterized by marked up-regulation or down-regulation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0013984.s002">Table S2</xref>). On the other hand, <italic>NQO1</italic> (<italic>NAD(P)H dehydrogenase</italic>, <italic>quinone 1</italic>; EntrezGene ID: 1728), whose inactivating mutation has been associated with colon cancer in animal models and in human population studies <xref rid="pone.0013984-Begleiter1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, is markedly down-regulated in cancer samples (<italic>t-test</italic> nominal p-value  =  2.4×10<sup>−6</sup>, 66.5% average reduction compared to control). Although this gene is likely important for cancer progression and severity, it was not identified in the original published gene expression analysis. Inspection of <italic>Alkyl/aryl transferase activity</italic> revealed that more than 90% of the disease genes in this set are glutathione S-transferases, involved in detoxification. Specifically, <italic>MGST1</italic> (<italic>Microsomal glutathione S-transferase 1</italic>; EntrezGene ID: 4257) is markedly down-regulated (<italic>t-test</italic> nominal p-value  =  6.9×10<sup>−5</sup>, 65.0% average reduction compared to control) and certain <italic>MGST1</italic> polymorphisms have been associated with increased colon cancer risk <xref rid="pone.0013984-Zhang2" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. Like <italic>NQO1</italic>, this gene was not identified in the original gene expression analysis. Similar results were also found for another metabolic gene-set, <italic>Aromatic compound metabolic process</italic> (GO:0006725), where the most down-regulated disease genes are <italic>glucuronosyltransferases</italic>. All in all, this type of analysis was useful to dissect the down-regulation of specific detoxification enzymes from the broader signal of down-regulation of oxidative metabolism (<italic>Warburg Effect</italic>). The biological relevance of the genes identified was supported by two independent sources, namely differential expression in the microarray experiment analyzed and known disease associations based on genetic screening or mechanistic studies. Therefore these genes likely play an important role in colon cancer, and should be considered for further study.</p>
      <p>The up-regulated gene-sets with the highest overlap with known disease genes are related to adhesion, angiogenesis, cell motility and immune response. Among these, we focused on the gene-sets <italic>Cell Motility</italic> and <italic>Chemotaxis</italic>. Dysregulation of these processes is likely to be responsible for the tumor invasive growth, its infiltration into the lymph nodes in more advanced stages and eventually metastasis <xref rid="pone.0013984-Horton1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0013984-Raman1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. We first looked at the <italic>Cell Motility</italic> gene-set (GO:0051270), which is characterized by a very significant overlap with the disease gene-set (nominal p-value: 3.3×10<sup>−8</sup>). However, the disease genes in this set are only weakly or inconsistently up-regulated (most significant nominal p-value: 1.8×10<sup>−3</sup>). On the other hand, the <italic>Chemotaxis</italic> gene-set (GO:0006935) has several known disease genes that are also significantly up-regulated, even if its overall overlap significance (2.5×10<sup>−5</sup>) is weaker than for <italic>Cell Motility</italic>. Most of these genes are chemokine ligands (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0013984.s002">Table S2</xref>), among which the most up-regulated is <italic>CXCL12</italic> (<italic>Chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 12 (stromal cell-derived factor 1</italic>), EntrezGene ID: 6387). <italic>CLXC12</italic> is secreted by carcinoma-associated fibroblasts, and is considered responsible for tumor invasion <xref rid="pone.0013984-Raman1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. Since this gene-set is likely important for colon cancer, we also looked for differentially expressed genes that were <italic>not</italic> in our disease gene-set. Interestingly, the top-ranking gene in this group is <italic>CYR61</italic> (<italic>Cysteine-rich</italic>, <italic>angiogenic inducer</italic>, <italic>61</italic>; EntrezGene ID: 3491), which was identified in the original study as one of the seven genes with the most consistent differential expression between colon cancer and control samples <xref rid="pone.0013984-Hong1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. <italic>CYR61</italic> could be a good new candidate for disease association, as only two publications relating <italic>CYR61</italic> to colon cancer were found in PubMed <xref rid="pone.0013984-Hong1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0013984-deAngelis1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>, one being the original publication of the microarray data set used in this analysis. This shows how the <italic>query set post-analysis</italic> feature of the Enrichment Map software can be used to identify gene-sets associated with a biological condition according to independent data sources (in this case, differential gene expression and known disease genes), and then to mine these sets for previously uncharacterized genes exhibiting interesting patterns. The applicability of this feature is not restricted to disease genes: it can also be used to identify the relations between the targets of a known regulator (e.g. transcription factor, microRNA) and the functional groups enriched in the condition(s) of interest.</p>

      <title>Enrichment Map can be applied to any enrichment test or gene set database</title>
      <p>The previous use cases demonstrate the utility of Enrichment Map to visualize GSEA enrichment results, using Gene Ontology as gene-set source. However, Enrichment Map is compatible with any type of enrichment test or gene-set source. In <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0013984.s004">Text S2</xref> we show how it can be applied to a disease gene list, using <italic>Fisher's Exact Test</italic> to test a larger collection of gene-sets derived from Gene Ontology as well as pathway databases. We also compare Enrichment Map visualization with other available tools that are strictly dependent on <italic>Fisher's Exact Test</italic>.</p>

      <title>Limitations of Enrichment Map</title>
      <p>Enrichment map works well when enrichment results contain many related gene sets. If only a few gene-sets result from enrichment analysis, Enrichment Map does not provide much benefit for result interpretation, as it is relatively easy to scan a list of a few gene-sets. Further, if the resulting gene-sets are not highly related, as they may be when not using Gene Ontology derived or similarly hierarchically organized gene-sets, Enrichment Map will not show clusters and thus will provide little benefit over a table of gene-sets presentation format. In <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0013984.s005">Text S3</xref> we evaluate the performance of Enrichment Map for several gene-set sources, including experimentally- or computationally-derived gene-sets, showing that Enrichment Map can be productively used in many cases, even when Gene Ontology is not the major gene-set source. However, specific gene-set sources, such as curated signatures from gene expression experiments in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0013984.s005">Text S3</xref>, may have sparser overlaps resulting in poorly connected networks.</p>

    <title>Discussion</title>
    <p>We have described Enrichment Map, a method for gene-set enrichment visualization. Enrichment Map organizes enriched gene-sets in a network in a way that helps manage the large overlap between gene-sets that often complicates interpretation of gene-set enrichment results. Highly redundant or biologically related gene-sets are placed close together, making enrichment results easier to interpret. Gene-sets can be linked by various criteria, such as the amount of co-expression of member genes, however the gene-set overlap measure that we use has the advantage of being intuitive, as biologically similar sets are clustered together, and general, as it does not depend on the type of data being analyzed (e.g. gene expression or genetic associations). We have demonstrated the utility of the enrichment map visualization in analyzing two published microarray gene expression experiments, profiling the estrogen response in breast cancer cells and early onset colon cancer. We showed that Enrichment Map provides a concise and biologically meaningful view of the cellular processes and components characterized by differential expression.</p>
    <p>Gene-set enrichment is often used to analyze single experiments, or single comparisons between two conditions within multi-condition experiments, and meta-analysis of gene expression data are often performed using Venn diagrams or heat-maps (for instance, <xref rid="pone.0013984-Lin1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0013984-Kaiser1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0013984-BenPorath1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>), without exploiting the full potential of functional annotations. Enrichment Map can be used for more informative comparisons, identifying which functional groups differ between experiments. A visualization framework is essential for this, as traditional displays of enrichment require tedious and error prone navigation of flat tables, often resulting in investigators choosing only a handful of gene-sets for follow-up out of the thousands available to them in a genomics experiment. The heat map view in Enrichment Map enables the user to zoom in and explore an enriched gene-set in more detail and the query set analysis facilitates exploration of relations to known disease genes or regulatory modules.</p>
    <p>Gene-set enrichment has been successfully applied to link functional gene-sets to disease and other biological conditions in hundreds of publications (according to <italic>ISI Web of Knowledge</italic>, October 2010, DAVID and GSEA were quoted by 159 and 1421 papers, respectively). We have successfully applied Enrichment Map to several research projects such as cardiac failure <xref rid="pone.0013984-Isserlin1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>, thyroid cancer signaling (Borrello MG, Degl'Innocenti D, Gariboldi M, Merico D, Antoniotti M, Pierotti M, Unpublished work) and autism <xref rid="pone.0013984-Pinto1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>. Virtually any research project in genomics can take advantage of this visualization framework; in particular, the modular design of the Enrichment Map Cytoscape plugin software makes it easy to integrate within existing analysis workflows.</p>
    <p>Future work will include incorporating molecular interaction network and pathway information <xref rid="pone.0013984-Cary1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0013984-Demir1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref> into gene-set analysis methods, as has successfully been done for gene expression analysis <xref rid="pone.0013984-Ideker1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0013984-Pradines1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0013984-Efroni1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0013984-Tarca1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0013984-Draghici3" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>. We will also improve the visualization. For instance, we are working on methods to automatically summarize gene-set clusters using tag clouds (Oesper L, Merico D, Isserlin R, Bader GD, Submitted work) and on better visualization methods for multi-condition experiments (more than two enrichment results). It will also be useful to develop gene set similarity measures weighted to consider the most informative genes in the gene set (such as the most differentially expressed).</p>

These thresholds are routinely used in enrichment analysis as large gene-sets rarely convey much useful biological meaning (e.g. <italic>regulation of physiological process</italic>), whereas very small gene-sets are more susceptible to being falsely enriched due to random fluctuations. Also, the reduced number of gene-sets decreases the multiple testing correction burden, potentially increasing the power of the analysis.</p>
