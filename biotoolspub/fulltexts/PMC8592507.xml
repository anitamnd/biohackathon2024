      <title>Abstract</title>
      <p>The evaluation of pharmacological data using machine learning requires high data quality. Therefore, data preprocessing, that is, cleaning analytical laboratory errors, replacing missing values or outliers, and transforming data adequately before actual data analysis, is crucial. Because current tools available for this purpose often require programming skills, preprocessing tools with graphical user interfaces that can be used interactively are needed. In collaboration between data scientists and experts in bioanalytical diagnostics, a graphical software package for data preprocessing called <italic toggle="yes">pguIMP</italic> is proposed, which contains a fixed sequence of preprocessing steps to enable reproducible interactive data preprocessing. As an R‐based package, it also allows direct integration into this data science environment without requiring any programming knowledge. The implementation of contemporary data processing methods, including machine‐learning‐based imputation techniques, ensures the generation of corrected and cleaned bioanalytical data sets that preserve data structures such as clusters better than is possible with classical methods. This was evaluated on bioanalytical data sets from lipidomics and drug research using k‐nearest‐neighbors‐based imputation followed by k‐means clustering and density‐based spatial clustering of applications with noise. The R package provides a Shiny‐based web interface designed to be easy to use for non–data analysis experts. It is demonstrated that the spectrum of methods provided is suitable as a standard pipeline for preprocessing bioanalytical data in biomedical research domains. The R package <italic toggle="yes">pguIMP</italic> is freely available at the comprehensive R archive network (<ext-link xlink:href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/pguIMP/index.html" ext-link-type="uri">https://cran.r‐project.org/web/packages/pguIMP/index.html</ext-link>).</p>

      <p>This study introduces a software package for data preprocessing that enables field experts without programming knowledge to prepare bioanalytical data for use in machine‐learning‐based drug discovery. Together with the software, a sequence of preprocessing steps is proposed that prevents common pitfalls in data preprocessing.

    <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
    <p>The establishment of high‐throughput experiments in clinical research provide a wealth of data of diverse structure. The goal of systems pharmacology is to integrate these high‐dimensional data into complex models that aid in decision making in the process of drug discovery or drug safety assessment. However, the often nonlinear and stochastic natures of these data pose a challenge for data processing, which is why data science methods have recently made their way into systems pharmacology.<xref rid="psp412704-bib-0001" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> Although differential equation systems–based pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic models describing the temporal evolution of a system, such as plasma concentrations or drug effects, are well established in the preprocessing of data sets from drug research and development,<xref rid="psp412704-bib-0002" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref>, <xref rid="psp412704-bib-0003" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref>, <xref rid="psp412704-bib-0004" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref>, <xref rid="psp412704-bib-0005" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref>, <xref rid="psp412704-bib-0006" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> these additional data pose new challenges to the preprocessing of drug discovery and development data sets. This is where the strength of data science comes into play, being able to extract knowledge from high‐dimensional data, often by using machine‐learning methods (for an overview, see Badillo et al.<xref rid="psp412704-bib-0007" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref>).</p>
    <p>The analysis of biomedical data by machine learning requires data that have been cleaned of analytical laboratory errors<xref rid="psp412704-bib-0008" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref>, <xref rid="psp412704-bib-0009" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> and are adequately transformed and preferably free of missing values, anomalies,<xref rid="psp412704-bib-0010" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> or values below the limit of quantification (LOQ).<xref rid="psp412704-bib-0002" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref>, <xref rid="psp412704-bib-0005" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref> Although likelihood‐based models have been shown to be particularly suitable for handling values below LOQ in pharmacokinetics mixed‐effects models,<xref rid="psp412704-bib-0002" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref>, <xref rid="psp412704-bib-0003" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref>, <xref rid="psp412704-bib-0004" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref>, <xref rid="psp412704-bib-0005" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref>, <xref rid="psp412704-bib-0006" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> many proposed solutions to this problem in the area of pharmacological data science are data set specific<xref rid="psp412704-bib-0010" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref>, <xref rid="psp412704-bib-0011" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> and must be tailored to analyses that use machine‐learning algorithms. For example, for the treatment of missing values in gas chromatography–mass spectrometry metabolomics, predictive k‐nearest neighbors (kNN), and random forest have proven to be particularly suitable.<xref rid="psp412704-bib-0012" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> Indeed, for data cleaning of high‐dimensional bioanalytical data sets used in pharmacological research for biomarker identification by machine learning,<xref rid="psp412704-bib-0013" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref> data science offers a wealth of imputation methods. However, not every method is suitable for every data set, and when choosing the imputation method, it is important to consider that the replacement of missing values has direct implications for further downstream analyses, for example, biomarker identification.<xref rid="psp412704-bib-0014" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref>
</p>
    <p>The addition of these data science methods to pharmacological research requires user friendly, generalizable solutions that allow measurable and documented quality control of routine preprocessing of the data, especially because the aforementioned methods are often new to the research field. Unfortunately, available solutions are often limited to simple statistics‐based imputations, such as substitution by the variable mean or median,<xref rid="psp412704-bib-0015" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref> or require programming skills in common data science languages (Table <xref rid="psp412704-sup-0004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref>), which is why a wider range of interactive preprocessing tools for bioanalytical data in drug research environments is a recurring desire. To address this need, an interactive data engineering package called <italic toggle="yes">pguIMP</italic>
<xref rid="psp412704-note-1001" ref-type="fn">†</xref> is presented that covers the preprocessing steps of bioanalytical data identified in a multidisciplinary approach by data scientists and field experts. Its components provide visually guided, interactive tools for each major preprocessing step of bioanalytical laboratory data, including visualization, transformation, normalization, outlier removal, and imputation of missing values. The design allows free choice of the provided algorithms and separate treatment of outliers and values outside the LOQs. The package preprocesses data based on established methods, including statistical hypothesis testing of the distribution of the original or transformed data, and it provides statistics‐based, machine‐learning‐derived methods for imputing missing values and removing outliers. It was previously shown that these methods do not cover all possible sources of error that may occur and that appropriate data visualizations, as implemented in the package, can assist the field expert in identifying these otherwise undetected errors in data sets. Because <italic toggle="yes">pguIMP</italic> is based on the R programming language, it fits seamlessly into this data science environment and offers the possibility of integration into more complex workflows and the application of additional methods from the large selection offered by the R environment.</p>

In contrast to classical pharmacometric models, which are based on pharmacological principles and can therefore be interpreted physiologically, in machine‐learning models the relationships are learned by a computer on the basis of a data set.<xref rid="psp412704-bib-0007" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref> Such a data set consists of a list of data points, so‐called instances, which in turn represent the entities to be studied, such as patients or individual cells. The data points in turn represent the totality of measured variables. These variables can be any measurable parameter: categorical variables such as gender or the division into smokers and nonsmokers are just as possible as numerical variables such as age, height, weight, or a biomarker concentration. All of these variables collected for an entity can be combined arbitrarily to a data point. The number of variables in a data point is also referred to as dimensionality. Pharmacological data sets used to train machine‐learning models usually have a high dimensionality because they often contain different omics data or gene expression profiles of the entities. In general, machine‐learning models are designed to handle high‐dimensional data sets. However, their performance depends largely on the form in which the data are presented to them. It is not uncommon to train the models on derived data sets with transformed and normalized variable values. In addition, most machine‐learning models do not tolerate missing values, which is why missing values are usually imputed before training. Because of the high variability of data sets, a high degree of domain knowledge is necessary for data preprocessing.<xref rid="psp412704-bib-0007" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref>
</p>
    <p>The <italic toggle="yes">pguIMP</italic> package for tracible and reproducible preprocessing of pharmacological data sets offers a variety of algorithms for data transformation, normalization, and imputation, which can be variably combined to form a data set specific, individual solution. This is done with the use of interactive dashboards on which the results of the individual analyses are presented graphically. This type of graphical result presentation provides a platform that can either be used by domain experts and data scientists to discuss the results of data preprocessing from different perspectives. In this way, a suitable solution for a data set can be approached individually.</p>
    <p>During the development of the package, great emphasis was placed on the traceability and reproducibility of the data preprocessing, as these are basic concepts of good laboratory practices.<xref rid="psp412704-bib-0048" ref-type="bibr"><sup>48</sup></xref> The traceability is guaranteed by the documentation of the package as well as the public availability of the source code.<xref rid="psp412704-bib-0049" ref-type="bibr"><sup>49</sup></xref>, <xref rid="psp412704-bib-0050" ref-type="bibr"><sup>50</sup></xref> The reproducibility of individual data preprocessing routines is guaranteed by detailed reports that archive results and all decisions and settings made by the user. At this point, it should be mentioned that some of the machine‐learning models used for outlier detection and missing value imputation rely to some degree on randomness. The required random numbers are generated on the software side by so‐called random number generators using deterministic mathematical functions. These generators deliver the same sequence of random numbers for the same starting point, the so‐called seed value. Here, the reproducibility of the results of these randomness‐based algorithms is guaranteed by the fact that the seed values are also archived.</p>
    <p>One of the most challenging tasks in data preprocessing is dealing with missing values. The reasons for their occurrence in bioanalytical data sets are diverse. On the one hand, stochastically occurring errors in data acquisition can lead to a situation where the information content of individual measurements cannot be trusted. On the other hand, regular measurements of values below the LLOQ may have been removed from the data set on purpose and reported as "&lt;LLOQ" instead. However, it has been shown that models trained on data containing values below LLOQ can be less erroneous than models trained on data where instances with variable values below the LLOQ were discarded or where the critical values were replaced by the variable LLOQ/2 during preprocessing<xref rid="psp412704-bib-0035" ref-type="bibr"><sup>35</sup></xref> (<xref rid="psp412704-sup-0004" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Material: Supplementary experiment 1</xref>). It is therefore essential for a preprocessing routine to separately process measurements that are missing because of stochastically occurring errors and measurements that are highly error prone because of a low value. From experience, however, one will be confronted with different data sets during data preprocessing. In few cases, it is a data set where missing values are because of stochastically occurring measurement errors and the measurements of variables whose value is below the LLOQ are given. Often, values below the LLOQ are masked or removed before the data is passed on. As a result, no information about the origin of the missing values is available. In this case, <italic toggle="yes">pguIMP</italic> offers two imputation approaches. In the first approach, the missing values are simply replaced by a variable characteristic such as the variable mean or median. In the second approach, the missing values are machine learned from the remaining values of all variables using predictive models. Recent benchmarks of different imputation methods show that machine‐learning‐based imputation methods such as kNN and random forests mostly outperform simple mean imputation when applied to data sets comprising missing values introduced to complete data sets either as CAR or NAR.<xref rid="psp412704-bib-0014" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref>
</p>
    <p>The results of the benchmark study are consistent with the results presented here. For this reason, machine‐learning‐based imputation methods are usually preferable to simple replacement with the variable mean or median. However, there are conceivable situations in which a model generalizes poorly and cannot make meaningful predictions about missing values. Most machine‐learning‐based models predict the value of a missing variable based on the remaining variables’ values. In case the machine‐learning‐based imputation methods do not provide satisfactory results, the <italic toggle="yes">pguIMP</italic> package will report an error message to the user and offers the possibility to substitute missing values by the variable mean or median. However, the choice of a suitable substitution method should always be preceded by an analysis of the origin of the missing values to avoid systematic errors, such as those caused by substituting the variable mean or median for NAR missing values.</p>
    <p>The performance of classification models or cluster models, as used in pharmacological research to identify biomarkers from high‐dimensional data sets,<xref rid="psp412704-bib-0013" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref> is directly influenced by the upstream data preprocessing. The results of recent benchmark studies show that classifier models show higher performance when erroneous training data have been previously cleaned using machine‐learning‐based models, such as kNN or random forests.<xref rid="psp412704-bib-0014" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref> These results could be reproduced within this study using downstream analyses such as clustering or dimension reduction (Supplementary Material S2) subsequently to data cleansing using the <italic toggle="yes">pguIMP</italic> package. With its strategy of taking into account the reason for the occurrence of missing data during imputation, <italic toggle="yes">pguIMP</italic> stands out from previous graphical solutions whose range of possible imputation methods in data preprocessing filters is limited to fix values or statistical solutions<xref rid="psp412704-bib-0015" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref> (<xref rid="psp412704-sup-0004" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Material: Supplementary experiment 3</xref>).</p>
