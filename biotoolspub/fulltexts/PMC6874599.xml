      <p id="Par1">Head injury models are important tools to study concussion biomechanics but are impractical for real-world use because they are too slow. Here, we develop a convolutional neural network (CNN) to estimate regional brain strains instantly and accurately by conceptualizing head rotational velocity profiles as two-dimensional images for input. We use two impact datasets with augmentation to investigate the CNN prediction performances with a variety of training-testing configurations. Three strain measures are considered, including maximum principal strain (MPS) of the whole brain, MPS of the corpus callosum, and fiber strain of the corpus callosum. The CNN is further tested using an independent impact dataset (N = 314) measured in American football. Based on 2592 training samples, it achieves a testing <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> of 0.916 and root mean squared error (RMSE) of 0.014 for MPS of the whole brain. Combining all impact-strain response data available (N = 3069), the CNN achieves an <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> of 0.966 and RMSE of 0.013 in a 10-fold cross-validation. This technique may enable a clinical diagnostic capability to a sophisticated head injury model, such as facilitating head impact sensors in concussion detection <italic>via</italic> a mobile device. In addition, it may transform current acceleration-based injury studies into focusing on regional brain strains.

    <title>Introduction</title>
    <p id="Par2">Traumatic brain injury (TBI) remains a major public health problem in the world<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. According to the ﻿World Health Organization, more than 40 million people worldwide suffer from a mild TBI (mTBI) each year<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. In the United States alone, the number of concussion incidents could reach 1.6–3.8 million annually, and is particularly common in athletes playing contact sports<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Although mild in nature, about 300,000 of the incidents involve loss of consciousness, with the majority occurring in American football<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>.</p>
    <p id="Par3">To mitigate the risk of concussion, head impact sensors such as Head Impact Telemetry (HIT) System<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup> and mouthguards<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup> are deployed in many contact sports. They record impact kinematics upon head collision and have been extensively used to measure head impact exposure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. However, only peak linear and/or rotational accelerations such as “g-forces” are often used that do not inform impact-induced brain strains thought responsible for brain injury<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Consequently, there is question about their effectiveness in concussion detection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>.</p>
    <p id="Par4">Using measured kinematics as input, a sophisticated computational head injury model can estimate detailed brain strains. They are generally believed to be more effective than impact kinematics in detecting brain injury, including concussion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. However, a significant challenge preventing injury models from real-world use such as facilitating head impact sensors for concussion detection on the sports field is that they are too slow—typically requiring hours to simulate even a single head impact on a high-end workstation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. As a result, the use of head injury models has been largely restricted to retrospective research efforts to date with no obvious clinical diagnostic value, and head impact sensors are also significantly underutilized.</p>
    <p id="Par5">There exist two competing strategies to mitigate the computational cost in model simulation. They share similarities in conceptualizing a head injury model as a nonlinear, high-dimensional, but smooth and continuous mapping function between impact kinematics and brain responses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. One strategy is to simplify the model and response output. For example, several reduced-order models have been proposed, including a one-degree-of-freedom (DOF) dynamic model based on modal analysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup> or equation of motion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>, and a second-order model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. By fitting parameters of a reduced-order model against directly simulated responses obtained from a finite element (FE) model of the human head, hybrid brain injury metrics were developed to correlate with peak maximum principal strain (MPS) of the whole brain. These metrics have shown promise over other conventional injury metrics derived solely from rotational kinematics when correlating against MPS of the whole brain over a large spectrum of impact severities and in diverse injury scenarios on a group-wise basis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>.</p>
    <p id="Par6">However, MPS estimation accuracy from reduced models degrade for large strain impacts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>, presumably as a result of failing to capture the significant nonlinearities when the impact severity is high. Unfortunately, large strains from more severe impacts (vs. low severity blows) likely would be the most important to consider when assessing the risk of brain injury on an individual basis. Further, reduced models relying on MPS of the whole brain lose critical information on brain strain distribution, because the strain variable is overly simplified to a single scalar value for the entire brain and is not region-specific. It is also unclear how reduced models could estimate directionally informed “axonal”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup> or “fiber”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup> strains that characterize stretches along white matter fiber tracts, or strain rate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup> thought important to brain injury as well. These observations indicate some inherent limitations with reduced-order models in practical applications, despite their potential for gaining physical insight into the induced brain strains.</p>
    <p id="Par7">To preserve the nonlinearity and spatial distribution of brain strains, a pre-computed brain response atlas was also introduced<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Instead of simplifying the model and output, this approach idealizes impact kinematic profiles serving as model input. Brain strains are pre-computed for a large library of impacts by discretizing peak rotational acceleration/velocity, and azimuth and elevation angles of head rotation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. Element-wise MPS values (vs. peak magnitude of the whole brain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>) for an arbitrary impact are then interpolated/extrapolated instantly. The pre-computed response atlas was shown to be effective using dummy head impacts simulating American football<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. However, the idealized rotational kinematic profiles are limited to triangular shapes of acceleration impulses that do not include deceleration. For more complex kinematic profiles involving deceleration and velocity reversal, the atlas may need to be expanded to include additional characteristic impacts. Unfortunately, this requires an explicit analysis of rotational velocity profile shapes, which is not trivial<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>.</p>
    <p id="Par8">Instead of simplifying the impact kinematic input<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>, head injury model, or response output<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>, here we develop a convolutional neural network (CNN) to learn the nonlinear impact-strain relationship without any simplification. The CNN is a typical data-driven approach where the network weights are determined by the given training data iteratively <italic>via</italic> backpropagation. By “implicitly” capturing important features of head rotational velocity profiles, regional brain strains can be estimated instantly with sufficient accuracy while maintaining the fidelity of impact kinematics, the sophistication of a head injury model, and the detailed response output. Such a capability is critical for effective real-world applications such as concussion detection on the sports field.</p>
    <p id="Par9">CNN is a class of deep learning neural network that has been extensively used in medical imaging and computer vision<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. Object detection and pattern recognition are achieved <italic>via</italic> local filter convolution to capture structural information among neighboring pixels/voxels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. This is analogous to detecting local shape variations in head rotational kinematic temporal profiles that serve as model input to determine brain strains. This inspired us to conceptualize time-varying biomechanical signals of head rotation, specifically, rotational velocity profiles along the three anatomical directions, as two-dimensional (2D) images to apply CNN for response regression. The image representation preserves the temporal locality of head rotational velocity as the three components along the temporal dimension are given at the same time. In contrast, concatenating the three velocity profiles into a one-dimensional (1D) vector may not work well with existing CNN architectures because it destroys the temporal locality required for data convolution.</p>
    <p id="Par10">We organized the study as the following. We first used two real-world impact datasets to generate sufficient training samples through augmentation. Next, we empirically optimized a CNN architecture and probed its testing performance behaviors under a variety of training-testing configurations. All training samples were then combined to conduct a 10-fold cross-validation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup> and to further test on a third, independent impact dataset measured in American football<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. Finally, an additional 10-fold cross-validation was conducted using all response samples available. The CNN technique developed here allows instantly converting a head impact measured from impact sensors into regional brain strains. Therefore, it may facilitate head impact sensors in monitoring neural health and detecting concussion more effectively; thus, transforming kinematics-based TBI studies into brain strain-related investigations in the future.</p>

      <title>Data augmentation</title>
      <p id="Par11">We used two impact datasets to generate CNN training samples: (1) video-confirmed impacts measured in American college football, boxing, and mixed martial arts from Stanford University (SF; N = 110)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>; and (2) lab-reconstructed impacts from National Football League (NFL; N = 53)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. The SF dataset was measured using instrumented mouthguards<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. The latter were reconstructed and recently reanalyzed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup> in the laboratory using dummy heads by matching the location, direction, and speed of the impacts approximated from video analysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. As contribution of linear acceleration to brain strains was negligible<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>, only isolated 3-DOF rotational velocity profiles in a ground-fixed coordinate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup> were used. The data sizes were small compared to typical CNN applications (e.g., thousands or even millions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>). Therefore, data augmentation was necessary to increase the variation in head rotational kinematics for training.</p>
      <p id="Par12">To do so, components along the <italic>x</italic>, <italic>y</italic>, and <italic>z</italic> directions were permuted to construct 6 (<italic>N</italic> = 3!) <italic>v</italic><sub><italic>rot</italic></sub> profiles (i.e., <italic>xyz</italic>, <italic>xzy</italic>, <italic>yxz</italic>, <italic>yzx</italic>, <italic>zxy</italic>, and <italic>zyx</italic>; Step 1 in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Each profile was further rotated about a random axis passing through the head center of gravity with a random magnitude (within 0–90<sup>0</sup>; Step 2 in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. The azimuth and elevation angles (<italic>θ</italic> and <italic>α</italic>, respectively) of the rotational axis, Ω(<italic>θ</italic>,<italic>α</italic>), were then determined based on peak magnitude of rotational velocity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. Due to head symmetry about the mid-sagittal plane, only half of the Ω sampling space was necessary (shaded area in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>.

      <p id="Par13">Finally, to focus on more “severe” head impacts relevant to potential “injury”, all profile magnitudes were randomly scaled so that the peak resultant velocity magnitude was above the median concussive value of 21.9 rad/s found in football while below 40 rad/s, sufficient to capture the 95<sup>th</sup> percentile of 34.1 rad/s<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>. For a given impact dataset, each permutation and random perturbation/scaling constituted one batch of training data.</p>
      <p id="Par14">The augmented SF dataset was used to optimize a CNN architecture, including the number of layers and their associated parameters (details below). We found two batches of <italic>v</italic><sub><italic>rot</italic></sub> profiles (N = 1320, 110 × 6 × 2) were necessary to yield a coefficient of determination (<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup>) above 0.90 (deemed successful) in a 10-fold cross-validation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. Similarly, we generated two batches of <italic>v</italic><sub><italic>rot</italic></sub> profiles for the NFL impacts (N = 636, 53 × 6 × 2). Some impacts from the augmented datasets may not be physically admissible or rare to occur; still, they uniquely probed the impact-strain response hypersurface and were useful for CNN training.</p>

    <sec id="Sec4">
      <title>Data preprocessing</title>
      <p id="Par15">The CNN requires a fixed input size. Therefore, all <italic>v</italic><sub><italic>rot</italic></sub> profiles were reformatted into a 3 × 201 matrix. The first dimension was fixed to represent time-varying <italic>v</italic><sub><italic>rot</italic></sub> components along the three anatomical directions. The second dimension corresponded to 200 ms in temporal length at a resolution of 1 ms (from 0 to 200 ms; sufficient for all impacts used). The second dimension could be adjusted based on the impact temporal resolution, which may require adjusting the CNN filter and stride sizes accordingly (details below). As peak rotational velocity was known to be important for brain strains, we synchronously shifted the three <italic>v</italic><sub><italic>rot</italic></sub> components so that the resultant peak occurred at a fixed time point of 100 ms (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). At both ends of the rotational velocity profile, replicated padding was used to maintain a zero acceleration, where values at the two velocity profile borders were replicated along the temporal axis. Controlling the temporal location of the resultant velocity peak reduced kinematic data variation, which was expected to decrease the number of training samples required because the same shifting and padding were applied to all testing <italic>v</italic><sub><italic>rot</italic></sub> profiles. Repositioning <italic>v</italic><sub><italic>rot</italic></sub> profiles in time did not affect output, as the strain responses were accumulated maximum values, regardless of the time of occurrence.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Overview of impact data preprocessing (top) and an empirically optimized CNN architecture (bottom) for training and testing. A typical rotational velocity temporal profile is conceptualized as a 2D image for CNN input. Note the difference in velocity profile temporal axes, as no curves are “squeezed”.

    <title>Discussion</title>
    <p id="Par32">Improving the computational efficiency while maintaining the sophistication of a head injury model and accuracy in response output is critical for prospective, real-world applications such as facilitating impact sensors in concussion detection on the sports field. This has long been desired<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup> but has remained infeasible to date. In this study, we introduced a data-driven approach using a convolutional neural network (CNN) to learn the nonlinear impact-strain relationship without the need to simplify impact kinematic input<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>, head injury model, or response output<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. The substantial increase in computational efficiency—from hours on a high-end workstation to under a second on a laptop—may enable a sophisticated head injury model for practical real-world use.</p>
    <p id="Par33">For all training-testing configurations regardless of the strain measure, the trained CNN instantly estimated regional brain strains with sufficient accuracy, especially for within-range impacts. The only exception might be when using the augmented NFL dataset to test on measured SF dataset (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5b</xref>; further discussed below). MPS of the whole brain generally achieved the best performance, with some degradation for more sophisticated strain measures characterizing region-specific MPS and directionally informed fiber strain of the corpus callosum (Figs <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref> and <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>). Although the regions of interest were limited to the whole brain and corpus callosum for illustration in this study, most likely the technique can be extended to other regions, including specific gray matter regions and their white matter interconnections. In contrast, reduced-order methods are limited to estimating peak MPS of the whole brain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup> but not element- or region-wise MPS, or directionally informed fiber strain in specific regions. The pre-computation technique estimates element-wise MPS of the entire brain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>; however, it remains unclear how it performs when estimating fiber strains.</p>
    <p id="Par34">Nevertheless, directly benchmarking against these competing methods was not feasible in this study because they did not use the same impact data to report performance. Accuracy assessment in this study was limited to those occurring in contact sports; albeit, they were scaled to levels most relevant to injury. In contrast, earlier reduced-order models used impacts from a broad range of head impact conditions including sports, automotive crashes, sled tests and human volunteers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. However, in addition to degraded accuracy for more severe, but perhaps the most important, impacts, inclusion of low-severity impacts could have also artificially skewed the correlation to a more favorable score. Performance with the pre-computation technique was limited to dummy head impacts, but not real-world recorded impacts yet<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>.</p>
    <p id="Par35">Both the CNN technique and the previous pre-computed brain response atlas approach<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup> require a large training dataset. However, the CNN technique is significantly more advantageous because it is scalable—when model-simulated responses from new or “unseen” impacts become available (e.g., to challenge the CNN estimation accuracy), they can be assimilated into the existing training dataset to re-train. This iterative updating process is expected to continually improve the estimation accuracy, as illustrated (Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>). In contrast, the pre-computation approach is unable to assimilate fresh impact-response samples<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>.</p>
    <p id="Par36">Even for impacts whose resultant peak velocity fell outside of the targeted peak resultant velocity range, many of their CNN predictions were still within ± 1 RMSE relative to their directly simulated counterparts (Figs <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref> and <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). This indicated some impressive generalizability and robustness of the CNN technique. The ReLU activation functions were very effective in characterizing the inherently nonlinear brain-skull dynamic system, as it introduced sparsity effect<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup> on the neural network to improve information representation and to avoid overfitting<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. ReLU was also desirable here since its output and strains of interest were all non-negative. Nevertheless, further fine-tuning the CNN architecture may be desirable in the future using all of the impact-strain response samples available (N = 3069).</p>
    <p id="Par37">The data augmentation scheme <italic>via</italic> permutation and random perturbation (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) was important to generate sufficient data variations to the head rotational axis and velocity magnitude. However, the temporal “shapes” of the head rotational velocity profiles were limited to what the measured/reconstructed impact datasets offered. Unfortunately, a parameterized descriptor of head rotational velocity temporal shape does not exist to allow generating its variations for CNN training. However, potentially this could be somewhat augmented by linearly scaling along the temporal direction, which can be explored in the future. Nevertheless, shifting the rotational velocity profiles so that the resultant peak velocity occurred at a fixed temporal location indeed slightly improved the testing performance; otherwise, <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> typically dropped by 0.01 for within-range evaluations.</p>
    <p id="Par38">We chose to use <italic>v</italic><sub><italic>rot</italic></sub> profiles for training because <italic>v</italic><sub><italic>rot</italic></sub> is known to be important to brain strain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. The corresponding rotational acceleration profiles or the combination of rotational velocity and acceleration profiles could also be used for training. They are equivalent in prescribing head motion, with the caveat of a possible non-zero initial velocity in <italic>v</italic><sub><italic>rot</italic></sub> profiles, which was found to be negligible for brain strain. Therefore, they were found to lead to virtually identical CNN performances (confirmed but not shown). The CNN input matrix was fixed to 3 in the first dimension to correspond to the three anatomical directions, but the second temporal dimension could be adjusted. We found that increasing the temporal resolution did not improve CNN estimation accuracy, but decreasing the temporal resolution degraded the accuracy. This suggested that the latter led to some loss of information, as expected.</p>
    <p id="Par39">Comparing performances across different training-testing configurations, we found that training using the augmented SF dataset to test on the reconstructed NFL dataset outperformed that when instead, using the augmented NFL dataset for training to test on the measured SF dataset, even when the sample sizes were comparable (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). We suspected that this was because the measured impacts on the field contained more “feature” variations in the rotational kinematics profiles that included acceleration, deceleration, as well as reversal in rotational velocity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. In contrast, lab-reconstructed head impacts mainly focused on matching impact location, direction, and speed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup> but may not include more complicated shape variations. These findings suggested the importance of using “feature-rich” impact kinematics data to maximize variation in the training samples. Nevertheless, the addition of the augmented NFL dataset did improve testing performance (Figs <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> vs. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>), suggesting that they also contained information useful for CNN training. On the other hand, prediction on relatively “simple” impacts such as those in the reconstructed NFL dataset always yielded the best performance (Figs <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>–<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>).</p>
    <p id="Par40">Finally, although sophisticated computational hardware is desirable/necessary for model simulations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup> to generate training samples and to train the CNN, this is not necessary for using an already trained CNN for prediction. In fact, even a portable mobile device may be sufficient for applying a trained CNN for prediction, which is desirable for potential real-world deployment in the future. To potentially better serve the research community and other interested parties, we have made the trained CNN publicly available, along with code and examples at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/Jilab-biomechanics/CNN-brain-strains">https://github.com/Jilab-biomechanics/CNN-brain-strains</ext-link>. It is anticipated that the link will be updated as needed in the future.</p>
    <sec id="Sec14">
      <title>Limitations</title>
      <p id="Par41">For brevity, we only reported accuracies of strains measured at the 95<sup>th</sup> percentile for illustration. The same approach was also tested at the 100<sup>th</sup> and 50<sup>th</sup> percentile levels (both used in injury prediction). A lower percentile would effectively serve as a smoothing filter to the impact-response hypersurface, which would slightly improve the prediction accuracy compared to the 100<sup>th</sup> percentile responses (confirmed but not shown).</p>
      <p id="Par42">We focused on a relatively narrow range of peak resultant velocity magnitude because they were most relevant to injury. However, expanding the coverage range to lower impact severities to allow considering the cumulative effects of repeated sub-concussive impacts is straightforward. For out-of-range impacts, the CNN generally overestimated strains to some degree, but with many still within ±1 RMSE relative to the directly simulated counterparts. This highlighted the generalizability and robustness of the technique, which was important for real-world applications where unexpected, “out-of-range” impacts may occur.</p>
      <p id="Par43">Further, the data-driven CNN technique does not address any physics behind brain biomechanical responses. However, as a fast and accurate brain strain response generator, the trained CNN may allow other researchers to efficiently produce impact-response data to explore the physics behind brain strains and concussion in reduced-order models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref></sup>.</p>
      <p id="Par44">Nevertheless, the CNN was only tested using impacts in contact sports in this study because our focus was to enable head injury models for facilitating concussion detection on the sports field. It merits further investigation into whether the application can be expanded more broadly to other impact scenarios such as automotive crashes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. If found to be similarly effective, the technique may allow transforming state-of-the-art impact kinematics-based studies of brain injury into focusing more on brain strains in the future.</p>
      <p id="Par45">Finally, the trained CNN is model-dependent, and regional strain estimates are subject to all limitations related to the WHIM used for generating training samples. Nonetheless, the CNN can be easily re-trained to accommodate another model or a future, upgraded WHIM. In this case, a large amount of impacts may need to be simulated again. However, existing training data already simulated can still be reused to set an appropriate initial starting point for CNN training, which would reduce the number of impacts required to re-simulate.</p>

    <title>Conclusion</title>
    <p id="Par46">In this study, we developed a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) to train and instantly estimate impact-induced regional brain strains with sufficient accuracy. The technique is significantly more advantageous than other alternative methods, because it does not need to simplify impact kinematic input, head injury model, or response output, and is effective for estimating more sophisticated, region-specific and directionally informed strains. The trained neural network is uniquely capable of assimilating fresh impact-response samples to iteratively improve accuracy. Together with sensors that measure impact kinematics upon head collision, this technique may enable a sophisticated head injury model to produce region-specific brain responses, instantly, potentially even on a portable mobile device. Therefore, this technique may offer clinical diagnostic values to a sophisticated head injury model, e.g., to facilitate head impact sensors in concussion detection <italic>via</italic> a mobile device. This is important to mitigate the millions of concussion incidents worldwide every year. In addition, the technique may transform current acceleration-based injury studies into focusing on regional brain strains.</p>
