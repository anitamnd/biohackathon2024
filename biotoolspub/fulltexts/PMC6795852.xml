      <p id="Par1">Methods for investigating DNA methylation nowadays either require a reference genome and high coverage, or investigate only CG methylation. Moreover, no large-scale analysis can be performed for N<sup>6</sup>-methyladenosine (6 mA) at an affordable price. Here we describe the methylation content sensitive enzyme double-digest restriction-site-associated DNA (ddRAD) technique (MCSeEd), a reduced-representation, reference-free, cost-effective approach for characterizing whole genome methylation patterns across different methylation contexts (e.g., CG, CHG, CHH, 6 mA). MCSeEd can also detect genetic variations among hundreds of samples. MCSeEd is based on parallel restrictions carried out by combinations of methylation insensitive and sensitive endonucleases, followed by next-generation sequencing. Moreover, we present a robust bioinformatic pipeline (available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://bitbucket.org/capemaster/mcseed/src/master/">https://bitbucket.org/capemaster/mcseed/src/master/</ext-link>) for differential methylation analysis combined with single nucleotide polymorphism calling without or with a reference genome.</p>

    <title>Introduction</title>
    <p id="Par2">DNA methylation is one of the fastest mechanisms that organisms use to rapidly adapt to new conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Indeed, the methylation of cytosine residues in genomic DNA has a pivotal role in regulation of genome expression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>, particularly for the cytosines in promoter sequences of specific genes. Generally, methylation is correlated with silencing of genes and transposable elements, while demethylation is correlated with active transcription<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>, although the reverse has also been documented<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Moreover, methylation patterns along a gene can have specific effects on the gene expression: body-methylated genes tend to be constitutively expressed, whereas promoter-methylated genes are preferentially expressed in a tissue-specific manner<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>.</p>
    <p id="Par3">Cytosine methylation is conventionally classified in terms of CG, CHG, and CHH sequence contexts (where H is A, C, or T), which are subjected to the actions of different DNA methyltransferases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Methylation on adenine (N<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>-methyladenosine; 6 mA)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup> has been recently found in <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> and in several multicellular eukaryotes, including flowering plants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. While in prokaryotes and ancient eukaryotes, 6 mA serves as major marker to discriminate invasive foreign DNA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>, its role in eukaryotes has recently been associated with transcriptional activation in response to stress<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>, and with transgenerational chromatin regulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>.</p>
    <p id="Par4">There are many technologies available to obtain genome-wide information on differential DNA methylation. Some of these provide qualitative information on the methylation state, while others are based on the chemical conversion of unmethylated cytosine to thymine. This chemical conversion defines the level of unconverted cytosines, which provides a measure of the level of DNA methylation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>.</p>
    <p id="Par5">Whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) is a technique that can assess virtually every cytosine methylation state in the genome, although this requires high coverage (at least 5–10–fold)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>, which makes it expensive in species with a large genome and/or in experiments with many samples<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. Reduced representative bisulfite sequencing (RRBS)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup> has been proposed as an alternative to WGBS for large genomes. RRBS introduces a DNA digestion step with a methylation-insensitive enzyme that is followed by size filtration of the restricted fragments, and chemical conversion. This technique investigates only a fraction of the genome, but the increased sequencing coverage of the represented fraction provides greater confidence in such methylation measurements. Although RRBS has been shown to be extremely powerful, there remain technical and financial bottlenecks that challenge the feasibility of these approaches, especially in species with a large genome and lacking a reference genome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>.</p>
    <p id="Par6">Further reductions in sequencing efforts can be achieved through adoption of methylation-sensitive endonucleases, as in methylation-sensitive restriction-enzyme digestion and sequencing (MRE-seq)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>, or the EpiRADseq<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup> variation of Double digest RADseq (ddRADseq<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>). These techniques involve DNA digestion with a methylation-sensitive enzyme followed by size selection and sequencing. However, these methylation-sensitive enzymes target non-methylated sites, and thus they act more specifically on sites with low level of methylation, which are the most difficult to detect with conventional techniques<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. Such read counts for each locus do not provide absolute measures of cytosine methylation, although they can be useful to infer methylation differences between samples at specific sites. A limitation of MRE-seq is that it is specific for CG methylation. Importantly, none of these methods address analysis of the methylation status of adenines, which is currently being studied using either costly or complex approaches, such as PacBio sequencing mass spectrometry, immunoprecipitation, and 6mA-RE-seq<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>.</p>
    <p id="Par7">To overcome some of these limitations, we present the methylation content sensitive enzyme double-digest restriction-site-associated DNA (ddRAD) technique (MCSeEd), a very simple, highly scalable, cost-effective extension of the original ddRAD protocol that allows the detection of methylation changes for the CG, CHG, CHH, and 6 mA contexts.</p>
    <p id="Par8">This MCSeEd technique was tested on leaves of a commercial maize hybrid grown under normal irrigation (well watered; WW) and under drought stress (DS), and collected 60 days after sowing (DAS). The relative methylation changes estimated by MCSeEd for differentially methylated positions (DMPs) and differentially methylated regions (DMRs) clearly discriminated between WW and DS samples with both genome-dependent and genome-independent approaches. The DMRs identified by MCSeEd showed gene enrichments related to the experimental system under investigation. Shifts in single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) allele frequencies were also identified, and were related to the specific methylated/unmethylated alleles.</p>

        <p id="Par9">The MCSeEd technique was used to monitor DNA methylation changes induced by drought stress in maize leaves. To this end, we constructed next-generation sequencing (NGS) libraries from genomic DNA purified from the leaves of the WW and DS maize plants. A total of 24 libraries were produced by double restriction–ligations, each using <italic>Mse</italic>I in combination with one of the four methylation-sensitive enzymes <italic>Aci</italic>I, <italic>Pst</italic>I, <italic>Eco</italic>T22I, and <italic>Dpn</italic>II, for the CG, CHG, and CHH and 6 mA contexts, respectively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup> (Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">S1</xref>) as outlined in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> and in Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">S2</xref>.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Schematic representation of MCSeEd. Two samples (e.g., control, stressed samples) (<bold>a</bold>) are subjected to double digestion (<bold>b</bold>) with a methylation-insensitive (<italic>Mse</italic>I) and a methylation-sensitive enzyme (<italic>Aci</italic>I, <italic>Pst</italic>I, <italic>Eco</italic>T22, <italic>Dpn</italic>II; see Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">S1</xref>) and ligated (<bold>c</bold>) with specific adapters: a Y adapter for the <italic>Mse</italic>I site and a barcoded adapter specific for the methylation-sensitive enzyme (<bold>c</bold>). After size selection, the fragments are pooled and amplified with adapter-specific primers (<italic>Mse</italic>I primers carry library-specific indices) and sequenced using the 1 × 150 Illumina chemistry (<bold>d</bold>). Demultiplexed reads (<bold>e</bold>) are analyzed with the design-appropriate MCSeEd pipeline.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="41598_2019_51423_Fig1_HTML" id="d29e520"/></fig></p>
        <p id="Par10">A mean of 7.8 million 150-bp-long reads were obtained from each library (Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">S3</xref>). Of these, 98% passed quality control and were aligned to the B73 reference genome. To avoid bias due to paralogous sequences that can align at multiple genomic sites, only the reads that mapped at unique genomic positions were retained. Thus, a total of 89,935,677 reads were mapped uniquely on the reference genome (48.49% of the total reads, with a minimum of 30.13% for <italic>Dpn</italic>II, and a maximum of 78.70% for <italic>Pst</italic>I). We named these reads the MCSeEd loci (Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">S3</xref>). They identified 992,320 loci containing cytosines (705,341 in symmetric, and 286,889 in asymmetric contexts) and 1,629,894 loci containing adenines (Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">S4</xref>).</p>
        <p id="Par11">The mapping location of each MCSeEd locus was investigated to determine whether it fell into an extended gene body (EGB) that included the region within 2.5 kb upstream of the transcription start site (TSS), the transcribed region (i.e., the gene body), and the region within 2.5 kb downstream of the transcription termination site (TTS). Of note, in all, 92.9% (<italic>Aci</italic>I), 78.0% (<italic>Pst</italic>I), 82.3% (<italic>Eco</italic>T22I), and 98.1% (<italic>Dpn</italic>II) of the identified MCSeEd loci fell into EGBs. Specifically, a mean of 6.28 sites per EGB was recorded, with a minimum of 2.96 for <italic>Pst</italic>I, and a maximum of 12.58 for <italic>Dpn</italic>II (Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">S5</xref>).</p>
        <p id="Par12">After normalization of the MCSeEd loci, the sites covered by a total number of reads &lt; 4 or showing excessive read-count variation among the replicates (standard deviation &gt; 8%) were discarded (Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">S4</xref>). The remaining sites were used to estimate the total of 62,489 DMPs, out of the 992,230 investigated cytosines, with significantly altered methylation levels between the WW and DS samples (false discovery rate, ≤0.05). Of these, 44,176 belonged to symmetric, and 18,313 to asymmetric contexts. With similar filtering, out of 1.6 million on 6 mA, 118,269 DMPs were detected (Supplementary Tables <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">S6</xref>, <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">S7</xref>).</p>
        <p id="Par13">Principal component analysis was used to cluster the samples based on the methylation levels of the DMPs (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>). The first latent component (PC1) accounted for 53%, 84%, 44%, and 47% of the total variance, for the CG, CHG, CHH, and 6 mA contexts, respectively, and clearly discriminated between WW and DS, which indicated that the drought stress leads to genome-wide methylation changes in maize leaves.</p>
        <p id="Par14">Accordingly, complete linkage clustering of the methylation levels at DMPs clearly separated the DS from the WW samples (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref>). Altogether, these data indicate that the MCSeEd pipeline can infer the effects of drought stress for each methylated context. Considering all of the methylation changes as being induced by water deficiency in the drought-stressed replicates, we observed 1.6-fold (CG) to 3.4-fold (CHH) more methylation increases than decreases as responses to this stress, whereas for CHG and 6 mA, the proportion of methylation changes in each direction was equivalent (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S3a</xref>).</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="Sec5">
        <title>Differentially methylated regions</title>
        <p id="Par15">Genomic regions with co-regulated methylation changes upon drought-stress were identified by an adjacent window approach that targeted adjacent DMPs with concordant methylation changes (at least 2). After validation by logistic regression, the identified genomic regions were investigated as DMRs. In total, 5,726 DMRs were identified for the CG (347), CHG (836), CHH (205), and mA (4,338) contexts (Supplementary Tables <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">S6</xref>, <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">S8</xref>). The DMR median length was similar for CG (485 bp), CHH (484 bp), and 6 mA (506 bp), and a little lower for CHG (325 bp) (Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">S9</xref>).</p>
        <p id="Par16">The estimated relative methylation levels of the DMPs belonging to each DMR were hierarchically clustered, and as expected, clustered according to treatment, as WW or DS (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). In particular, for the CG and CHH sites, the number of DMRs with higher methylation levels in the DS samples (relative to the WW samples) was higher than the number of DMRs that showed a lower level in the DS samples (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). In contrast, for the CHG and 6 mA contexts, the number of DMRs with higher methylation levels in the DS samples (relative to the WW samples) was equivalent to the number of DMRs with a lower level in the DS samples.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Relative methylation frequencies of differentially methylated regions identified from the comparison between the well watered (WW) and drought stressed (DS) samples. Relative methylation frequencies of the differentially methylated positions contained in each differentially methylated region were averaged and used in complete linkage clustering analysis of samples derived from WW and DS based on 347 (<bold>a</bold>; CG), 836 (<bold>b</bold>; CHG), 205 (<bold>c</bold>; CHH) and 4338 (<bold>d</bold>; 6 mA) differentially methylated regions.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="41598_2019_51423_Fig2_HTML" id="d29e628"/></fig></p>

        <title>Differentially methylated genes</title>
        <p id="Par17">To analyze how water stress impacts the methylation patterns typical of genic regions, we analyzed the DMP and DMR distributions in relation to the coding and regulatory genomic sequences. In particular, we compared the distribution of DMPs and DMRs in transcribed genic regions extended by 2 kb at both ends (EGBs) (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S4</xref>, Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>) and found that DMRs mapped preferentially to EGBs (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). In particular 243, 731, and 307 EGBs were overlapped at least once by 1,388 DMRs in the 2 kb windows upstream of TSS, within the gene body, or in the 2 kb windows downstream of TTS, respectively. The genes belonging to these EGBs were defined as differentially methylated genes (DMGs, Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">S10</xref>) and were investigated as DMGs upon drought stress.

    <title>Discussion</title>
    <p id="Par26">We have developed a reduced-representation, reference-free approach for characterizing whole genome methylation patterns across different methylation contexts. While WGBS is the gold standard, it is cost prohibitive at most experimental scales, and requires a reference genome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>.</p>
    <p id="Par27">Alternative approaches aimed at reducing the sequencing demands are based on genomic digestion with either methylation-sensitive or methylation-insensitive endonucleases, before direct NGS (e.g., EpiRADseq<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>, MRE-seq<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>), or bisulfite treatments and NGS (e.g., RRBS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>, methylation-sensitive restriction enzyme bisulfite sequencing [MREBS]<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>). However, both RRBS and MREBS still require a reference genome and a certain level of coverage, at least for estimation of the methylation status of the cytosines. Although EpiRADseq and MRE-seq do not require a reference genome, these consider only the CG sites, and the methylation status is deduced by counting the unmethylated cytosines within the recognition site. The scenario for 6 mA is even worse to date, with the level of 6 mA determined by immunoprecipitation or liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. The only sequencing technique that can simultaneously infer the cytosine-5 methylation and 6 mA is PacBio single-molecule real-time sequencing, but this is prohibitively expensive for most applications<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>.</p>
    <p id="Par28">To address these limitations, we developed a new method: MCSeEd. Similar to other reduced-representation methods, MCSeEd is based upon parallel restrictions carried out by combinations of a methylation-insensitive endonuclease (<italic>Mse</italic>I) and one of four methylation-sensitive endonucleases, directed to one of CG, CHG, CHH, and 6 mA. This is completed using NGS.</p>
    <p id="Par29">With MCSeEd, the read counts can be readily used to estimate the differential methylation between two samples, which is often of primary interest<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. Indeed, the cytosine libraries here described were equally represented, and they covered a mean of 2.6 million sites, about 7% of which were differentially methylated between the samples. This MCSeEd pipeline was tested without and with the support of a reference genome and in both cases, this resulted in identification of DMPs at very high rates. The genome-dependent approach resulted in a similar number of DMPs with respect to the genome-independent approach (180,758 vs 181,481).</p>
    <p id="Par30">As validation, we used qMRE to confirm the changes in the DNA methylation recorded in the WW <italic>versus</italic> DS comparison. To confirm our DS experiment data, we randomly chose 10 DMPs and applied the qMRE method. Of note, this system was able to confirm the methylation levels within the samples and the differential methylation between the WW and DS samples in nine out of the 10 cases.</p>
    <p id="Par31">Methylation of adenines is still a poorly investigated field. For instance, Fu <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup> reported that the consensus motifs for 6 mA are only partially conserved in different eukaryotic organisms, and enzymes might have evolved to catalyze 6 mA modifications in the evolutionary process. They reported that GATC appears to be the most ancient 6 mA motif, which exists in both lower eukaryotes and bacteria, but is lost in higher eukaryotes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Instead, GAGG is present in both <italic>plantae</italic> and <italic>animalia</italic>, and AGAA might be specific to animals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. Liang <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup> demonstrated that <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> contains two specific methylated motifs, ANYGA and ACCT, which have not been found in other organisms to date. On the other hand, the presence of adenine methylation at GATC sequences was shown in rice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>, tobacco<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>, and <italic>Arabidopsis</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>. In particular, both Dhar <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup> and Ashapkin <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup> used <italic>Dpn</italic>I, which digests the DNA only if adenine is methylated in the sequence GATC, to demonstrate the extensive digestion of rice and <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> DNAs. Our results confirm these findings, and demonstrate that methylation at the GATC site is not only present in maize, but also that the mechanisms of methylation/demethylation are still active, as the levels of differentially methylated positions due to stress are very high (118,269 and 143,389 DMPs in the genome-dependent and genome-independent approaches).</p>
    <p id="Par32">CG methylation is prevalent in the transcribed regions of many constitutively expressed plant genes (i.e., gene body methylation), and it shows characteristic patterns within genic regions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>. In maize, CG methylation has been shown for exons more than introns, which suggests a defensive function <italic>versus</italic> transposon insertion in the coding sequence, while allowing insertions into introns and other noncoding regions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>. Moreover, both in maize and <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, the CHG and CHH methylation contexts are significantly enriched at intron-exon junctions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>. Our data show that all cytosine-5 methylation contexts are enriched within 2 kb upstream of the TSS; moreover, while CG and CHG are highly enriched in exons, CHH is enriched in introns.</p>
    <p id="Par33">For 6 mA, Liang <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup> reported that these sites in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> genes are mainly located in exons, while those in transposable element genes show a local reduction at the TSS, followed by an immediate increase, as also seen in <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. This is in contrast to what was seen in <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic>, where 6 mA are distributed equally in genomic regions, including introns, exons, and TSS regions, and in <italic>Mus musculus</italic> and <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic>, where 6 mA are primarily excluded from coding regions. Our data show an enrichment of 6 mA in EGBs, and lower levels of 6 mA in intergenic regions. This is particular true for DMRs, but less evident for DMPs. It is worth nothing that the 6 mA located in EGBs appears to respond to water restriction more than the 6 mA located in intergenic regions.</p>
    <p id="Par34">The efficiency of MCSeEd for detection of changes in DNA methylation between two sets of contrasting samples was evident in both principal component analysis and linkage clustering, which clearly discriminated the WW samples from the DS samples, for both DMPs and DMRs.</p>
    <p id="Par35">Boyko <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup> reported an increase in global genome methylation in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> plants exposed to stress, including salt, UVC, cold, heat and flood stresses. In particular, the progenies of these stress-treated plants showed increased global methylation, even in the absence of the stress, but these transgenerational effects did not persist in successive generations in the absence of stress. Moreover, induction of transient DNA methylation was related to drought stress in pea<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup> and in drought susceptible rice genotypes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup>. By using MCSeEd on these maize samples with different water status (i.e., WW vs. DS), we found that DS appears to induce methylation rather than demethylation, particularly in the CHH and CG contexts. In total, we identified 1,240 DMGs, most of which were related to regulation of transcription, biosynthetic and metabolic processes, and response to stimuli, processes that suggest that changes in DNA methylation are correlated with stress responses to water deprivation.</p>
    <p id="Par36">Genomic DNA cytosine/adenine methylation polymorphism studies can be tested for their ability to reveal “epigenetic heterosis” effects for tolerance to drought and other stress factors, and as a tool to identify novel stress-responsive genes. Indeed, methylation changes can be allele specific or genome specific (in case of polyploids). Therefore, inferred ASMR sites might be very important for this purpose. In our study, many ASMR sites for drought stress were identified, as a genome-wide situation that already existed in the control plants (i.e., WW). It is known than genomes can show selective allelic imbalance, as seen for humans<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup> and plants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref></sup>.</p>
    <p id="Par37">The drought stress influenced the methylation status of cytosines and adenines, which created a level of imbalanced heterozygosis between the stress (DS) and control (WW) conditions. This imbalance might impact on the level of gene expression, as methylation can have a general role in the regulation of gene expression and contribute to the hybrid vigor phenomenon<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref></sup>. MCSeEd can thus mine SNPs associated with selectively methylated sites, to highlight allelic imbalance. This has implications for breeding programs, wherein MCSeEd can provide information about which of two genomes in a hybrid has been methylated, and through the targeting of candidate ASMR sites, allow a “MAS by methylation” approach.</p>
    <p id="Par38">Here we tested MCSeEd on maize, as an important crop that has a large genome and is thus very rich in transposable elements. Also, in its cultivated form, maize is a hybrid, and hence a very challenging species to work with. We have demonstrated that even in such a complex scenario, use of MCSeEd identified differentially methylated regions both between stress and control conditions in a hybrid genotype, and between developing organs in an inbred line (B73). Benchmarking experiments indicate that MCSeEd can be reliably used for differential methylation analyses with consistent results.</p>

      <title>Loci-counting approach</title>
      <p id="Par44">To create a count matrix where the columns are the sample libraries and the rows represent the locations in the genome hit by the sequencing, we created a merged bam file that acted as a guide for creating an “experiment-wise annotation”. Here, all of the genomic positions sequenced were stored, whereby all of the uniquely mapped reads were recorded for each genomic location covered in the experiment. Briefly, for each alignment in the bam file, genome coordinates and CIGAR<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref></sup> fields were processed to produce meaningful intervals with a Perl script. Then, redundant coordinates were collapsed and sorted, and overlapping intervals were merged with the <italic>bedtools</italic> suite, maintaining strandedness<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref></sup>. This information was converted to a formal GFF file, and then used as the input in <italic>featureCounts</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref></sup>, along with the bam files previously described, to count the occurrences on the experiment-wise annotation.</p>
      <p id="Par45">The count matrix consisted of one row per locus and one column per sample, and it was then filtered and processed by two in-house–built Perl scripts. The following operations were performed: (1) the libraries were normalized and balanced in a reads per million fashion; (2) loci with a coverage of at least 10 reads were retained; (3) relative methylation level per locus were estimated; and (4) the filtered data were parsed for use by the methylKit R package<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref></sup>. In particular, the relative methylation levels at each site (point 3) were calculated following a rescaling procedure that was based on the maximum number of observed read counts. In practice, the sample showing the highest number of reads was assumed to be the not-methylated reference for the site, or to have 0% methylcytosine and 100% cytosine, and all of the remaining samples were rescaled proportionally (Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">S16</xref>). As the reference was common to all samples, the methylation level estimates can be used to infer relative methylation changes between the samples. DMPs were therefore identified as sites that showed significant differences in the methylation levels between the treatments, using logistic regression as implemented in methylKit. The DMPs were called following the methylKit manual best practices.</p>
      <p id="Par46">The mapping of the DMPs in the same scaffold and as closer than a given threshold provided their clustering together to identify the DMRs, based on the following procedure. Briefly, the first step was to maximize the number of DMRs in a set of adjacent windows, to identify the best window length for each context. We therefore tested a range of windows, from 100 bp to 2,000 bp. To do so, each potential window (i.e., 100 bp) was screened for DMPs that were significantly differentially methylated (false discovery rate, ≤0.05). The 5′-end of the window was therefore registered to start at the DMP position. Additional DMPs that were mapped within the re-positioned window (i.e., 100 bp) were included in the cluster, provided that the following conditions were met: (i) the direction of the methylation change agreed with the preceding DMP included in the cluster; and (ii) the DMPs to be included were called with a given significance threshold (false discovery rate, ≤0.05). After the additional DMPs were included in the cluster, the window start was registered to the position of the most 3′ of the DMPs included, and the procedure was repeated as described. If no additional DMPs were identified based on the described condition, the scanning procedure was restarted until a DMP was identified. These clusters of DMPs that were composed of a number of DMPs that exceeded a given threshold were analyzed using logistic regression, to identify and define the DMRs.</p>
      <p id="Par47">Once the data for each window length was produced, the operator chose the best length, i.e., the one that maximized the number of DMRs per window (Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">S9</xref>). At this point, the script was re-stared for each context using the adjacent window of the chosen length.</p>

      <title>Reference-free workflow</title>
      <p id="Par48">For the genome-independent part of the pipeline, we relied on the robust and simple approach of Schield <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>, with some modifications. Briefly, as no reference genome was available, the raw reads were collapsed using Rainbow 2.0.4 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/bio-rainbow">https://sourceforge.net/projects/bio-rainbow</ext-link>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref></sup> and CDHit (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/weizhongli/cdhit">https://github.com/weizhongli/cdhit</ext-link>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref></sup>, to create a pseudo-reference genome that consists of a multi-fasta file that contained the read contigs: this serves as a guide for the mapping algorithm. After mapping the reads to the pseudo-reference using the <italic>bwa mem</italic> algorithm with its default settings<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref></sup>, a result matrix was created for each sample using Samtools, which counts how many sequences per contig are mapped. This matrix was then used following the loci counting approach described above.</p>

      <title>Variant calling and shift in allelic frequency</title>
      <p id="Par49">For both genome-dependent and genome-independent approaches, MCSeEd can perform a variant calling procedure using the Stacks suite<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref></sup>. Briefly, after the creation of a population file and a catalog of mutations, a VCF file with frequencies and reference/alternative alleles was created, which was ready to be transformed into any population-genetics exchange file (i.e., PED/MAP).</p>
      <p id="Par50">To highlight unbalanced allelic frequencies in heterozygous loci among the WW and DS samples, and putatively due to differential methylation, the reference (REF) and alternative (ALT) allele counts were extracted from the vcf files and normalized across the samples. Only sites covered by at least 25 reads were considered. Then, at each site, the frequency of the reference allele was computed for each allele across the three replicates, as in Equation (<xref rid="Equ1" ref-type="">1</xref>):<disp-formula id="Equ1"><label>1</label><alternatives><tex-math id="M1">\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

      <p id="Par51">This was then used to calculate the mean frequency at each locus, for each enzymatic context. The shifts in the allele contribution indices between the WW and DS samples were calculated based on Student’s t-tests, followed by Benjamini-Hochberg correction for multiple tests (P &lt; 0.05).</p>

      <title>MCSeEd validation</title>
      <p id="Par52">As described by Hashimoto <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>, for each MCSeEd sequence to be validated, the DNA was digested using the methylation-sensitive enzyme for the corresponding methylcytosine context. The reaction mixture of 25 μL contained 100 ng DNA, 0.5 U of either <italic>Aci</italic>I, <italic>Pst</italic>I, or <italic>Eco</italic>T22I in the specific buffer defined for each enzyme. For the non-enzyme control (mock), distilled water was added instead of the enzyme. All of the samples were then incubated at 37 °C for 4 h, follow by heat inactivation at 65 °C/80 °C for 20 min.</p>
      <p id="Par53">Real-time PCR for the methylation status was performed (Mx3000P QPCR system; Stratagene, La Jolla, CA, USA) with the SYBR Green JumpStart Taq ReadyMix for Quantitative PCR (Sigma Aldrich). Using the Primer3 software<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref></sup>, specific primers were designed for each randomly chosen DMP to be validated. The sequence information of the primers that bracketed the enzyme site of each DMP are reported in Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">S15</xref>.</p>
      <p id="Par54">The PCR fragments were analyzed using a dissociation protocol, to ensure that each amplicon was a single product. The amplicons were also sequenced to verify the specificities of the targets. The amplification efficiency was calculated from the raw data using the LingRegPCR software<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref></sup>.</p>
      <p id="Par55">All of the qMRE were performed in a final volume of 25 µL that contained 20 ng DNA template (previously digested/mock), 0.2 µM of each primer, and 12.5 µL 2 × PCR Master Mix, according to the manufacturer instructions. The following thermal cycling profile was used: 95 °C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C for 10 s, 57 °C for 15 s, and 72 °C for 15 s. Following the cycling, the melting curve was determined in the range of 57 °C to 95 °C, with the temperature increment of 0.01 °C/s. Each reaction was run in triplicate (as technical replicates).</p>
      <p id="Par56">The raw Ct data from the real-time PCR were exported to a data file and analyzed using the GeneEx Pro software<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref></sup>. During the pre-processing phase, the data were corrected for PCR efficiency, with the means of the three biological samples calculated. The selected reference gene, GAPDH (GenBank accession no. X15596.1), was subsequently used to normalize the Ct values<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref></sup>, and the quantities were calculated relative to the maximum Ct value. As our interest was in fold-changes in the amplification between the mock and treated samples and the WW and DS samples, we ultimately converted the quantities to a logarithmic scale using log base 2 conversion, which also allowed the normal distribution of the values to be tested<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref></sup>.</p>

The ‘stats’ package was used to estimate correlations and binomial and logistic regression, and ‘factorextra’ was used to perform the principal component analysis. Complete linkage clustering was carried out using the ‘heatmap.2’ function of the ‘gplots’ package, in combination with the ‘hclust’ and ‘dist’ functions, and with ‘ward.D2’ as the clustering method. The MethylKit R package was used to estimate the methylation changes between the WW and DS samples.</p>
