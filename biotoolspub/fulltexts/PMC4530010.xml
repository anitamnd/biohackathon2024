      <p id="P4">The reference human genome sequence set the stage for studies of genetic variation and its association with human disease, but a similar reference has lacked for epigenomic studies. To address this need, the NIH Roadmap Epigenomics Consortium generated the largest collection to-date of human epigenomes for primary cells and tissues. Here, we describe the integrative analysis of 111 reference human epigenomes generated as part of the program, profiled for histone modification patterns, DNA accessibility, DNA methylation, and RNA expression. We establish global maps of regulatory elements, define regulatory modules of coordinated activity, and their likely activators and repressors. We show that disease and trait-associated genetic variants are enriched in tissue-specific epigenomic marks, revealing biologically-relevant cell types for diverse human traits, and providing a resource for interpreting the molecular basis of human disease. Our results demonstrate the central role of epigenomic information for understanding gene regulation, cellular differentiation, and human disease.</p>

    <title>Introduction</title>
    <p id="P5">While the primary sequence of the human genome is largely preserved in all human cell types, the epigenomic landscape of each cell can vary considerably, contributing to distinct gene expression programs and biological functions<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>-<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>. Epigenomic information, such as covalent histone modifications, DNA accessibility, and DNA methylation can be interrogated in each cell and tissue type using high-throughput molecular assays<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>-<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>. The resulting maps have been instrumental for annotating cis-regulatory elements and other non-coding genomic features with characteristic epigenomic signatures<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>-<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>, and for dissecting gene regulatory programs in development and disease<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>-<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>. Despite these technological advances, we still lack a systematic understanding of how the epigenomic landscape contributes to cellular circuitry, lineage specification, and the onset and progression of human disease.</p>
    <p id="P6">To facilitate and spearhead these efforts, the NIH Roadmap Epigenomics Program was established, with the goal of elucidating how epigenetic processes contribute to human biology and disease. One of the major components of this program consists of the Reference Epigenome Mapping Centers<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>, which systematically characterized the epigenomic landscapes of representative primary human tissues and cells. We used a diversity of assays, including chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>-<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>-<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>, DNA digestion by deoxyribonuclease I (DNase)<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>, bisulfite treatment <sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>-<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>-<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>, methylated DNA immunoprecipitation (MeDIP)<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>, methylation-sensitive restriction enzyme digestion (MRE)<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>, and RNA profiling<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>, each followed by massively-parallel short-read sequencing (-seq). The resulting datasets were assembled into publicly-accessible websites and databases, which serve as a broadly useful resource for the scientific and biomedical community. Here, we report the integrative analysis of 111 reference epigenomes (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref></bold>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Extended Data 1a-d</xref>), which we analyze jointly with an additional 16 epigenomes previously reported by the ENCyclopedia Of DNA Elements (ENCODE) project<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>.</p>
    <p id="P7">We integrate information about histone marks, DNA methylation, DNA accessibility, and RNA expression to infer high-resolution maps of regulatory elements annotated jointly across a total of 127 cell and tissue types. We use these annotations to recognize epigenome differences that arise during lineage specification and cellular differentiation, to recognize modules of regulatory regions with coordinated activity across cell types, and to identify key regulators of these modules based on motif enrichments and regulator expression. In addition, we study the role of regulatory regions in human disease by relating our epigenomic annotations to genetic variants associated with common traits and disorders. These analyses demonstrate the importance and wide applicability of our data resource, and lead to important insights into epigenomics, differentiation, and disease. Specifically:

      <title>1. Reference epigenome mapping across tissues and cell types</title>
      <p id="P15">The Reference Epigenome Mapping Centers generated a total of 2,805 genome-wide datasets, including 1,821 histone modification datasets, 360 DNA accessibility datasets, 277 DNA methylation datasets, and 166 RNA-seq datasets, encompassing a total of 150.21 billion mapped sequencing reads corresponding to 3,174-fold coverage of the human genome.</p>
      <p id="P16">In this manuscript, we focus on a subset of 1,936 datasets (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref></bold>) comprising 111 reference epigenomes (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a-d</xref></bold>), which we define as having a core set of five histone modification marks (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2e</xref></bold>). The five marks consist of: H3K4me3, associated with promoter regions<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>; H3K4me1, associated with enhancer regions<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>; H3K36me3, associated with transcribed regions; H3K27me3, associated with Polycomb repression<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>; and H3K9me3, associated with heterochromatin regions<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup>. Selected epigenomes also contain a subset of additional epigenomic marks, including: acetylation marks H3K27ac and H3K9ac, associated with increased activation of enhancer and promoter regions<sup><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>-<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2f</xref></bold>); DNase hypersensitivity<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>, denoting regions of accessible chromatin commonly associated with regulator binding (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2g</xref></bold>); DNA methylation, typically associated with repressed regulatory regions or active gene transcripts<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> and profiled using whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS)<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>, reduced-representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS)<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>, and mCRF-combined<sup><xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> methylation-sensitive restriction enzyme(MRE)<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> and immuno-precipitation based<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> assays (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2h</xref></bold>); and RNA expression levels<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>, measured using RNA-seq and gene expression microarrays (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2i</xref></bold>). Our definition of 111 reference epigenomes is very similar to that used by the International Human Epigenome Consortium (IHEC), which required RNA-seq, WGBS, and H3K27ac that are only available in a subset of epigenomes here. Lastly, an additional 16 histone modification marks on average were profiled across 7 deeply-covered cell types (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2j</xref></bold>).</p>
      <p id="P17">We jointly processed and analyzed our 111 reference epigenomes with 16 additional epigenomes from ENCODE<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>. We generated genome-wide normalized coverage tracks, peaks and broad enriched domains for ChIP-seq and DNase-seq<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup>, normalized gene expression values for RNA-seq<sup><xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup>, and fractional methylation levels for each CpG site<sup><xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>-<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup>. We computed several quality control measures (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref></bold>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Table S1</xref>) including: number of distinct uniquely mapped reads; the fraction of mapped reads overlapping areas of enrichment<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup>; genome-wide strand cross-correlation<sup><xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup> (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2e-g</xref></bold>); inter-replicate correlation; multidimensional scaling of datasets from different production centers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1</xref>); correlation across pairs of datasets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Extended Data 1e</xref>); consistency between assays carried out in multiple mapping centers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Table S2</xref>); and read mapping quality for bisulfite-treated reads<sup><xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>-<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup>. Outlier datasets were flagged, removed or replaced, and lower-coverage datasets were combined when possible (See Methods).</p>
      <p id="P18">The resulting datasets provide global views of the epigenomic landscape in a wide range of human cell and tissue types (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref></bold>), including: the largest and most diverse collection to date of chromatin state annotations (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref></bold>); some of the deepest surveys of individual cell types using diverse epigenomic assays (with 21-31 distinct epigenomic marks for seven deeply-profiled epigenomes, <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref></bold>); and some of the broadest surveys of individual epigenomic marks across multiple cell types (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref></bold>). These datasets enable genome-wide epigenomic analyses across multiple dimensions (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d</xref></bold>).

      <title>2. Chromatin states display highly specific DNA methylation and accessibility</title>
      <p id="P19">As a foundation for integrative analysis, we learned a common set of combinatorial chromatin states<sup><xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup> across all 111 epigenomes, plus 16 additional epigenomes generated by the ENCODE project (127 epigenomes in total), using the core set of five histone modification marks that were common to all. We learned a 15-state model (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a,b</xref></bold>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Table S3a</xref>) consisting of 8 active states and 7 repressed states (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c</xref></bold>) that were recurrently recovered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Extended Data 2a</xref>), and showed distinct levels of DNA methylation (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4d</xref></bold>), DNA accessibility (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4e</xref></bold>), regulator binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Extended Data 2b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2</xref>), and evolutionary conservation (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4f</xref></bold>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3</xref>). The active states (associated with expressed genes) consist of active TSS-proximal promoter states (TssA, TssAFlnk), a transcribed state at the 5’ and 3’ end of genes showing both promoter and enhancer signatures (TxFlnk), actively-transcribed states (Tx, TxWk), enhancer states (Enh, EnhG), and a state associated with zinc finger protein genes (ZNF/Rpts). The inactive states consist of constitutive heterochromatin (Het), bivalent regulatory states (TssBiv, BivFlnk, EnhBiv), repressed Polycomb states (ReprPC, ReprPCWk), and a quiescent state (Quies) which covers on average 68% of each reference epigenome. Enhancer and promoter states cover approximately 5% of each reference epigenome on average, and show enrichment for evolutionarily-conserved non-coding regions<sup><xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup>.</p>
      <p id="P20">To capture the greater complexity afforded by additional marks, we learned additional chromatin state models in subsets of cell types. In the subset of 98 reference epigenomes that also included H3K27ac data, we also learned an 18-state model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Extended Data 2c</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Table S3b</xref>), enabling us to distinguish enhancer states containing strong H3K27ac signal (EnhA1, EnhA2), which showed higher DNA accessibility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Extended Data 3a</xref>), lower methylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Extended Data 3b</xref>), and higher TF binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Extended Data 2c</xref>) than enhancers lacking H3K27ac. In a subset of 7 epigenomes with an average of 24 epigenomic marks, we learned separate 50-state chromatin state models based on all the available histone marks and DNA accessibility in each epigenome (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4</xref>), which additionally distinguished: a DNase-state with distinct TF binding enrichments (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4f</xref>), including for mediator/cohesin components<sup><xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup> (even though CTCF was not included as an input track to learn the model) and repressor NRSF; transcribed states showing H3K79me1 and H3K79me2 and associated with the 5’ ends of genes and introns; and a large number of putative regulatory and neighboring regions showing diverse acetylation marks even in absence of the H3K4 methylation signatures characteristic of enhancer and promoter regions.</p>
      <p id="P21">We used chromatin states to study the relationship between histone modification patterns, RNA expression levels, DNA methylation, and DNA accessibility. Consistent with previous studies<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>-<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref></sup>, we found low DNA methylation and high accessibility in promoter states, high DNA methylation and low accessibility in transcribed states, and intermediate DNA methylation and accessibility in enhancer states (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4d-e</xref></bold>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Extended Data 3a,b</xref>). These differences in methylation level were stronger for higher-expression genes than for lower-expression genes, leading to a more pronounced DNA methylation profile (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Extended Data 3c</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S5</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Table S4f</xref>). Genes proximal to H3K27ac-marked enhancers show significantly higher expression levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Extended Data 3d</xref>), and conversely, higher-expression genes were significantly more likely to neighbor H3K27ac-containing enhancers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Extended Data 3e</xref>).</p>
      <p id="P22">Chromatin states sometimes captured differences in RNA expression that are missed by DNA methylation or accessibility. For example, TxFlnk, Enh, TssBiv, and BivFlnk states show similar distributions of DNA accessibility but widely differing enrichments for expressed genes (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c,d</xref></bold>). Enh and ReprPC states show intermediate DNA methylation, but very different distributions of DNA accessibility and different enrichments for expressed genes (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c-e</xref></bold>). Lack of DNA methylation, typically associated with de-repression, is associated with both the active TssA promoter state and the bivalent TssBiv and BivFlnk states. Bivalent states TssBiv and BivFlnk also showed overall lower DNA methylation and higher DNA accessibility than enhancer states Enh and EnhG and binding by both activating and repressive regulatory factors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Extended Data 2b</xref>). These results also held for alternate methylation measurement platforms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">Extended Data 4a-c</xref>), and for the 18-state chromatin state model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">Extended Data 4d-e</xref>). Overall, these results highlight the complex relationship between DNA methylation, DNA accessibility, and RNA transcription and the value of interpreting DNA methylation and DNA accessibility in the context of integrated chromatin states that better distinguish active and repressed regions.</p>
      <p id="P23">Given the intermediate methylation levels of tissue-specific enhancer regions, we directly annotated intermediate methylation (IM) regions, based on the complementary DNA methylation assays of MeDIP<sup><xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref></sup> and MRE-Seq<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup> in 19 reference epigenomes and 6 additional samples which had both assays available<sup><xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref></sup>. This resulted in more than 18,000 IM regions, showing 57% CpG methylation on average, that are strongly enriched in genes, enhancer chromatin states (EnhBiv, EnhG, Enh), and evolutionarily-conserved regions. IM was associated with intermediate levels of active histone modification and DNaseI hypersensitivity. Near TSSs, IM correlated with intermediate gene expression, and in exons it was associated with an intermediate level of exon inclusion<sup><xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref></sup>. IM signatures were equally strong within tissue samples, peripheral blood, and purified cell types, suggesting that IM is not simply reflecting differential methylation between cell types, but likely reflects a stable state of cell-to-cell variability within a population of cells of the same type.</p>

    <sec id="S4">
      <title>3. Methylation and mark differences across differentiation and cell types</title>
      <p id="P24">We next studied the relationship between DNA methylation dynamics and histone modifications across 95 epigenomes with methylation data, extending previous studies that focused on individual lineages<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>-<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref></sup>. We found that the distribution of methylation levels for CpGs in some chromatin states varied significantly across tissue and cell types (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4g</xref></bold>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">Extended Data 4f</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Table S4a</xref>). For example: TssAFlnk states are largely unmethylated in terminally-differentiated cells and tissues, but frequently methylated for several pluripotent and ESC-derived cells (Bonferroni-corrected F-test p&lt;.01); Enh and EnhG states are highly methylated in pluripotent cells, but show a broader distribution of intermediate methylation in differentiated cells and tissues (p&lt;.01); EnhBiv states are unmethylated in most primary cells and tissues, but show a broader distribution of methylation levels in pluripotent cells, possibly reflecting cell-to-cell heterogeneity (p&lt;.01); the repressed state ReprPC shows varying methylation levels among epigenomes; the Het state showed high levels of methylation in almost all epigenomes.</p>
      <p id="P25">We also studied DNA methylation changes in three different systems. First, we studied DNA methylation changes during Embryonic Stem Cell (ESC) differentiation<sup><xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>-<xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref></sup>. We identified regions that lost methylation (Differentially Methylated Regions, DMRs, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Table S4c</xref>) upon differentiation of ESCs (E003) to mesodermal (E013), endodermal (E011), and ectodermal (E012) lineages (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4h</xref></bold>). Each lineage showed a largely distinct set of ~2200-4400 DMRs, that are enriched for distinct transcription factor binding events (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4h</xref></bold>, right column)<sup><xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref></sup>, consistent with their distinct developmental regulation. Upon further differentiation, ectodermal DMRs remained hypomethylated in three neural progenitor populations <sup><xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref></sup>, despite the usage of distinct hESC lines, and mesodermal and endodermal DMRs remained highly methylated (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4h</xref></bold>), highlighting the lineage-specific nature of changes in DNA methylation during early differentiation<sup><xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>,<xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref></sup>.</p>
      <p id="P26">Second, we studied DNA methylation changes associated with breast epithelia differentiation<sup><xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref></sup>. Ectoderm to breast epithelia differentiation was dominated by DNA methylation loss (1.3M CpGs lost methylation vs. 0.2M gained), consistent with other primary somatic cell types<sup><xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref></sup>. Distinguishing luminal vs. myoepithelial cells by flow sorting, and comparing a set of DMRs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Table S4d</xref>) defined specifically in epithelial lineages<sup><xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref></sup>, we found differences in nearest-gene enrichments<sup><xref rid="R54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref></sup> (mammary gland epithelium development vs. actin filament bundle, respectively), and differences in motif density (luminal DMRs show greater motif density for 51 TFs and lower for 0 TFs). Proximal DMRs were highly associated with increased transcription, consistent with regulatory element de-repression associated with DNA methylation loss.</p>
      <p id="P27">Third, we asked whether tissue environment or developmental origin is the primary driving factor in DNA methylation differences observed in more differentiated cell types<sup><xref rid="R55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref></sup>, using epigenomes from skin cell types (keratinocytes E057/058, melanocytes E059/E061, and fibroblasts E055/056) that share a common tissue environment but possess distinct embryonic origins (surface ectoderm, neural crest, and mesoderm, respectively). We found that despite the shared tissue environment, these three cell types displayed lower overlap in their DNA methylation and histone modification signatures, and instead were more similar to other cell types with a shared developmental origin. Using a set of DMRs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Table S4e</xref>) defined specifically in the skin cell types<sup><xref rid="R55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref></sup>, keratinocytes shared 1392 (18%) of DMRs with surface ectoderm-derived breast cell types (Hypergeometric P-value&lt;10<sup>−6</sup>), and 97% of these were hypomethylated. These shared DMRs were enriched for regulatory elements and cell-type relevant genes, suggesting a common gene regulatory network and shared signaling pathways and structural components<sup><xref rid="R55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref></sup>. These results suggest that common developmental origin can be a primary determinant of global DNA methylation patterns, and sometimes supersedes the immediate tissue environment in which they are found.</p>
      <p id="P28">In addition, we examined coordinated changes in chromatin marks associated with cellular differentiation<sup><xref rid="R56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref></sup>. We found that enhancers showing coordinated differences in multiple marks are enriched near genes showing common tissue-specific expression, and common knockout phenotypes based on their mouse orthologs. For example, enhancers that showed higher H3K27ac and H3K4me3 (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4i</xref></bold>, Cluster C2) in left ventricle (E095) relative to their ESCs (E003) and mesendodermal (E004) precursor lineages were enriched for heart ventricle expression and cardiac and muscle phenotypes in their mouse orthologs.</p>

      <title>4. Epigenomic dynamics reveal most variable states and distinct chromosomal domains</title>
      <p id="P29">We next sought to characterize the overall variability of each chromatin state across the full range of cell and tissue types. We first evaluated the observed consistency of each chromatin state at any given genomic position across all 127 epigenomes (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a</xref></bold>). We found that H3K4me1-associated states (including TxFlnk, EnhG, EnhBiv, Enh) are the most tissue-specific, with 90% of instances present in at most 5-10 epigenomes, followed by bivalent promoters (TssBiv), and repressed states (ReprPC, Het). In contrast, active promoters (TssA) and transcribed states (Tx, TxWk) were highly constitutive, with 90% of regions marked in as many as 60-75 epigenomes, and quiescent regions (Quies) were the most constitutive, with 90% of Quies regions consistently marked as Quies in most of the 127 epigenomes. These results held in the 18-state chromatin state model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">Extended Data 5a</xref>), and in the subset of highest-quality epigenomes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S6a,b</xref>).</p>
      <p id="P30">Adjusting for the overall coverage and variability of each state, we then studied differences in the relative fraction of the genome annotated to each chromatin state between cell types (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5b</xref></bold>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">Extended Data 5b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S6c-e</xref>). Immune cells show a consistent and previously unrecognized depletion of active and bivalent promoters (TssA, TssBiv) and weakly transcribed states (TxWk), which may be related to their capacity to generate sub-lineages, replicate, and enter quiescence (reversible G0 phase). ESCs and iPSCs show enrichment of TssBiv, consistent with previous studies<sup><xref rid="R57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref></sup>, and a depletion of ReprPCWk (defined by weak H3K27me3), possibly due to restriction of H3K27me3-establishing Polycomb proteins to promoter regions. Surprisingly, IMR90 fetal lung fibroblasts, which were previously used as a somatic reference cell type<sup><xref rid="R58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref></sup> are in fact a strong outlier in multiple ways, showing higher levels of Het, ReprPC and EnhG, and a depletion of Quies chromatin states.</p>
      <p id="P31">We next studied the relative frequency with which different chromatin states switch to other states across different tissues and cell types (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5c</xref></bold>), relative to switching across samples of the same tissue or cell type (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S7a,b</xref>). This revealed a relative switching enrichment between active states and repressed states, consistent with activation and repression of regulatory regions. The only exception was significant switching between transcribed states and active promoter and enhancer states, possibly due to alternative usage of promoters<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> and enhancers<sup><xref rid="R59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref></sup> embedded within transcribed elements. These chromatin state switching properties were also found in the 18-state model incorporating H3K27ac marks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">Extended Data 5c</xref>) and in the subset of 16 ENCODE reference epigenomes using both models (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S7c,d</xref>). We found that enhancers and promoters maintained their identity, except for a small subset of regions switching between enhancer signatures and promoter signatures<sup><xref rid="R60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref></sup>. Luciferase assays showed that these regions indeed possess both enhancer and promoter activity<sup><xref rid="R60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref></sup>, consistent with their epigenomic marks.</p>
      <p id="P32">While our chromatin state analysis focused at the nucleosome resolution (200-bp), we also studied the overall co-occurrence of chromatin states across tissues at a larger 2Mb resolution to recognize higher-order properties (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5d</xref></bold>). This analysis revealed that 2Mb segments rich in active enhancers are constrained to approximately 40% of the genome (clusters c1-c6), with the remainder marked predominantly by inactive regions (c7-c11), consistent with the identification of two large chromatin conformation compartments<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="R61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref></sup>. However, both compartments can be further subdivided by their chromatin state composition: inactive regions separate into predominantly quiescent (40%; c9, c11), heterochromatic (10%, c10), or bivalent (10%, c7-c8) marked regions; and active regions separate into regions rich in multiple marks (c3 and c6, showing a large diversity of active, ReprPC, and bivalent states), weakly-transcribed regions (c5, showing primarily Enh and TxWk states), and regions of intermediate activity (c1, c2, c4). As these subdivisions are based on average state density across a large diversity of cell types, we expected them to be stable chromosomal features, and indeed, they showed strong differences in gene density, CpG island occupancy, lamina association<sup><xref rid="R62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>-<xref rid="R63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref></sup> and cytogenetic bands (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5d</xref></bold>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">Extended Data 5d</xref>).</p>

      <title>5. Relationships between marks and lineages reveal expanded epigenomic space</title>
      <p id="P33">We next used epigenome similarity to study the relationship between tissues and cell types, based on the similarity of diverse histone modification marks evaluated in their relevant chromatin states. Hierarchical clustering of our 111 reference epigenomes using H3K4me1 signal in Enh (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6a</xref></bold>) showed consistent grouping of biologically-similar cell and tissue types, including ESCs, iPSCs, T-cells, B-cells, adult brain, fetal brain, digestive, smooth muscle, and heart. We also found several initially surprising but biologically-meaningful groupings: fetal brain and germinal matrix samples clustered with neural stem cells rather than adult brain, consistent with fetal neural stem cell proliferation; many ES-derived cells clustered with ESCs and iPS cells rather than the corresponding tissues, suggesting that those are still closer to pluripotent states than corresponding somatic states; adult and fetal thymus samples clustered with T-cells rather than other tissues, consistent with roles in T-cell maturation and immunity. Several marks successfully recovered these biological groupings when evaluated in their relevant chromatin states (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S8</xref>), including H3K4me1 in TssA, H3K27me3 in ReprPC state, and H3K27ac in Enh states, suggesting that the signal of each mark in relevant chromatin states is highly indicative of cell type and tissue identity. These alternative clusterings also showed some differences; for example, H3K4me3 in TssA states grouped several fetal samples together with each other, in a cluster sister to ESCs and iPSCs, rather than in separate tissue groups.</p>
      <p id="P34">We applied this approach to compare the Roadmap Epigenomics reference epigenomes with the 16 ENCODE 2012 samples with broad mark coverage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F15">Extended Data 6</xref>). We found that H3K4me1 signal in enhancer chromatin states correctly groups primary cells from similar tissues across the two projects, emphasizing the robustness of our annotations and signal tracks across projects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F15">Extended Data 6a</xref>). For example, epidermal keratinocytes NHEK group with other keratinocytes, mammary epithelial cells HMEC with other skin cells, and skeletal muscle myoblasts HSMM and osteoblasts with bone marrow. Some cancer cell lines also grouped with corresponding primary tissues, including hepatocellular carcinoma HepG2 with liver tissue, primary lung fibroblasts NHLF with the IMR90 lung fibroblast cell line, and T cell leukemia Dnd41 with Thymus, while in other cases cancerous cell lines grouped together, e.g. HeLa-S3 cervical carcinoma with A549 lung carcinoma. Similarly, H3K27me3 signal in Polycomb-repressed states grouped five immortalized cell lines together (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F15">Extended Data 6c</xref>), despite their T-cell, Lung, Cervical, Leukemia, and Hepatocellular origins<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="R64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref></sup>. This larger trees spanning ENCODE 2012 and Roadmap Epigenomics also highlighted the large number of lineages not previously covered by reference epigenomes, including brain, muscle, smooth muscle, heart, mucosa, digestive tract, and fetal tissues.</p>
      <p id="P35">To understand the relationship among different tissue/cell samples beyond the constraints of a tree representation, we also studied the full similarity matrix of each mark in relevant chromatin states (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S9</xref>) and also visualized the principal dimensions of epigenomic variation using multidimensional scaling (MDS) analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S10</xref>). The pairwise similarity matrices of different marks were most effective in distinguishing different subsets of the samples, with H3K4me1 in Enh primarily capturing immune cell similarities, and H3K27me3 in ReprPC capturing pluripotent cell similarities (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S9</xref>). In the MDS analysis, the first four dimensions of variation for most marks separated several major sample groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F16">Extended Data 7a-i</xref>), with some subtle differences between marks. For example, pluripotent cells and immune cells were two strong outliers in the first two dimensions of H3K4me1 variation in Enh (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6b</xref></bold>), but H3K27me3 in ReprPC showed more uniform spreading of reference epigenomes (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6c</xref></bold>), consistent with the coverage distributions of immune and pluripotent cells for the corresponding chromatin states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5b</xref>). For most marks, the first five dimensions captured most of the variance, with additional dimensions capturing only 4-6% for each mark (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F16">Extended Data 7</xref>).</p>

      <title>6. Epigenome dynamics reveal enhancer modules and their putative regulators</title>
      <p id="P36">We next exploited the dynamics of epigenomic modifications at <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements to gain insights into gene regulation. We focused on 2.3M regions (12.6% of the genome) showing DNA accessibility in any reference epigenome and regulatory (promoter or enhancer) chromatin states, considering enhancer-only, promoter-only, or enhancer-promoter alternating states separately (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S11</xref>). We clustered enhancer-only elements (Enh, EnhBiv, EnhG) into 226 enhancer modules of coordinated activity (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7a</xref></bold>), promoter-only elements into 82 promoter modules (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S11a</xref>) and promoter/enhancer ‘dyadic’ elements into 129 modules (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S11b</xref>), enabling us to distinguish ubiquitously-active, lineage-restricted, and tissue-specific modules for each group. Focusing on the enhancer-only clusters, we found that the neighboring genes of enhancers in the same module showed significant enrichment for common functions<sup><xref rid="R65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref></sup> (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7b</xref></bold>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S11c,d</xref>), common genotype-phenotype associations<sup><xref rid="R66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref></sup> (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7c</xref></bold>), and common expression in their mouse orthologs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S12</xref>), each annotation type showing strong consistency with the known biology of the corresponding tissues. For example, stem-cell enhancers are enriched near developmental patterning genes, immune cell enhancers near immune response genes, and brain enhancers near learning and memory genes (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7b</xref></bold>). Sub-clustering of individual modules continued to reveal distinct enrichment patterns of individual sub-modules (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S11e</xref>), suggesting increased diversity of regulatory processes beyond the 226 modules used here.</p>
      <p id="P37">The genome sequence of enhancers in the same module showed substantial enrichment for sequence motifs<sup><xref rid="R67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref></sup> associated with diverse transcription factors (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S13a</xref>). We found 84 significantly enriched motifs in 101 modules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F17">Extended Data 8</xref>), indicating that enhancer modules likely represent co-regulated sets, and proposing candidate upstream regulators for nearly half of all modules. Direct application of the same approach and thresholds to the putative regulatory regions annotated in each of the 111 reference epigenomes led to significant enrichment for only 10 enriched motifs in 15 reference epigenomes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S13b,c</xref>) of which 8 are blood samples, and focusing on the regions unique to each of the 17 tissue groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>) only led to 19 enriched motifs in 10 tissue groups (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S13d,e</xref>), emphasizing the importance of studying regulatory motif enrichments at the level of enhancer modules.</p>
      <p id="P38">We next sought to distinguish likely activator and repressor motifs, by identifying regulators whose expression pattern across cell/tissue types shows a strong (positive or negative) correlation with the activity of enhancers in the enriched module<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>. We focused on the 40 most strongly expression-correlated regulators (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F18">Extended Data 9a</xref>), and used the module-level motif enrichments to link each regulator to the cell/tissue types that define each module (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8</xref></bold>). We found that many of the inferred links correspond to known regulatory relationships, including: OCT4 (also known as POU5F1) in pluripotent cells, HNF1B and HNF4A1 in liver and other digestive tissues, RFX4 in neurosphere and neuronal cells, and MEF2D in muscle. The most enriched regulators showed primarily positive correlations, suggesting they function as transcriptional activators, while a subset of factors showed a negative correlation, with the factor expressed in the lineages where its motif showed enhancer depletion, suggesting a repressive role. For example, REST (also known as NRSF), a known repressor of neuronal lineages was least expressed in neuronal tissues, where its motif was most enriched in enhancers, and a similar signature was found for ZBTB1B, a known repressor of myogenesis and brain development.</p>
      <p id="P39">Regulatory motifs predicted to be drivers of enhancer activity patterns showed significant enrichment in tissue-specific high-resolution (6bp-40bp) DNase digital genomic footprints (DGF)<sup><xref rid="R68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref></sup> in matching cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F18">Extended Data 9b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Table S5b</xref>), providing DNA accessibility evidence that the motifs are indeed bound in these cell types. In addition, they showed positional bias relative to both the center of DGF locations, and relative to their boundaries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F19">Extended Data 10</xref>), a property not found for shuffled motifs<sup><xref rid="R69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref></sup>. These positional biases were highly tissue- and cell type-specific for most activating factors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F18">Extended Data 9c</xref>), including POU5F in iPSCs, MEF2D in heart, HNF1B in GI tissues, BHLH in brain, SPI1 in immune cells, and MEF2 in heart and muscle, in each case matching the tissues that showed the highest enrichment. In contrast, for repressive factors and CTCF, positional biases were found in large numbers of tissues, even when the motifs were not enriched in active enhancers. For example, REST (NRSF) was positionally biased in DGF sites in nearly all tissues except brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F18">Extended Data 9c</xref>), even though it was only enriched in active enhancers in brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F18">Extended Data 9a</xref>), consistent with widespread repressive binding in non-brain tissues.</p>
      <p id="P40">Overall, these enhancer modules, motif enrichments, and regulatory predictions provide an unbiased map that can help guide studies of candidate master regulators for fetal and adult lineage establishment and cell type identity.</p>

      <title>7. Impact of DNA sequence and genetic variation on epigenomic state</title>
      <p id="P41">We next studied the impact of primary DNA sequence on the epigenomic landscape, across genomic regions and between the two alleles of a given individual. First, we evaluated whether histone modifications and DNA methylation can be predicted by the underlying DNA sequence using DNA motifs for TFs expressed in ESCs and four ES-derived cell types. Using the area under the receiver operating curve (AUROC), we found between 71% predictive power for H3K4me1 peaks and 98% for H3K4me3 peaks (average of 85% across six marks and methylation-depleted regions)<sup><xref rid="R70" ref-type="bibr">70</xref></sup>. The most predictive motifs were those of factors associated with specific histone modifications or specific cell-types, and were found within peak regions enriched for chromatin marks and at their boundaries. As an example of a boundary enrichment, H3K4me3 peaks were flanked by motifs consisting of a continuous stretch of A and T followed by a G and C cap, which may play a role in nucleosome positioning or recruiting promoter-associated TFs, such as nuclear receptors. Enhancer and promoter-predictive motifs were enriched in high-resolution DNase hypersensitive sites (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Table S5a</xref>), suggesting they correspond to TF-bound sequences.</p>
      <p id="P42">Second, we studied how sequence variants between the two alleles of the same individual can lead to allelic biases in histone modifications, DNA methylation, and transcript levels. We reconstructed chromosome-spanning haplotypes for ESCs, four ESC-derived cell lines<sup><xref rid="R71" ref-type="bibr">71</xref></sup> and 20 tissue samples<sup><xref rid="R60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref></sup>, and we resolved allele-specific activity and structure for each. We found widespread allelic bias in both transcript levels and epigenomic marks for each epigenome. For example, 24% of all testable genes that contain exonic variants demonstrate allelic transcription in one or more ESC or ESC-derived cell lineages, and the majority of these genes also exhibit allelic epigenomic modifications in promoters (71%) and Hi-C-linked enhancers (69%)<sup><xref rid="R71" ref-type="bibr">71</xref></sup>. Similarly, as many as 11% of the testable enhancers display allelic bias in histone modification H3K27ac in the 20 tissue samples with allele-resolved transcription and chromatin states<sup><xref rid="R60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref></sup>. Allelic histone acetylation at enhancers is highly specific to individual genotypes, and often occurs near sequence variants that alter transcription factor binding, suggesting <italic>cis</italic>-acting sequence drivers<sup><xref rid="R60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>,<xref rid="R71" ref-type="bibr">71</xref></sup>.</p>

      <title>8. Complex trait variants are enriched in diverse epigenomic marks</title>
      <p id="P43">We next used our tissue-specific epigenomic datasets to study the regulatory annotation enrichments of phenotype-associated variants from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of diverse traits and disorders. Previous studies showed that disease-associated variants are enriched in specific regulatory chromatin states<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>, evolutionarily-conserved elements<sup><xref rid="R72" ref-type="bibr">72</xref></sup>, histone marks<sup><xref rid="R73" ref-type="bibr">73</xref></sup>, and accessible regions<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>. We expanded these analyses using the diversity of primary tissues surveyed by our epigenomic maps, applied to a compendium of disease-associated variants from the NHGRI GWAS catalog<sup><xref rid="R74" ref-type="bibr">74</xref></sup>. We intersected the set of variants identified in each curated study with peaks of H3K4me1, H3K4me3, H3K36me3, H3K27me3, and H3K9me3 across each of the 127 epigenomes, and H3K27ac, H3K9ac, and DNase when available (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F20">Extended Data 11</xref>-<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F21">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8">Table S6</xref>), and we searched for significant enrichment in their overlap relative to what would be expected given the NHGRI GWAS catalog as background (see Methods).</p>
      <p id="P44">For enhancer-associated H3K4me1 peaks, we found 58 studies (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Fig. 9a</xref></bold>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F20">Extended Data 11a</xref>) with significant enrichments in at least one tissue at 2% FDR (Hypergeometric P&lt;10<sup>−3.9</sup>). Upon manual curation, the enriched cell types were consistent with our current understanding of disease-relevant tissues for the vast majority of cases. For example, diverse immune traits were enriched in immune cell enhancers, including rheumatoid arthritis, celiac disease, type 1 diabetes, systemic lupus erythematosus, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, allergy, multiple sclerosis, and Graves’ disease<sup><xref rid="R75" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>-<xref rid="R81" ref-type="bibr">81</xref></sup>. A large number of metabolic trait variants are enriched in liver enhancer marks, including LDL, HDL, total cholesterol, lipid metabolism phenotypes, and metabolite levels<sup><xref rid="R82" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>-<xref rid="R83" ref-type="bibr">83</xref></sup>. Fasting glucose was most enriched for pancreatic islet enhancer marks, and insulin-like growth factors in placenta, consistent with their endocrine regulatory roles<sup><xref rid="R84" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>-<xref rid="R85" ref-type="bibr">85</xref></sup>. Several cardiac traits were enriched in heart tissue enhancers, including the PR heart repolarization interval, blood pressure, and aortic root size. Interestingly, inflammatory bowel disease and ulcerative colitis variants show enrichment in both immune and gastrointestinal enhancer marks, suggesting dysregulation of both organs may underlie disease predisposition. Both attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and adiponectin levels were enriched in brain regions, consistent with causal roles in brain dysregulation<sup><xref rid="R86" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>-<xref rid="R87" ref-type="bibr">87</xref></sup>. In contrast, late-onset Alzheimer's disease variants were enriched in immune cell enhancers, rather than brain, consistent with recent evidence of a possible immune and inflammatory basis<sup><xref rid="R88" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>-<xref rid="R90" ref-type="bibr">90</xref></sup>.</p>
      <p id="P45">For active enhancer-associated H3K27ac peaks (available in 98 cell types), we found a similar number of enriched studies (47 at 2% FDR, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F21">Extended Data 12b</xref>), but for promoter-associated H3K4me3 and H3K9ac peaks, we found only 25 and 18 enriched studies, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F21">Extended Data 12a,b</xref>), suggesting that enhancer-associated marks are more informative for tissue-specific disease enrichments than promoter-associated marks. For DNase peaks, we only found 9 enriched studies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F21">Extended Data 12c</xref>), partly because they were only available in 53 reference epigenomes (restricting H3K4me1 to the same 53 resulted in 25 enriched studies, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8">Table S6</xref>), and possibly due to lack of distinction between enhancer and promoter regions. For transcription-associated H3K36me3, we found 15 enriched studies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F21">Extended Data 12d</xref>), indicating that these help capture additional biologically-meaningful variants outside annotated promoter and enhancer regions. In contrast, we found no enriched study for either Polycomb-associated H3K27me3 peaks or heterochromatin-associated H3K9me3 peaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F21">Extended Data 12e,f</xref>). These results indicate that enhancer-associated marks have the greatest ability to distinguish tissue-specific enrichments for regulatory regions, but promoter-, open-chromatin-, and transcription-association marks are also significantly enriched, indicating that disease variants affect a wide range of processes.</p>

    <title>Discussion</title>
    <p id="P47">The Reference Epigenome Mapping Consortium has been working to improve epigenomic assays, generate reference epigenomic maps, and use them to understand gene regulation, differentiation, reprogramming, and human disease (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.roadmapepigenomics.org/publications">http://www.roadmapepigenomics.org/publications</ext-link>). This paper constitutes the first integrative analysis of all the reference epigenomes generated by the consortium, and represents an early component of the International Human Epigenome Consortium (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ihec-epigenomes.org/">http://ihec-epigenomes.org/</ext-link>) which seeks to extend such epigenomic maps to more than a thousand reference human epigenomes<sup><xref rid="R93" ref-type="bibr">93</xref></sup>.</p>
    <p id="P48">In this paper, we use this resource to gain insights into the epigenomic landscape, its dynamics across cell types, tissues, and development, and its regulatory circuitry. We find that combinations of histone modification marks are highly informative of the methylation and accessibility levels of different genomic regions, while the converse is not always true. Genomic regions vary greatly in their association with active marks, with approximately 5% of each epigenome marked by enhancer or promoter signatures on average, which show increased association with expressed genes, and increased evolutionary conservation, while two thirds of each reference epigenome on average are quiescent, and enriched in gene-poor and nuclear lamina-associated stably-repressed regions. Even though promoter and transcription associated marks are less dynamic than enhancer mark, each mark recovers biologically-meaningful cell type groupings when evaluated in relevant chromatin states, allowing a data-driven approach to learn relationships between cell types, tissues, and lineages. The coordinated activity patterns of enhancer regions enable us to cluster them into co-regulated modules, which are proximal to genes with common functions and phenotypes and enriched in regulatory motifs, enabling us to predict candidate upstream regulators.</p>
    <p id="P49">We also demonstrate the usefulness of the resulting regulatory annotations for interpreting human genetic variation and disease. In an unbiased sampling across the GWAS catalog, we find that genetic variants associated with complex traits are highly enriched in epigenomic annotations of trait-relevant tissues, providing mechanistic insights on the likely relevant cell types underlying genome-wide significant loci. The GWAS enrichments in our analysis were strongest for enhancer-associated marks, consistent with their highly tissue-specific nature. However, promoter-associated and transcription-associated marks were also enriched, implicating several gene-regulatory levels as underlying genetic variants associated with complex traits. These results suggest that our datasets will be valuable in the study of human disease, as several companion papers explore in the context of autoimmune disorders<sup><xref rid="R94" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>-<xref rid="R95" ref-type="bibr">95</xref></sup>, Alzheimer's Disease<sup><xref rid="R90" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>,<xref rid="R96" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>-<xref rid="R97" ref-type="bibr">97</xref></sup> and cancer<sup><xref rid="R98" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>-<xref rid="R99" ref-type="bibr">99</xref></sup>.</p>
    <p id="P50">Overall, our epigenomic datasets, regulatory annotations, and integrative analyses have resulted in the most comprehensive map of the human epigenomic landscape to date across the largest collection of primary cells and tissues. We expect this map will be of broad use to the scientific and biomedical communities, for studies of genome interpretation, gene regulation, cellular differentiation, genome evolution, genetic variation, and human disease.</p>

          <p id="P56">The raw Release 9 read alignment files contain reads that are pre-extended to 200 bp. However, there were significant differences in the original read lengths across the Release 9 raw datasets reflecting differences between centers and changes of sequencing technology during the course of the project (36 bp, 50 bp, 76 bp and 100 bp). To avoid artificial differences due to mappability, for each consolidated dataset, the raw mapped reads were uniformly truncated to 36 bp and then refiltered using a 36 bp custom mappability track to only retain reads that map to positions (taking strand into account) at which the corresponding 36-mers starting at those positions are unique in the genome. Filtered datasets were then merged across technical/biological replicates, and where necessary to obtain a single consolidated sample for every histone mark or DNase-seq in each standardized epigenome. <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Table S1</xref></bold>. summarizes the mapping of the individual Release 9 primary data sample files to the consolidated data files corresponding to the 127 consolidated reference epigenomes.</p>

For the 7 deeply-profiled reference epigenomes (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2j</xref></bold>), histone mark datasets were subsampled to a maximum of 45 million reads (median depth).

          <p id="P59">For DNase-seq data, we used two methods to identify DNaseI-accessible sites.

          <title>d. Genome-wide signal coverage tracks</title>
          <p id="P61">We used the signal processing engine of the <bold>MACSv2.0.10</bold> peak caller to generate genome-wide signal coverage tracks. Whole cell extract was used as a control for signal normalization for the histone ChIP-seq coverage. Each DNase-seq dataset was normalized using simulated background datasets generated by uniformly distributing equivalent number of reads across the mappable genome. We generated 2 types of tracks that use different statistics based on a Poisson background model to represent per-base signal scores. Briefly, reads are extended in the 5’ to 3’ direction by the estimated fragment length. At each base, the observed counts of ChIP-seq/DNaseI-seq extended reads overlapping the base are compared to corresponding dynamic expected background counts (<italic>λ<sub>local</sub></italic>) estimated from the control dataset. <italic>λ<sub>local</sub></italic> is defined as <italic>max(λ<sub>BG</sub>, λ<sub>1K</sub>, λ<sub>5K</sub>, λ<sub>10K</sub>)</italic> where <italic>λ<sub>BG</sub></italic> is the expected counts per base assuming a uniform distribution of control reads across all mappable bases in the genome and <italic>λ<sub>1K</sub>, λ<sub>5K</sub>, λ<sub>10K</sub></italic> are expected counts estimated from the 1 kb, 5 kb and 10 kb window centered at the base. <italic>λ<sub>local</sub></italic> is adjusted for the ratio of the sequencing depth of ChIP-seq/DNase-seq dataset relative to the control dataset. The two types of signal score statistics computed per base are as follows.</p>
          <p id="P62">(1) <bold>Fold-enrichment</bold> ratio of ChIP-seq or DNase counts relative to expected background counts <italic>λ<sub>local</sub></italic>. These scores provide a direct measure of the <bold>effect size</bold> of enrichment at any base in the genome. (2) negative log10 of the <bold>Poisson <italic>p</italic>-value</bold> of ChIP-seq or DNase counts relative to expected background counts <italic>λ<sub>local</sub></italic>. These <bold>signal confidence scores</bold> provides a measure of <bold>statistical significance</bold> of the observed enrichment.</p>
          <p id="P63">The -log10(<italic>p</italic>-value) scores provide a convenient way to threshold signal (e.g. 2 corresponds to a <italic>p</italic>-value threshold of 1e-2), similar to what is used in identifying enriched regions (peak calling). We recommend using the signal confidence score tracks for visualization. A universal threshold of 2 provides good separation between signal and noise. Both types of signal tracks were also generated for the unconsolidated datasets using the same parameter settings described above.</p>

          <p id="P64">For the primary Release 9 datasets, data quality enrichment scores were computed as the fraction of the uniquely mapped reads overlapping with areas of enrichment. Several methods were employed to select signal enrichment regions. The <bold>SPOT quality score</bold> was computed based on regions identified with the HotSpot peak caller<sup><xref rid="R103" ref-type="bibr">103</xref></sup>; the <bold>FindPeaks quality score</bold> was inferred based on peak calls made using the FindPeaks<sup><xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup> software; finally, a <bold>Poisson metric</bold> was derived by modeling the read distribution in genome-tiling 1000 basepair windows with a Poisson process and selecting as enriched regions windows with <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05. All the quality scores in Release 9 are in agreement, with strong pairwise correlation (Pearson correlation &gt; 0.9). <bold>Concordance between centers</bold> was confirmed and data analysis pipeline was validated at the outset of the project using datasets for the H1 cell line. The same pipeline was subsequently used to produce Release 9 data. ChIP-seq data for 6 histone modifications (H3K4me3, H3K27me3, H3K9ac, H3K9me3, H3K36me3, and H3K4me1) were independently generated for the H1 cell line by three REMCs (Broad, UCSD, UCSF-UBC). To quantify concordance, the reads from each experiment were mapped (Level 1 data), read density tracks (Level 2 data) were generated using the EDACC's primary data processing pipeline, and finally Pearson correlation coefficients were computed between each pair of experiments, as well as between experiments and H1 input acting as a control for background correlation between signals (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Table S2</xref></bold>).

For each consolidated ChIP-seq dataset, read counts were computed in non-overlapping 200 bp bins across the entire genome. Each bin was discretized into two levels, 1 indicating enrichment and 0 indicating no enrichment. The binarization was performed by comparing ChIP-seq read counts to corresponding whole-cell extract control read counts within each bin and using a Poisson <italic>p</italic>-value threshold of 1e-4 (the default discretization threshold in ChromHMM). We trained several models with the number of states ranging from 10 states to 25 states.

        <p id="P72">For any set of genomic coordinates representing a genomic feature and a given state, the fold enrichment of overlap is calculated as the ratio of “the joint probability of a region belonging to the state and the feature” vs. “the product of independent marginal probability of observing the state in the genome” times “the probability of of observing the feature”, namely the ratio between the (#bases in state AND overlap feature)/(#bases in genome) and the [(#bases overlap feature)/(#bases in genome) X (#bases in state)/(#bases in genome)]. The neighborhood enrichment is computed for genomic bins around a set of single base pair anchor locations in the genome e.g. transcription start sites.</p>
        <p id="P73">For the <bold>overlap enrichment</bold> plots in the figures, the enrichments for each genomic feature (column) across all states is normalized by subtracting the minimum value from the column and then dividing by the max of the column. So the values always range from 0 (white) to 1 (dark blue) i.e. its a column wise relative scale. For the <bold>neighborhood positional enrichment</bold> plots, the normalization is done across all columns i.e. the minimum value over the entire matrix is subtracted from each value and divided by the maximum over the entire matrix.</p>
        <p id="P74">The <bold>functional annotations</bold> used were as follows (All coordinates were relative to the hg19 version of the human genome): (1) CpG islands obtained from the UCSC table browser.

A gaussian mixture model with 2 components was fit on expression levels of all genes to obtain thresholds for the two classes. (4) Zinc finger genes (obtained by searching the ENSEMBL annotation for genes with gene names starting with ZNF).

        <p id="P80">For each state <italic><bold>s</bold></italic> for the core 15 state joint model, we computed the number of genomic bins that were labeled with that state in at least one epigenome (<italic><bold>G<sub>s</sub></bold></italic>). From amongst these bins we counted the number of bins (<italic><bold>g<sub>s,i</sub></bold></italic>) that were labeled as being in state <italic><bold>s</bold></italic> in exactly <italic><bold>i</bold></italic> epigenomes (i=1..127). We converted these counts to fractions (<italic><bold>g<sub>s,i</sub></bold></italic> / <italic><bold>G<sub>s</sub></bold></italic>) and computed the cumulative fraction that is consistently labeled with the same chromatin state in at most <italic><bold>N</bold></italic> epigenomes (N=1..127). States whose cumulative fractions rise faster than others represent those that are less constitutive (more variable). We repeated the same procedure restricted to 43 high quality and non-redundant Roadmap epigenomes (using only 1 representative epigenome from those corresponding to the ESC lines, iPS lines or epigenomes for the same tissue type from different individuals and excluding ENCODE cell-lines) (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Table S1</xref></bold> - Sheet VariationAnalysis) (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S6a</xref></bold>).

        <p id="P81">The observed cumulative fractions of cell-type specificity are a function of the composition of cell-types in the compendium and do depend to some extent on the variability of data quality for the different marks. For example, the enhancer mark (H3K4me1) does have a much better signal-to-noise ratio than the transcribed mark (H3K36me3). One might expect this to result in more spurious variation of states associated with the transcribed mark. However, contrary to this expectation, the cumulative fractions for states involving only the transcription mark (Tx and TxWk) and not the enhancer mark indicate that these states are in fact less variable and more constitutive across cell types. On the other hand, all states composed of the enhancer mark (H3K4me1), irrespective of whether they do (TxFlnk, EnhG) or do not (EnhBiv, Enh, BivFlnk, TssAFlnk) include the transcription mark (H3K36me3), are far more cell-type specific. These observation indicate that the increased variability of states are largely due to the enhancer mark (H3K4me1) than the transcribed mark (H3K36me3). As replicates are not available in all epigenomes, we did not correct for inter-replicate variation in this analysis, but in the state switching analysis below, we utilize samples from the same tissue as quasi-replicates.</p>

        <p id="P82">To avoid spurious switching due to differences in data quality, we restricted this analysis to chromatin states from the 43 high quality and non-redundant Roadmap epigenomes (see above). Using the 15 state primary model, we computed the empirical switching frequency of any pair of states across all pairs of 43 epigenomes. For a given pair of states A and B, we counted the number of genomic bins that were labeled as (A,B) or (B,A) in all pairs of epigenomes. The switching frequency matrix (which is symmetric) was then row-normalized in order to convert the switching frequencies to switching probabilities. This is done to avoid a dependence on the total number of epigenomes. Also, the switching probabilities unlike switching frequencies are not dominated by states that are highly prevalent (e.g. quiescent state). <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S7b</xref></bold>. shows the empirical switching probabilities for all pairs of states across the 43 epigenomes. In order to differentiate between chromatin state dynamics across tissues (inter-tissue) relative to variation of states across individuals or replicates from the same tissue (intra-tissue), we also computed analogous switching frequencies by restricting to subgroups of epigenomes from the same tissue type (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Table S1</xref></bold> - Sheet VariationAnalysis).

      <p id="P92">For each of the 39 Roadmap reference epigenomes with DNase data, peak positions are combined across reference epigenomes by defining peak island areas, defined by stacking all DNase peak positions across epigenomes, and considering the Full Width at Half Maximum (FWHM). Note that for this we are only considering peak locations, not intensities. The goal of this is to obtain an estimate of the area of open chromatin, not to quantify the level of ‘openness’, as these data are not available for all reference epigenomes. In cases when peak islands overlap, they are merged because it means that the original DNase peak area populations overlap at least for half of the epigenomes with DNase peaks in that area (given the FWHM approach). Peak island summits are defined as the median peak summit of all peak island member DNase peaks. This results in a total of 3,516,964 DNase enriched regions across epigenomes.</p>
      <p id="P93">We then annotate each of the ~3.5M DNase peaks with the chromatin states they overlap with in each of the 111 Roadmap reference epigenomes, using the core 15-state chromatin state model, and focusing on states TssA, TssAFlnk, and TssBiv for promoters, and EnhG, Enh, and EnhBiv for enhancers, and state BivFlnk (flanking bivalent Enh/Tss) for ambiguous regions. Out of these, ~2.5M regions are called as either enhancer or promoter across any of the 111 Roadmap reference epigenomes. Note that because DNase data is not available for all Roadmap epigenomes, the set of regulatory regions defined may exclude DNase regions active in cell types for which DNase was not profiled (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2g</xref>). Although most regions are undisputedly called exclusively promoter or enhancer, there are ~530k regions that needed further study to decide whether they should be called promoters, enhancers, or both (‘dyadic’). We arbitrate on these regions by first clustering them (using the methods in the following section) with an expected cluster size of 10,000 regions, and then for each cluster calculating (a) the mean posterior probabilities for promoter and enhancer calls separately, and (b) the mean number of reference epigenomes in which regions were called promoter or enhancer. Clusters of regions for which the differences in mean posterior probabilities (a) is smaller than 0.05, <italic>or</italic> for which the absolute log2-ratio of the number of epigenomes called as promoter or enhancer (b) is smaller than 0.05 are called true ‘dyadic’ regions, along with a small number of ‘ambiguous’ regions in state BivFlnk. Note that this particular clustering is only to arbitrate on these regions using group statistics instead of one-by-one; the final clusterings are described next. Overall, we define ~2.3M putative enhancer regions (12.63% of genome), ~80k promoter regions (1.44% of genome) and ~130k dyadic regions (0.99% of genome), showing either promoter or enhancer signatures across epigenomes.</p>

We do this using a weighted bag-of-words approach to select highly-enriched terms that contain many words that are overrepresented in gene-set labels showing similar enrichment patterns. Briefly, sliding along the row names (gene-set terms) of the, diagonalized, enrichment matrices, we collect word counts and multiply these by integer-rounded -log10(q-values) obtained from GREAT. We do this in sliding windows of size 33 for <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7b</xref></bold> (resulting in 35 terms) and size 16 for <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7c</xref></bold> (resulting in 15 terms). For each word in a window, these values are expressed relative to the same words across all row names, registering to what extend they are over-represented. Each gene-set term in the window is then assigned a score based on the mean over-representation of all words it consists of. Lastly, gene-sets are co-ranked based on this mean over-representation and their GREAT significance. The best-ranked gene set label is selected as the representative label for that window.

      <p id="P101">We compute an expression score for each enhancer module and transcription factor as the Pearson correlation between the TF expression across cell types with expression data (quantile-normalized log(RPKM) with zeros replaced by log(0.0005)) and the ‘center’ of a module. For each enhancer module, its center is defined as a vector of length 111, containing the fraction of regions in that module called as (any type of) enhancer in each of the 111 epigenomes analyzed. This expression score is meant to act as the “expression” of a transcription factor within a module of cell types. We then compute an expression-enrichment value for each transcription factor as the correlation of this expression score and the enrichment of the corresponding motif across enhancer modules. The top 40 motifs in terms of their absolute expression-enrichment correlation and the clusters with log2 enrichment or depletion of at least log2=1.5 for at least one motif are shown in <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8</xref></bold> and <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F17">Extended Data 8a</xref></bold> (only one motif is shown in <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8</xref></bold> for each factor).</p>

For each driver TF motif, we generated two views corresponding to the motif position (the center of the motif instance) relative to the center of closest DGF site (center view) and the motif position relative to the boundary of closest DGF site (boundary view). We only consider the motif instances with closest DGF site within 100bp. For center view, we plotted the motif occurrence density respect to the distance to DGF center for different cell type. For the boundary view, we considered the shortest distance of the center of a motif instance to the both side of DGF boundary, and gave a negative distance value if the motif instance is inside the DGF, otherwise the distance value is positive. Similar to center view, we plot the motif density respect to the derived distance value in the boundary view for each cell type.</p>
      <p id="P106">To access the significance of the motif concentration within DGF in each cell type, we compute the DGF enrichment ratio as the ratio between the number of motif instance with distance less than 20bp to the DGF center and that number in the immediate flanking window, that is, the number of motif instance with distance to the DGF center larger than 20bp and smaller than 40bp. As control, we randomly sampled the same number of motif instances from the shuffled versions of the given motif, and obtained the DGF enrichment ratio for the shuffled motif instances. The DGF enrichment ratio of the true motif is further converted to z-score by mean and standard deviation from the DGF enrichment ratios of shuffled motif from 1000 times random sampling. Then the adjusted p-value is further computed from z-score and bonferroni correction for number of cell types.</p>

This was done in three cell types where both DGF and predictive motifs were available: ‘H1 BMP4 Derived Mesendoderm Cultured Cells’ (E004), ‘H1 BMP4 Derived Trophoblast Cultured Cells’ (E005), and ‘H1 Derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells’ (E006). The motifs that were predictive of the following seven modifications were considered: H3K27me3, H3K27ac, H3K9me3, H3K36me3, H3K4me1, H3K4me3 and DNA methylation valleys (DMV)<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>. To identify overlaps the predictive motifs were scanned against the modification peaks of the corresponding modification and the location of the best match between motif and sequence was recorded. Then we counted the number of times the locations of the best motif matches overlapped a DGF by at least one bp. These counts were compared to the number of overlaps identified randomly, which was calculated by comparing DGF to random locations within the modifications peaks. The reported random frequency was the average of 100 repeats. To calculate the fold enrichment we divided the observed frequency by the random frequency.</p>

We restricted the enrichment analysis to chr1-22 and chrX. We defined a study to be a unique combination of annotated trait and pubMedID. To reduce dependencies between pairs of SNPs assigned to the same study, we pruned SNPs such that no two SNPs were within 1MB of each other on the same chromosome. The pruning procedure considered each SNP in ranked order of p-value with the the most significant coming first, and we retained a SNP if there was no already retained SNP on the same chromosome within 1MB. We computed hypergeometric p-values for the enrichment of each pruned set of SNPs overlapping peak calls against the pruned GWAS catalog as the background. We estimated separately for each mark a mapping from a p-value to a false discovery rate across tests for all study and reference epigenome combinations by generating 100 randomized versions of the pruned GWAS catalogs shuffling which SNPs were assigned to which study and computing the average fraction of reference epigenome–study combinations that reached that level of significance (in a continuous mapping of p-values to FDR) using randomized catalogs divided by the number based on the actual GWAS catalog.</p>

Chromatin state model robustness.</bold> Clustering of 15-state ‘core’ chromatin state model learned jointly across reference epigenomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>) with chromatin state models learned independently in 111 reference epigenomes. We applied ChromHMM to learn a 15-state ChromHMM model using the five core marks in each of the 111 reference epigenomes generated by the Roadmap Epigenomics program, and clustered the resulting 1680 state emission probability vectors (leaves of the tree) with the 15 states from the joint model (indicated by arrows). We found that the vast majority of states learned across cell types clustered into 15 clusters, corresponding to the joint model states, validating the robustness of chromatin states across cell types. This analysis revealed two new clusters (red crosses) which are not represented in the 15 states of the jointly-learned model: ‘HetWk’, a cluster showing weak enrichment for H3K9me3; and ‘Rpts’, a cluster showing H3K9me3 along with a diversity of other marks, and enriched in specific types of repetitive elements (satellite repeats) in each cell type, which may be due to mapping artifacts. This joint clustering also revealed subtle variations in the relative intensity of H3K4me1 in states TxFlnk, Enh, and TssBiv, and H3K27me3 in state TssBiv. Overall, this analysis confirms that the 15-state chromatin state model based on the core set of five marks provides a robust framework for interpreting epigenomic complexity across tissues and cell types. b.
