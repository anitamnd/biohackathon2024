      <p>warpDOCK is an open-source pipeline for virtual small-molecule
drug discovery using cloud infrastructure. warpDOCK is designed from
the ground up for the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI), enabling
harmonious parallelism of docking calculations over thousands to hundreds
of thousands of cores. This enables cost-effective sampling of ultra-large
chemical libraries, potentially reducing the time to identify lead
drug candidates by orders of magnitude. By utilizing established docking
software and automating each step of the process, warpDOCK makes large-scale
virtual screening accessible to a broad user group. The warpDOCK code
can be found at the BruningLab GitHub repository (<uri xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://github.com/BruningLab/warpDOCK">https://github.com/BruningLab/warpDOCK</uri>).</p>

    <title>Introduction</title>
    <p>Recent advances in virtual screening programs
and approaches have
enabled the discovery of promising new drug candidates.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>−<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref></sup> Traditionally, modest virtual screening experiments (up to 3–5
million compounds) have been performed using onsite high-performance
computing clusters, typically requiring days to weeks of computation
time.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref></sup> Recently, an increasing number of published
studies have performed large-scale virtual screens using chemical
libraries of more than 100 million,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref></sup> or even a billion ligands.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref></sup> However, to perform such screens, access to considerable computational
resources, experience in managing HPC clusters, and scripting knowledge
are essential—a limiting factor for most prospective users.
The benefit of upscaling CPU cores is clear when considering that
the overall computation time (<italic>T</italic>) of a virtual screen
is proportional to the number of ligands (<italic>N</italic>), processing
time per ligand (<italic>P</italic>), and the number of cores (<italic>C</italic>) available<disp-formula id="eq1"><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="ao3c02249_m001" position="anchor"/><label>1</label></disp-formula></p>
    <p>For example, on a modern desktop PC
with 8 cores, it would take
approximately 4 years to screen 100 million ligands, assuming a typical
processing time of 10 s per ligand, which is not practical. Compared
to onsite HPCs, cloud computing is advantageous as the user has access
to virtual and bare-metal machines, enormous core scalability, and
data storage. Cloud infrastructure is also globally accessible and
does not require prior HPC experience. Therefore, incorporating cloud
infrastructures with large-scale virtual screening is beneficial for
the broader scientific community, enabling increased access and usability
for this powerful drug discovery approach.</p>
    <p>Here, we introduce
warpDOCK, an open-source pipeline for virtual
screening using cloud network infrastructure (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref></xref>). To provide a smooth user experience and
best performance, we designed warpDOCK for the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure
(OCI) and automated tasks that would otherwise be complex and time-consuming
with subsidiary programs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>; <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="other">Table <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="other">1</xref></xref>). Because of the design architecture of the queue-engine, warpDOCK
offers practically limitless scaling capabilities whilst maintaining
the maximum efficiency of docking calculations on all CPU cores across
all compute instances, and is compatible with multiple different docking
algorithms. As an exercise to demonstrate the capabilities and cost-effectiveness
of the pipeline and to compute behavioral characteristics, we performed
a virtual screen against AmpC β-lactamase (PDB: <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="PDB" xlink:href="1L2S">1L2S</ext-link>) from <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> using 1.28 million ligands and a
large-scale ensemble virtual screen with over 100 million docking
calculations against <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic><sc>d</sc>-alanine–<sc>d</sc>-alanine ligase (<italic>Sa</italic>Ddl; PDB: <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="PDB" xlink:href="7U9K">7U9K</ext-link>). Collectively, these exercises demonstrate that the warpDOCK platform
is accessible, cost-effective, and simple to use.</p>

from the ZINC database in the PDBQT format (3D) and imported into

proportional to the number of compute instances. Docking calculations
are performed on compute instances and are managed by the queue engine.

        <p>Schematic architecture of warpDOCK on the Oracle Cloud
Infrastructure
(OCI). The framework is hosted within the user’s private-subnet
of the VCN. To access the private-subnet, the user first uses SSH
to access the Bastion login node in the public-subnet from a local
machine with the private key file. The Bastion login node is used
as a lily pad into the private-subnet using SSH and the private key
file. In the private-subnet, all operations are managed from the Control
node. In the private-subnet, compute instances are launched together
as an instance pool. Each instance is installed with a custom image
and has the same shape configuration. The custom image is cloned from
a base canonical Ubuntu OS installed with warpDOCK, Qvina2, and dependencies.
The custom image is permanently mounted to block storage devices via
the NFS server. Thus, all operations can be managed harmoniously.</p>

    <title>Results and Discussion</title>
    <p>In cloud environments, a computer
(“shape” according
to OCI terminology) is launched as an object called an “instance”,
having varied core allocations and memory. Depending on the task,
the number of instances could vary significantly, but this creates
complexity as jobs must be managed harmoniously between cores and
simultaneously between instances. Because the docking calculation
time per ligand is not consistent, core utilization can drop if the
next ligand is not pre-loaded. Rather than using BASH shell scripting
to load ligands,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref></sup> which is computationally
expensive (thus affecting process loading time), we developed the
warpDOCK queue-engine in python (<uri xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://www.python.org/">https://www.python.org/</uri>) to circumvent this issue. Here, the
queue-engine actively monitors the number of docking calculations
allocated to each core, and if the values drop below a threshold,
a new ligand is loaded to the queue from a pre-partitioned chemical
library sub-folder. The number of compounds in the sub-folder is determined
by partitioning the chemical library by the number of compute instances.
The processing threshold (<italic>L</italic>) is determined by the
number of cores multiplied by the scaling factor (<italic>S</italic>)<disp-formula id="eq2"><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="ao3c02249_m002" position="anchor"/><label>2</label></disp-formula></p>
    <p>Therefore, if <italic>C</italic> =
128 and <italic>S</italic> =
3, a new ligand will be added to the queue if the number of processes
drops below 384. Multiple parallel instances are controlled via SSH
from a secure control node in the user’s private-subnet. When
the warpDOCK queue-engine is operating with over 250 physical CPUs
(500 virtual CPU cores), many input and output requests can occur
between the computing instances and the data storage device. This
may push some processes onto the blocked queue on the operating system,
resulting in idling of instances. To reduce this risk, data from the
virtual screen is funneled through a customized networked file system
server (NFS) with multi-path enabled uber-high performance block storage
devices (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>).</p>
    <p>For the best possible trade-off between speed and accuracy, warpDOCK
is intended to use Qvina2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref></sup> but is also
compatible with AutoDock Vina and other Vina-based docking algorithms.
Chemical library handling and management of large results datasets
are likely to be major hurdles for many prospective users. Hence,
we have developed a series of programs to automate these tasks increasing
usability (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="other">Table <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="other">1</xref></xref>).</p>
    <p>To test compatibility with different docking algorithms (Qvina2,
Qvina-W, AutoDock Vina, Smina vinardo, and Vina-Carb), we performed
virtual screens against two targets, AmpC β-lactamase and <italic>Sa</italic>Ddl, using a drug-like library of 1.28 million compounds
and a modest allocation of 1024 AMD E4.Flex virtual CPUs (2048 virtual
CPU cores) and 64 GB RAM/instance (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref></xref>a). Each program was compatible with the
warpDOCK pipeline. Qvina2 and Qvina-W were fastest and performed at
similar speed for both proteins, each recording wall-clock times of
approximately 80 min (which includes boot-up of instances and shutdown
of queue)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref></sup> However, in practice, Qvina-W is recommended
only for docking very large search areas. In contrast to Qvina2 and
Qvina-W, completion times for each of the other docking algorithms
varied between protein. These differences are likely a product of
the different search algorithms and scoring functions; e.g., Vina
docked all compounds to <italic>Sa</italic>Ddl in ∼113 min
versus ∼156 min for AmpC β-lactamase. Nonetheless, the
warpDOCK pipeline efficiently handled all docking algorithms tested.</p>

are averaged over search grid volume; error bars represent the standard

    </fig>
    <p>To test the scaling behavior of the pipeline on
OCI, we performed
virtual screens in combinations of exponentially increasing library
sizes (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsomega.3c02249/suppl_file/ao3c02249_si_001.pdf">Figure S2</ext-link>), cores (ergo instances),
and search-grid volume using Qvina2 and recorded wall-clock times.
This data fit well to a non-linear regression model (RMSE = 11.69, <italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.98), with computation time exponentially
increasing and decreasing with the number of ligands and number of
cores, respectively. For smaller libraries, a gain of diminishing
returns was evident when comparing core speed-up, e.g., 1024 vs 2048
virtual CPUs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref></xref>b)—a trait of multicore processing (see Amdahl’s law).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref></sup> Additionally, varying the search grid volume
does not majorly affect the overall computation time. For example,
using 2048 virtual CPUs and <italic>L</italic> = 1, a library of 1280K
randomly sampled ligands could be screened in 69.2 and 72.2 min for
search-grid volumes of 1<sup>3</sup> and 4 nm<sup>3</sup>, a four-fold
increase in volume (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref></xref>c). In comparisons between the randomly sampled library and
an equally sized prototypical drug “control” library
(Ampicillin), the queue-engine scaled similarly for the sample library
over the control library (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref></xref>d). Collectively, these data demonstrate the adaptability
of the queue-engine and pipeline to respond efficiently to varied
experimental parameters and provide predictable performance for each
virtual screen on OCI.</p>
    <p>Because computation times scale linearly
with the number of CPUs,
it is possible to estimate time and, therefore, compute costs. For
example, using 1024 AMD VM.E4.Flex CPUs (2048 virtual CPUs) with 64
GB RAM and <italic>L</italic> = 3 and a search-grid of 4 nm<sup>3</sup> the cost to screen 640K ligands versus 1280K ligands against <italic>Sa</italic>Ddl was approximately $USD 18.94 and $USD 32.68 including
boot-volumes, respectively. By fitting a slope to these data (for
all points; <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.99), the estimated
costs to screen 10M ligands, 100M ligands, and 1B ligands using 1024
AMD VM.E4.Flex CPUs (2048 virtual CPUs) with 64 GB RAM are $USD 258.5,
$USD 2580.88, and $USD 25,804.6. In practice, however, the number
of CPUs used to screen 100M or 1B ligands would much greater and thus
require less time, which may vary cost estimations due to Amdahl’s
law. It is important to also note that the costs discussed above are
for compute hardware only, i.e., CPUs and memory, and instance boot
volumes. Storage costs vary depending on capacity and are billed monthly.
All costs were estimated at the time of manuscript preparation.</p>
    <p>We also sought to benchmark and compare the performance of warpDOCK
against the closest docking pipeline, VirtualFlow, which uses BASH
job scheduling.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref></sup> To compare performance,
the 1.28 million benchmarking libraries were screened against AmpC
β-lactamase with Qvina2 (exhaustiveness = 1) using both VirtualFlow
and warpDOCK (<italic>L</italic> = 1). Docking calculations were performed
using 1024 AMD VM.E4.Flex CPUs (2048 virtual CPU cores) and 64 GB
RAM/ instance. warpDOCK completed all docking calculations in 80 min,
compared to 295 min for VirtualFlow, a 3.7-fold increase in completion
time. The compute costs for each pipeline for the two virtual screens
also differed: the virtual screen compute costs for warpDOCK were
$USD 35.45 versus $USD 131 for VirtualFlow. Thus, the warpDOCK queue-engine
demonstrates the benefits of ground-up design for increasing the efficiency
of docking calculations and reducing compute costs.</p>
    <p>As a practical
example to demonstrate capabilities and cost-effectiveness
for users, we used the warpDOCK pipeline to perform two virtual screening
exercises. First, we docked the 1.28 million benchmarking library
against AmpC β-lactamase with Qvina2 using 1024 AMD VM.E4.Flex
CPUs with 64 GB of RAM. A coarse- to fine-grain approach was used:
in the first pass, all ligands were docked with an exhaustiveness
of 1; then the top 1% were extracted and redocked with an exhaustiveness
of 25. To help validate the screening approach and Qvina2 scoring
function, a library of active inhibitors was also docked to the receptor
(<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsomega.3c02249/suppl_file/ao3c02249_si_001.pdf">Figure S3</ext-link>). Comparative analysis of the
docked co-crystallized ligand (binding affinity = −7.4 kcal/mol)
to that of the crystal structure revealed strong conservation of binding
orientation and molecular interactions. We also found that the top
0.25% of ligands from the virtual screen (<italic>n</italic> = 3200)
were significantly enriched over the active inhibitors (<italic>n</italic> = 62) by Welch’s unequal variances <italic>t</italic>-test
(<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0005). The compute costs for the AmpC β-lactamase
virtual screen cost were approximately $USD 63, demonstrating efficiency
and affordability.</p>
    <p>Next, for the second virtual screening exercise,
we performed a
larger and more exhaustive ensemble virtual screen targeting the ATP
and di-peptide binding sites of <italic>Sa</italic>Ddl, an antibiotic
drug target essential for cell wall biosynthesis, using a library
of 4.75 million “drug-like” ligands (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsomega.3c02249/suppl_file/ao3c02249_si_001.pdf">Figure S4</ext-link>). The Ω-loop, which forms a peripheral shell
surrounding the ATP and di-peptide binding sites, is dynamic in the
absence of substrates and does not appear in the electron density
of crystal structures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref></sup> As such, we performed
three independent 250 ns all-atom molecular dynamics simulations with
substrate-free <italic>Sa</italic>Ddl and used RMSD-based clustering
to identify representative conformations (or centroids). Next, 21
of the top representative conformations of the protein (including
the crystal structure) were screened, totaling ∼101 million
docking calculations using a coarse-/fine-grain approach. There are
currently no available inhibitors that target both the ATP and dipeptide
binding sites of <sc>d</sc>-alanine–<sc>d</sc>-alanine ligase
enzymes; therefore, it is challenging to generate decoys. Appropriate
validation of docking calculations and interpretation of the results
are important to mitigate the risk of false positives. As an alternative,
we tested in silico whether a subset of the top clustered hits from
the ensemble screen could stably bind to <italic>Sa</italic>Ddl over
the duration of a 100 ns molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. We found
that, using the poses docked to the crystal structure as starting
coordinates, 2 of the 31 ligands dissociated after an initial equilibration
period (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsomega.3c02249/suppl_file/ao3c02249_si_001.pdf">Figure S3d,e</ext-link>). These data highlight
that even when predicted binding affinities are calculated using exhaustive
ensemble-based approaches, false positives may still be enriched.
Therefore, users should be aware of and have controls in place to
reduce risks. The virtual screen was performed using 1920 AMD VM.E4.Flex
CPUs (3840 virtual CPU cores) with an approximate wall-clock time
of 3.5 h per receptor conformation. At the time of manuscript preparation,
the entire ensemble virtual screen compute costs were approximately
$USD 3675.</p>

    <title>Conclusions</title>
    <p>Here, we show that the warpDOCK pipeline
provides a powerful framework
for virtual screening using cloud infrastructure which is both accessible
and simple to use. Given the ever-expanding depth of ultra-large chemical
libraries and protein structures and the recent successes of RoseTTAFold
and Alphafold2,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>−<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref></sup> large-scale virtual screening is more relevant than ever. Importantly,
because of the nature of cloud computing, users can perform virtual
screening experiments using as little or as many resources available.
As the warpDOCK code is written in Python, we encourage the scientific
community to contribute toward future development. All code, usage

      <title>Docking Algorithm Compatibility, Scaling Behavior, and Benchmarking</title>
      <p>To test the compatibility of the warpDOCK pipeline with other docking
algorithms, we assembled a 1.28 million “drug-like”
ligand library from ZINC (<uri xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://zinc.docking.org/">https://zinc.docking.org/</uri>) and virtually screened all ligands against two receptor targets:
AmpC -lactamase and <italic>Sa</italic>Ddl. The docking algorithms
used were AutoDock Vina (<uri xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://vina.scripps.edu/downloads/">https://vina.scripps.edu/downloads/</uri>), Qvina2 and Qvina-W (<uri xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://qvina.github.io/">https://qvina.github.io/</uri>), Smina
vinardo (<uri xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/smina/">https://sourceforge.net/projects/smina/</uri>), and Vina-Carb (<uri xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://glycam.org/">https://glycam.org/</uri>). Each virtual screen was performed using an exhaustiveness of 1
and <italic>L</italic> = 3; flexible side chain docking was not enabled.</p>
      <p>To test the performance of the queue-engine on OCI, we assembled
random libraries increasing exponentially from 10,000 to 1.28 million
in size from the benchmarking library. First, we performed a series
of virtual screens using the <italic>Sa</italic>Ddl active-site as
the target (exhaustiveness = 1, scaling factor = 3) and changed parameters
until all possible combinations were screened, e.g., 640K ligands,
512 cores, and a search-grid volume of 8 nm<sup>3</sup>. The number
of AMD VM.E4.Flex CPUs used was either 256, 512, 1024, or 2048, each
with 64 GB of RAM per instance. The search-grid volume was either
1, 2, 4, 8, and 16 nm<sup>3</sup>. For each screen, we recorded wall-clock
times, which include, for instance, boot-up time, embarrassingly parallel
operations, shutting down of the queue, and parallel processes. To
derive a slope, we implemented multiple polynomial regressions using
the <italic>Sklearn</italic> library in Python<disp-formula id="eq3"><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="ao3c02249_m003" position="anchor"/><label>3</label></disp-formula>where <italic>y</italic> is the dependent
variable (time in minutes), β<sub>0</sub> is the <italic>y</italic> intercept, β<sub><italic>n</italic></sub> are the coefficients,
and <italic>a</italic>, <italic>b</italic>, and <italic>c</italic> are the dependent variables of ligands, cores, and search-grid volume,
respectively. The polynomial is of the 3rd degree. For a complete
list of the polynomial features, coefficients, and intercepts at different
degrees, please refer to the accompanying <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsomega.3c02249/suppl_file/ao3c02249_si_001.pdf">Supporting Information</ext-link>. Root-mean-squared-error and <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> were calculated with the <italic>Sklearn.metrics</italic> library.</p>
      <p>Second, to test characteristics of the scaling factor <italic>L</italic>, we compared the 1.28 million benchmarking library (“sample”)
to an equally sized “control” library, which was the
ligand Ampicillin (SMILES: CC1(C(N2C(S1)C(C2=O)NC(=O)C(C3=CC=CC=C3)N)C(=O)O)C).
We compared wall-clock times for <italic>L</italic> = 1 to 4 for search-grid
volumes of 1 and 4 nm.<sup>3</sup></p>
      <p>To benchmark the performance
of warpDOCK against VirtualFlow, a
pipeline which uses BASH job scheduling, we installed VirtualFlow
in the private subnet and set up the pipeline using SLURM as the job
scheduler.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref></sup> The 1.28 million ligand benchmarking
library was virtually screened against AmpC with Qvina2 using both
warpDOCK and VirtualFlow on 1024 AMD VM.E4.Flex CPUs (2048 virtual

First, the substrate binding site was screened using the 1.28 million
benchmarking libraries with an exhaustiveness of 1 using Qvina2. Next,
the top 1% scoring ligands (kcal/mol) were re-docked with an exhaustiveness

active-lactamase inhibitors was also screened against the substrate
binding site. Statistical analysis was performed using Welch’s

        <p>Molecular dynamics simulations

performed using GROMACS (2020.4) with the Charmm-27 all-atom forcefield.
The ATP and dipeptide-bound co-crystal structure of <italic>Sa</italic>Ddl (2 Å resolution, PDB: <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="PDB" xlink:href="7U9K">7U9K</ext-link>, intact Ω-loop) was stripped of
all waters, metals, and small molecules. Missing residues of other
loops were modeled using the ICM-Pro Molsoft software suite (3.9-1b)
and subsequently refined. Refined <italic>Sa</italic>Ddl was placed
in a dodecahedral box at least 1.0 nm from the periodic edge boundary
and solvated with the TIP3P water model. Na<sup>+</sup> and Cl<sup>–</sup> were added until the net neutral charge of the system
was achieved. The system was then energy minimized using the steepest-descent
method until <italic>F</italic><sub>max</sub> &lt; 1000 kJ/mol. We
performed sequential 250 ps restrained <italic>NVT</italic> and <italic>NPT</italic> simulations to appropriately equilibrate the system

prior to three 250 ns unrestrained production simulations. All equilibration

        <title>RMSD-Based Clustering</title>
        <p>To generate an ensemble of probable
structural conformations for ensemble docking calculations, we performed
RMSD-based clustering of a single unrestrained trajectory using the
GROMOS algorithm.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref></sup> Coordinates were extracted
per 10 ps across the trajectory, producing 25,001 simulated structures
aligned by α-C atoms to remove translational and rotational
variance. Representative structures were then clustered by pairwise
RMSD calculations across all protein heavy atoms with a 0.15 nm cut-off,
resulting in 122 clusters, with the top 20 representing ∼77%
of the conformational ensemble. We defined a representative structure,
or “centroid,” from each cluster as the lowest (or middle)
RMSD relative to all other structures in the cluster.</p>

    </sec>
    <sec id="sec4.12">
      <title>Ensemble Virtual Ligand Screening and Refinement with MD</title>
      <p>Docking calculations were performed using a library of ∼4.75
million commercially available drug-like compounds curated from ZINC
(<uri xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://zinc.docking.org/">https://zinc.docking.org/</uri>), of which all could be successfully docked. The library was designed
such that compounds had a molecular weight of up to 450 Da and a Log <italic>P</italic> score of 5.0 or less. A search grid was created around
the ATP and dipeptide binding sites, large enough to encompass conformational
variance for both the crystal structure and ensemble structures. For
both the crystal and ensemble VLS, we utilized a coarse-to-fine grain
approach. Initially, ligands were screened against each structure
with low exhaustiveness, equating to ∼101 million unique docking
calculations in the first pass. For the ensemble VLS, binding affinities
(in kcal/mol) were weighted per the contribution (%) of each cluster
to the sampled conformational ensemble. Weighted binding affinities
were then summed to provide a final binding affinity for each ligand.
Results from the ensemble and crystal virtual screens were aligned
by ligand ID and ranked according to the ensemble-weighted score.
Next, using the top 0.01% of compounds from the ensemble screen, we
repeated docking calculations with higher exhaustiveness (<italic>E</italic> = 25). To further the reduce dimensionality of the data,
we introduced a binding affinity threshold of −10 kcal/mol
along the <italic>X</italic> and <italic>Y</italic> axes, resulting
in four quadrants. From these, we further analyzed ligands belonging
to the 2nd quadrant (Q2), thus including ligands that have the best
binding affinities for both the ensemble and the crystal structure.
We then clustered each ligand according to pairwise Tanimoto coefficient
distance (Tc = 0.3) using the Butina algorithm, an unsupervised statistical
approach optimized for clustering based on chemical similarities.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref></sup> Following this, the top-scoring ligands were
extracted from each cluster and subsequently ranked. For in silico
validation using molecular dynamics, we cherry-picked compounds based
on binding affinity, the number of molecules belonging to each cluster,
and favorable receptor interactions, resulting in an initial 31 compounds.
The starting coordinates for each of the 31 ligands were those of
the ligand docked to the crystal structure. The system was equilibrated
as described above, and a single 100 ns unrestrained production simulation
was performed for each ligand. To calculate relative solvation, we
averaged ligand heavy-atom RMSDs across the trajectory per 10 ps and
calculated RMSDs relative to the starting coordinates post-energy
minimization.</p>
      <p>Docking calculations were performed with Qvina2.
Chemical similarity clustering of compounds was conducted using the
RDkit Python library using in-house scripts (available on request).</p>

      <p>warpDOCK is an open-source pipeline for virtual small-molecule
drug discovery using cloud infrastructure. warpDOCK is designed from
the ground up for the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI), enabling
harmonious parallelism of docking calculations over thousands to hundreds
of thousands of cores. This enables cost-effective sampling of ultra-large
chemical libraries, potentially reducing the time to identify lead
drug candidates by orders of magnitude. By utilizing established docking
software and automating each step of the process, warpDOCK makes large-scale
virtual screening accessible to a broad user group. The warpDOCK code
can be found at the BruningLab GitHub repository (<uri xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://github.com/BruningLab/warpDOCK">https://github.com/BruningLab/warpDOCK</uri>).</p>

    <title>Introduction</title>
    <p>Recent advances in virtual screening programs
and approaches have
enabled the discovery of promising new drug candidates.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>−<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref></sup> Traditionally, modest virtual screening experiments (up to 3–5
million compounds) have been performed using onsite high-performance
computing clusters, typically requiring days to weeks of computation
time.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref></sup> Recently, an increasing number of published
studies have performed large-scale virtual screens using chemical
libraries of more than 100 million,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref></sup> or even a billion ligands.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref></sup> However, to perform such screens, access to considerable computational
resources, experience in managing HPC clusters, and scripting knowledge
are essential—a limiting factor for most prospective users.
The benefit of upscaling CPU cores is clear when considering that
the overall computation time (<italic>T</italic>) of a virtual screen
is proportional to the number of ligands (<italic>N</italic>), processing
time per ligand (<italic>P</italic>), and the number of cores (<italic>C</italic>) available<disp-formula id="eq1"><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="ao3c02249_m001" position="anchor"/><label>1</label></disp-formula></p>
    <p>For example, on a modern desktop PC
with 8 cores, it would take
approximately 4 years to screen 100 million ligands, assuming a typical
processing time of 10 s per ligand, which is not practical. Compared
to onsite HPCs, cloud computing is advantageous as the user has access
to virtual and bare-metal machines, enormous core scalability, and
data storage. Cloud infrastructure is also globally accessible and
does not require prior HPC experience. Therefore, incorporating cloud
infrastructures with large-scale virtual screening is beneficial for
the broader scientific community, enabling increased access and usability
for this powerful drug discovery approach.</p>
    <p>Here, we introduce
warpDOCK, an open-source pipeline for virtual
screening using cloud network infrastructure (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref></xref>). To provide a smooth user experience and
best performance, we designed warpDOCK for the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure
(OCI) and automated tasks that would otherwise be complex and time-consuming
with subsidiary programs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>; <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="other">Table <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="other">1</xref></xref>). Because of the design architecture of the queue-engine, warpDOCK
offers practically limitless scaling capabilities whilst maintaining
the maximum efficiency of docking calculations on all CPU cores across
all compute instances, and is compatible with multiple different docking
algorithms. As an exercise to demonstrate the capabilities and cost-effectiveness
of the pipeline and to compute behavioral characteristics, we performed
a virtual screen against AmpC β-lactamase (PDB: <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="PDB" xlink:href="1L2S">1L2S</ext-link>) from <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> using 1.28 million ligands and a
large-scale ensemble virtual screen with over 100 million docking
calculations against <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic><sc>d</sc>-alanine–<sc>d</sc>-alanine ligase (<italic>Sa</italic>Ddl; PDB: <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="PDB" xlink:href="7U9K">7U9K</ext-link>). Collectively, these exercises demonstrate that the warpDOCK platform
is accessible, cost-effective, and simple to use.</p>

        <p>Schematic architecture of warpDOCK on the Oracle Cloud
Infrastructure
(OCI). The framework is hosted within the user’s private-subnet
of the VCN. To access the private-subnet, the user first uses SSH
to access the Bastion login node in the public-subnet from a local
machine with the private key file. The Bastion login node is used
as a lily pad into the private-subnet using SSH and the private key
file. In the private-subnet, all operations are managed from the Control
node. In the private-subnet, compute instances are launched together
as an instance pool. Each instance is installed with a custom image
and has the same shape configuration. The custom image is cloned from
a base canonical Ubuntu OS installed with warpDOCK, Qvina2, and dependencies.
The custom image is permanently mounted to block storage devices via
the NFS server. Thus, all operations can be managed harmoniously.</p>

    <title>Results and Discussion</title>
    <p>In cloud environments, a computer
(“shape” according
to OCI terminology) is launched as an object called an “instance”,
having varied core allocations and memory. Depending on the task,
the number of instances could vary significantly, but this creates
complexity as jobs must be managed harmoniously between cores and
simultaneously between instances. Because the docking calculation
time per ligand is not consistent, core utilization can drop if the
next ligand is not pre-loaded. Rather than using BASH shell scripting
to load ligands,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref></sup> which is computationally
expensive (thus affecting process loading time), we developed the
warpDOCK queue-engine in python (<uri xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://www.python.org/">https://www.python.org/</uri>) to circumvent this issue. Here, the
queue-engine actively monitors the number of docking calculations
allocated to each core, and if the values drop below a threshold,
a new ligand is loaded to the queue from a pre-partitioned chemical
library sub-folder. The number of compounds in the sub-folder is determined
by partitioning the chemical library by the number of compute instances.
The processing threshold (<italic>L</italic>) is determined by the
number of cores multiplied by the scaling factor (<italic>S</italic>)<disp-formula id="eq2"><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="ao3c02249_m002" position="anchor"/><label>2</label></disp-formula></p>
    <p>Therefore, if <italic>C</italic> =
128 and <italic>S</italic> =
3, a new ligand will be added to the queue if the number of processes
drops below 384. Multiple parallel instances are controlled via SSH
from a secure control node in the user’s private-subnet. When
the warpDOCK queue-engine is operating with over 250 physical CPUs
(500 virtual CPU cores), many input and output requests can occur
between the computing instances and the data storage device. This
may push some processes onto the blocked queue on the operating system,
resulting in idling of instances. To reduce this risk, data from the
virtual screen is funneled through a customized networked file system
server (NFS) with multi-path enabled uber-high performance block storage
devices (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>).</p>
    <p>For the best possible trade-off between speed and accuracy, warpDOCK
is intended to use Qvina2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref></sup> but is also
compatible with AutoDock Vina and other Vina-based docking algorithms.
Chemical library handling and management of large results datasets
are likely to be major hurdles for many prospective users. Hence,
we have developed a series of programs to automate these tasks increasing
usability (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="other">Table <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="other">1</xref></xref>).</p>
    <p>To test compatibility with different docking algorithms (Qvina2,
Qvina-W, AutoDock Vina, Smina vinardo, and Vina-Carb), we performed
virtual screens against two targets, AmpC β-lactamase and <italic>Sa</italic>Ddl, using a drug-like library of 1.28 million compounds
and a modest allocation of 1024 AMD E4.Flex virtual CPUs (2048 virtual
CPU cores) and 64 GB RAM/instance (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref></xref>a). Each program was compatible with the
warpDOCK pipeline. Qvina2 and Qvina-W were fastest and performed at
similar speed for both proteins, each recording wall-clock times of
approximately 80 min (which includes boot-up of instances and shutdown
of queue)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref></sup> However, in practice, Qvina-W is recommended
only for docking very large search areas. In contrast to Qvina2 and
Qvina-W, completion times for each of the other docking algorithms
varied between protein. These differences are likely a product of
the different search algorithms and scoring functions; e.g., Vina
docked all compounds to <italic>Sa</italic>Ddl in ∼113 min
versus ∼156 min for AmpC β-lactamase. Nonetheless, the
warpDOCK pipeline efficiently handled all docking algorithms tested.</p>

ligands exponentially increasing from 10,000 to 1.28 million. Times
are averaged over search grid volume; error bars represent the standard

    </fig>
    <p>To test the scaling behavior of the pipeline on
OCI, we performed
virtual screens in combinations of exponentially increasing library
sizes (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsomega.3c02249/suppl_file/ao3c02249_si_001.pdf">Figure S2</ext-link>), cores (ergo instances),
and search-grid volume using Qvina2 and recorded wall-clock times.
This data fit well to a non-linear regression model (RMSE = 11.69, <italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.98), with computation time exponentially
increasing and decreasing with the number of ligands and number of
cores, respectively. For smaller libraries, a gain of diminishing
returns was evident when comparing core speed-up, e.g., 1024 vs 2048
virtual CPUs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref></xref>b)—a trait of multicore processing (see Amdahl’s law).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref></sup> Additionally, varying the search grid volume
does not majorly affect the overall computation time. For example,
using 2048 virtual CPUs and <italic>L</italic> = 1, a library of 1280K
randomly sampled ligands could be screened in 69.2 and 72.2 min for
search-grid volumes of 1<sup>3</sup> and 4 nm<sup>3</sup>, a four-fold
increase in volume (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref></xref>c). In comparisons between the randomly sampled library and
an equally sized prototypical drug “control” library
(Ampicillin), the queue-engine scaled similarly for the sample library
over the control library (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref></xref>d). Collectively, these data demonstrate the adaptability
of the queue-engine and pipeline to respond efficiently to varied
experimental parameters and provide predictable performance for each
virtual screen on OCI.</p>
    <p>Because computation times scale linearly
with the number of CPUs,
it is possible to estimate time and, therefore, compute costs. For
example, using 1024 AMD VM.E4.Flex CPUs (2048 virtual CPUs) with 64
GB RAM and <italic>L</italic> = 3 and a search-grid of 4 nm<sup>3</sup> the cost to screen 640K ligands versus 1280K ligands against <italic>Sa</italic>Ddl was approximately $USD 18.94 and $USD 32.68 including
boot-volumes, respectively. By fitting a slope to these data (for
all points; <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.99), the estimated
costs to screen 10M ligands, 100M ligands, and 1B ligands using 1024
AMD VM.E4.Flex CPUs (2048 virtual CPUs) with 64 GB RAM are $USD 258.5,
$USD 2580.88, and $USD 25,804.6. In practice, however, the number
of CPUs used to screen 100M or 1B ligands would much greater and thus
require less time, which may vary cost estimations due to Amdahl’s
law. It is important to also note that the costs discussed above are
for compute hardware only, i.e., CPUs and memory, and instance boot
volumes. Storage costs vary depending on capacity and are billed monthly.
All costs were estimated at the time of manuscript preparation.</p>
    <p>We also sought to benchmark and compare the performance of warpDOCK
against the closest docking pipeline, VirtualFlow, which uses BASH
job scheduling.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref></sup> To compare performance,
the 1.28 million benchmarking libraries were screened against AmpC
β-lactamase with Qvina2 (exhaustiveness = 1) using both VirtualFlow
and warpDOCK (<italic>L</italic> = 1). Docking calculations were performed
using 1024 AMD VM.E4.Flex CPUs (2048 virtual CPU cores) and 64 GB
RAM/ instance. warpDOCK completed all docking calculations in 80 min,
compared to 295 min for VirtualFlow, a 3.7-fold increase in completion
time. The compute costs for each pipeline for the two virtual screens
also differed: the virtual screen compute costs for warpDOCK were
$USD 35.45 versus $USD 131 for VirtualFlow. Thus, the warpDOCK queue-engine
demonstrates the benefits of ground-up design for increasing the efficiency
of docking calculations and reducing compute costs.</p>
    <p>As a practical
example to demonstrate capabilities and cost-effectiveness
for users, we used the warpDOCK pipeline to perform two virtual screening
exercises. First, we docked the 1.28 million benchmarking library
against AmpC β-lactamase with Qvina2 using 1024 AMD VM.E4.Flex
CPUs with 64 GB of RAM. A coarse- to fine-grain approach was used:
in the first pass, all ligands were docked with an exhaustiveness
of 1; then the top 1% were extracted and redocked with an exhaustiveness
of 25. To help validate the screening approach and Qvina2 scoring
function, a library of active inhibitors was also docked to the receptor
(<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsomega.3c02249/suppl_file/ao3c02249_si_001.pdf">Figure S3</ext-link>). Comparative analysis of the
docked co-crystallized ligand (binding affinity = −7.4 kcal/mol)
to that of the crystal structure revealed strong conservation of binding
orientation and molecular interactions. We also found that the top
0.25% of ligands from the virtual screen (<italic>n</italic> = 3200)
were significantly enriched over the active inhibitors (<italic>n</italic> = 62) by Welch’s unequal variances <italic>t</italic>-test
(<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0005). The compute costs for the AmpC β-lactamase
virtual screen cost were approximately $USD 63, demonstrating efficiency
and affordability.</p>
    <p>Next, for the second virtual screening exercise,
we performed a
larger and more exhaustive ensemble virtual screen targeting the ATP
and di-peptide binding sites of <italic>Sa</italic>Ddl, an antibiotic
drug target essential for cell wall biosynthesis, using a library
of 4.75 million “drug-like” ligands (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsomega.3c02249/suppl_file/ao3c02249_si_001.pdf">Figure S4</ext-link>). The Ω-loop, which forms a peripheral shell
surrounding the ATP and di-peptide binding sites, is dynamic in the
absence of substrates and does not appear in the electron density
of crystal structures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref></sup> As such, we performed
three independent 250 ns all-atom molecular dynamics simulations with
substrate-free <italic>Sa</italic>Ddl and used RMSD-based clustering
to identify representative conformations (or centroids). Next, 21
of the top representative conformations of the protein (including
the crystal structure) were screened, totaling ∼101 million
docking calculations using a coarse-/fine-grain approach. There are
currently no available inhibitors that target both the ATP and dipeptide
binding sites of <sc>d</sc>-alanine–<sc>d</sc>-alanine ligase
enzymes; therefore, it is challenging to generate decoys. Appropriate
validation of docking calculations and interpretation of the results
are important to mitigate the risk of false positives. As an alternative,
we tested in silico whether a subset of the top clustered hits from
the ensemble screen could stably bind to <italic>Sa</italic>Ddl over
the duration of a 100 ns molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. We found
that, using the poses docked to the crystal structure as starting
coordinates, 2 of the 31 ligands dissociated after an initial equilibration
period (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsomega.3c02249/suppl_file/ao3c02249_si_001.pdf">Figure S3d,e</ext-link>). These data highlight
that even when predicted binding affinities are calculated using exhaustive
ensemble-based approaches, false positives may still be enriched.
Therefore, users should be aware of and have controls in place to
reduce risks. The virtual screen was performed using 1920 AMD VM.E4.Flex
CPUs (3840 virtual CPU cores) with an approximate wall-clock time
of 3.5 h per receptor conformation. At the time of manuscript preparation,
the entire ensemble virtual screen compute costs were approximately
$USD 3675.</p>

    <title>Conclusions</title>
    <p>Here, we show that the warpDOCK pipeline
provides a powerful framework
for virtual screening using cloud infrastructure which is both accessible
and simple to use. Given the ever-expanding depth of ultra-large chemical
libraries and protein structures and the recent successes of RoseTTAFold
and Alphafold2,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>−<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref></sup> large-scale virtual screening is more relevant than ever. Importantly,
because of the nature of cloud computing, users can perform virtual
screening experiments using as little or as many resources available.
As the warpDOCK code is written in Python, we encourage the scientific
community to contribute toward future development. All code, usage

      <title>Docking Algorithm Compatibility, Scaling Behavior, and Benchmarking</title>
      <p>To test the compatibility of the warpDOCK pipeline with other docking
algorithms, we assembled a 1.28 million “drug-like”
ligand library from ZINC (<uri xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://zinc.docking.org/">https://zinc.docking.org/</uri>) and virtually screened all ligands against two receptor targets:
AmpC -lactamase and <italic>Sa</italic>Ddl. The docking algorithms
used were AutoDock Vina (<uri xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://vina.scripps.edu/downloads/">https://vina.scripps.edu/downloads/</uri>), Qvina2 and Qvina-W (<uri xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://qvina.github.io/">https://qvina.github.io/</uri>), Smina
vinardo (<uri xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/smina/">https://sourceforge.net/projects/smina/</uri>), and Vina-Carb (<uri xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://glycam.org/">https://glycam.org/</uri>). Each virtual screen was performed using an exhaustiveness of 1
and <italic>L</italic> = 3; flexible side chain docking was not enabled.</p>
      <p>To test the performance of the queue-engine on OCI, we assembled
random libraries increasing exponentially from 10,000 to 1.28 million
in size from the benchmarking library. First, we performed a series
of virtual screens using the <italic>Sa</italic>Ddl active-site as
the target (exhaustiveness = 1, scaling factor = 3) and changed parameters
until all possible combinations were screened, e.g., 640K ligands,
512 cores, and a search-grid volume of 8 nm<sup>3</sup>. The number
of AMD VM.E4.Flex CPUs used was either 256, 512, 1024, or 2048, each
with 64 GB of RAM per instance. The search-grid volume was either
1, 2, 4, 8, and 16 nm<sup>3</sup>. For each screen, we recorded wall-clock
times, which include, for instance, boot-up time, embarrassingly parallel
operations, shutting down of the queue, and parallel processes. To
derive a slope, we implemented multiple polynomial regressions using
the <italic>Sklearn</italic> library in Python<disp-formula id="eq3"><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="ao3c02249_m003" position="anchor"/><label>3</label></disp-formula>where <italic>y</italic> is the dependent
variable (time in minutes), β<sub>0</sub> is the <italic>y</italic> intercept, β<sub><italic>n</italic></sub> are the coefficients,
and <italic>a</italic>, <italic>b</italic>, and <italic>c</italic> are the dependent variables of ligands, cores, and search-grid volume,
respectively. The polynomial is of the 3rd degree. For a complete
list of the polynomial features, coefficients, and intercepts at different
degrees, please refer to the accompanying <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsomega.3c02249/suppl_file/ao3c02249_si_001.pdf">Supporting Information</ext-link>. Root-mean-squared-error and <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> were calculated with the <italic>Sklearn.metrics</italic> library.</p>
      <p>Second, to test characteristics of the scaling factor <italic>L</italic>, we compared the 1.28 million benchmarking library (“sample”)
to an equally sized “control” library, which was the
ligand Ampicillin (SMILES: CC1(C(N2C(S1)C(C2=O)NC(=O)C(C3=CC=CC=C3)N)C(=O)O)C).
We compared wall-clock times for <italic>L</italic> = 1 to 4 for search-grid
volumes of 1 and 4 nm.<sup>3</sup></p>
      <p>To benchmark the performance
of warpDOCK against VirtualFlow, a
pipeline which uses BASH job scheduling, we installed VirtualFlow
in the private subnet and set up the pipeline using SLURM as the job
scheduler.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref></sup> The 1.28 million ligand benchmarking
library was virtually screened against AmpC with Qvina2 using both
warpDOCK and VirtualFlow on 1024 AMD VM.E4.Flex CPUs (2048 virtual

First, the substrate binding site was screened using the 1.28 million
benchmarking libraries with an exhaustiveness of 1 using Qvina2. Next,
the top 1% scoring ligands (kcal/mol) were re-docked with an exhaustiveness

active-lactamase inhibitors was also screened against the substrate
binding site. Statistical analysis was performed using Welch’s

        <p>Molecular dynamics simulations

The ATP and dipeptide-bound co-crystal structure of <italic>Sa</italic>Ddl (2 Å resolution, PDB: <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="PDB" xlink:href="7U9K">7U9K</ext-link>, intact Ω-loop) was stripped of
all waters, metals, and small molecules. Missing residues of other
loops were modeled using the ICM-Pro Molsoft software suite (3.9-1b)
and subsequently refined. Refined <italic>Sa</italic>Ddl was placed
in a dodecahedral box at least 1.0 nm from the periodic edge boundary
and solvated with the TIP3P water model. Na<sup>+</sup> and Cl<sup>–</sup> were added until the net neutral charge of the system
was achieved. The system was then energy minimized using the steepest-descent
method until <italic>F</italic><sub>max</sub> &lt; 1000 kJ/mol. We
performed sequential 250 ps restrained <italic>NVT</italic> and <italic>NPT</italic> simulations to appropriately equilibrate the system

prior to three 250 ns unrestrained production simulations. All equilibration

        <title>RMSD-Based Clustering</title>
        <p>To generate an ensemble of probable
structural conformations for ensemble docking calculations, we performed
RMSD-based clustering of a single unrestrained trajectory using the
GROMOS algorithm.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref></sup> Coordinates were extracted
per 10 ps across the trajectory, producing 25,001 simulated structures
aligned by α-C atoms to remove translational and rotational
variance. Representative structures were then clustered by pairwise
RMSD calculations across all protein heavy atoms with a 0.15 nm cut-off,
resulting in 122 clusters, with the top 20 representing ∼77%
of the conformational ensemble. We defined a representative structure,
or “centroid,” from each cluster as the lowest (or middle)
RMSD relative to all other structures in the cluster.</p>

    <sec id="sec4.12">
      <title>Ensemble Virtual Ligand Screening and Refinement with MD</title>
      <p>Docking calculations were performed using a library of ∼4.75
million commercially available drug-like compounds curated from ZINC
(<uri xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://zinc.docking.org/">https://zinc.docking.org/</uri>), of which all could be successfully docked. The library was designed
such that compounds had a molecular weight of up to 450 Da and a Log <italic>P</italic> score of 5.0 or less. A search grid was created around
the ATP and dipeptide binding sites, large enough to encompass conformational
variance for both the crystal structure and ensemble structures. For
both the crystal and ensemble VLS, we utilized a coarse-to-fine grain
approach. Initially, ligands were screened against each structure
with low exhaustiveness, equating to ∼101 million unique docking
calculations in the first pass. For the ensemble VLS, binding affinities
(in kcal/mol) were weighted per the contribution (%) of each cluster
to the sampled conformational ensemble. Weighted binding affinities
were then summed to provide a final binding affinity for each ligand.
Results from the ensemble and crystal virtual screens were aligned
by ligand ID and ranked according to the ensemble-weighted score.
Next, using the top 0.01% of compounds from the ensemble screen, we
repeated docking calculations with higher exhaustiveness (<italic>E</italic> = 25). To further the reduce dimensionality of the data,
we introduced a binding affinity threshold of −10 kcal/mol
along the <italic>X</italic> and <italic>Y</italic> axes, resulting
in four quadrants. From these, we further analyzed ligands belonging
to the 2nd quadrant (Q2), thus including ligands that have the best
binding affinities for both the ensemble and the crystal structure.
We then clustered each ligand according to pairwise Tanimoto coefficient
distance (Tc = 0.3) using the Butina algorithm, an unsupervised statistical
approach optimized for clustering based on chemical similarities.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref></sup> Following this, the top-scoring ligands were
extracted from each cluster and subsequently ranked. For in silico
validation using molecular dynamics, we cherry-picked compounds based
on binding affinity, the number of molecules belonging to each cluster,
and favorable receptor interactions, resulting in an initial 31 compounds.
The starting coordinates for each of the 31 ligands were those of
the ligand docked to the crystal structure. The system was equilibrated
as described above, and a single 100 ns unrestrained production simulation
was performed for each ligand. To calculate relative solvation, we
averaged ligand heavy-atom RMSDs across the trajectory per 10 ps and
calculated RMSDs relative to the starting coordinates post-energy
minimization.</p>
      <p>Docking calculations were performed with Qvina2.
Chemical similarity clustering of compounds was conducted using the
RDkit Python library using in-house scripts (available on request).</p>
