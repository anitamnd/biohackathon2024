    <abstract>
      <p>Infections are a serious health concern worldwide, particularly in vulnerable populations such as the immunocompromised, elderly, and young. Advances in metagenomic sequencing availability, speed, and decreased cost offer the opportunity to supplement or even replace culture-based identification of pathogens with DNA sequence-based diagnostics. Adopting metagenomic analysis for clinical use requires that all aspects of the workflow are optimized and tested, including data analysis and computational time and resources. We tested the accuracy, sensitivity, and resource requirements of three top metagenomic taxonomic classifiers that use fast k-mer based algorithms: Centrifuge, CLARK, and KrakenUniq. Binary mixtures of bacteria showed all three reliably identified organisms down to 1% relative abundance, while only the relative abundance estimates of Centrifuge and CLARK were accurate. All three classifiers identified the organisms present in their default databases from a mock bacterial community of 20 organisms, but only Centrifuge had no false positives. In addition, Centrifuge required far less computational resources and time for analysis. Centrifuge analysis of metagenomes obtained from samples of VAP, infected DFUs, and FN showed Centrifuge identified pathogenic bacteria and one virus that were corroborated by culture or a clinical PCR assay. Importantly, in both diabetic foot ulcer patients, metagenomic sequencing identified pathogens 4–6 weeks before culture. Finally, we show that Centrifuge results were minimally affected by elimination of time-consuming read quality control and host screening steps.</p>

      <title>Author summary</title>
      <p>Currently, the gold standard for identifying pathogens that are causing infection is to attempt growth in culture followed by identification based on physical characteristics such as shape and metabolic profile. However, many organisms do not grow in culture or are overgrown by faster growing organisms that out-compete them. Another method to identify pathogens in infections is to sequence the DNA in the samples and use that DNA sequence to identify the pathogens present—a process called metagenomic sequencing. Analyzing clinical metagenomic data can be difficult given the amount of data generated, high levels of human DNA contamination and a lack of well-defined bioinformatics methods. In this study, three leading software tools were compared for identification and quantitation of microbes in metagenomic data. One tool, called Centrifuge, reliably identified microbes present at just 1% relative abundance while requiring less computer time and resources than the others to which it was compared. Moreover, we found that Centrifuge results changed minimally when time-consuming quality control and host-screening steps were eliminated. We also examined Centrifuge’s performance in real-word clinical data sets showing that Centrifuge identified the same pathogens as culture.</p>

    <title>Introduction</title>
    <p>Intubated, diabetic, and neutropenic patients are susceptible to infections, yet current culture-based methods for identifying pathogens from clinical samples often fail [<xref rid="pcbi.1006863.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>–<xref rid="pcbi.1006863.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Without diagnostic information, clinicians rely on empiric antibiotic therapy assuming that the organism is bacterial and susceptible to the selected antibiotic therapy. Metagenomic sequencing of clinical samples offers an approach that bypasses and overcomes many drawbacks of culture, however, mining the resulting metagenomic sequence can be slow and error-prone given the volume of reads, host read contamination, and lack of well-defined bioinformatics methods. We hypothesized that metagenomic sequencing and analysis with a recent k-mer based taxonomic classifier would provide rapid results while accurately matching both the known profiles of predefined samples and culture results from clinical samples. As such, the goal of our study was to assess three leading tools for taxonomic classification and quantitation of metagenomic data using clinically relevant datasets with an eye toward reducing computing time without sacrificing accuracy.</p>
    <p>The current gold standard for clinical diagnosis of infections relies on isolating organisms by culture-based methods followed by microscopic and phenotypic identification combined with drug resistance testing. Methods for identifying pathogens that rely on culture have several drawbacks including fastidious bacteria, the time required for growth in culture, and the difficulty targeting viruses, fungi, and parasites. Because of these problems, culture has a high failure rate when rare, fastidious or non-bacterial organisms are responsible. For example, in a study of neutropenic patients the efficiency of culture-based diagnosis of blood stream infections was found to be low, with only ~16% (609 of 3,756) of febrile neutropenic patients found to be culture positive [<xref rid="pcbi.1006863.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Compared to patients in whom no culture was taken, the hazard ratio of dying was nearly four-fold higher in culture-negative patients and higher still for culture-positive patients. The higher hazard ratio of dying in culture-negative patients suggests that many culture negative patients do indeed have an infection, and the high cost in lives when cultures fail.</p>
    <p>In contrast to culture, identifying pathogens directly from biological samples via DNA sequencing can overcome many of the limitations of culture-based identification and may improve the number and speed of diagnoses [<xref rid="pcbi.1006863.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1006863.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In such an analysis, both the identity and relative abundance of the organisms present are important, as well as detecting the presence of drug resistance genes. While k-mer based tools such as MASH, Libra, and SIMKA are useful for comparing metagenomic content, they do not produce abundance estimates [<xref rid="pcbi.1006863.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>–<xref rid="pcbi.1006863.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In contrast, read-by-read taxonomic classifiers such as Centrifuge, CLARK, and KrakenUniq can both identify and quantitate the organisms present in a metagenome. When applied to clinical samples, the rate of false positives and false negatives, as well as the speed and computational requirements for analysis are critical. For these reasons, direct analysis of pathogens using metagenomic methods, along with detection of drug resistance genes, has been referred to as the holy grail of molecular methods of infection diagnosis [<xref rid="pcbi.1006863.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p>
    <p>Presently, there are two metagenomic sequencing methods: marker gene sequencing and whole genome shotgun (WGS) sequencing [<xref rid="pcbi.1006863.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1006863.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Marker gene sequencing uses the 16S ribosomal RNA (16S rRNA) gene or other marker genes (e.g. the internal transcribed spacer region for fungi) to differentiate between bacteria or other targeted organisms based on variations in gene sequence. 16S rRNA sequencing and has been used extensively in microbiome surveys, as well as in the particular milieu of diabetic foot ulcer (DFU), ventilator acquired pneumonia (VAP), and bacteremia [<xref rid="pcbi.1006863.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>–<xref rid="pcbi.1006863.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Because marker gene sequencing uses PCR to amplify the target gene sequences, it can detect organisms even when significant background is present, however, 16S rRNA sequencing has important drawbacks with respect to clinical applications. Drawbacks include “blind spots” in identification (e.g. <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> versus <italic>Shigella flexneri</italic>) due to sequence similarity between species and the inability to identify drug resistance (e.g. methicillin resistant <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> versus methicillin-sensitive <italic>S</italic>. <italic>Aureus</italic>) [<xref rid="pcbi.1006863.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1006863.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In addition, detecting fungi requires different amplicons than bacteria, there are no universal primers for detecting viruses, and drug resistance detection requires specifically targeting the genes responsible with additional amplicons. Despite these limitations, 16S rRNA sequencing has been used to identify pathogens in bacteremia with increasing frequency [<xref rid="pcbi.1006863.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1006863.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. By comparison, metagenomic data can yield fundamental insight into complex mixtures of microbial communities, their abundance and functional potential (including antibiotic resistance), and representation across all domains of life, including viruses. However, because metagenomics data can contain tens of millions of reads, efficient classification algorithms need to be employed to ensure reasonable runtime and computational requirements.</p>
    <p>The potential of metagenomic WGS in clinical settings has been demonstrated in a broad range of infection scenarios including leptospirosis [<xref rid="pcbi.1006863.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], nosocomial transmission of a drug-resistant bacteria [<xref rid="pcbi.1006863.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], foodborne illness [<xref rid="pcbi.1006863.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], infectious disease outbreaks [<xref rid="pcbi.1006863.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], and recently in a prospective study of meningitis and encephalitis [<xref rid="pcbi.1006863.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Despite successes using metagenomic shotgun sequencing to identify pathogens, routine application in clinical settings requires accurate, efficient classification, minimizing sample contamination, and rapid sample analysis [<xref rid="pcbi.1006863.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1006863.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>–<xref rid="pcbi.1006863.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. For example, while a small group of studies have reported on high-throughput metagenomic sequencing for identifying pathogens from immunocompromised patients, the samples were not enriched for microbes, resulting in less than 1% of reads being pathogen-specific [<xref rid="pcbi.1006863.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1006863.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] dramatically reducing the diagnostic possibilities from the data [<xref rid="pcbi.1006863.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. To begin addressing these deficiencies, we developed a molecular approach to increase the proportion of pathogen-derived reads in samples and applied it to samples obtained from three groups of patients, those with: 1) ventilator acquired pneumonia; 2) infected diabetic foot ulcers that eventually resulted in amputation and 3) febrile neutropenia (FN) during anti-tumor therapy.</p>
    <p>While there are no standards for analyzing metagenomic WGS data obtained from clinical samples, there have been recent innovations in taxonomic classification algorithms that make it possible to rapidly quantify microbial species directly from reads in metagenomic datasets. McIntyre <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pcbi.1006863.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] evaluated the performance of three broad types of taxonomic classifiers based on alignment method, marker gene identification, and k-mer matches. Results showed that k-mer based algorithms, used in tools like CLARK [<xref rid="pcbi.1006863.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] and Kraken [<xref rid="pcbi.1006863.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], achieve high accuracy and reduced computational time compared to the other two classes of algorithms. These advantages make k-mer based classifiers particularly promising for the rapid identification and quantitation of pathogens in patient samples. Since the McIntyre study, new tools (Centrifuge [<xref rid="pcbi.1006863.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]) and updates of previous tools (KrakenUniq and CLARK) were released. Centrifuge implemented memory-efficient indexing based on the Burrows-Wheeler transform [<xref rid="pcbi.1006863.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1006863.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] and a Ferragina-Manzini (FM) index [<xref rid="pcbi.1006863.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] which allow storage of a large number of reference genome sequences without affecting Centrifuge’s memory requirements. KrakenUniq [<xref rid="pcbi.1006863.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] builds on the previously released Kraken by using the cardinality estimation algorithm HyperLogLog for counting the number of unique <italic>k</italic>-mers identified for each taxon thus enabling confirmation that a detected taxon has even coverage across its genome. Lastly, CLARK was found by McIntyre <italic>et al</italic>. to have both higher accuracy and precision than other state of the art classifiers while taking advantage of multi-core architectures. While these innovations are promising for the detection of pathogens in clinical samples, to our knowledge, no study has directly compared these new k-mer based classifiers or investigated their accuracy with clinical samples.</p>
    <p>Here we report the accuracy, sensitivity and computational requirements of three k-mer based taxonomic classification tools (CLARK, Centrifuge, and KrakenUniq) using a series of well-defined <italic>in silico</italic> and biological benchmark datasets [<xref rid="pcbi.1006863.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1006863.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1006863.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. We further report Centrifuge’s performance relative to culture in samples obtained from normal blood and patients. The clinical samples include (1) longitudinal ventilator exudate samples from two patients that developed VAP, (2) longitudinal curettage and tissue samples from two patients with infected DFUs that led to amputation, and (3) whole blood from three patients with FN. The clinical datasets were selected to show the spectrum of potential clinical infections ranging from: no infection (normal blood), infection with a single well-defined clinical microbe (VAP), polymicrobial infection (DFU), and infection with atypical pathogens (FN). Lastly, we tested the effect of quality control and host-screening on the classification of reads by Centrifuge. This work provides a foundation for analysis of metagenomic data from clinical samples using open-source software that requires minimal computational resources while providing rapid and accurate identification of pathogens. To promote reusability and further benchmarking, Centrifuge was added as a free web-based App in iMicrobe (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://iMicrobe.us">http://iMicrobe.us</ext-link>, [<xref rid="pcbi.1006863.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]) along with a benchmark dataset. In addition, singularity containers and source code for KrakenUniq (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/hurwitzlab/krakenuniq">https://github.com/hurwitzlab/krakenuniq</ext-link>) and Centrifuge (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/hurwitzlab/centrifuge">https://github.com/hurwitzlab/centrifuge</ext-link>) were placed in GitHub under the MIT open source license.</p>

With respect to abundance calculations, Centrifuge normalizes relative abundance by genome size after calculating the percent of reads classified to each organism, while CLARK and KrakenUniq simply report relative abundance as percent of reads classified for each organism. Three sets of binary bacterial mixtures were selected to represent taxonomic distances from the species to phylum-level. The mixtures represent a three-log range of relative abundance with each organism ranging from 0.1% to 99.9% of the mixture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006863.g001">Fig 1</xref>). Centrifuge, CLARK, and KrakenUniq correctly identified all four species present in the mixtures and misidentified a maximum of four percent of the reads in any of the 18 combinations sequenced (false positives, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006863.g001">Fig 1</xref>). Centrifuge was sensitive to the lowest relative abundance (0.1%) in three out of six opportunities, while CLARK and KrakenUniq identified the lowest relative abundance in two of six opportunities. CLARK and Centrifuge were equivalent in their accuracy of relative abundance, while KrakenUniq had particular difficulty estimating the relative abundances of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>flexneri</italic> and <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> due to its strategy of assigning reads that match closely related organisms to the next highest shared taxonomic level. Reads matching phage present in the mixtures were classified and quantitated by Centrifuge, CLARK and KrakenUniq separately from their host genomes and were not included in the relative abundance estimates of their hosts, thus reducing the number of reads assigned to their hosts. Despite the effect of phage matches and false positive classifications, the coefficient of determination (R<sup>2</sup>) for the three mixtures quantitated by Centrifuge was 0.99 for <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic>/<italic>S</italic>. <italic>flexneri</italic>, 0.99 for <italic>S</italic>. <italic>saprophyticus</italic>/<italic>S</italic>. <italic>pyogenes</italic>, and 0.96 for <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic>/<italic>S</italic>. <italic>saprophyticus</italic>. Similarly, the coefficients of determination for CLARK were 0.99, 0.99, and 0.995 while those of KrakenUniq were 0.43, 0.99, and 0.96. Importantly, Centrifuge and CLARK were able to discriminate between organisms as difficult to separate as <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> and <italic>S</italic>. <italic>flexneri</italic> while KrakenUniq could not.</p>

      <title>Accuracy of identification and abundance estimates in a staggered mock bacterial community</title>
      <p>The three classifiers were next compared using a more complex mock community of 20 bacterium present in varying relative abundances. As the standard KrakenUniq and Centrifuge databases did not contain <italic>Actinomyces odontolyticus</italic> and therefore could not detect this organism in the mock community, <italic>A</italic>. <italic>odontolyticus</italic> was removed from the analysis. All three classifiers were able to detect the presence of the remaining 19 organisms, however, CLARK reported five false positives (two <italic>Shigella sp</italic>., two <italic>Staphylococcus sp</italic>. and <italic>Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis</italic>) while KrakenUniq reported 9 false positives (three <italic>Shigella sp</italic>., two <italic>Staphylococcus sp</italic>., <italic>Escherichia albertii</italic>, <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic>, <italic>Streptococcus troglodytae</italic>, and <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic>). In contrast to CLARK and KrakenUniq, Centrifuge did not produce any false positives, and only reported additional hits to phages that infect the organisms present in the mock community. As with the binary bacterial mixtures, CLARK and Centrifuge had the most accurate relative abundance estimates, while KrakenUniq had a severe outlier (<italic>Streptococcus agalactiae</italic>) estimated as 1.54% when expected was 0.030%). The relative abundance of the 19 organisms in the mock community was graphed against their known abundance and R<sup>2</sup> values calculated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006863.g002">Fig 2</xref>). The R<sup>2</sup> values were nearly identical: 0.97 for CLARK, 0.96 for Centrifuge, and 0.95 for KrakenUniq. Overall, most estimated abundances made by Centrifuge and CLARK fell below the perfect fit represented by the dotted line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006863.g002">Fig 2</xref>, indicating they tended to overestimate relative abundance values, especially the lowest abundances. In contrast, KrakenUniq tended to underestimate the abundance values.

        <title>Normal blood negative controls identify background false positives and set detection thresholds for clinical samples</title>
        <p>To provide a negative control for metagenomic sequencing of clinical samples, whole blood was obtained from two healthy donors once a week for six weeks. When the samples were sequenced and analyzed using Centrifuge with a minimum relative abundance threshold of 1%, three skin commensal bacterium <italic>Streptococcus thermophilus</italic>, <italic>Propionibacterium acnes</italic>, and <italic>Lactococcus lactis</italic> were detected along with a synthetic construct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006863.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). Due to the extreme difference in genome size between <italic>H</italic>. <italic>sapiens</italic> and synthetic construct, the synthetic construct had high relative abundance despite a low number of reads classified. Thus, while <italic>H</italic>. <italic>sapiens</italic> accounted for 79–97% of the reads classified in the normal blood datasets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006863.g003">Fig 3B</xref>), it was calculated to be less than 2% relative abundance by Centrifuge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006863.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). Conversely, synthetic construct never accounted for more than 20% of the reads classified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006863.g003">Fig 3B</xref>) but had relative abundances of 87–99% after normalization by genome size in the relative abundance calculation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006863.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). An additional organism, <italic>Taylorella equigenitalis</italic>, was detected when organisms representing 1% of reads classified were examined. <italic>T</italic>. <italic>equigenitalis</italic> was considered a false positive due to either misclassification or laboratory/reagent contamination due to its appearance in both donors and no prior report of infection in humans. Synthetic construct has been seen in previous metagenomic analyses [<xref rid="pcbi.1006863.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], and the other three bacterium are known to arise in whole blood cultures due to contamination with skin commensals during sample collection. Thus, when the four bacteria above along with the synthetic construct were identified (in all cases as &lt;1% of reads classified) in any subsequent clinical samples, they were excluded. In addition, based on these results from the normal blood samples, subsequent clinical sample results were filtered at 1% relative abundance and 0.01% of total reads classified.</p>

        <title>Identification of pathogens in ventilator acquired pneumonia</title>
        <p>Intubated patients were followed longitudinally from the first day of intubation, with samples collected every two days. In contrast to the invasive bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) used to collect culture samples, samples for WGS were collected from an endotracheal exudate trap attached to the ventilator. Two patients that developed pneumonia were selected for WGS of their samples, and results were compared to culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006863.g004">Fig 4</xref>). On day one of intubation, Centrifuge identified only human reads in the sample from Patient 1.

        <p>Both VAP patients’ culture results identified not just <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic>, but MRSA, raising the question of whether WGS could identify the presence of the <italic>mecA</italic> gene responsible for methicillin resistance in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic>.

      <title>Identification of pathogens in longitudinal samples of infected diabetic foot ulcers</title>
      <p>Patients seen for treatment of diabetic foot ulcers were followed longitudinally. Two patients with infected ulcers that progressed (despite standard of care) to lower limb amputation were selected for WGS analysis and results were compared to culture. DFU samples consisted of curettage samples or necrotic tissue obtained during wound debridement. In three of the four VAP samples analyzed above, human reads constituted &gt;90% of the classified reads (<xref rid="pcbi.1006863.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). In an attempt to reduce human reads in subsequent analyses, a simple sample processing protocol was employed: pathogens were enriched by low speed centrifugations followed by filtering (described in methods). Despite pathogen enrichment steps, the first three DFU samples yielded the lowest number of non-human organisms classified by Centrifuge (<xref rid="pcbi.1006863.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>), possibly because the human DNA contamination was not from intact human cells, but instead arose from cell-free DNA released into the wound from necrotic tissue.</p>
      <p>In the first time point for Patient 1, WGS detected a low prevalence of <italic>Corynebacterium</italic> (1% relative abundance), while culture detected <italic>Corynebacterium</italic> (3+), <italic>Streptococcus sp</italic>. (1+), <italic>Haemophilus influenzae</italic> (3+), and mixed flora (3+) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006863.g005">Fig 5</xref>). Based on the culture results and clinical signs of infection, broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy was initiated. The wound continued to worsen despite antibiotic therapy, wound debridement, and proper wound care. After six weeks of antibiotic therapy the wound was not healing, and another culture detected only <italic>Corynebacterium</italic> (2+) and <italic>Staphylococcus simulans</italic> (1+). In contrast, WGS revealed a complete conversion of the wound microbiome to 100% <italic>Enterobacter hormaechei</italic>, a member of the <italic>E</italic>. <italic>cloacae</italic> complex [<xref rid="pcbi.1006863.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006863.g005">Fig 5</xref>). Four weeks later the wound continued to worsen, and the patient developed a fever, precipitating admission to hospital for impending sepsis and re-initiation of antibiotic therapy. A third culture sample was taken upon admission to hospital, this time detecting 3+ <italic>E</italic>. <italic>cloacae</italic> four weeks after WGS had detected it at time point 2. The third WGS analysis at this time again identified <italic>E</italic>. <italic>hormaechei</italic> as the sole organism in the wound (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006863.g005">Fig 5</xref>).

      <title>Identification of pathogens in whole blood from febrile neutropenia patients</title>
      <p>Three neutropenic leukemia/lymphoma patients self-reported to the University of Arizona Cancer Center clinic with fever and were diagnosed with FN. Blood cultures were ordered, at which time a whole blood sample was taken for WGS analysis. Three likely pathogens were identified by Centrifuge: <italic>Pseudomonas sp</italic>. with a relative abundance of 41% in Patient 1, human parvovirus B19 with a relative abundance of &gt;99% in Patient 2, and Torque teno virus with a relative abundance of 58% in Patient 3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006863.g006">Fig 6</xref>). For the two viruses detected, the number of reads classified to each was small relative to the total, however, as with the synthetic construct in the normal blood controls, Centrifuge compensated for their small genome sizes in the relative abundance estimates. Torque teno virus’s relative abundance was 51%, while representing only 1.6% of the reads classified, while human parvovirus had a relative abundance estimate of &gt;99%, while representing only 13.9% of the reads classified.</p>

      <p>Blood culture results for all three patients were negative, both at the time of WGS sample collection and in two subsequent blood cultures of each patient. Thus, the sequencing results could not be corroborated by culture. However, patient two was positive for human parvovirus in a clinical PCR test in the month before and after the WGS sample was obtained, supporting the WGS results. In FN Patient 1, the predominant <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> species identified was <italic>P</italic>. <italic>fluorescens</italic>. <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> has been reported as a false positive in a prior study of laboratory and reagent contaminants, and <italic>P</italic>. <italic>fluorescens</italic> is not generally considered a human pathogen.

      <title>Effect of quality control and to host read removal on taxonomic assignment and relative abundance estimates</title>
      <p>Quality control of sequence reads and removal of reads that align to the host genome are commonly done before taxonomic classification, adding to analysis time. We tested the effect of not performing quality control of sequence reads before Centrifuge analysis on the staggered mock bacterial community and the FN patient datasets. Eliminating quality control caused a single, low abundance false positive classification in the mock community, while causing viral reads to be preferentially removed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006863.s003">S1 File</xref>). Consequently, quality control was not performed for clinical sample analyses.</p>
      <p>We next compared three methods of removing host (human) reads on the taxonomic classification and relative abundance estimates of the FN samples (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006863.s004">S2 File</xref>). All three resulted in additional low abundance organisms being identified by Centrifuge. These organisms are likely spurious due the fact that removal of human reads greatly affected the percent of total reads that were classified to these organisms, and thus caused them to pass the filters set by the normal blood negative controls. Consequently, host read removal was not performed for any of the analyses reported.</p>

    <title>Discussion</title>
    <p>The first dataset used to assess the three classifiers was a series of binary bacterial mixtures chosen for their phylogenetic distance, and mixed so that each pair was combined across three logs of relative abundance. Centrifuge was able to discriminate the most closely related pair of bacteria, <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> and <italic>S</italic>. <italic>flexneri</italic>, even when one of the organisms was present as 0.1% of the mixture while KrakenUniq and CLARK failed to detect the lowest relative abundance of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>flexneri</italic>. As the proportion of <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> decreased, the relative abundance estimates for all three classifiers diverged from expected, so that the <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> estimate was &gt;1% when <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> was only 0.1% of the mixture. The same inaccuracy did not occur as the <italic>S</italic>. <italic>flexneri</italic> relative abundance decreased to 0.1%, suggesting Centrifuge misidentified a portion of the <italic>S</italic>. <italic>flexneri</italic> genome as <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> but not the other way around, while KrakenUniq and CLARK failed altogether. The difficulty classifying <italic>S</italic>. <italic>flexneri</italic> was further suggested by the fact that the false positive rate increased as <italic>S</italic>. <italic>flexneri</italic> relative abundance increased. One possible cause for more relative matches to <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> than <italic>S</italic>. <italic>flexneri</italic> is that <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> strains and isolates represent the most substantial fraction of the reference database. Another possibility is false positive identification of reads as <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic>, for example, McIntyre et al. [<xref rid="pcbi.1006863.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] saw similar false positive identification of <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> when using metagenomic classifiers on negative control sequences not belonging to any known organism. Although Centrifuge uses a modified FM-index to condense closely related genomes, the total file size of base pairs maintained (unique + shared based on ≥ 99% identity) exceeds the relative file size of all other species [<xref rid="pcbi.1006863.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] giving it a higher probability for matches. Centrifuge’s better performance with the <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic>/<italic>S</italic>. <italic>flexneri</italic> mixture suggests that Centrifuge’s use of a modified FM-index dampens the effect of multiple strains and isolate genomes, but the effect is still present for highly abundant organisms such as <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic>. In contrast to Centrifuge and CLARK’s abundance estimates, KrakenUniq classified the majority of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>flexneri</italic> and <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> reads to the family (<italic>Enterbacteriacae</italic>) level, only estimating 11.6% relative abundance of S. flexneri when it was in fact 99.9% of the sample. KrakenUniq’s assignment of the majority of the <italic>S</italic>. <italic>flexneri</italic>/<italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> reads to a higher taxonomic level results from its strategy for taxonomic assignment of reads. Specifically, reads from closely related organisms in which a read that could be assigned to multiple species are instead assigned to the nearest common taxonomic level. Therefore, the KrakenUniq abundance estimates are not strictly comparable to CLARK and Centrifuge without further analysis and re-calibration.</p>
    <p>Interestingly, phylogenetic distance did not predict the accuracy of Centrifuge and CLARK’s relative abundance estimates. Both were capable of reliably detecting organisms down to 1% abundance, regardless of phylogenetic distance. A reasonable assumption would be that as phylogenetic distance increases, the number of discriminatory k-mers would also increase and allow better classification of reads. Instead, both Centrifuge and CLARK had better sensitivity to the lowest relative abundance in the most closely related pair (<italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic>/<italic>S</italic>. <italic>flexneri</italic>) than the intermediate pair (<italic>S</italic>. <italic>pyogenes</italic>/<italic>S</italic>. <italic>saprophyticus</italic>) where both organisms only shared the same phylogenetic class (<italic>Bacilli</italic>). Overall, while Centrifuge and CLARK out-performed KrakenUniq in terms of relative abundance accuracy, CLARK proved the most accurate due to Centrifuge’s difficulty with correctly estimating <italic>S</italic>. <italic>pyogenes</italic> in the most distant phylogenetic pairing.</p>
    <p>One drawback of using Centrifuge for clinical pathogen identification is that Centrifuge separates strain-level counts, splitting reads among species strains, which required manually summing strain level abundances for reporting. Future iterations of Centrifuge could address this issue by re-analyzing the data with a reduced reference set of genomes based on the first round of analysis or using a reduced reference database. Lastly, current reference databases do not account for all of the extant microbial/viral diversity that may be present in patients as evidenced by <italic>A</italic>. <italic>odontolyticus’</italic> absence from the default Centrifuge and KrakenUniq databases. However, this issue can be addressed by database curation and the exponential growth in the number of microbial draft genomes available [<xref rid="pcbi.1006863.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>].</p>
    <p>In addition to KrakenUniq’s trouble separating clinically important bacteria, and KrakenUniq’s and CLARK’s reporting of false positives in the mock community, the processing time and computational resources required by KrakenUniq and CLARK were far greater than Centrifuge (<xref rid="pcbi.1006863.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Therefore, we focused on Centrifuge in the subsequent clinical analyses. The much larger RAM requirements for KrakenUniq and CLARK relative to Centrifuge (<xref rid="pcbi.1006863.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>) are consistent with a previous comparison of Kraken and Centrifuge (Kim et al. 2016), and the study in which McIntyre <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pcbi.1006863.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] reported CLARK’s RAM requirements were similar to Kraken’s. Given the greatly reduced computer system requirements for Centrifuge, analyses could run on a well-equipped personal computer (e.g. 18-core processors and 8GB RAM) compared to CLARK and KrakenUniq that require a server (e.g. 28-core processors and &gt; 256GB RAM) to achieve comparable speeds to those reported in <xref rid="pcbi.1006863.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. Future adoption of WGS approaches will be constrained by the total time from sample collection to delivery of results. This time could be reduced to 6–12 hours with current technology, thus putting a premium on the data analysis steps being as rapid as possible, preferably requiring only minutes to perform. The reduction in time and resources achieved by Centrifuge relative to the other taxonomic classifiers likely owes to its compression of the reference database [<xref rid="pcbi.1006863.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Thus, despite Centrifuge’s drawbacks such as separation of results to strain level and reporting phages separately from their hosts, Centrifuge's lower false positives, greater speed, and lower memory requirements suggests it may be a good starting point for clinical applications.</p>

      <title>Normal whole blood for false positive detection and background thresholds</title>
      <p>Six longitudinal whole blood samples from two donors were processed to deplete human cells (and thus human sequence reads in the datasets) by centrifugation and filtration similar to an approach that has been recently published [<xref rid="pcbi.1006863.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Despite the efforts to reduce human reads, the majority of classified reads were still human (normal blood donors, <xref rid="pcbi.1006863.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>), presumably because there was low biomass from other organisms in the normal blood as would be expected from such a sterile site. Despite well-documented issues with spurious results arising from reagent and laboratory contamination [<xref rid="pcbi.1006863.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], when organisms with relative prevalence below 1% were ignored, no credible organisms other than <italic>Homo sapiens</italic> were detected in normal blood. In addition, the three organisms that were identified in the normal whole blood (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006863.g003">Fig 3A</xref>) are all recognized skin commensals that are also detected by culture as a result of sample collection. Despite the possible advantages WGS over culture, skin contaminants will continue to present themselves since the whole blood sample collection method is the same. The approach of ignoring low prevalence organisms is a simple means of reducing spurious results, while other physical and statistical approaches have been developed [<xref rid="pcbi.1006863.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1006863.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] and will be of importance to developing reliable clinical tests in the future. Our results with normal blood stand in contrast to a much larger study [<xref rid="pcbi.1006863.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] in which normal blood was consistently found to contain predominantly <italic>Sphingomonas</italic> bacterial DNA. We note, however, that S<italic>phingomonas</italic> was found to be a consistent and significant contaminant of PCR master mix [<xref rid="pcbi.1006863.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], possibly explaining the detection of <italic>Sphingomonas</italic> in so many normal blood samples. Suppression and identification of spurious results, which appear to be much more likely when actual sample pathogen biomass is low or negative, (e.g., a patient with a fever is suspected of bloodstream infection but is actually febrile due to chemotherapy), will be a critical component of clinical applications of metagenomic sequencing.</p>

      <title>Pathogen detection in clinical samples</title>
      <p>Sixteen samples from seven patients were sequenced by WGS and analyzed with Centrifuge. In both VAP patients, culture samples were taken when pneumonia was diagnosed on day three, and all three organisms identified by culture were identified by WGS, despite the sample types being different (BAL versus endotracheal aspirate). The ability of WGS to detect the culture-identified pathogens from a non-invasive sample suggests the possibility of WGS-based surveillance of intubated patients to detect emergence of infection before pneumonia symptoms arise.</p>
      <p>In the first DFU patient, culture initially detected a number of specific organisms (<italic>Streptococcus sp</italic>., <italic>H</italic>. <italic>influenzae</italic>, <italic>Corynebacterium</italic>) and a vague number of others (“mixed flora”) while WGS only detected <italic>Corynebacterium</italic>. Following a course of broad-spectrum antibiotics, culture failed to identify the complete conversion of the wound to a single organism (<italic>E</italic>. <italic>Hormaechei</italic>, a member of the <italic>E</italic>. <italic>cloacae</italic> complex) that was detected by WGS. It was not until the third time point that culture identified <italic>E</italic>. <italic>cloacae</italic>, by which time the wound had progressed to the point that amputation was required. There was a similar conversion of the wound microbiome in Patient 2, in whom culture initially identified <italic>E</italic>. <italic>faecium</italic> and <italic>K</italic>. <italic>pneumoniae</italic>, while WGS only identified <italic>K</italic>. <italic>pneumoniae</italic>. Following a course of antibiotics targeting <italic>E</italic>. <italic>Faecium</italic>, the wound underwent a complete conversion to <italic>P</italic>. <italic>aeruginosa</italic> that was missed by culture until six weeks later, by which point the patient required an amputation. While both wounds were clinically infected from the start of observation, both underwent a profound change in their microbiomes that was detected by WGS weeks before culture. The drastic changes in the wound microbiomes were presumably a result of the antibiotic therapy initiated after the first culture results, with the wounds in both cases becoming dominated by organisms that were not susceptible to the antibiotics used. The results from the two DFU patients point to the possibility of improved wound surveillance by WGS.</p>
      <p>Lastly, Torque teno virus was identified in a cancer patient undergoing bone marrow ablation in preparation for a hematopoietic stem cell transplant. This finding highlights the possible value of the metagenomic sequencing approach as Torque teno virus has been investigated as a predictive marker for post-transplant complications [<xref rid="pcbi.1006863.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. In addition, Torque teno virus was also reported recently in a prospective study of the utility of WGS analysis in cerebrospinal fluid samples. The identification of Torque teno virus and human parvovirus (which was corroborated by a clinical PCR assay) in the FN patients indicates that the sample preparation methods used in this study can isolate and detect viruses.</p>

      <title>Identification of a drug resistance gene in a clinical sample</title>
      <p>Bacterial drug resistance is a serious worldwide human health problem [<xref rid="pcbi.1006863.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]; and its detection in clinical samples can be as important as a species-level identification. For example, detection of “methicillin-resistant gram-positive cocci” by culture is more relevant to clinical decision making than a detection of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> by WGS that misses the presence of <italic>mecA</italic>. To this end, we attempted to identify <italic>mecA</italic> in the three samples that were positive for <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> by WGS from the two VAP patients diagnosed with MRSA. Low coverage in two of the samples prevented detection <italic>mecA</italic>, but the sample from Patient 2 on day 1 of intubation had enough reads that the entirety of the <italic>mecA</italic> was covered. Interestingly, no culture sample was taken on day one, as the patient was not diagnosed with pneumonia until day three. Thus, WGS identification of MRSA on day one, two days before diagnosis of pneumonia, and from a non-invasive sample, supports the potential for WGS surveillance of intubated patients before symptoms of pneumonia arise. Also of note, was the ability of WGS to detect <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> even in the other two samples with low numbers of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> reads. For example, in the sample from which <italic>mecA</italic> was detected, the <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> relative abundance was 26% calculated from 619,389 reads classified as <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> out of a total of 2,719,033. In contrast, the day three relative abundance (when pneumonia was diagnosed, and MRSA detected by culture) was 10% calculated from just 962 reads classified as <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> out a total of 2,345,230. A recent prospective study using WGS and the same drug resistance identification tool used here was also successful in detecting drug resistance genes in samples of cerebrospinal fluid [<xref rid="pcbi.1006863.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Given the critical importance of drug resistance to the success of antibiotic therapy, the interplay between total number of reads obtained, number of reads classified to a pathogen, number of reads classified to the host genome, and the relative genome sizes involved will need to be carefully explored for successful clinical translation of WGS.</p>

      <title>Genome coverage of presumptive pathogens identified in FN patient samples</title>
      <p>We examined the genome coverage of the pathogens identified in the FN patients with the assumption that the genomes of the pathogens should be represented by consistent coverage, whereas uneven coverage could indicate insufficient evidence of organism presence. Parize et al. [<xref rid="pcbi.1006863.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] took a similar approach in which even distribution of contigs was used as part of the criteria to decide if a sample was deemed positive [<xref rid="pcbi.1006863.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Interestingly, Torque teno virus sequence found in Patient 3 had high coverage of only a ~500 base pair untranslated region of the genome. This highly conserved region has been suggested to be critical for viral replication, and may indicate an early replication event or the presence of sub-viral particles, a characteristic that has previously observed in Torque teno virus [<xref rid="pcbi.1006863.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. The evidence for sub-viral particles provided by the coverage analysis is the first from an <italic>in vivo</italic> sample.</p>

      <title>Host screening and quality control</title>
      <p>Although quality control of raw reads is imperative for variant calling and genome assembly, it takes considerable computing time and resources. In this study, we observed limited benefits of quality control regarding accurately identifying and quantifying the abundance of the bacteria in the staggered mock community (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006863.s003">S1 File</xref>, Fig A). Although quality control of reads eliminated a single false positive organism estimated at 2.3% relative abundance, quality control of reads from the FN data showed a bias toward removing viral reads (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006863.s004">S2 File</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1006863.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The limited effect of quality control on Centrifuge’s performance likely stems from the overall high quality of base calls on the Ion Torrent sequencer within the context of k-mer based classifiers. Clinical development of a tool such as Centrifuge will have to weigh the limited benefits of quality controlling data before analysis versus the bias toward the removal of viral reads and the time required to perform quality control.</p>
      <p>Despite efforts to enrich microbial/viral DNA by centrifugation and filtering, a large proportion of reads were still classified as human in the clinical samples, especially in the DFU samples where extracellular human DNA would be expected due to necrosis (<xref rid="pcbi.1006863.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Screening host reads by alignment to the human reference genome appears to be unnecessary and even detrimental as it caused additional likely spurious organisms to pass filtering (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006863.s004">S2 File</xref>). Given that reference genomes can contain sequences of mixed origin due to horizontal gene transfer, endogenous and integrated microbes/viruses, prophage in bacterial genomes, as well as library preparation and sequencing contamination, classifying reads without host screening appears to be the best compromise between preserving accuracy and the reduced speed of analysis.</p>

      <title>Conclusion</title>
      <p>In summary, our analyses suggest that Centrifuge, an open-source software for fast taxonomic classification, provides accurate identification and abundance estimates in clinically relevant metagenomes, while more efficiently using computational resources and time relative to competing tools. Centrifuge's ability to quickly assign taxonomy to reads, accurately represent the abundance of organisms such as viruses, and sidestep read quality control and host-screening make it a good candidate for classifying reads of clinically relevant organisms. Consequently, we have made Centrifuge and the bubble plot software used in the study available as Apps in iMicrobe (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://imicrobe.us/">http://imicrobe.us</ext-link>) to provide public streamlined access.</p>

        <p>VAP: Endotracheal aspirate (~1–5 ml) was longitudinally collected every 48h starting from time of intubation. Samples were placed in sterile 15 ml tubes and immediately frozen at –80°C until DNA isolation. DNA was isolated from the endotracheal aspirate obtained on days one and three (when both patients were diagnosed with pneumonia and BAL samples were taken for culture) of intubation with the QIAamp BiOstic Bacteremia DNA kit (Qiagen Inc., Germantown, MD, USA) and quantitated on a NanoDrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Technologies Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA). DNA was diluted to one ng/ml, and 10 ng used to prepare sequencing libraries.</p>
        <p>DFU: Curettage or necrotic tissue samples were collected during wound debridement for DFU patients during standard of care and placed in sterile sample collection containers. Samples were transferred to sterile 15 ml conical tubes (Fisher Scientific, Hampton, NH, USA), and 1 ml of sterile PBS was added followed by vortexing for 30 s. The liquid portion of the sample was drawn off followed by a human cell depletion protocol including three low speed centrifugations 50, 100, and 150 x g for 5 m, 5μm filtering, and a final 4000 x g centrifugation.

Isolated DNA was quantitated on a NanoDrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Technologies Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA), diluted to one ng/μl, and 10 ng used to prepare sequencing libraries.</p>
        <p>FN: Approximately 5 mL of whole blood were collected (K<sub>2</sub>EDTA BD Vacutainer tubes, catalog #367863 BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA) when blood cultures were ordered for each FN patient and transferred for processing within 2h of collection. Blood samples were diluted with an equal volume of sterile phosphate buffered saline, layered on Ficoll-Paque (GE HealthCare Life Sciences, Pittsburgh, PA, USA) and centrifuged for 20 minutes at 400 x g. Plasma was carefully drawn off, sacrificing some yield to prevent drawing up monocytes, and centrifuged three more times at 50, 100, and 150 x g for 5 minutes to further remove human cells. The plasma was passed through a five-micron filter, and finally centrifuged at 4000 x g to collect microbes.

The 109 reads were subsequently aligned to the <italic>mecA</italic> gene with BWA 0.7.17 and coverage data generated with the samtools (v1.2) depth tool to generate coverage values that were graphed in R v3.1.1 (R scripts: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/hurwitzlab/pathogens_in_clinically_relevant_samples/tree/master/S1_Fig">https://github.com/hurwitzlab/pathogens_in_clinically_relevant_samples/tree/master/S1_Fig</ext-link>).</p>

      <title>Genome coverage of suspected pathogens from febrile neutropenia patient samples</title>
      <p>Reads from FN samples were quality controlled as described above for the bacterial mixtures and staggered mock bacterial community. Following quality control, Bowtie2 [<xref rid="pcbi.1006863.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>] was used to map FASTQ reads (with option—very-sensitive) to reference genomes for the organisms identified by Centrifuge (<italic>Pseudomonas fluorescens</italic> accession: NC_012660.1, human parvovirus B19 accession: NC_000883.2, Torque teno virus accession: NC_015783.1). Coverage data was generated with samtools (v1.3.1, [<xref rid="pcbi.1006863.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]) depth tool from the resulting BAM files and visualized in R v3.1.1 (R scripts are available at: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/hurwitzlab/pathogens_in_clinically_relevant_samples/tree/master/7_depth_coverage">https://github.com/hurwitzlab/pathogens_in_clinically_relevant_samples/tree/master/7_depth_coverage</ext-link>).</p>
