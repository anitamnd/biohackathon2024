        <title>Motivation</title>
        <p>Pathway inference methods are important for annotating the genome, for providing insights into the mechanisms of biochemical processes and allow the discovery of signalling members and potential new drug targets. Here, we tested the hypothesis that genes with similar impact on cell viability across multiple cell lines belong to a common pathway, thus providing a conceptual basis for a pathway inference method based on correlated anti-proliferative gene properties.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="s2">
        <title>Methods</title>
        <p>To test this concept, we used recently available large-scale RNAi screens to develop a method, termed functional pathway inference analysis (FPIA), to systemically identify correlated gene dependencies.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="s3">
        <title>Results</title>
        <p>To assess FPIA, we initially focused on PI3K/AKT/MTOR signalling, a prototypic oncogenic pathway for which we have a good sense of ground truth. Dependencies for <italic toggle="yes">AKT1</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">MTOR</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">PDPK1</italic> were among the most correlated with those for <italic toggle="yes">PIK3CA</italic> (encoding PI3Kα), as returned by FPIA, whereas negative regulators of PI3K/AKT/MTOR signalling, such as <italic toggle="yes">PTEN</italic> were anti-correlated. Following FPIA, <italic toggle="yes">MTOR</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">PIK3CA</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">PIK3CB</italic> produced significantly greater correlations for genes in the PI3K-Akt pathway versus other pathways. Application of FPIA to two additional pathways (p53 and MAPK) returned expected associations (e.g. <italic toggle="yes">MDM2</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">TP53BP1</italic> for p53 and <italic toggle="yes">MAPK1</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">BRAF</italic> for MEK1). Over-representation analysis of FPIA-returned genes enriched the respective pathway, and FPIA restricted to specific tumour lineages uncovered cell type-specific networks. Overall, our study demonstrates the ability of FPIA to identify members of pro-survival biochemical pathways in cancer cells.</p>

    <title>1 Introduction</title>
    <p>Signal transduction pathways decode extracellular signals into appropriate biological responses, thereby regulating most cell processes. Components of signalling pathways form complex networks of biochemical reactions and are frequently dysregulated in diseases such as cancer, neurodegeneration and diabetes. Therefore, discovering new signalling pathway members is important to understand the mechanisms of cellular biological processes and to uncover new anti-cancer drug targets. Pathway inference methods used for this purpose are based on literature mining techniques (<xref rid="btac769-B33" ref-type="bibr">Prill <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="btac769-B40" ref-type="bibr">Turei <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>), on protein–protein interaction analysis (<xref rid="btac769-B8" ref-type="bibr">Choobdar <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2019</xref>; <xref rid="btac769-B35" ref-type="bibr">Singh <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>) or on the identification of co-correlated genes in transcriptomics data (<xref rid="btac769-B41" ref-type="bibr">van Dam <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2018</xref>). More recently, kinase networks have been mapped using phosphoproteomic markers of kinase–kinase associations (<xref rid="btac769-B18" ref-type="bibr">Hijazi <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2020</xref>; <xref rid="btac769-B38" ref-type="bibr">Terfve <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>).</p>
    <p>Despite these advances, assigning genes to pathways and reconstructing cell type-specific networks is still challenging (<xref rid="btac769-B40" ref-type="bibr">Turei <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>). Experimental approaches for pathway inference do not take into account protein function, whilst literature mining methods are influenced by gene popularity and reagent availability. We postulated that genes belonging to the same pro-proliferative pathway would produce the same anti-proliferative phenotypes across cell models when such genes are perturbed. Thus, analysis of pairwise correlated anti-proliferative signals in systematic genetic perturbation screens should reveal components of signalling pathways that regulate cell survival and proliferation.</p>
    <p>To test this concept, we developed a method named functional pathway inference analysis (FPIA), which uses gene dependency data (cell viability data as a function of genome-wide gene targeting) to reveal genes whose inhibition produces similar cell survival phenotypes across cell lines. This is distinct from previously published methods where the aim was to identify genetic or other perturbations correlated to gene dependencies (<xref rid="btac769-B31" ref-type="bibr">Park <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2022</xref>). To evaluate the performance of FPIA, we chose to examine the Class 1A phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-AKT signalling pathway as this is one of the most frequently dysregulated pathways in cancer (<xref rid="btac769-B3" ref-type="bibr">Bachman <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref rid="btac769-B7" ref-type="bibr">Boehm and Golub, 2015</xref>; <xref rid="btac769-B29" ref-type="bibr">Meyers <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>; <xref rid="btac769-B39" ref-type="bibr">Tsherniak <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>; <xref rid="btac769-B42" ref-type="bibr">Vanhaesebroeck <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="btac769-B45" ref-type="bibr">Yu <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>). This pathway is well characterized (<xref rid="btac769-B14" ref-type="bibr">Geering <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="btac769-B32" ref-type="bibr">Porta <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>); Class 1A PI3K consists of regulatory (<italic toggle="yes">PIK3R1</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">PIK3R3</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">PIK3R3</italic> isoforms) and catalytic (<italic toggle="yes">PIK3CA</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">PIK3CB</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">PIK3CD</italic>) subunits. When activated by upstream signals, such as those emanating from receptor tyrosine kinases (examples of which include EGFR and the insulin receptor), PI3K phosphorylates phosphatidylinositol 4,5 bisphosphate (PIP<sub>2</sub>) to produce phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5 trisphosphate (PIP<sub>3</sub>). This lipid second messenger nucleates protein complexes leading to the activation of an intracellular protein kinase cascade involving PDK1 (gene <italic toggle="yes">PDPK1</italic>), AKT1 and MTOR. The lipid phosphatase PTEN dephosphorylates PIP<sub>3</sub>, thus opposing and terminating PI3K signalling. The PI3K system therefore offers a system for which we have a good sense of ground truth and thus allows assessing the ability of FPIA to produce biologically meaningful results. FPIA was then further tested for its ability to return meaningful associations to p53 and MEK1.</p>

      <title>2.1 Data availability</title>
      <p>FPIA utilized as input cancer dependency datasets from the Cancer Dependency Map (DepMap) project—a collaboration of the Broad Institute (Cambridge, MA, USA) and the Wellcome Sanger Institute (Hinxton, Cambridgeshire, UK). Data produced by the DepMap project are made publicly available under a Creative Commons licence and are accessible through the portal (<xref rid="btac769-B7" ref-type="bibr">Boehm and Golub, 2015</xref>; <xref rid="btac769-B9" ref-type="bibr">Corsello <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2020</xref>; <xref rid="btac769-B29" ref-type="bibr">Meyers <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>; <xref rid="btac769-B39" ref-type="bibr">Tsherniak <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>; <xref rid="btac769-B45" ref-type="bibr">Yu <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>). Here, we used the ‘D2_Achilles_gene_dep_scores’ dataset containing 711 cell lines (in rows), 16 810 genes (in columns) and 31 tumour lineages (<xref rid="btac769-B26" ref-type="bibr">Marcotte <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>; <xref rid="btac769-B27" ref-type="bibr">McDonald <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>; <xref rid="btac769-B28" ref-type="bibr">McFarland <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2018</xref>; <xref rid="btac769-B39" ref-type="bibr">Tsherniak <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>); analysis of the <italic toggle="yes">PIK3CD</italic> gene was not included as it was absent in the dataset. The associated cell line sample data included DepMap ID, cell line display name and lineage type with three further lineage subtypes. Data were manipulated using the R programming language (v4.1.2) in RStudio (v1.4.1717).</p>
    </sec>
    <sec>
      <title>2.2 Correlation analysis function design</title>
      <p>FPIA implemented Pearson correlation analysis to assess the similarity in dependency data via three principal functions of the ‘<italic toggle="yes">cordial</italic>’ package constructed herein: <italic toggle="yes">cor_target_map()</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">cor_targets()</italic> utilized <italic toggle="yes">cor.test()</italic> of the <italic toggle="yes">stats</italic> R package to produce correlations for a vector of targets or a single target respectively, and <italic toggle="yes">cor_map()</italic> used <italic toggle="yes">pwcor()</italic> of the <italic toggle="yes">collapse</italic> R package to generate correlations for an entire dataset. Calculated significance levels (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic>-values) were subjected to the Benjamini–Hochberg multiple testing adjustment method with <italic toggle="yes">stats::p.adjust()</italic> to control the false discovery rate calculating <italic toggle="yes">q</italic>-values; ‘<italic toggle="yes">cordial</italic>’ functions have the capacity to set the adjustment method (parameter <italic toggle="yes">method</italic>) which is passed to <italic toggle="yes">stats::p.adjust()</italic> (<xref rid="btac769-B5" ref-type="bibr">Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995</xref>). The general method applied was to firstly filter and subset input data; secondly, perform correlation analysis calculating <italic toggle="yes">r</italic>-values and <italic toggle="yes">P</italic>-values with multiple testing adjustment; thirdly, construct the output by transforming the correlation matrix into a long data format (<italic toggle="yes">data.table</italic>) to facilitate downstream analysis. The ‘<italic toggle="yes">cordial</italic>’ package was designed to be flexible so as not to be dependent on the input data and as such it can be used for correlation analysis of datasets beyond the molecular/genetic screens studied in this research.</p>
      <p>Correlation analysis was performed in a vectorized and parallelized manner with the <italic toggle="yes">future</italic> package to provide the parallel backend, and vectorized mapping functions from the <italic toggle="yes">furrr</italic> package that process input in parallel (Vaughan and Dancho, 2021). Prior to function usage, a multisession plan (<italic toggle="yes">plan()</italic>) was created that generates multiple R sessions which resolve futures asynchronously (in parallel) in separate R sessions equal to the number of physical processor cores; for convenience, this process has been incorporated into the ‘<italic toggle="yes">cordial</italic>’ function <italic toggle="yes">start_parallel()</italic>. The input supplied was split, distributed to the workers and returned to the main R session to be combined once all chunks have been processed. This method of spawning multiple background R sessions ensures compatibility across all operating systems since the alternative of forking processes is not supported by Windows.</p>
      <p>The function arguments consisted of an input dataset (parameter <italic toggle="yes">dataset</italic>) containing values which may also include associated metadata, or alternatively an optional dataset can additionally be supplied that may hold the metadata instead (parameter <italic toggle="yes">metadata</italic>). The data structure for both inputs is a <italic toggle="yes">data.table</italic> as this allowed for the subsequent efficient filtering of rows and subsetting of columns. Filtering (parameter <italic toggle="yes">filter_rows</italic>) was programmed by taking the input and a named <italic toggle="yes">list()</italic>, whereby names specify column names to filter on, and performing a cross-join. If the dataset required subsetting to limit the correlations to be made (or omit non-numeric value columns) then a vector of column names can be provided (parameter <italic toggle="yes">select_cols</italic>). The resultant correlations of <italic toggle="yes">cor_map()</italic> are symmetrical, specifically pairwise correlations are produced between all combinations of the columns specified (parameter <italic toggle="yes">select_cols</italic>). Unlike <italic toggle="yes">cor_map()</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">cor_targets()</italic> takes an additional argument of a single target column name (parameter <italic toggle="yes">target</italic>). The function <italic toggle="yes">cor_target_map()</italic> calls <italic toggle="yes">cor_targets()</italic> internally which is mapped in parallel with <italic toggle="yes">future_map()</italic> to the argument of a vector of column names. In contrast with <italic toggle="yes">cor_map()</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">cor_target_map()</italic> creates non-symmetrical correlations, that is for each specified target column (parameter <italic toggle="yes">target</italic>), pairwise correlations are produced with the columns specified (parameter <italic toggle="yes">select_cols</italic>).</p>

    <sec>
      <title>2.3 Statistical analyses</title>
      <p>Statistical methods (from the package <italic toggle="yes">stats()</italic>) were used to determine the statistical significance of results and check assumptions were met. These included: Shapiro–Wilk test for normality (<italic toggle="yes">shapiro.test()</italic>), F-test for homogeneity in variances (<italic toggle="yes">var.test()</italic>) and Welch two-sample unpaired <italic toggle="yes">t</italic>-test (<italic toggle="yes">t.test()</italic>). Fisher <italic toggle="yes">z</italic>-transformation (<italic toggle="yes">psych::fisherz</italic>) of the Pearson correlation coefficient <italic toggle="yes">r</italic> was used prior to testing of statistical significance for the population correlation coefficient <italic toggle="yes">ρ</italic> to overcome the skewed distribution observed as the sample correlation coefficient <italic toggle="yes">r</italic> nears ±1.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec>
      <title>2.4 Hierarchical cluster analysis</title>
      <p>Hierarchical cluster analysis was performed to assess gene relationships. Dissimilarities of Euclidean distances of <italic toggle="yes">r</italic>-values from significantly correlated genes following Pearson correlation, which included self-correlations, were calculated with <italic toggle="yes">dist()</italic> and subsequently used for clustering. The linkage method applied Ward's minimal increase of sum-of-squares agglomeration method, corresponding to <italic toggle="yes">hclust(…, method = ‘ward.D2’)</italic>, which minimized within-cluster variance (<xref rid="btac769-B30" ref-type="bibr">Murtagh and Legendre, 2014</xref>). A clustered heatmap was subsequently created with <italic toggle="yes">Heatmap()</italic> of the <italic toggle="yes">ComplexHeatmap</italic> package (<xref rid="btac769-B16" ref-type="bibr">Gu <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>).</p>
    </sec>
    <sec>
      <title>2.5 Network analysis</title>
      <p>Network analysis of the gene correlations was conducted using the <italic toggle="yes">igraph</italic> package and the <italic toggle="yes">graph_from_data_frame()</italic> function (<xref rid="btac769-B10" ref-type="bibr">Csardi and Nepusz, 2006</xref>). The edge weight attribute (<italic toggle="yes">E(graph)$weight</italic>) was assigned as absolute <italic toggle="yes">r</italic>-value; the edge colour attribute (<italic toggle="yes">E(graph)$color</italic>) was assigned to the direction of the correlation (positive/negative); the edge width parameter (<italic toggle="yes">edge.width</italic>) was assigned inside the call to the plotting function <italic toggle="yes">plot.igraph()</italic> as −log<sub>10</sub>(<italic toggle="yes">q</italic>-value). The vertex (node) colour attribute (<italic toggle="yes">V(graph)$color</italic>) was assigned to being a target gene.

        <title>3.1.1 Identification of gene-specific canonical signalling pathways</title>
        <p>To assess the accuracy of FPIA as an unbiased pathway inference tool, we applied it to a set of 25 human target genes canonically associated with PI3K signalling as given by the KEGG pathways hsa04151: PI3K-Akt signalling pathway, or hsa04070: phosphatidylinositol signalling system. The dependencies of these 25 canonical PI3K genes across the 711 cell lines were correlated to the dependencies of the other 16 810 genes in the RNAi dataset in a pairwise manner using the <italic toggle="yes">cor_target_map()</italic> function in the ‘<italic toggle="yes">cordial</italic>’ package developed as part of this work. <xref rid="btac769-F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref> demonstrates proof of principle for gene dependencies associated with those for the <italic toggle="yes">PIK3CA</italic> gene, which codes for the p110α catalytic subunit of PI3K. Comparing this to RNAseq data as in previous work (<xref rid="btac769-B41" ref-type="bibr">van Dam <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2018</xref>), FPIA using dependencies from DepMap RNAi screens was able to identify the most strongly correlated genes as being significant, whereas the RNAseq-based analysis failed to do so (<xref rid="btac769-F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). Furthermore, this was reinforced by over-representation analysis of the top 25 <italic toggle="yes">PIK3CA</italic> significant correlations for each method, in which FPIA with RNAi, but not RNAseq, returned significant terms closely related to PI3K-AKT signalling (<xref rid="btac769-F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>).</p>

        <p>FPIA found 13 725 genes in the dataset (81.6%) that were significantly correlated (<italic toggle="yes">q </italic>&lt;<italic toggle="yes"> </italic>0.05) to target genes, of which 300 were in hsa04151 from the 342 hsa04151 genes present in the RNAi dataset, producing a pathway coverage of 87.7% (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. S1</xref>). The target gene with the greatest number of significant correlations in hsa04151 was <italic toggle="yes">INPPL1</italic> (91) followed by <italic toggle="yes">INPP5E</italic> (75), and this was transposed for significant correlations of genes corresponding to other pathways (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. S1</xref>). Both target genes belong to hsa04070, whereas the highest ranked for hsa04151 were <italic toggle="yes">PIK3R1</italic> (71) and <italic toggle="yes">PDPK1</italic> (69). <italic toggle="yes">INPPL1</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">INPP5E</italic> are involved in PI-associated signalling and thus can only indirectly influence AKT signalling by manipulating the pool of PI lipid substrates, whilst <italic toggle="yes">PIK3R1</italic> encodes a regulatory subunit of PI3K (<xref rid="btac769-B42" ref-type="bibr">Vanhaesebroeck <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>). Such gene products are consequently capable of exerting influence across multiple PI3K members within the pathway. The observed ranking is therefore consistent with the nature of molecular interactions of PI3K signalling nodes. To determine if PI3K target genes were more correlated to PI3K pathway members than to other pathways, we carried out a Pearson correlation <italic toggle="yes">r</italic>-value to Fisher <italic toggle="yes">z</italic>-transformation of significant correlations (<italic toggle="yes">q</italic>-value &lt; 0.05) followed by <italic toggle="yes">t</italic>-test of hsa04151 genes versus genes of all other pathways. This analysis revealed six target genes where the means of the significant correlations that belong to the pathway were significantly different to those of other pathways. Of these, <italic toggle="yes">MTOR</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">PIK3CA</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">PIK3CB</italic> exhibited means that were significantly greater for correlations to genes in hsa04151 than other pathways (<xref rid="btac769-F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>). Together, these results demonstrate that from only a small sample of target genes, FPIA is a useful method that capably identifies the majority of a canonical signalling pathway.</p>
        <p>To test the performance of FPIA in returning biologically meaningful associations further, we assessed the output of the approach when querying individual PI3K/AKT pathway members (<xref rid="btac769-F1" ref-type="fig">Figs 1A</xref> and <xref rid="btac769-F2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. S2</xref>). In agreement with the canonical understanding of PI3K signalling (<xref rid="btac769-B14" ref-type="bibr">Geering <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="btac769-B20" ref-type="bibr">Hutchinson <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref rid="btac769-B25" ref-type="bibr">Manning and Cantley, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="btac769-B32" ref-type="bibr">Porta <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>), FPIA showed that dependency to <italic toggle="yes">PIK3CA</italic> was positively correlated with dependencies to downstream kinases such as <italic toggle="yes">AKT1</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">MTOR</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">PDPK1</italic>, the transcription factor <italic toggle="yes">FOXA1</italic>, and the upstream PI3K activators <italic toggle="yes">ERBB2</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">ERBB3</italic>, as well as the ERBB2 regulator <italic toggle="yes">ERBIN</italic> (<xref rid="btac769-F1" ref-type="fig">Figs 1A</xref> and <xref rid="btac769-F2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. S2</xref>). Furthermore, the results were coherent with one another, as illustrated by <italic toggle="yes">AKT1</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">MTOR</italic> which were positively correlated with each other regardless of which gene was used as the target. This also applied to correlated genes that were not themselves queried such as <italic toggle="yes">ERBB2</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">ERBB3</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">SPDEF</italic> that were positively correlated with <italic toggle="yes">PIK3CA</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">AKT1</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">MTOR</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">PDPK1</italic>, which in turn were congruently positively correlated with each other. Similarly, dependencies to <italic toggle="yes">MTOR</italic> correlated to those for <italic toggle="yes">MTOR</italic> binding partners <italic toggle="yes">RAPTOR</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">RHEB</italic>. Additionally, dependencies to known negative regulators of the pathway, such as <italic toggle="yes">PTEN, TSC1</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">TSC2</italic>, reversely correlated with those to <italic toggle="yes">MTOR</italic> whilst being positively correlated with each other. Hierarchical cluster analysis revealed clear grouping that demarcated the direction of gene correlations (positive or negative) which was homogenous for all key target genes (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. S6</xref>). Furthermore, it demonstrated <italic toggle="yes">PIK3CA</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">AKT1</italic> to be less dissimilar than <italic toggle="yes">MTOR</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">PDPK1</italic>, causing the clustering of two groups, which followed the nature of their known interactions (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. S6</xref>). Overall, these results show that FPIA is able to return biologically coherent results and reproduce components associated to a canonical signalling pathway with high sensitivity.</p>
        <p>Beyond the ability to output known associations, significant gene correlations that were unknown from our canonical understanding of the target gene signalling network were also produced. <italic toggle="yes">PIK3CA</italic> dependencies across cells were positively correlated with those of <italic toggle="yes">ZNF574</italic> (<xref rid="btac769-F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>, <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. S2</xref>). While no experimental evidence in the literature exists for a functional interaction between <italic toggle="yes">ZNF574</italic> and PI3K signalling (a search in PubMed returned zero publications), there is support to suggest that this may be a true observation as both have similar mutation patterns in cancer (<xref rid="btac769-B1" ref-type="bibr">Ahn <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>; <xref rid="btac769-B2" ref-type="bibr">Arafeh and Samuels, 2019</xref>). Additionally, <italic toggle="yes">ZNF574</italic> is differentially upregulated in early-onset colorectal cancer versus late-onset, and <italic toggle="yes">PIK3CA</italic> mutations are elevated in early-onset hypermutated colorectal cancer cases (<xref rid="btac769-B1" ref-type="bibr">Ahn <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>; <xref rid="btac769-B6" ref-type="bibr">Berg <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>). The approach similarly returned associations of genes that are not part of the canonical PI3K/AKT pathway, but for which some experimental evidence exists for their biological relevance, such as with the kinase MAPKAPK2 found to be downstream of the PI3K/MTOR axis (<xref rid="btac769-B17" ref-type="bibr">Herranz <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>). These results illustrate the potential of FPIA to discover new components of pro-proliferative biochemical pathways and provide novel insights into signalling networks.</p>

        <title>3.1.2 Identification of tumour lineage-specific PI3K networks</title>
        <p>To obtain an insight into the distinct nature of signalling cascades in a tumour-specific context, we applied FPIA to the canonical PI3K gene set (KEGG pathway hsa04151) within individual tumour lineages. Of the 31 lineages represented in the dataset, 12 had a sufficient number of cell lines without missing values (<italic toggle="yes">n </italic>&gt;<italic toggle="yes"> </italic>4) for analysis. Although this represents a restriction, it is of the input dataset rather than the method and therefore will improve as more cancer models are studied. The three tumour lineages that cumulatively covered the greatest number of significantly correlated (<italic toggle="yes">q </italic>&lt;<italic toggle="yes"> </italic>0.05) genes in hsa04151 were lung, breast and skin (<xref rid="btac769-F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). This can be partly explained by those lineages possessing a larger proportion of cell lines which facilitated the generation of statistical significance. Nevertheless, the central nervous system lineage with the third largest number of cell lines only ranked seventh. The target gene with the most significant correlations in the lung lineage was <italic toggle="yes">PIK3R4</italic> (42), whereas in the breast it was <italic toggle="yes">PDPK1</italic> (21), whilst in skin it was <italic toggle="yes">INPP4B</italic> (21). The three topmost target genes ranked by number of significantly correlated genes were <italic toggle="yes">PDPK1</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">MTOR</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">PIK3R4</italic>, which contrasted from the gene-specific analysis in hsa04151 across all cell lines (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. S1</xref>). Moreover, the tumour-specific analysis revealed the prominence of each target gene in individual tumours as well as the relative influence of the pathway for each tumour type.</p>

        <p>To reveal a core PI3K network, we investigated the extent of conservation in cancer dependency in multiple lineages with pathway members possessing a similar dependency profile (<xref rid="btac769-F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>, <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. S3</xref>). These findings illustrate that certain genes associate in a ubiquitous manner and form part of a canonical (or core) network. Whereas, for others their functional interacting partners are specific to a given tissue or precise conditions, as observed with <italic toggle="yes">COL6A5</italic> which was significantly positively correlated with <italic toggle="yes">PIK3CA</italic> in colorectal cancer (<xref rid="btac769-F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>, <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. S3</xref>). <italic toggle="yes">COL6A5</italic> belongs to the collagen family and is a constituent of the extracellular matrix, where mutations are associated with colorectal cancer (<xref rid="btac769-B22" ref-type="bibr">Kim <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2021</xref>). These results are consistent with a recent study that used weighted correlation network analysis in oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma tissues to identify an association between collagen family members and the PI3K/AKT/MTOR pathway (<xref rid="btac769-B24" ref-type="bibr">Li <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2019</xref>). Thus, results from FPIA are aligned with the literature and have the potential to uncover core signalling networks as well as new cell type-specific pathway members.</p>

        <p>To investigate which lineages each target gene featured in, and the magnitude of their involvement, tumour lineages were ranked by counts of significant gene correlations. <italic toggle="yes">MTOR</italic> dependency was associated with other gene dependencies in 11 out of 12 lineages, with the largest number of associations being in lung cancers (<xref rid="btac769-F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>, <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. S3</xref>). In contrast, <italic toggle="yes">PIK3CA</italic> had significant dependency correlations in four lineages, of which breast held the most, followed by skin, lung and colorectal. Interestingly, consistent with these data, <italic toggle="yes">PIK3CA</italic> mutations are frequently found in breast cancers with 20–32% of tumours showing mutations in this gene, second only to endometrial cancers with 24–46% (<xref rid="btac769-B2" ref-type="bibr">Arafeh and Samuels, 2019</xref>). Also in line with our findings, <italic toggle="yes">PIK3CA</italic> mutation frequency in colorectal cancers is 13–28%, placing it as the fifth most frequently mutated gene in this malignancy (<xref rid="btac769-B2" ref-type="bibr">Arafeh and Samuels, 2019</xref>). Overall, our data show that FPIA may be used to identify the various cascades within a network that are likely to be involved in a given tumour type, thereby revealing sub-networks of pro-proliferative pathways and helping to rationalize differences in response to cancer treatment across tumour types.</p>

      <title>3.2 Network analysis of FPIA results identifies central nodes</title>
      <p>To better interpret the relationships between signalling constituents of specific gene targets returned as significant by FPIA, we integrated these interactions in a network graph. In order to visualize the network and reveal its structure, it was simplified to display only the topmost significant correlations for each target gene (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. S4</xref>). In agreement with the canonical understanding of the pathway, and with our previous results shown above, <italic toggle="yes">PIK3CA</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">AKT1</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">MTOR</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">PDPK1</italic> clustered most closely. To reveal which genes were the most influential, we calculated node degree centrality on the full network, whilst betweenness centrality was used to reveal vertices important in the flow of the network. The vertex with the largest betweenness centrality was <italic toggle="yes">INPPL1</italic>, mirroring the rank previously ascertained in <xref rid="btac769-F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> (<xref rid="btac769-F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). <italic toggle="yes">PIK3R1</italic> ranked uppermost of the PI3K regulatory subunits, whilst <italic toggle="yes">PIK3CG</italic> ranked highest among the catalytic subunits. <italic toggle="yes">INPPL1</italic> represents a counterbalance to <italic toggle="yes">PIK3CA</italic>-generated PIP<sub>3</sub>, enabling its redistribution along a path of further phosphatase-mediated metabolism. Unlike <italic toggle="yes">PTEN</italic> which reverses the lipid product back into a substrate for <italic toggle="yes">PIK3CA</italic>, the action of <italic toggle="yes">INPPL1</italic> effectively sequesters the substrate from <italic toggle="yes">PIK3CA</italic>, thereby limiting the impact of <italic toggle="yes">PIK3CA</italic> action. Therefore, <italic toggle="yes">INPPL1</italic> is of vital importance in signal transduction in the PI3K/AKT network. The genes identified with a higher betweenness represented those that featured on a greater number of shortest paths. The significance of this being that they are instrumental in enabling movement through the signalling pathway and could potentially be critical cancer vulnerabilities to exploit. The method of ranking vertices according to measures of centrality allowed the determination of the most influential genes in the common pathway agnostic of intra-pathway prior knowledge. This focuses them for further study by pharmaceutical targeting, or for novel associations by corroboration <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic>.</p>

      <title>3.3 FPIA identifies components of p53 and MAPK pathways</title>
      <p>To determine whether FPIA can return meaningful associations for genes other than those in the PI3K/AKT/MTOR pathway, we applied the method to p53 (gene name <italic toggle="yes">TP53</italic>) and MEK1 (gene name <italic toggle="yes">MAP2K1</italic>, a member of the MAPK pathway). Genes that positively or negatively regulate p53, including <italic toggle="yes">MDM2</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">MDM4</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">TP53BP1</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">CHEK2</italic>, were the most significantly associated genes with <italic toggle="yes">TP53</italic> (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. S5A</xref>). Similarly, the most significantly associated with genes to <italic toggle="yes">MAP2K1</italic> include upstream regulators of this kinase (<italic toggle="yes">BRAF</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">STK38</italic>) as well as downstream effectors [<italic toggle="yes">MAPK1</italic> (ERK2), <italic toggle="yes">RPS6K1</italic> (RSK) and <italic toggle="yes">MAPK6</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">EIF2AK2</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">CDK19</italic>] (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. S5B</xref>). Term over-representation analysis showed an enrichment of TP53 and MAPKK activity pathways in <italic toggle="yes">TP53</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">MAP2K1</italic>, respectively (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. S5A and B</xref>). In addition to these known members of p53 and MAPK axes, other genes with hitherto unknown roles in these pathways were also identified, highlighting the potential of FPIA for discovering new pathway members.</p>

    <title>4 Conclusion</title>
    <p>This work tested the hypothesis that genes with similar impact on cell viability across multiple cell lines belong to a common pathway, thus implying that the correlation of anti-cancer genetic dependencies may be used for biological pathway inference and for the annotation of genes with functional information. To test this idea, we developed a method termed FPIA to systemically determine correlated gene dependencies from large-scale gene silencing screens. Our gene-specific analysis revealed significant gene correlations within canonical signalling cascades with the potential to identify novel interactions. This was evident from inspection of PI3K, p53 and MEK1 correlated genes which returned the canonical pathway (<italic toggle="yes">AKT1</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">MTOR</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">PDPK1</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">PTEN</italic>, etc. for PI3K; ERK2, BRAF for MEK1; and MDM2 and TP53BP1 for p53), and by unbiased over-representation analysis in which the respectively associated pathways were enriched in the new unbiasedly identified network. Consequently, the FPIA method, and the associated <italic toggle="yes">cor_target_map()</italic> function of the ‘<italic toggle="yes">cordial</italic>’ package, provides insights into signalling pathways and may be used to uncover novel interactions in a global, genome-wide manner. A potential limitation of the method is that it relies on functional analysis of genes that impact cell viability and therefore it may only be applied to the discovery of members of pathways that regulate cell survival and the proliferative process. Nevertheless, since dysregulated cell proliferation is a key hallmark of cancer, and the aim of most anti-cancer drugs is to inhibit cell viability/proliferation, FPIA has the potential to advance our understanding of biochemical networks involved in cancer and to inform new therapeutic targets and approaches.</p>

        <title>Motivation</title>
        <p>Pathway inference methods are important for annotating the genome, for providing insights into the mechanisms of biochemical processes and allow the discovery of signalling members and potential new drug targets. Here, we tested the hypothesis that genes with similar impact on cell viability across multiple cell lines belong to a common pathway, thus providing a conceptual basis for a pathway inference method based on correlated anti-proliferative gene properties.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="s2">
        <title>Methods</title>
        <p>To test this concept, we used recently available large-scale RNAi screens to develop a method, termed functional pathway inference analysis (FPIA), to systemically identify correlated gene dependencies.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="s3">
        <title>Results</title>
        <p>To assess FPIA, we initially focused on PI3K/AKT/MTOR signalling, a prototypic oncogenic pathway for which we have a good sense of ground truth. Dependencies for <italic toggle="yes">AKT1</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">MTOR</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">PDPK1</italic> were among the most correlated with those for <italic toggle="yes">PIK3CA</italic> (encoding PI3Kα), as returned by FPIA, whereas negative regulators of PI3K/AKT/MTOR signalling, such as <italic toggle="yes">PTEN</italic> were anti-correlated. Following FPIA, <italic toggle="yes">MTOR</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">PIK3CA</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">PIK3CB</italic> produced significantly greater correlations for genes in the PI3K-Akt pathway versus other pathways. Application of FPIA to two additional pathways (p53 and MAPK) returned expected associations (e.g. <italic toggle="yes">MDM2</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">TP53BP1</italic> for p53 and <italic toggle="yes">MAPK1</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">BRAF</italic> for MEK1). Over-representation analysis of FPIA-returned genes enriched the respective pathway, and FPIA restricted to specific tumour lineages uncovered cell type-specific networks. Overall, our study demonstrates the ability of FPIA to identify members of pro-survival biochemical pathways in cancer cells.</p>

    <title>1 Introduction</title>
    <p>Signal transduction pathways decode extracellular signals into appropriate biological responses, thereby regulating most cell processes. Components of signalling pathways form complex networks of biochemical reactions and are frequently dysregulated in diseases such as cancer, neurodegeneration and diabetes. Therefore, discovering new signalling pathway members is important to understand the mechanisms of cellular biological processes and to uncover new anti-cancer drug targets. Pathway inference methods used for this purpose are based on literature mining techniques (<xref rid="btac769-B33" ref-type="bibr">Prill <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="btac769-B40" ref-type="bibr">Turei <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>), on protein–protein interaction analysis (<xref rid="btac769-B8" ref-type="bibr">Choobdar <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2019</xref>; <xref rid="btac769-B35" ref-type="bibr">Singh <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>) or on the identification of co-correlated genes in transcriptomics data (<xref rid="btac769-B41" ref-type="bibr">van Dam <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2018</xref>). More recently, kinase networks have been mapped using phosphoproteomic markers of kinase–kinase associations (<xref rid="btac769-B18" ref-type="bibr">Hijazi <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2020</xref>; <xref rid="btac769-B38" ref-type="bibr">Terfve <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>).</p>
    <p>Despite these advances, assigning genes to pathways and reconstructing cell type-specific networks is still challenging (<xref rid="btac769-B40" ref-type="bibr">Turei <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>). Experimental approaches for pathway inference do not take into account protein function, whilst literature mining methods are influenced by gene popularity and reagent availability. We postulated that genes belonging to the same pro-proliferative pathway would produce the same anti-proliferative phenotypes across cell models when such genes are perturbed. Thus, analysis of pairwise correlated anti-proliferative signals in systematic genetic perturbation screens should reveal components of signalling pathways that regulate cell survival and proliferation.</p>
    <p>To test this concept, we developed a method named functional pathway inference analysis (FPIA), which uses gene dependency data (cell viability data as a function of genome-wide gene targeting) to reveal genes whose inhibition produces similar cell survival phenotypes across cell lines. This is distinct from previously published methods where the aim was to identify genetic or other perturbations correlated to gene dependencies (<xref rid="btac769-B31" ref-type="bibr">Park <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2022</xref>). To evaluate the performance of FPIA, we chose to examine the Class 1A phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-AKT signalling pathway as this is one of the most frequently dysregulated pathways in cancer (<xref rid="btac769-B3" ref-type="bibr">Bachman <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref rid="btac769-B7" ref-type="bibr">Boehm and Golub, 2015</xref>; <xref rid="btac769-B29" ref-type="bibr">Meyers <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>; <xref rid="btac769-B39" ref-type="bibr">Tsherniak <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>; <xref rid="btac769-B42" ref-type="bibr">Vanhaesebroeck <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="btac769-B45" ref-type="bibr">Yu <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>). This pathway is well characterized (<xref rid="btac769-B14" ref-type="bibr">Geering <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="btac769-B32" ref-type="bibr">Porta <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>); Class 1A PI3K consists of regulatory (<italic toggle="yes">PIK3R1</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">PIK3R3</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">PIK3R3</italic> isoforms) and catalytic (<italic toggle="yes">PIK3CA</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">PIK3CB</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">PIK3CD</italic>) subunits. When activated by upstream signals, such as those emanating from receptor tyrosine kinases (examples of which include EGFR and the insulin receptor), PI3K phosphorylates phosphatidylinositol 4,5 bisphosphate (PIP<sub>2</sub>) to produce phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5 trisphosphate (PIP<sub>3</sub>). This lipid second messenger nucleates protein complexes leading to the activation of an intracellular protein kinase cascade involving PDK1 (gene <italic toggle="yes">PDPK1</italic>), AKT1 and MTOR. The lipid phosphatase PTEN dephosphorylates PIP<sub>3</sub>, thus opposing and terminating PI3K signalling. The PI3K system therefore offers a system for which we have a good sense of ground truth and thus allows assessing the ability of FPIA to produce biologically meaningful results. FPIA was then further tested for its ability to return meaningful associations to p53 and MEK1.</p>

      <title>2.1 Data availability</title>
      <p>FPIA utilized as input cancer dependency datasets from the Cancer Dependency Map (DepMap) project—a collaboration of the Broad Institute (Cambridge, MA, USA) and the Wellcome Sanger Institute (Hinxton, Cambridgeshire, UK). Data produced by the DepMap project are made publicly available under a Creative Commons licence and are accessible through the portal (<xref rid="btac769-B7" ref-type="bibr">Boehm and Golub, 2015</xref>; <xref rid="btac769-B9" ref-type="bibr">Corsello <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2020</xref>; <xref rid="btac769-B29" ref-type="bibr">Meyers <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>; <xref rid="btac769-B39" ref-type="bibr">Tsherniak <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>; <xref rid="btac769-B45" ref-type="bibr">Yu <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>). Here, we used the ‘D2_Achilles_gene_dep_scores’ dataset containing 711 cell lines (in rows), 16 810 genes (in columns) and 31 tumour lineages (<xref rid="btac769-B26" ref-type="bibr">Marcotte <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>; <xref rid="btac769-B27" ref-type="bibr">McDonald <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>; <xref rid="btac769-B28" ref-type="bibr">McFarland <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2018</xref>; <xref rid="btac769-B39" ref-type="bibr">Tsherniak <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>); analysis of the <italic toggle="yes">PIK3CD</italic> gene was not included as it was absent in the dataset. The associated cell line sample data included DepMap ID, cell line display name and lineage type with three further lineage subtypes. Data were manipulated using the R programming language (v4.1.2) in RStudio (v1.4.1717).</p>
    </sec>
    <sec>
      <title>2.2 Correlation analysis function design</title>
      <p>FPIA implemented Pearson correlation analysis to assess the similarity in dependency data via three principal functions of the ‘<italic toggle="yes">cordial</italic>’ package constructed herein: <italic toggle="yes">cor_target_map()</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">cor_targets()</italic> utilized <italic toggle="yes">cor.test()</italic> of the <italic toggle="yes">stats</italic> R package to produce correlations for a vector of targets or a single target respectively, and <italic toggle="yes">cor_map()</italic> used <italic toggle="yes">pwcor()</italic> of the <italic toggle="yes">collapse</italic> R package to generate correlations for an entire dataset. Calculated significance levels (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic>-values) were subjected to the Benjamini–Hochberg multiple testing adjustment method with <italic toggle="yes">stats::p.adjust()</italic> to control the false discovery rate calculating <italic toggle="yes">q</italic>-values; ‘<italic toggle="yes">cordial</italic>’ functions have the capacity to set the adjustment method (parameter <italic toggle="yes">method</italic>) which is passed to <italic toggle="yes">stats::p.adjust()</italic> (<xref rid="btac769-B5" ref-type="bibr">Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995</xref>). The general method applied was to firstly filter and subset input data; secondly, perform correlation analysis calculating <italic toggle="yes">r</italic>-values and <italic toggle="yes">P</italic>-values with multiple testing adjustment; thirdly, construct the output by transforming the correlation matrix into a long data format (<italic toggle="yes">data.table</italic>) to facilitate downstream analysis. The ‘<italic toggle="yes">cordial</italic>’ package was designed to be flexible so as not to be dependent on the input data and as such it can be used for correlation analysis of datasets beyond the molecular/genetic screens studied in this research.</p>
      <p>Correlation analysis was performed in a vectorized and parallelized manner with the <italic toggle="yes">future</italic> package to provide the parallel backend, and vectorized mapping functions from the <italic toggle="yes">furrr</italic> package that process input in parallel (Vaughan and Dancho, 2021). Prior to function usage, a multisession plan (<italic toggle="yes">plan()</italic>) was created that generates multiple R sessions which resolve futures asynchronously (in parallel) in separate R sessions equal to the number of physical processor cores; for convenience, this process has been incorporated into the ‘<italic toggle="yes">cordial</italic>’ function <italic toggle="yes">start_parallel()</italic>. The input supplied was split, distributed to the workers and returned to the main R session to be combined once all chunks have been processed. This method of spawning multiple background R sessions ensures compatibility across all operating systems since the alternative of forking processes is not supported by Windows.</p>
      <p>The function arguments consisted of an input dataset (parameter <italic toggle="yes">dataset</italic>) containing values which may also include associated metadata, or alternatively an optional dataset can additionally be supplied that may hold the metadata instead (parameter <italic toggle="yes">metadata</italic>). The data structure for both inputs is a <italic toggle="yes">data.table</italic> as this allowed for the subsequent efficient filtering of rows and subsetting of columns. Filtering (parameter <italic toggle="yes">filter_rows</italic>) was programmed by taking the input and a named <italic toggle="yes">list()</italic>, whereby names specify column names to filter on, and performing a cross-join. If the dataset required subsetting to limit the correlations to be made (or omit non-numeric value columns) then a vector of column names can be provided (parameter <italic toggle="yes">select_cols</italic>). The resultant correlations of <italic toggle="yes">cor_map()</italic> are symmetrical, specifically pairwise correlations are produced between all combinations of the columns specified (parameter <italic toggle="yes">select_cols</italic>). Unlike <italic toggle="yes">cor_map()</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">cor_targets()</italic> takes an additional argument of a single target column name (parameter <italic toggle="yes">target</italic>). The function <italic toggle="yes">cor_target_map()</italic> calls <italic toggle="yes">cor_targets()</italic> internally which is mapped in parallel with <italic toggle="yes">future_map()</italic> to the argument of a vector of column names. In contrast with <italic toggle="yes">cor_map()</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">cor_target_map()</italic> creates non-symmetrical correlations, that is for each specified target column (parameter <italic toggle="yes">target</italic>), pairwise correlations are produced with the columns specified (parameter <italic toggle="yes">select_cols</italic>).</p>
    </sec>
    <sec>
      <title>2.3 Statistical analyses</title>
      <p>Statistical methods (from the package <italic toggle="yes">stats()</italic>) were used to determine the statistical significance of results and check assumptions were met. These included: Shapiro–Wilk test for normality (<italic toggle="yes">shapiro.test()</italic>), F-test for homogeneity in variances (<italic toggle="yes">var.test()</italic>) and Welch two-sample unpaired <italic toggle="yes">t</italic>-test (<italic toggle="yes">t.test()</italic>). Fisher <italic toggle="yes">z</italic>-transformation (<italic toggle="yes">psych::fisherz</italic>) of the Pearson correlation coefficient <italic toggle="yes">r</italic> was used prior to testing of statistical significance for the population correlation coefficient <italic toggle="yes">ρ</italic> to overcome the skewed distribution observed as the sample correlation coefficient <italic toggle="yes">r</italic> nears ±1.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec>
      <title>2.4 Hierarchical cluster analysis</title>
      <p>Hierarchical cluster analysis was performed to assess gene relationships. Dissimilarities of Euclidean distances of <italic toggle="yes">r</italic>-values from significantly correlated genes following Pearson correlation, which included self-correlations, were calculated with <italic toggle="yes">dist()</italic> and subsequently used for clustering. The linkage method applied Ward's minimal increase of sum-of-squares agglomeration method, corresponding to <italic toggle="yes">hclust(…, method = ‘ward.D2’)</italic>, which minimized within-cluster variance (<xref rid="btac769-B30" ref-type="bibr">Murtagh and Legendre, 2014</xref>). A clustered heatmap was subsequently created with <italic toggle="yes">Heatmap()</italic> of the <italic toggle="yes">ComplexHeatmap</italic> package (<xref rid="btac769-B16" ref-type="bibr">Gu <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>).</p>
    </sec>
    <sec>
      <title>2.5 Network analysis</title>
      <p>Network analysis of the gene correlations was conducted using the <italic toggle="yes">igraph</italic> package and the <italic toggle="yes">graph_from_data_frame()</italic> function (<xref rid="btac769-B10" ref-type="bibr">Csardi and Nepusz, 2006</xref>). The edge weight attribute (<italic toggle="yes">E(graph)$weight</italic>) was assigned as absolute <italic toggle="yes">r</italic>-value; the edge colour attribute (<italic toggle="yes">E(graph)$color</italic>) was assigned to the direction of the correlation (positive/negative); the edge width parameter (<italic toggle="yes">edge.width</italic>) was assigned inside the call to the plotting function <italic toggle="yes">plot.igraph()</italic> as −log<sub>10</sub>(<italic toggle="yes">q</italic>-value). The vertex (node) colour attribute (<italic toggle="yes">V(graph)$color</italic>) was assigned to being a target gene. The vertex size parameter (<italic toggle="yes">vertex.size</italic>) was assigned in <italic toggle="yes">plot.igraph()</italic> as weighted vertex degree with <italic toggle="yes">strength()</italic>. Network groups were calculated in the <italic toggle="yes">plot.igraph()</italic> parameter (<italic toggle="yes">mark.groups</italic>) as connected components (<italic toggle="yes">groups(components(graph))</italic>). The layout of the network graph (<italic toggle="yes">plot.igraph(…, layout = layout_with_fr, …)</italic>) was the Fruchterman and Reingold force-directed layout where larger weight values (herein absolute <italic toggle="yes">r</italic>-value) produced shorter edges (<xref rid="btac769-B13" ref-type="bibr">Fruchterman and Reingold, 1991</xref>). Self-correlations were omitted to avoid self-loops. The analyses performed were <italic toggle="yes">degree()</italic> (the number of adjacent edges of a vertex) and <italic toggle="yes">betweenness()</italic> (the number of shortest paths through a vertex) (<xref rid="btac769-B10" ref-type="bibr">Csardi and Nepusz, 2006</xref>).</p>

      <title>2.6 Gene ontology over-representation analysis</title>
      <p>The output from <italic toggle="yes">cor_target_map()</italic> was studied by Term Enrichment Analysis of genes correlated to the target gene in Reactome (<xref rid="btac769-B46" ref-type="bibr">Yu and He, 2016</xref>) as previously described in <xref rid="btac769-B15" ref-type="bibr">Gerdes <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> (2021)</xref> (<ext-link xlink:href="https://github.com/CutillasLab/Term-Enrichment-Analysis" ext-link-type="uri">https://github.com/CutillasLab/Term-Enrichment-Analysis</ext-link>); the false discovery rate was controlled for by calculating <italic toggle="yes">q</italic>-values with the Benjamini–Hochberg method (<xref rid="btac769-B19" ref-type="bibr">Hochberg and Benjamini, 1990</xref>).</p>

        <p>To assess the accuracy of FPIA as an unbiased pathway inference tool, we applied it to a set of 25 human target genes canonically associated with PI3K signalling as given by the KEGG pathways hsa04151: PI3K-Akt signalling pathway, or hsa04070: phosphatidylinositol signalling system. The dependencies of these 25 canonical PI3K genes across the 711 cell lines were correlated to the dependencies of the other 16 810 genes in the RNAi dataset in a pairwise manner using the <italic toggle="yes">cor_target_map()</italic> function in the ‘<italic toggle="yes">cordial</italic>’ package developed as part of this work. <xref rid="btac769-F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref> demonstrates proof of principle for gene dependencies associated with those for the <italic toggle="yes">PIK3CA</italic> gene, which codes for the p110α catalytic subunit of PI3K. Comparing this to RNAseq data as in previous work (<xref rid="btac769-B41" ref-type="bibr">van Dam <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2018</xref>), FPIA using dependencies from DepMap RNAi screens was able to identify the most strongly correlated genes as being significant, whereas the RNAseq-based analysis failed to do so (<xref rid="btac769-F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). Furthermore, this was reinforced by over-representation analysis of the top 25 <italic toggle="yes">PIK3CA</italic> significant correlations for each method, in which FPIA with RNAi, but not RNAseq, returned significant terms closely related to PI3K-AKT signalling (<xref rid="btac769-F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>).</p>

        <p>FPIA found 13 725 genes in the dataset (81.6%) that were significantly correlated (<italic toggle="yes">q </italic>&lt;<italic toggle="yes"> </italic>0.05) to target genes, of which 300 were in hsa04151 from the 342 hsa04151 genes present in the RNAi dataset, producing a pathway coverage of 87.7% (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. S1</xref>). The target gene with the greatest number of significant correlations in hsa04151 was <italic toggle="yes">INPPL1</italic> (91) followed by <italic toggle="yes">INPP5E</italic> (75), and this was transposed for significant correlations of genes corresponding to other pathways (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. S1</xref>). Both target genes belong to hsa04070, whereas the highest ranked for hsa04151 were <italic toggle="yes">PIK3R1</italic> (71) and <italic toggle="yes">PDPK1</italic> (69). <italic toggle="yes">INPPL1</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">INPP5E</italic> are involved in PI-associated signalling and thus can only indirectly influence AKT signalling by manipulating the pool of PI lipid substrates, whilst <italic toggle="yes">PIK3R1</italic> encodes a regulatory subunit of PI3K (<xref rid="btac769-B42" ref-type="bibr">Vanhaesebroeck <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>). Such gene products are consequently capable of exerting influence across multiple PI3K members within the pathway. The observed ranking is therefore consistent with the nature of molecular interactions of PI3K signalling nodes. To determine if PI3K target genes were more correlated to PI3K pathway members than to other pathways, we carried out a Pearson correlation <italic toggle="yes">r</italic>-value to Fisher <italic toggle="yes">z</italic>-transformation of significant correlations (<italic toggle="yes">q</italic>-value &lt; 0.05) followed by <italic toggle="yes">t</italic>-test of hsa04151 genes versus genes of all other pathways. This analysis revealed six target genes where the means of the significant correlations that belong to the pathway were significantly different to those of other pathways. Of these, <italic toggle="yes">MTOR</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">PIK3CA</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">PIK3CB</italic> exhibited means that were significantly greater for correlations to genes in hsa04151 than other pathways (<xref rid="btac769-F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>). Together, these results demonstrate that from only a small sample of target genes, FPIA is a useful method that capably identifies the majority of a canonical signalling pathway.</p>
        <p>To test the performance of FPIA in returning biologically meaningful associations further, we assessed the output of the approach when querying individual PI3K/AKT pathway members (<xref rid="btac769-F1" ref-type="fig">Figs 1A</xref> and <xref rid="btac769-F2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. S2</xref>). In agreement with the canonical understanding of PI3K signalling (<xref rid="btac769-B14" ref-type="bibr">Geering <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="btac769-B20" ref-type="bibr">Hutchinson <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref rid="btac769-B25" ref-type="bibr">Manning and Cantley, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="btac769-B32" ref-type="bibr">Porta <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>), FPIA showed that dependency to <italic toggle="yes">PIK3CA</italic> was positively correlated with dependencies to downstream kinases such as <italic toggle="yes">AKT1</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">MTOR</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">PDPK1</italic>, the transcription factor <italic toggle="yes">FOXA1</italic>, and the upstream PI3K activators <italic toggle="yes">ERBB2</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">ERBB3</italic>, as well as the ERBB2 regulator <italic toggle="yes">ERBIN</italic> (<xref rid="btac769-F1" ref-type="fig">Figs 1A</xref> and <xref rid="btac769-F2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. S2</xref>). Furthermore, the results were coherent with one another, as illustrated by <italic toggle="yes">AKT1</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">MTOR</italic> which were positively correlated with each other regardless of which gene was used as the target. This also applied to correlated genes that were not themselves queried such as <italic toggle="yes">ERBB2</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">ERBB3</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">SPDEF</italic> that were positively correlated with <italic toggle="yes">PIK3CA</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">AKT1</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">MTOR</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">PDPK1</italic>, which in turn were congruently positively correlated with each other. Similarly, dependencies to <italic toggle="yes">MTOR</italic> correlated to those for <italic toggle="yes">MTOR</italic> binding partners <italic toggle="yes">RAPTOR</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">RHEB</italic>. Additionally, dependencies to known negative regulators of the pathway, such as <italic toggle="yes">PTEN, TSC1</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">TSC2</italic>, reversely correlated with those to <italic toggle="yes">MTOR</italic> whilst being positively correlated with each other. Hierarchical cluster analysis revealed clear grouping that demarcated the direction of gene correlations (positive or negative) which was homogenous for all key target genes (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. S6</xref>). Furthermore, it demonstrated <italic toggle="yes">PIK3CA</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">AKT1</italic> to be less dissimilar than <italic toggle="yes">MTOR</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">PDPK1</italic>, causing the clustering of two groups, which followed the nature of their known interactions (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. S6</xref>). Overall, these results show that FPIA is able to return biologically coherent results and reproduce components associated to a canonical signalling pathway with high sensitivity.</p>
        <p>Beyond the ability to output known associations, significant gene correlations that were unknown from our canonical understanding of the target gene signalling network were also produced. <italic toggle="yes">PIK3CA</italic> dependencies across cells were positively correlated with those of <italic toggle="yes">ZNF574</italic> (<xref rid="btac769-F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>, <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. S2</xref>). While no experimental evidence in the literature exists for a functional interaction between <italic toggle="yes">ZNF574</italic> and PI3K signalling (a search in PubMed returned zero publications), there is support to suggest that this may be a true observation as both have similar mutation patterns in cancer (<xref rid="btac769-B1" ref-type="bibr">Ahn <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>; <xref rid="btac769-B2" ref-type="bibr">Arafeh and Samuels, 2019</xref>). Additionally, <italic toggle="yes">ZNF574</italic> is differentially upregulated in early-onset colorectal cancer versus late-onset, and <italic toggle="yes">PIK3CA</italic> mutations are elevated in early-onset hypermutated colorectal cancer cases (<xref rid="btac769-B1" ref-type="bibr">Ahn <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>; <xref rid="btac769-B6" ref-type="bibr">Berg <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>). The approach similarly returned associations of genes that are not part of the canonical PI3K/AKT pathway, but for which some experimental evidence exists for their biological relevance, such as with the kinase MAPKAPK2 found to be downstream of the PI3K/MTOR axis (<xref rid="btac769-B17" ref-type="bibr">Herranz <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>). These results illustrate the potential of FPIA to discover new components of pro-proliferative biochemical pathways and provide novel insights into signalling networks.</p>

        <title>3.1.2 Identification of tumour lineage-specific PI3K networks</title>
        <p>To obtain an insight into the distinct nature of signalling cascades in a tumour-specific context, we applied FPIA to the canonical PI3K gene set (KEGG pathway hsa04151) within individual tumour lineages. Of the 31 lineages represented in the dataset, 12 had a sufficient number of cell lines without missing values (<italic toggle="yes">n </italic>&gt;<italic toggle="yes"> </italic>4) for analysis. Although this represents a restriction, it is of the input dataset rather than the method and therefore will improve as more cancer models are studied. The three tumour lineages that cumulatively covered the greatest number of significantly correlated (<italic toggle="yes">q </italic>&lt;<italic toggle="yes"> </italic>0.05) genes in hsa04151 were lung, breast and skin (<xref rid="btac769-F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). This can be partly explained by those lineages possessing a larger proportion of cell lines which facilitated the generation of statistical significance. Nevertheless, the central nervous system lineage with the third largest number of cell lines only ranked seventh. The target gene with the most significant correlations in the lung lineage was <italic toggle="yes">PIK3R4</italic> (42), whereas in the breast it was <italic toggle="yes">PDPK1</italic> (21), whilst in skin it was <italic toggle="yes">INPP4B</italic> (21). The three topmost target genes ranked by number of significantly correlated genes were <italic toggle="yes">PDPK1</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">MTOR</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">PIK3R4</italic>, which contrasted from the gene-specific analysis in hsa04151 across all cell lines (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. S1</xref>). Moreover, the tumour-specific analysis revealed the prominence of each target gene in individual tumours as well as the relative influence of the pathway for each tumour type.</p>

        <p>To reveal a core PI3K network, we investigated the extent of conservation in cancer dependency in multiple lineages with pathway members possessing a similar dependency profile (<xref rid="btac769-F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>, <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. S3</xref>). These findings illustrate that certain genes associate in a ubiquitous manner and form part of a canonical (or core) network. Whereas, for others their functional interacting partners are specific to a given tissue or precise conditions, as observed with <italic toggle="yes">COL6A5</italic> which was significantly positively correlated with <italic toggle="yes">PIK3CA</italic> in colorectal cancer (<xref rid="btac769-F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>, <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. S3</xref>). <italic toggle="yes">COL6A5</italic> belongs to the collagen family and is a constituent of the extracellular matrix, where mutations are associated with colorectal cancer (<xref rid="btac769-B22" ref-type="bibr">Kim <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2021</xref>). These results are consistent with a recent study that used weighted correlation network analysis in oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma tissues to identify an association between collagen family members and the PI3K/AKT/MTOR pathway (<xref rid="btac769-B24" ref-type="bibr">Li <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2019</xref>). Thus, results from FPIA are aligned with the literature and have the potential to uncover core signalling networks as well as new cell type-specific pathway members.</p>

        <p>To investigate which lineages each target gene featured in, and the magnitude of their involvement, tumour lineages were ranked by counts of significant gene correlations. <italic toggle="yes">MTOR</italic> dependency was associated with other gene dependencies in 11 out of 12 lineages, with the largest number of associations being in lung cancers (<xref rid="btac769-F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>, <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. S3</xref>). In contrast, <italic toggle="yes">PIK3CA</italic> had significant dependency correlations in four lineages, of which breast held the most, followed by skin, lung and colorectal. Interestingly, consistent with these data, <italic toggle="yes">PIK3CA</italic> mutations are frequently found in breast cancers with 20–32% of tumours showing mutations in this gene, second only to endometrial cancers with 24–46% (<xref rid="btac769-B2" ref-type="bibr">Arafeh and Samuels, 2019</xref>). Also in line with our findings, <italic toggle="yes">PIK3CA</italic> mutation frequency in colorectal cancers is 13–28%, placing it as the fifth most frequently mutated gene in this malignancy (<xref rid="btac769-B2" ref-type="bibr">Arafeh and Samuels, 2019</xref>). Overall, our data show that FPIA may be used to identify the various cascades within a network that are likely to be involved in a given tumour type, thereby revealing sub-networks of pro-proliferative pathways and helping to rationalize differences in response to cancer treatment across tumour types.</p>

      <title>3.2 Network analysis of FPIA results identifies central nodes</title>
      <p>To better interpret the relationships between signalling constituents of specific gene targets returned as significant by FPIA, we integrated these interactions in a network graph. In order to visualize the network and reveal its structure, it was simplified to display only the topmost significant correlations for each target gene (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. S4</xref>). In agreement with the canonical understanding of the pathway, and with our previous results shown above, <italic toggle="yes">PIK3CA</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">AKT1</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">MTOR</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">PDPK1</italic> clustered most closely. To reveal which genes were the most influential, we calculated node degree centrality on the full network, whilst betweenness centrality was used to reveal vertices important in the flow of the network. The vertex with the largest betweenness centrality was <italic toggle="yes">INPPL1</italic>, mirroring the rank previously ascertained in <xref rid="btac769-F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> (<xref rid="btac769-F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). <italic toggle="yes">PIK3R1</italic> ranked uppermost of the PI3K regulatory subunits, whilst <italic toggle="yes">PIK3CG</italic> ranked highest among the catalytic subunits. <italic toggle="yes">INPPL1</italic> represents a counterbalance to <italic toggle="yes">PIK3CA</italic>-generated PIP<sub>3</sub>, enabling its redistribution along a path of further phosphatase-mediated metabolism. Unlike <italic toggle="yes">PTEN</italic> which reverses the lipid product back into a substrate for <italic toggle="yes">PIK3CA</italic>, the action of <italic toggle="yes">INPPL1</italic> effectively sequesters the substrate from <italic toggle="yes">PIK3CA</italic>, thereby limiting the impact of <italic toggle="yes">PIK3CA</italic> action. Therefore, <italic toggle="yes">INPPL1</italic> is of vital importance in signal transduction in the PI3K/AKT network. The genes identified with a higher betweenness represented those that featured on a greater number of shortest paths. The significance of this being that they are instrumental in enabling movement through the signalling pathway and could potentially be critical cancer vulnerabilities to exploit. The method of ranking vertices according to measures of centrality allowed the determination of the most influential genes in the common pathway agnostic of intra-pathway prior knowledge. This focuses them for further study by pharmaceutical targeting, or for novel associations by corroboration <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic>.</p>

      <title>3.3 FPIA identifies components of p53 and MAPK pathways</title>
      <p>To determine whether FPIA can return meaningful associations for genes other than those in the PI3K/AKT/MTOR pathway, we applied the method to p53 (gene name <italic toggle="yes">TP53</italic>) and MEK1 (gene name <italic toggle="yes">MAP2K1</italic>, a member of the MAPK pathway). Genes that positively or negatively regulate p53, including <italic toggle="yes">MDM2</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">MDM4</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">TP53BP1</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">CHEK2</italic>, were the most significantly associated genes with <italic toggle="yes">TP53</italic> (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. S5A</xref>). Similarly, the most significantly associated with genes to <italic toggle="yes">MAP2K1</italic> include upstream regulators of this kinase (<italic toggle="yes">BRAF</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">STK38</italic>) as well as downstream effectors [<italic toggle="yes">MAPK1</italic> (ERK2), <italic toggle="yes">RPS6K1</italic> (RSK) and <italic toggle="yes">MAPK6</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">EIF2AK2</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">CDK19</italic>] (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. S5B</xref>). Term over-representation analysis showed an enrichment of TP53 and MAPKK activity pathways in <italic toggle="yes">TP53</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">MAP2K1</italic>, respectively (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. S5A and B</xref>). In addition to these known members of p53 and MAPK axes, other genes with hitherto unknown roles in these pathways were also identified, highlighting the potential of FPIA for discovering new pathway members.</p>

    <title>4 Conclusion</title>
    <p>This work tested the hypothesis that genes with similar impact on cell viability across multiple cell lines belong to a common pathway, thus implying that the correlation of anti-cancer genetic dependencies may be used for biological pathway inference and for the annotation of genes with functional information. To test this idea, we developed a method termed FPIA to systemically determine correlated gene dependencies from large-scale gene silencing screens. Our gene-specific analysis revealed significant gene correlations within canonical signalling cascades with the potential to identify novel interactions. This was evident from inspection of PI3K, p53 and MEK1 correlated genes which returned the canonical pathway (<italic toggle="yes">AKT1</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">MTOR</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">PDPK1</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">PTEN</italic>, etc. for PI3K; ERK2, BRAF for MEK1; and MDM2 and TP53BP1 for p53), and by unbiased over-representation analysis in which the respectively associated pathways were enriched in the new unbiasedly identified network. Consequently, the FPIA method, and the associated <italic toggle="yes">cor_target_map()</italic> function of the ‘<italic toggle="yes">cordial</italic>’ package, provides insights into signalling pathways and may be used to uncover novel interactions in a global, genome-wide manner. A potential limitation of the method is that it relies on functional analysis of genes that impact cell viability and therefore it may only be applied to the discovery of members of pathways that regulate cell survival and the proliferative process. Nevertheless, since dysregulated cell proliferation is a key hallmark of cancer, and the aim of most anti-cancer drugs is to inhibit cell viability/proliferation, FPIA has the potential to advance our understanding of biochemical networks involved in cancer and to inform new therapeutic targets and approaches.</p>
