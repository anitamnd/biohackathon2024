    <title>Background</title>
    <p id="Par20">Genomic structural variant(s) (SV(s)), including copy number variant(s) (CNV(s)), are an important source of genetic variation, and it is well established that large CNVs (typically &gt; 100 kb) are an important cause of many inherited human genetic diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Clinically accredited array comparative genome hybridization (aCGH) or single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) microarrays (MA) are currently first-line clinical laboratory tests used to diagnose patients with many rare genetic diseases. Especially common among these conditions are intellectual disability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] and autism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Depending on their probe density, aCGH and SNP MA detect CNV down to a resolution of ~ 50 kb and are, except for loss of heterozygosity regions, unable to detect copy number-neutral SV events, such as inversions or balanced translocations. Short-read whole genome sequencing (WGS) has emerged as a comprehensive test for diagnosing rare inherited genetic disorders. A small number of laboratories have obtained clinical accreditation (e.g., CLIA/CAP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], or ISO 15189 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]) for the identification of single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and short insertion or deletion variants (indels) (&lt; 50 bp) from WGS, where sensitivity and specificity often exceed 99% across most of the genome. Due to its broad and uniform sequencing coverage, WGS additionally has considerable potential to identify both small and large CNVs, with size ranging from smaller-than-single-exon, up to whole-chromosome aneuploidy, as well as copy-number-neutral SVs. Until recently, WGS analytical methods had imperfect sensitivity and specificity for detection of SVs, leading some groups to report that SV detection from WGS was not yet fit for use in clinical practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. There are now numerous recent reports using WGS to identify short CNV, affecting single genes, or even single exons as the cause of many monogenic disorders, suggesting considerable potential for short CNVs below the limit of detection of traditional MA to explain a proportion of previously undiagnosed patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The ability to find short, potentially pathogenic CNVs raises significant new interpretation challenges, as there are thousands of benign short CNVs in healthy individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p>
    <p id="Par21">For the detection of SVs and CNVs, short-read paired-end sequencing provides four main categories of evidence: changes in depth of coverage (DOC), reads with a gapped sequence alignment referred to as split reads (SR), reads-pairs with aberrant mapping orientation or distance referred to as discordant pairs (DP, Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a, b), and variant allelic fraction of heterozygous SNPs. Most CNV detection tools (e.g., CNVnator [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]) use only changes in DOC, while most popular SV detection tools (e.g., Lumpy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], Delly2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] and Manta [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]) use evidence from SR and DP to identify SVs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Used alone, each of these methods gives an incomplete picture. DOC methods work well for large CNVs with confidently mapped reads but perform poorly for shorter CNVs, and for regions with poorly mapped reads, or extreme GC content. Recent improvements in DOC methods have demonstrated high-quality CNV calling from WGS down to 10 kb [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. SR and DP can identify small CNVs and copy number-neutral SVs, often with base-pair precision, but perform poorly when supporting reads are ambiguously aligned, and suffer from reduced coverage at regions of extreme GC nucleotide composition. Previous studies have proposed to improve CNV and SV detection by integrating multiple variant callers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. These approaches often combine large numbers of individual CNV and SV callers to increase sensitivity, at the expense of specificity, complexity, and analytical cost, and do not address the challenges of variant visualization, annotation, and prioritization of rare variants.

    <p id="Par22">Manual assessment of individual candidate SVs remains critical, with many groups using Integrated Genome Viewer (IGV) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], or more specialized tools including svviz [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], SplitThreader [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], Ribbon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], or SVPV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. However, most of these tools are limited to visualizing read evidence from single samples, ignoring additional lines of evidence to assess the quality, and clinical relevance of each candidate SV.</p>
    <p id="Par23">The variants that cause inherited genetic diseases are typically very rare in the general population. Deriving a database of SV frequencies however is challenging, as there is currently no consensus on the method or technology used to detect CNVs or SVs from genomic data. Furthermore, most databases of CNVs, such as the database of genomic variants (DGV) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], include predominantly MA studies with varying resolutions making it difficult to determine whether partially overlapping CNVs represent the same event. To date, the most comprehensive resource of small and large CNVs derived from WGS is from the Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>], which was established using numerous CNV and SV callers. High-coverage whole genome sequencing data (30) has been recently generated from the openly consented participants from the 1000 genomes project [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], which will be an important open resource for CNV methods development.</p>
    <p id="Par24">Assessing the analytical performance of new SV detection methods is hampered by the lack of comprehensive and accurate reference call sets. While several validated SV datasets using the NA12878 reference cell line exist [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>], the concordance between three of them was only 33% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. This poor concordance is likely due to differences in the technology (e.g., MA, WGS, PCR) and analytical approaches used.

    <p id="Par25">To overcome the challenges associated with accurate CNV and SV detection for rare disease diagnosis, we have developed <italic>ClinSV</italic>, a SV integration, annotation, prioritization, and visualization framework.

Only samples passing sequencing QC were processed further, i.e., mean coverage &gt; 30x (coverage calculation according to Illumina technical note), &gt; 75% Q30 bases, and total yield &gt; 100 Gb. Sequence reads were aligned to the human genome reference assembly GRCh37 decoy using BWA MEM (v0.7.12-r1039, settings -M).

      <title><italic>ClinSV</italic> pre-processing and variant integration</title>
      <p id="Par28">Variants were processed individually or in batches of up to 15 samples. Discordant mapping read pairs (DP) and split reads (SR) were extracted from the sequence alignment file. To determine the upper and lower discordant mapping distance cutoffs, the mapping distance for all read pairs with normal mapping orientation in a sample region (1:1,000,001–5,000,000) was obtained by <italic>ClinSV</italic>. The read pairs were sorted by their mapping distance. Iterating through this list in descending order and summing the number of read-pairs, the upper cutoff was set to the mapping distance at an average coverage of 100 read pairs per Mb. The lower limit was obtained accordingly by iterating in ascending order. DPs were extracted from the whole BAM, using PE-SR-bam2bed.pl (part of <italic>ClinSV</italic>) and these cutoffs. SRs were extracted using the “extractSplitReads_BwaMem” script from Lumpy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] and further processed with PE-SR-bam2bed.pl, discarding reads mapping to NC_007605 or hs37d5, reads having more than one clipped part, reads having overlapping alignment parts, or the clipped part having more than one alignment in the SA tag. Coverage was assessed using the get_coverages.py script, and an excluded region file was generated to exclude regions with &gt; 300x coverage using the get_exclude_regions.py scripts from Lumpy. Lumpy v0.2.11 was run to detect genome-wide SV with the options -mw 3 -tt 0, using only the discordant and split reads. Resulting variant calls were annotated with depth of coverage (DOC, see the “<xref rid="Sec6" ref-type="sec">Depth of coverage annotation</xref>” section below). When joint-calling multiple samples, in case a deletion or duplication had DOC support only for some samples and others samples only having DP/SR, then such variants were outputted as two separate variant calls, one CNV and one copy neutral variant (CNV = 0).</p>
      <p id="Par29">CNVnator v0.3 was run in parallel using cnvnator_wrapper.py v.0.0.1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] with a window size of 100 bases. CNVnator calls spanning masked regions (marked with Ns in FASTA) of the genome were split, excluding the masked part. CNVnator calls were annotated with DP and SR showing the expected mapping orientation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] and being located within certain inner (towards the center of the CNV) and outer limits (flanking the CNV) of each breakpoint. The outer limit was set to 1% of CNV length but at least 1 kb and at most 5 kb. The inner limit was set to half the CNV length but at most 5 kb.</p>
      <p id="Par30">The genotype was assigned purely based on the DOC, since the percentage of DPs and SRs were found to be poor indicators for the actual genotype, due to repeats at breakpoints. A DOC normalized to the average coverage (abbreviated as DRA) between ≥ 0.2 and &lt; 0.8 or &gt; 1.2 and ≤ 1.75 were defined heterozygous (0/1) and a DRA &lt; 0.2 or &gt; 1.75 as homozygous (1/1). In case multiple samples were processed, CNVnator calls were first merged across samples requiring the same event type (gain or loss), and a reciprocal overlap of at least 70% or the non-overlapping parts of each call to be at most 200 bases. For merged calls, the average start and end coordinates, and call properties were calculated.

The DOC of a variant was normalized by the DOC of its flanking region (DRF to DOC ratio flanking) or the genome average (DRA). DRF was calculated by dividing the DOC within the variant by the average of both flanking regions of the same length as the variant. The DOC for the DRF and DRA computation was determined if possible from genomic regions with an average read mapping quality of ≥ 50 (Phred scale; max 60 for BWA MEM), unless less than one third of the variant length fulfilled this criterion, in which case no mapping quality cut-off was applied.</p>
      <p id="Par34">The average genome read coverage was estimated from a 10-Mb window (20,000,001 to 30,000,000) in each autosome, which was chosen to not overlap any centromeric or telomeric regions. The autosomal read coverage was set to the median coverage of the 10-Mb region across all autosomes. For the Y chromosome, the coverage was estimated from the two large unique regions (6,641,419–10,079,253 and 13,800,704–23,668,908) and for X the entire chromosome was used, to be robust against large copy number changes. To further increase the robustness of the sex chromosome coverage estimates, their coverage was rounded in fractions of 0.5 of the autosomal coverage.</p>
      <p id="Par35">SV calls from Lumpy and CNVnator were classified as CNV (CNV = 1) if DRA or DRF was &lt; 0.8 or &gt; 1.2.

      <title>Determining SV population variant allele frequencies</title>
      <p id="Par36">Five population allele frequency (PAF) estimates were calculated. Three were derived from a control cohort of 500 healthy Australian individuals as part of the Medical Genome Reference Bank [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>], one from gnomAD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] and one from the 1000 Genomes Project [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] (PAF1KG, Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S2).</p>
      <p id="Par37">One PAF derived from the MGRB cohort was based on the sum of DP and SR counts (referred to as PAFSU), another was based on the normalized read depth (referred to as PAFDRA), and the third was based on the actual Pass and High confidence variants (referred to as PAFV). MGRB variants were joint-called in batches of 15 samples. PAFSU was calculated in order to obtain an abundance estimate of variants with few DPs and SRs close to or below the detection threshold (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S3). PAFSU is computed from the sum of DP and SR supporting a variant (SU) and the corresponding sum of DP and SR in the control cohort (SUC) averaged by the number of control samples (NCS, PAFSU=SUC/SU/NCS). For example, if a variant has in total 10 supporting DPs and SRs, and if in the control cohort (<italic>n</italic> = 500), there are in total 200 matching DPs and SRs, then PAFSU is 4%. Control sample’s DPs and SRs had to be located within 1000 bases flanking each breakpoint and orientated corresponding to the SV type (DEL, DUP, INV). PAFDRA was calculated to obtain an abundance estimate for CNV in regions of segmental duplications lacking DPs and SRs often having imprecise boundaries or being fragmented (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S4). PAFDRA is obtained by counting the number of samples that show the same copy number change (gain or loss) over at least 90% of the CNV. To speed up the comparison process, the DRA of the control samples was summarized in adjacent intervals of 1000 bases. This summarized coverage was also used to compute the population coverage standard deviation. When determining concordant variants for assigning PAF1KG and PAFV, the variant type (DEL, DUP, INV) including the CNV state (CNV = 1 for gain or loss, CNV = 0 for copy number neutral calls) had to match. For copy number-neutral SV, each breakpoint position could deviate at most 1000 bases. For CNV, at least 20% of the reference variant length and 90% of <italic>ClinSV</italic> variant length had to match. For <italic>ClinSV</italic> variants smaller than 1000 bases, at least 70% of their length had to match.</p>

Additional SV annotation included the variant’s GC content and the sequence compression ratio (CR). The latter is a measure for the repetitiveness of a sequence and used to indicate tandem repeats. For this, the compressed sequence length (using perl Compress::Zlib) is divided by the actual sequence length. Accordingly, a tandem repeat region has a lower CR than a complex sequence. SVs were also annotated with previously published segmental duplications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>] obtained from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://genome.ucsc.edu">genome.ucsc.edu</ext-link>. In cases where more than one segmental duplication overlapped with an SV, the best matching was selected, which was defined as the one with the highest sum of overlap length (in % of variant length) and sequence similarity (in %, sum of both). For annotating SV with genes they affected, ENSEMBL genes release 75 for GRCh37 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>] excluding pseudogenes was used.

Variants were required to not overlap and respecting a 5-kb flanking region, prioritizing smaller over larger variants. Excluding 4 variants in masked regions of the genome build GRCh37, we obtained 2003 deletions and 467 duplications.

DNA samples were extracted using standard protocols and subjected to WGS as described above, although some samples with suspected Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease used KAPA Hyper PCR-free library preparation kits. Following WGS and <italic>ClinSV</italic> analysis, CNVs for each patient were filtered by PAF1KG &lt; 2% and PAFMGRB &lt; 2% and restricted to high or pass confidence. The analysis was mostly restricted to disease-specific curated gene lists, or virtual gene lists consistent with the patient’s presenting phenotype; CNVs were filtered to only those overlapping these genes. Where whole genome analysis was requested, the analysis was limited to currently described disease-associated genes in OMIM. To allow for breakpoint uncertainty analysis was restricted to genic regions within +/− 20% of the total CNV size from the CNV breakpoints. This 20% value was a conservative “upper bound” based on the assessment of measurement uncertainty of CNV size performed during the clinical validation. The measurement uncertainty of the CNV size ranged from 0 to 20.9% in CNVs analyzed (data not shown). As would be expected, CNVs with split read and discordant pair evidence showed lower uncertainty with a median 0.11%, whereas CNVs with only DOC evidence showed a higher uncertainty with a median of 6.54%. The supporting data for CNVs in genes located outside of the breakpoints defined by the variant callers were critically reviewed to determine if there was evidence for the inclusion of the gene. While there were no such results in this study that were clinically reportable, in such an event the CNV would be confirmed by an orthogonal method, such as MLPA, prior to reporting. Evidence for intronic CNV calls was critically reviewed to determine the likelihood of a) including genic material b) disrupting splicing. For example, if split read evidence clearly defines the breakpoints as within the intron, there is a low likelihood that the CNV extends to the exon. Intronic CNVs were assessed for their proximity to acceptor and donor splice sites. Branch point motifs were not considered in the assessment of CNVs.</p>

Samples can be analyzed individually or jointly in batches of up to 15 samples. CNVs larger than 50 bp were detected using three evidence types, DP, SR, and changes to DOC (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a), while copy number-neutral SVs were detected using just DP and SR. SRs generally allow detection of genomic breakpoints with base-pair resolution (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b). <italic>ClinSV</italic> integrates CNV calls from CNVnator [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], which uses evidence only from DOC, and Lumpy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], which uses evidence only from DP and SR. <italic>ClinSV</italic> then determines the level of SR and DP support for each candidate CNV from CNVnator and computes the change in DOC for each candidate CNV from Lumpy before merging overlapping calls (see methods).

Based on 30–40x WGS from Illumina HiSeq X, we defined the following criteria: High confidence CNVs are either large (&gt; 100 kb), or &gt; 10 kb with confidently mapped reads (i.e., average mapping quality &gt; 55 across the entire variant). These criteria reduce false positives due to segmental duplications (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S5, S6). Pass CNVs are either &gt; 10 kb or ≤ 10 kb with at least two supporting split or discordant read pairs. High confidence copy number-neutral SVs need at least 10 split or spanning read support, and at least one from each source, whereas Pass copy number-neutral SVs need at least 6 supporting reads.

        <p id="Par74">We compared the total set of MA calls from either clinical laboratory to <italic>ClinSV</italic> variant calls from WGS and initially found a concordance rate of 62–75% (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S13). We manually inspected all of the <italic>n</italic> = 95 calls found only by aCGH. In cohort B, 64 of the 70 calls found only by aCGH were located in regions of common copy number variation, which often coincided with multi-allelic CNV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>], where the WGS data was clearly diploid (no DOC, SR, DP, in regions with good mapping quality). Since aCGH uses a pool of DNA from controls as a comparator, if a CNV is a common deletion in the general population, then a diploid patient may have an erroneous CNV amplification called (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>c), and vice versa (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S10). While these 64 events represent false positive calls in the MA data, in clinical practice, common copy number variants are usually filtered out, and not reported. In the cohort A, 4/25 discordant calls were in regions with common CNVs, 4/25 were not reproduced on the dye swap, 13/25 had less than four aCGH probes, 3/25 had poor logR intensity deviation from normal (2n) or probe intensities with a high standard deviation (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S13). There was one CNV call made by the 60 K aCGH array, of just 528 bp with more than 4 probes, for which we find no supporting evidence in the WGS data. Taken together, there was at most 1 <italic>bona fide</italic> extra call made by clinical MA that was not identified by <italic>ClinSV</italic>.</p>
        <p id="Par75">The limited probe density of MA affects the precision of the size of the resulting CNV calls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. <italic>ClinSV</italic> on WGS data was able to improve the precision of 38 of the 214 concordant calls from the cohort B, by a total of 960 kb (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S11). <italic>ClinSV</italic> also identified additional large CNVs that were not found in the MA data. In cohort B, there were on average 193 Pass and High confidence extra CNV per patient &gt; 50 kb identified by <italic>ClinSV</italic>. Of these, 95% were in regions of frequent copy number variation in the population (population allele frequency &gt; 5%), and thus potentially deliberately excluded from the MA probe design. The other 5% (average 7 per patient) were in repeat regions (average MQ &lt; 34), which could thus be missed by MA due to challenges in designing probes for these regions, or false positives in the WGS data.</p>

      <title>Limitations of short-read based CNV detection</title>
      <p id="Par76">Despite all the improvements of short-read WGS based CNV detection over MA, short-reads have inherent limitations which can hamper CNV detection in some parts of the genome. We investigated why some CNV candidates lacked supporting SR and/or DP evidence (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>d, Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S12, S13) and found that many had pairs of near-identical repeats on either side of the breakpoints. We hypothesized that in this scenario, paired-end read alignment algorithms would prefer to map the read pairs closer together than flanking the CNV (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>e). In NA12878, 13% (625/4634) of CNVs had flanking local repeat structures. The repeats ranged between 30 and 4000 bp and mostly consisted of tandem repeats (TR) (75%) followed by SINE (13%) and LINE (6%) elements (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S14, S15). The average number of SR, DP, and repeat length generally decreased with increasing sequence identity (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S15c).</p>

      <title>Application to clinical genetic testing</title>
      <p id="Par77">Collectively, these data demonstrated that <italic>ClinSV</italic> could identify CNVs from 30–40x depth Illumina WGS data with high reproducibility, sensitivity, and low false positive rates. Furthermore, <italic>ClinSV</italic> enables the identification of copy-number-neutral SVs and overlapping DEL-DUP events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Ultimately these results were used to support the ISO15189 clinical accreditation of <italic>ClinSV</italic> for the analysis of CNVs from WGS data &gt; 50 bp, in patients with suspected monogenic conditions.</p>
      <p id="Par78">Following ISO15189 clinical accreditation in March 2018 through the diagnostic genomics laboratory, Genome.One, <italic>ClinSV</italic> was applied to 485 patients with a diverse range of phenotypes including development delay, heart disease, hearing loss, neurological disease, and kidney disease. Within this cohort, a total of 23/485 patients (4.7%) had clinically reportable CNV, 100% of which were orthogonally confirmed, 21 using MLPA and two confirmed in alternative laboratories. MLPA or Sanger did not confirm one additional potential pathogenic CNV which had been classified as inconclusive following manual inspection. Of the reported CNVs, 52.2% were pathogenic, 17.4% likely pathogenic, and 30.4% were classified as variants of unknown significance (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>, Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S14). The size range of the reported variants was between 500 bases to 1.5 Mb, with 35% being smaller than 10 k.

Twenty-three clinically reportable CNVs were identified and subsequently reported to the referring clinician.

      <p id="Par79">Four of the reported variants (ID 3, 5, 13, 22) were within genes associated with recessively inherited diseases, where the patients also had an additional rare SNV identified by WGS in the same gene, presumably in a compound heterozygous state: <italic>ERCC5</italic> (MIM133530), <italic>STRC</italic> (MIM606440), <italic>SYNE1</italic> (MIM608441), and <italic>DST</italic> (MIM113810).

    <title>Discussion</title>
    <p id="Par82">Here we have presented <italic>ClinSV</italic>, a platform that enables the accurate detection and interpretation of CNVs and SVs from short-read WGS, with a focus on identifying rare, pathogenic CNVs. To date, most approaches have treated CNV and SV identification as separate analytical challenges; however, as we have shown, there is substantial benefit in combining these approaches.</p>
    <p id="Par83">There are several features that contribute to <italic>ClinSV</italic>’s accuracy. First, it integrates complementary evidence from DOC, DP, and SR to obtain a comprehensive set of SVs and CNVs per sample. Secondly, the level of evidence supporting each candidate SV is combined with quality metrics to classify CNVs into high-, pass- and low-quality tranches. Excluding low-quality variants efficiently removed most false positives and kept the sensitivity high relative to other short-read callers. We posit that the poor performance of previous comparisons was due to low-quality CNVs affecting the overall quality. Thirdly, the filtration by numerous population allele frequency metrics calculated from a matched sequencing and software pipeline substantially reduced the number of candidate SVs from 5800 to an average of only 20 rare gene affecting variants per patient. Fourthly, the integrated visualization framework adds additional lines of supporting evidence from matched controls that facilitate manual inspection and further improves the performance of the method. And finally, the comprehensive quality control report is valuable to highlight when the quality of input WGS data is poor; WGS data with variability in sequencing coverage makes CNV identification very challenging and may be caused by degraded DNA or poor-quality sequencing libraries.</p>
    <p id="Par84">By comparing to extensive simulated data, benchmarking, and long-read sequencing data now available from the NA12878 and NA24385 cell lines, the analytical performance of <italic>ClinSV</italic> was strong. <italic>ClinSV</italic> detected 99.8% simulated pathogenic ClinVar CNVs &gt; 10 kb and 85.1% &lt; 10 kb. The increase in sensitivity for CNV &gt; 10 kb is due to confident DOC based calls despite the absence of supporting DP and SR, which can occur due to repeats at variant breakpoints.</p>
    <p id="Par85">For presumably benign duplications and deletions &gt; 10 kb the sensitivity was 97% (DEL GIAB1, DEL/DUP GIAB2) and &lt; 10 kb ranging between 46 and 88% depending on the variant type and dataset analyzed. It was also shown that a copy number gain variant calls in regions of segmental duplication could be confirmed via MLPA, although failing manual review. We hypothesize that such variants are underrepresented in currently available validation call-sets, due to the difficulty to detect them. The majority of SVs in healthy individuals are short and in tandem repeats. In contrast, previously reported pathogenic variants have a higher proportion of variants &gt; 10 kb (Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>, Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S7-S9). Long-reads are more sensitive for detecting short insertions and deletions in repeated regions of the genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. Large amounts of such variants are included in the GIAB2 standard. <italic>ClinSV</italic> was developed using patient and control data derived from TruSeq Nano (PCR-based) library chemistry from Illumina HiSeq X sequencers. As sequencing chemistry, including PCR-free approaches and sequencing technology is evolving, this may limit the general applicability of this approach. However, we assessed the performance on PCR-free sequencing libraries, and sensitivity was comparable, especially for CNV &gt; 1 kb. We recommend validating ClinSV<italic>ClinSV</italic> using data generated within your laboratory on the NA12878 cell line, and evaluating performance using the built-in quality control report that <italic>ClinSV</italic> provides.</p>
    <p id="Par86"><italic>ClinSV</italic>’s FPR was 1.5–4.5% overall, substantially outperforming other methods, and demonstrating good performance for CNV duplications, validated by long-read PacBio sequencing data. Variants passing manual inspection and for which an MLPA assay could be designed all validated. Finally, the reproducibility of high confidence CNV calls from <italic>ClinSV</italic> was 99.1%, and 85.0% for high and pass confidence variants. This reduction in reproducibility of Pass CNV (relative to High CNV) was usually due to variants with small number of supporting reads, close to the detection threshold, which occasionally fell below the automated detection cutoffs. This suggests that higher than 30–40x sequencing depth may improve reproducibility and increase the number of variant calls. The visualization of the region with a suspected variant may reveal additional supporting reads not sufficient to automatically call a variant.</p>
    <p id="Par87">One of the major challenges during the development of <italic>ClinSV</italic> was to obtain high confidence calls to benchmark our methods. Continued efforts by the community to share data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>], benchmark methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>], and standardize variant call sets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] are critical for methods development and will play an increasingly important part of translating genomics to the clinic. There are very few validated copy number-neutral SV, or sets of CNV duplications in NA12878 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] or other healthy controls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], so comprehensively assessing the performance of <italic>ClinSV</italic> and other software for these types of variants will require additional benchmarking resources to be developed. These may come from additional well-studied reference materials, studying very large cohorts with WGS, aggregating evidence from individual case reports, or benchmarking using cancer genome data. It will be an important goal to increase the number of validated copy number neutral structural variants in germline DNA to improve benchmarking of this class of genetic variant.</p>
    <p id="Par88"><italic>ClinSV</italic> was able to identify all pathogenic variants that were detected using MA by the two clinical laboratories participating in this study. The increased resolution of WGS compared to MA enables <italic>ClinSV</italic> to resolve large CNV with much higher precision, as well as identify thousands of CNV smaller than the resolution of MA, in addition to copy number-neutral SV. Absolute DOC measurements from WGS provide an advantage over relative quantification used in aCGH to accurately resolve the copy number level of regions frequently altered in the general population, often co-coinciding with multi-allelic CNV, which can include genes that are relevant to disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. In support of this high clinical utility, <italic>ClinSV</italic> has been used in a number of research studies, which have identified short, pathogenic CNV affecting single exons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], overlapping whole-gene deletion-duplications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], and in adult patients with mitochondrial disease (Davis et al.<italic>, in prep</italic>).</p>
    <p id="Par89">By applying <italic>ClinSV</italic> to an unselected clinical cohort within a clinically accredited diagnostic laboratory we have demonstrated the increased clinical utility of CNV calling from WGS data over that of MA. Of particular interest are the 7/16 likely pathogenic and pathogenic CNVs that would not be readily detectable by MA. One could argue that reducing the minimum number of consecutive probes to make a diagnostic call by MA could help resolve some of these CNVs; however, this would still only recover at most an additional two CNVs (ID 4, 11) at the cost of significantly increasing the false positive detection rate of the assay. These small CNVs would be intractable to genome-wide MA techniques due to size and due to the heterogeneity of the disease within this cohort beyond the scope of targeted assays such as MLPA. An additional, underappreciated feature of expanding the variant types detectable by WGS is the consolidation of different variant types into a single assay. Cases 3, 5, 13, and 22 show a compound heterozygous state where one affected allele is a CNV and the other is a single nucleotide variant. Depending on the heterogeneity of the presenting disorder, the availability of previous test results, and the reporting policies of the laboratory it is plausible that these variants, if detected by different methods at different laboratories may be interpreted as single hits in a recessive disorder, and be overlooked and considered merely a carrier status rather than a diagnostic result when taken as a whole. Most demonstrative of this are the variants identified in <italic>ERCC5</italic> in case 5 where the presenting condition was complex and heterogeneous, the CNV was well below the resolution of MA and (to our knowledge) there are no commercially available MLPA kits to test for such a deletion. Without simultaneous SNV and CNV detection by WGS this patient is likely to have remained undiagnosed. While there have been limited studies showing that WGS performs similarly well compared to MA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], to our knowledge this is the first publication showing clear clinical utility for genome wide CNV detection at higher resolution than MA.</p>
    <p id="Par90">The ability for <italic>ClinSV</italic> to identify short CNVs from WGS would represent an insurmountable interpretive challenge for clinical laboratories and researchers, without a way to differentiate the potentially pathogenic events from the thousands of polymorphic CNV present in all healthy individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. A critical advance of <italic>ClinSV</italic> is the use of matched population control data, with five complementary measures of PAF to prioritize rare CNV. The PAF measures derived from <italic>ClinSV</italic> calls in control (PAFV), gnomAD (PAFG), and the 1000-genomes project (PAF1KG) highlight the allele frequency of well-resolved CNV. Perhaps more importantly, the PAF developed from SR and DP raw data highlights genomic regions with ambiguous short-read-mapping, which are depleted from final CNV and SV calls, making this a powerful way to filter variants and common artifacts. Large CNVs affecting multiple genes can be interpreted as they currently are by cytogenetics and research laboratories, whereas smaller candidate CNVs should be assessed in the context of which genes are affected, the patient’s phenotype and family history, known gene-phenotype correlations, and sensitivity to gene dosage and haploinsufficiency. While recent recommendations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>] will help to standardize this interpretation, it should be noted that the clinical interpretations in the issued pathology reports were performed prior to the publication of these guidelines and were instead based on a combination of previous guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. When combined with segregation analysis using additional family members, there are typically fewer than 10 variants to inspect.</p>
    <p id="Par91">We have also shown that short-reads are limited in their ability to resolve a subset of SV with repeated sequences surrounding each breakpoint, particularly if no DOC evidence exists (as for copy number-neutral SV) or if the DOC is not sufficient on its own (as for CNV &lt; 10 kb). The most frequent repeat class found at breakpoints were tandem repeats and we hypothesize that these repeats may act as a catalyst to form SVs similarly as has been suggested for segmental duplications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>]. Long-read sequencing technologies including Oxford Nanopore and PacBio offer improved performance over repetitive elements, and aberrant GC%, and they can identify thousands of SV missed by short-read sequencing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. Long-read sequencing also enables complementary ways of detecting SV by using de novo assembly approaches, compared to the reference genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>]. Optical mapping is able to identify even larger SV often missed by current long-read sequencing technology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>]. Strand-seq is another very promising technology allowing resolving haplotypes and detection of structural variation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>]. It is able to outperform long reads, short reads, and optical mapping for uncovering large inversions including inversions flanked by repeats, which are particularly challenging groups of structural variants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>]. Today, however, for most clinical and research laboratories seeking a single test that can accurately identify all SNVs, indels, and most CNVs and SVs from a patient’s genome, long-read sequencing remains cost-prohibitive at the sequencing depths required to also obtain robust SNV and indel performance. Supplementing high-quality short-read sequencing with limited amounts of long-read sequencing for CNV detection or using strand-seq may become a promising approach in the clinic.</p>

    <title>Conclusion</title>
    <p id="Par92"><italic>ClinSV</italic> can accurately identify pathogenic CNVs and copy number-neutral SVs from short-read WGS data in the size range from 50 bp up to whole-chromosome aneuploidy, at a resolution far higher than existing clinical microarrays. Through its integration, filtration, annotation, and visualization framework, it accurately identifies high-quality CNVs and SVs from patient clinical genome data and presents the data in a clinician- and researcher-friendly output. We have demonstrated that <italic>ClinSV</italic> combined with 30–40x short-read WGS provides increased clinical utility over microarray, resolving an additional 4.7% of cases over the usual standard combination of WES/WGS and microarray. By combining WGS with clinical-grade methods for SNV, indel, CNV, and SV detection, it represents a comprehensive, single-test capable of diagnosing a larger portion of genetic disorders than even a combination of previous best methods.</p>
