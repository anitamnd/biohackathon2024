      <title>Abstract</title>
      <p>Recent advances in single-cell open-chromatin and transcriptome profiling have created a challenge of exploring novel applications with a meaningful transformation of read-counts, which often have high variability in noise and drop-out among cells. Here, we introduce UniPath, for representing single-cells using pathway and gene-set enrichment scores by a transformation of their open-chromatin or gene-expression profiles. The robust statistical approach of UniPath provides high accuracy, consistency and scalability in estimating gene-set enrichment scores for every cell. Its framework provides an easy solution for handling variability in drop-out rate, which can sometimes create artefact due to systematic patterns. UniPath provides an alternative approach of dimension reduction of single-cell open-chromatin profiles. UniPath's approach of predicting temporal-order of single-cells using their pathway enrichment scores enables suppression of covariates to achieve correct order of cells. Analysis of mouse cell atlas using our approach yielded surprising, albeit biologically-meaningful co-clustering of cell-types from distant organs. By enabling an unconventional method of exploiting pathway co-occurrence to compare two groups of cells, our approach also proves to be useful in inferring context-specific regulations in cancer cells.

    <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
    <p>Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and single-cell open-chromatin profiling help us to decipher cellular heterogeneity of activity of coding and non-coding genomic elements (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). The heterogeneity in the activity of genomic sites among single-cells is regularly used to estimate cellular composition in complex tissue, spotting rare cells and understanding the role of genes and transcription factors (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). However, new questions are being asked with the increase in throughput of scRNA-seq and single-cell open-chromatin profiling through ATAC-seq (single-cell assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin using sequencing). One such question is, how can we use single-cell transcriptome and epigenome profiles for new applications. Can single-cell epigenome and expression profile help in finding co-occurrence between the activity of a pathway and lineage potency of a cell? Can single-cell heterogeneity be used in choosing more specific target pathways for cancer therapeutics? The answers to such questions can be found by representing cell state-space of meaning functional terms which could also provide perspective about its role and dynamic behavior. However, most often tools meant for estimating the enrichment of gene-sets like GSEA (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>), use differential gene expression between two groups of cells, and such approach does not solve the purpose of studying heterogeneity of activity of pathways at single-cell resolution.</p>
    <p>Another category of methods like SVA (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>), RUV (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>), scLVM (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>) and f-scLVM (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>) provide relevance score for known and unknown dominating factors for a group of single-cells. Such methods do not provide enrichment and relevance of gene-sets in each single-cell like PAGODA (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>) and AUCell (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Earlier methods for aggregation of gene-expression in gene-sets were designed for microarray-based expression profiles (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>) which tend to have different distribution and low sparsity. Hence, PAGODA was designed to tackle issues of variable and high drop-out rate among single-cells for calculation of gene-set scores. However, PAGODA is very slow, and it is not designed to handle scRNA-seq data with a relatively less heterogeneous collection of cells (e.g. all cells of the same type). Whereas, AUCell has been primarily used for identification of cells with the activity of one or two gene-sets at a time and generally it is not used for other analysis-step for scRNA-seq profiles such as clustering and temporal ordering. The main hurdle in calculating enrichment of multiple pathways for each single-cell has been the default dependency on read-count data of genes. The read-count values in single-cell profiles are often zero due to true low expression (non-active regions) or dropouts. Dropouts are defined as undetected true expression (activity) due to technical issues. The statistical modelling of read-count of a gene (or genomic site) across multiple cells is a non-trivial task, especially for single-cell open-chromatin and scRNA-seq profiles due to variability in the dropout rate and sequencing depth among cells (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Moreover, before this study, there has been rarely any attempt to estimate pathway enrichment-scores for single-cells using their open-chromatin profiles for downstream analysis like clustering and pseudo-temporal ordering. Hence, there has been a need for a uniform method which can transform single-cell expression and open-chromatin profiles from both homogeneous and heterogeneous samples to gene-set activity scores.</p>
    <p>In this study, we have addressed the challenge of representing single-cells in terms of pathways and gene-set enrichment-scores estimated using scRNA-seq and open-chromatin profiles despite cell-to-cell variability in dropout of genomic regions and sequencing depth. Unlike previously proposed methods for scRNA-seq profiles, we do not try to normalize or scale read-count of a gene across cells using parametric distributions like Poisson or negative binomial. Scaling read-count across cells with variable dropout rate and sequencing depth increases chances of artefacts. Therefore, we use a common null model to estimate adjusted pathway enrichment scores while handling scRNA-seq profiles (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S1</xref>). Similarly, while using scATAC-seq profiles, we use the approach of highlighting enhancers by dividing read-counts of genomic sites with their global accessibility scores (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S1</xref>). We benchmarked our methods and null models for estimating single-cell gene-set enrichment using several published scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq datasets. We tried to explore how using pathway scores can improve temporal-ordering of cells. However, we found that there is bias in temporal-ordering methods towards using read-count and gene-expression directly. Hence, we developed a method to perform pseudo-temporal ordering of single-cells using their pathway scores and showed its utility in avoiding known covariates in the form of gene-sets. Further, we applied UniPath on different data-sets to achieve results which could not be found using gene-expression directly.</p>

      <title>Calculating Enrichment of gene-sets for scATAC-seq profiles</title>
      <p>Most of the regulatory sites in a cell, like insulators and active promoters tend to have high chromatin accessibility in the majority of cell types. However, to estimate differences among single-cells using open chromatin profiles, sites with cell-type-specific activity like enhancers could be more useful. Moreover, enhancers profiles can provide a more clear perspective about active pathways in a cell. Therefore, UniPath first normalizes the read-count of scATAC-seq profiles of each cell to highlight enhancers. For multiple organisms like human, mouse and Drosophila, bulk sample chromatin accessibility is available for many tissues and cell types. For example, for Human hg19 genome, we combined DNAse-seq and ATACseq peaks from ENCODE and IHEC consortiums (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>), to achieve more than 1 million sites and calculated accessibility scores of combined peak list (see supplementary methods). The accessibility score is calculated for a site as the proportion of cell types or samples in which it was detected as an open-chromatin peak.</p>

Thus, the method of highlighting enhancers using global accessibility score does not need any inter-cell tag-count normalization. Using global accessibility scores also makes it possible to have a uniform transformation of scATAC-seq read-count matrix from different scientific groups without re-calculating tag-counts using the aligned DNA fragments (bam or sam files) on a common peak-list.</p>
      <p>For every cell, the peaks having high normalized tag-count are selected and used as a set of positives (foreground) and the set of all peaks is used as background. Usually, we use a threshold of 1.25 above global accessibility score for choosing foreground peak, but it could vary depending on stringency needed. The chosen peaks in the positive set are highly likely to be enhancers and regulatory sites with cell-type-specific activity. Then for every peak, a most proximal gene within 1Mbp is found, and peaks which do not have any gene within 1Mbp is dropped. UniPath has an option for two statistical methods to estimate enrichment of gene-sets using foreground peaks, namely binomial and hypergeometric tests. With a binomial test, to calculate statistical significance (<italic>P</italic>-value) for a gene-set <italic>m</italic> whose genes appear proximal to <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>m</italic></sub> out of <italic>n</italic> peaks in foreground set, we use the formula:<disp-formula id="M2"><label>(2)</label><tex-math id="M10">\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

      <title>Normalization free Gene-set enrichment for single-cell expression</title>
      <p>For estimating the significance of enrichment of pathway (gene-set) using scRNA-seq, we use the logarithmic value of the expression (FPKM, TPM, RPKM, UMI-count) of genes and treat every cell independently from each other. Thus unlike other published methods, we avoid creating artefacts which can happen due to the unresolved issue of estimating the distribution of tag-count of a gene across multiple samples (or cells) for normalization. As scaling and normalization across different cells can create artefacts due to a variable level of noise and gene dropout rate among them. Rather, we use the widely accepted fact that within a sample (cell) non-zero expression (FPKM, TPM and RPKM) values of genes follow approximately log-normal distribution (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S2</xref>). We treated UMI-counts as expression, as UMI-counts are independent of gene-length bias (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). We modelled the distribution of log (gene-expression) as bimodal such that one mode corresponds to genes with zero count and other mode correspond to a normal distribution for genes with non-zero expression. Thus probability distribution function (pdf) for log (expression) value <italic>x</italic> in a cell can be written as<disp-formula id="M4"><label>(4)</label><tex-math id="M12">\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

Here, the fraction of genes with zero expression-value represents both true low expression as well as dropout (undetected expression). The variables μ and σ represent the mean and standard deviation respectively of logarithmic values of only non-zero expression (FPKM, TPM, UMI-count) in a single-cell. Thus, for every cell, we use its own value of μ and σ to convert the log scale value of non-zero expression of a gene into <italic>P</italic>-value (right-tailed) assuming Gaussian distribution. The reason for the conversion of gene-expression value to <italic>P</italic>-value is that it gives an advantage of combining them using Brown's method that can be used for <italic>P</italic>-values derived using Gaussian distribution.

      <p>This procedure leads to the calculation of combined <italic>P</italic>-value for each gene-set in every cell. Covariance between log-<italic>P</italic>-values of genes is calculated by using their values in all the cells in the same data-sets. In order to have robust estimate not affected by just one or two genes, we use a threshold of minimum five genes with non-zero expression to calculate a combined <italic>P</italic>-value for a gene-set. However, combined <italic>P</italic>-values could also have many unwanted effects from house-keeping genes, promiscuously enriched gene-set and multiple hypothesis testing. Hence, we corrected the <italic>P</italic>-values with a permutation-based test using a null model.</p>
      <p>In order to make a null model, we first randomly chose cells from multiple studies so that we can have an equal representation of multiple cell-type. The scRNA-seq profiles of these studies (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary table S5</xref>) were downloaded from recount2 database (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>), which provides counts/expression on the same ensemble gene list. The ensemble gene ids were converted to official gene symbols. Those ensemble genes whose official symbol was not available were dropped from the list. We performed hierarchical clustering of cells using genes selected on the basis of the criterion of coefficient-of-variation (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). We choose highly <italic>variable</italic> genes based upon the coefficient of variation in each bin when the genes are binned according to their mean value across all cells. In other words, we chose 500 features only for hierarchical clustering while making null model. Using dynamic cutting of the hierarchical tree, we achieved clusters (or classes) of cells. We chose 1000 pairs of cells such that in a pair the cells belonged to different clusters in hierarchical clustering based result. It was done to ensure heterogeneity in the null model. For each pair, we took an average expression value for all gene. Thus, the null model consisted of 1000 expression vectors (false cells), each being average of gene-expression profiles of two cells. For every false-cell vector in the null model, the combined <italic>P</italic>-values of gene-sets were calculated using the method mentioned above. Thus, for every pathway (gene-set) we achieved 1000 <italic>P</italic>-values corresponding to the number of false-cells in the null model. For a pathway (gene-set) to calculate adjusted <italic>P</italic>-value in the target cell, we take the proportion of cells in the null model, which had lower combined <italic>P</italic>-value than the target cell.</p>

      <title>UniPath's approach of temporal ordering of cells using pathway scores</title>
      <p>Nearly all methods for temporal-ordering of single-cells use read-count or gene-expression directly, however, gene-set scores have the potential to avoid covariate effect and provide weightage to meaning full pathway activity. Therefore, we developed a novel temporal ordering method which can work efficiently using the pathway scores of single-cells. Our method first performs hierarchical clustering of cells before finding the order among the clusters of cells, followed by distance weighting and learning minimum spanning tree. Such approach is based on the observation made by Zhicheng and Hongkai that applying minimum spanning tree detection directly on raw distances among cells like monocle-1 (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>) can lead to a false connection between cells due to noise or other bias (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). However, we do not follow Zhicheng and Hongkai's approach completely as it does not provide true ordering at single-cell resolution. Hence, we developed an approach, such that after initial clustering of cells using pathway scores, we shrink (or weight) distances among every cell pair based on their belonging-ness to the same class and using neighborhood index among their classes. To calculate neighborhood index among classes, we first find top <italic>k</italic> nearest neighbor for every cell. Then for every class, we count the number of times its cells have top k neighbors in other classes. For example, if cells in class <italic>A</italic> has total <italic>M</italic> neighbors in others classes out of which mb cells are from a class <italic>B</italic> then we calculate neighborhood index of <italic>A</italic> with <italic>B</italic> (<italic>A</italic> -&lt;<italic>B</italic>) as mb/M. We shrink the distances between the cells in class <italic>A</italic> and class <italic>B</italic> by mb/M. After two stages of shrinkage of distances among cells, we use a shrinked-distance matrix to find a minimum spanning tree. We plot the minimum spanning tree using the netbiov R library (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). The minimum spanning tree drawn using our approach has fewer chances to be influenced by noise as the distances among cells are shrunk using consensus information.</p>

      <title>Differential co-occurrence analysis</title>
      <p>We use a permutation test to estimate the significance of the difference of pathway co-occurrence among two groups of cells. For a pathway pair, we first calculate the difference between spearman correlation values of their enrichment scores (adjusted <italic>P</italic>-value) in two groups of cells. We call it a true difference. We perform random-shuffling of group-labels of cells and calculate the difference in spearman-correlation of enrichment scores among two shuffled groups. Thus, for a pair of pathways, we make a collection of a set of false-difference in correlations using shuffled groups. The <italic>P</italic>-value is calculated as a fraction of false-differences which are greater than the true difference in term of absolute value. Notice that, here, we use spearman correlation of adjusted <italic>P</italic>-value (pathway score), not just the combined <italic>P</italic>-value of gene-sets. Using adjusted <italic>P</italic>-value increases robustness as it becomes rank based scores which helps in filtering out effect due to only one or two genes. Thus, if two pathways are correlated using their adjusted <italic>P</italic>-value, the correlation has less chance to be affected by only one or two genes or outliers.</p>

    <title>RESULTS</title>
    <p>For transforming scRNA-seq profiles to pathway scores, we treat each cell separately. Generally, in a single-cell, RPKM (read per Kilobase per million) or FPKM (fragment per kilo per million) value of genes have a bimodal distribution, where one of the modes is around zero, and other is for non-zero expression values. We used widely and theoretically accepted assumption that most of the time, non-zero RPKM and FPKM values within a sample (or cell) follow log-normal distribution (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). For a single-cell, we convert non-zero expression values (FPKM, RPKM, TPM, UMI-counts) of genes to <italic>P</italic>-values (right-tailed) using log-normal distribution (see Materials and Methods). UMI-counts do not need to be divided by gene-length to calculate gene-expression values (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>); hence we use log-transformed UMI-counts to calculate <italic>P</italic>-values. The assumption of log-normal distribution for non-zero gene-expression values for a cell also has support from a report by Furusawa <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>) on the ubiquity of log-normal distributions in intra-cellular reaction dynamics. Moreover, skewed distributions often fit log-normal (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>), which is also reflected by quantile–quantile (<italic>q</italic>–<italic>q</italic>) plots for FPKM, TPM and UMI-counts shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S2</xref>. We apply Brown's method to combine <italic>P</italic>-values of genes in a gene-set to reduce the effect of covariation among genes (see Materials and Methods). The combined <italic>P</italic>-value for every gene-set is adjusted using a null background model made using a systematic approach (see Methods, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S1A</xref>). The objective of <italic>P</italic>-value adjustment using a null model created by Monte-Carlo approach (see Methods) is to highlight cell-type-specific gene-set activity and reduce blurring due to background house-keeping function of cells. We call the adjusted <italic>P</italic>-value of a pathway (or gene-set) in a single-cell as its score.</p>

      <title>Evaluation of UniPath's approach of transforming single-cell expression profiles to pathway enrichment scores</title>
      <p>Due to the lack of gold standard, it is not trivial to assess gene-set enrichment methods for heterogeneous bulk samples. However, for single-cell from known cell-lines, the marker gene-set for cell-types can be used directly to test methods like UniPath. We used marker gene-sets for cell-types to compare our approach with existing methods PAGODA (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>) and AUCell meant for scRNA-seq and GSVA (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). Systematic evaluation using scRNA-seq profiles from 10 studies (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>) revealed that most of the time UniPath was better than PAGODA, AUCell and GSVA in terms of estimating enrichment of gene-sets for correct cell-type as one among top 5 enriched terms (see supplementary methods). (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S1, Additional File 1</xref>). Notice that the purpose of using cell-type marker gene-set was to evaluate the correctness of enrichment of gene-sets for downstream analysis steps of clustering and temporal-ordering. To further clarify, we made a collection of gene-sets of non-immune related pathway terms, and as spike-in, we added two known gene-sets related to B cell. We also added two gene-set associated with T cells to the same collection (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S2</xref>). We checked in what fraction of cells both relevant terms appeared in the top 5 enriched terms (supplementary methods, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). With this control experiment for both B cell (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>) and T cell (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>), UniPath revealed the correct respective pathways in top 5 enriched terms with substantially better accuracy than PAGODA, AUCell and GSVA (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S4A, B</xref>). To have a further unbiased test, we used GSEA (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>) to make reference list of significantly enriched gene-sets (FDR &lt; 0.2) in the group of T cells w.r.t other cell types using mouse cell atlas (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>) data-set. We used the reference gene-set as a list of positives for T cell to evaluate UniPath and other three methods in terms of their presence in the top 10 terms in every single T cell (supplementary methods). UniPath had a substantially higher level of presence of reference gene-sets (positives) among 10 term enriched terms in comparison to PAGODA, AUCell and GSVA (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). Repeating the same experiments for B cells, we found similar results, highlighting the fact that UniPath is indeed superior in estimating cell-type-specific enrichment for gene-sets in single cells.</p>

      <p>We also assessed the consistency of enrichment of pathways by UniPath and the other three methods (PAGODA, AUCell, GSVA). We analyzed B cells (GM12878) scRNA-seq profile (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>) while grouping them each time with different cell types. The scores for pathways and gene-sets from PAGODA and GSVA were not consistent (see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S4C–E</xref>) and for every cell, the output was dependent on the composition of cell type in the data-set. However, UniPath and AUCell based enrichment scores for a cell remains consistent and is not affected by other neighbouring cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S4C–E</xref>). Thus, UniPath also resolves the issues of highlighting correct gene-sets and relevant pathways with consistency for each single-cell irrespective of the level of heterogeneity of cell-types in the provided scRNA-seq data.</p>

      <title>Gene-set enrichment with UniPath as an alternative dimension-reduction method for single-cell ATAC-seq profile</title>
      <p>For the transformation of open chromatin profile of single-cells to pathway enrichment scores, UniPath first highlights enhancers by normalizing read-count on peaks using their global accessibility scores (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S1B</xref>) (see Materials and Methods). For this purpose, it intersects peak list of given scATAC-seq profile with a pre-compiled list of genomic regions with pre-calculated global accessibility scores. The global accessibility score of a genomic site is proportional to the number of times it appeared as a peak in available bulk open-chromatin profiles. (see Materials and Methods). The motivation behind normalizing read-count of each peak using its global accessibility score is to have consistency and avoid adjustment of variability in sequencing depth and dropout rate. For every cell, genomic sites with high normalized read-count are chosen as foreground set. Then, for every cell, UniPath uses proximal genes of peaks in its foreground set to estimate statistical significance (<italic>P</italic>-value) of enrichment gene-sets using Hypergeometric or Binomial test. We call the <italic>P</italic>-value of enrichment of a pathway or gene-set as its score. We performed systematic evaluation using cell-type marker gene-set for both bulk ATAC-seq of -immune cells (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>) and multiple single-cell ATAC-seq profiles (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). Most of the time, UniPath highlighted correct cell type among top 5 enriched gene-set for both bulk and single-cell ATAC-seq profiles (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figures S5 and S6</xref>). Making a global list of peaks with accessibility score is possible due to the availability of bulk open-chromatin profiles. In the absence of enough publicly available open-chromatin profiles for any species, one can also use UniPath by calculating local accessibility score (study-specific normalization). However, local accessibility scores are dependent on the composition of cells in the data-set and could lead to inconsistency in estimation of enrichment of gene-sets (shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1E</xref>). Thus, UniPath calculates consistent and mostly correct enrichment scores for pathway and gene-sets for every cell using its scATAC-seq profile independently.</p>

      <title>Handling dropout and batch effect and evaluation using visualization and clustering</title>
      <p>Most often in single-cell scRNA-seq profile, there is heterogeneity in dropout rate among cells. Such dropout of genes could be random or systematic. The systematic dropout usually occurs due to differences in sequencing depth or RNA degradation level (frozen versus fresh) among different batches of samples. We tested whether UniPath is robust to systematic dropout variability among cells. We first simulated the systematic dropout rate using publicly available scRNA-seq data-sets (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>) (see Methods). We found that applying PCA on raw read-count (or gene-expression) lead to artefactual cluster formation due to systematic dropout. Whereas, using UniPath based pathway scores, similar cells remained in the same cluster irrespective of the pattern in dropout rate (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S7A</xref>). When t-SNE scatter plot (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S7B</xref>) was used to visualize scRNA-seq profile with 10% systematic simulated drop-out, UniPath based pathway scores provided robust results and similar type of cells grouped together. Whereas for the same data and gene-set, results from other similar methods (PAGODA, AUCcell, GSVA) showed an artefactual cluster for cells with systematic drop-out (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S7B</xref>).</p>

Three types of clustering efficiency quantification (clustering purity, adjusted rand index and normalized mutual information) are shown here.

Using only gene-expression based visualization with t-SNE, showed separate grouping of expression profiles from frozen cells. Even while using highly variant feature (genes) frozen cell profiles clustered together as a separate group in t-SNE plot. However, in t-SNE scatter plot made using UniPath's gene-set score, the expression profile of microglial cells from fresh and frozen sample showed high overlap (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S7C–E</xref>). Besides being robust to systematic dropout, UniPath also allows correction for strong technical batch effect before calculating the adjusted <italic>P</italic>-value for the enrichment of pathways (see supplementary methods and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S8A</xref>) using available tools. The framework of UniPath avoids normalization artefact due to sequencing depth and dropout rate; therefore, it could be used for efficient clustering of single-cell. During hierarchical-clustering, UniPath based gene-set scores provided comparable clustering-purity to raw expression based results (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S8B–D</xref>). Thus, for normal data-sets using genes-expression directly could provide comparable visualization and clustering purity, however, when there is systematic bias (such as frozen samples) UniPath-score is more useful than raw gene-expression for avoiding artefactual clusters.</p>
      <p>We further compared visualization and clustering using pathway scores from 4 different methods for scRNA-seq profiles. We used t-SNE based visualization and performed dbscan (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>) based clustering of t-SNE coordinates (supplementary methods). We tried using different values for eps parameter (for the radius of the neighbourhood) in dbscan. However, for almost all values of eps parameter of dbscan, UniPath based pathway scores provided better clustering purity. UniPath based clustering results also had higher values for adjusted rand Index (ARI) and normalized mutual information (NMI) than other three methods (PAGODA, AUCell, GSVA) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S9</xref>). Due to better visualization and clustering, we found meaningful sub-groups of stromal cells in an organ (Uterus) in mouse cell atlas only while using UniPath scores (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S9C</xref> and supplementary information).</p>
      <p>When hierarchical clustering was performed using pathway scores of imputed scATAC-seq profiles, it resulted in high clustering-purity (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>). We also compared visualization and clustering of scATAC-seq profiles with the outputs of two other tools (ChromVar and SCALE) (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>) (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>) which are used for handling scATAC-seq count but not for finding enrichment of gene-set. UniPath based pathways scores for imputed scATAC-seq profiles provided better or comparable visualization and clustering when compared to the output of ChromVar and SCALE (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S10</xref>). Thus high accuracy in clustering with gene-set enrichment scores, proves that defining cell-states in terms of pathway enrichment using UniPath can also be a reliable method for classifying single-cell epigenome and transcriptome data-sets.</p>

      <title>Pseudo-temporal ordering using pathway enrichment scores and visualizing the continuum of lineage potency and pathway co-occurrence</title>
      <p>Pathway-scores based representation can provide new similarity measures among cells as well as help in avoiding few covariates like cell-cycle phase, tissue-microenvironment or culture conditions. However, current methods for temporal ordering (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>) of cells are designed mainly to handle FPKM and read-counts of genes. Hence, we extended UniPath with a novel method for the pseudo-temporal ordering of single-cells which can utilize pathway scores based representations. For temporal ordering, we apply two levels of shrinking of distances between cells based on their pre-clustering and continuum among their classes before finding a minimum spanning tree (MST). To find a continuum between different classes, we use KNN based approach after initial clustering so that correct temporal ordering among clusters of cells can be determined (see methods). Without shrinkage of distances using pre-clustering and KNN based continuum, the MST could not capture correct temporal order in few cases (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S11A, B</xref>). Overall, we found that UniPath is indeed able to predict approximately correct order of cells using pathway scores derived from scATAC-seq and scRNA-seq profiles (see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S11</xref>).</p>

      <p>We further used UniPath for temporal ordering of scRNA-seq profile of Human embryonic stem cells (hESC) and their differentiated states collected at time points of 0, 12, 36, 72 and 96 h during differentiation towards definitive endoderm (DE) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>) (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). Using other tools (monocle, TSCAN, DiffusionMap, CellTree) (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>) for pseudo-temporal ordering with gene-expression (Transcript per million, TPM) matrix (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>), resulted in predicting wrong order of cells for the same data-set. However, with UniPath, when we dropped gene-set associated with cell cycle, we achieved the correct order of cells. We found that the score of gene-set for cell cycle (S phase is shown here) is higher at 0 and 12 h, possibly due to a high level of proliferation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>). The S phase gene-set score kept decreasing as the cells differentiated towards endoderm (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>). However, at 36 h, we find two batches of cells such that one batch of cells had a much lower score of cell-cycle (S phase here) gene-set than the other. Such batches of cells hint about the possible impact of cell-cycle as a covariate during the prediction of temporal order. Besides handling known covariates, UniPath can also be used to visualize continuum of lineage potency and concurrence of two pathways on pseudo-temporally ordered tree (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref>) (see methods). UniPath also enables analysis of co-occurrence pattern and detection of clusters of pathways which can be used to infer context-specific regulation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figures S12 and S13</xref>, supplementary information). Overall, UniPath tends to be beneficial for predicting correct temporal order of cells and making inference about stage-specific co-occurrence of pathways during differentiation of cells.</p>

      <title>Enabling analysis of large atlas scale scRNA-seq data-set using pathway enrichment scores</title>
      <p>The consistency due to the use of global null models by UniPath provides horizontal scalability in calculating scores for pathways for single-cells. Even with a single CPU, the computation time needed by UniPath is much less than PAGODA and GSVA on the same number of cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S14A</xref>). The horizontal scalability, speed and consistency of UniPath allowed us to transform expression profiles (UMI-counts) of more than 61000 single-cells from mouse cell atlas (MCA) dataset (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>), by dividing them into smaller groups of cells. We selected 49507 cells which have &gt;800 genes with non-zero expression value (see supplementary methods). Further, t-SNE (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>) based dimension reduction of pathway scores and subsequent application of dbscan (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>) (Additional file 2), revealed a correct grouping of most of the cells according to their tissue (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S14B</xref>). As expected, some cells did not group with their source tissue cluster, but they formed a separate class. Such as immune cells from different organs grouped together in clusters 13, 14, 15 (see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>, Additional file 2).</p>

      <p>Surprisingly, co-clustering of few non-immune cells from different tissues revealed convergence which has been rarely reported before by single-cell analysis but is supported by earlier scientific studies. Such as in our analysis, cluster 40 has <italic>Afp+</italic> fetal liver hepatocytes as well as <italic>Afp+</italic> placental endodermal cells which were reported to belong to different classes in the original study of MCA. Cluster 40 also has a few Fabp1+ hepatocytes. It has been previously shown, that placenta-derived multipotent cells (PDMCs) with the expression of Afp (see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>) gene, has endodermal features and can differentiate easily towards hepatocytes like cells (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). We compared both types of cells (<italic>Afp+</italic> placental endodermal cells and <italic>Afp+</italic> fetal liver hepatocyte) in cluster 40 with other cells in MCA. Among top 50 pathways more enriched in <italic>Afp+</italic> placental endodermal cells (from cluster 40) 22 were also present in 50 most differentially upregulated pathways in hepatocytes cells of cluster 40 (additional files 3 and 4). These common 22 pathways (44% overlap) were mostly related to lipid metabolism (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S3</xref>). However, there was certainly a difference between hepatocytes and <italic>Afp+</italic> placental endodermal cells of cluster 40 in t-SNE based visualization. (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>).</p>
      <p>Another example of convergence is cluster 3, which has virgin mammary gland luminal-epithelial cells (including alveoli cells) and glandular epithelial cells from uterus. An interesting example of convergence is cluster 52, that has <italic>Col10a1+</italic> and <italic>Cmnd+</italic> bonemarrow mesenchyme stromal, pre-osteoblast and chondrocytes cells. It is well-known that bonemarrow mesenchyme stromal (also known as mesenchymal stem cells (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>)) has a high potency to transform to pre-osteoblast and chondrocytes cell state (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>). In contrast to such a result, <italic>Cxcl1+</italic> MSC from in vitro culture grouped with trophoblast stem cells in cluster 21. It can be noticed, that the cell types from different organs, converging in a major cluster, did not overlap completely with each other but formed their own sub-cluster within their major class (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). However, the convergence to a major class shows a reduction of covariates due to underlying tissue microenvironment in gene-set scores, which caused cells with a similar state to group together. Overall UniPath, provided a new dimension to cluster cells and revealed that even though an organ has a specific type of cells for its functioning, it also has some cells with a regulatory state similar to cell-types from other parts of the body.</p>

        <title>Revealing new minor classes using pathway scores and annotation of unlabeled cells</title>
        <p>Feature extraction in terms of pathway scores can help to reduce noise, sparsity and effect of few covariates. Hence, it can help to highlight clusters of cells which might not get detected by using raw read-counts. Such as analysis using pathway scores of brain cells in MCA data-set, resulted in the detection of a new cluster among oligodendrocyte-precursor cells. Oligodendrocyte precursor cells belonging to the new small cluster had a higher expression for <italic>Tuba1a, Sirt2, Cd9, Plp1</italic> and <italic>Bcas1</italic> (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>). These genes are involved in the differentiation of oligodendrocyte-precursor toward mature oligodendrocytes (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44–47</xref>). On the same trend, we found two new clusters of ‘unknown’ cells from the bladder in MCA data-set (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D</xref>). We could annotate cells in one of the newly detected clusters in the bladder as Cd74_high dendritic cells. Thus, UniPath based analysis could highlight a few groups of cells which were not found in the original study relying only on using read-count directly. We also made an attempt to annotate a few un-annotated cells as described in the supplementary material (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S14C, additional file 5</xref>).</p>

      <title>Application in inferring context-specific regulation in cancer cells</title>
      <p>We further explored how UniPath can help in for studying context-specific regulation in cancer cells which is often required for precision oncology. Recently Wang <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>) showed a difference in metabolic profile among two types of NSCLC cell lines, non-adherent tumorspheres (TS) grown in serum-free culture conditions and adherent (Adh) cells cultured in serum-containing medium. They have demonstrated a high level of the tumorigenic potential of non-adherent TS cells in comparison to adherent ones using mouse xenograft models. We performed single-cell expression profiling of 162 cells out of which approximately half were TS cells, and others were Adh cells (see Materials and Methods). After applying UniPath, the differential enrichment analysis using Wilcoxon Rank sum test revealed GPCR ligand binding gene-set (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>), IL23 pathway, cytochrome_P450_drug_metabolism and phenylanine metabolism as having higher enrichment in TS cells (based on median fold change and Wilcoxon Rank-sum <italic>P</italic>-value &lt; 0.05, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>) (additional File 6). Distributions and gradient of some pathways in TS and Adh cells are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S15B</xref>. GPCR.

        <graphic xlink:href="gkaa1138fig5"/>
      </fig>
      <p>We further used an approach, rarely used for scRNA-seq. We performed co-occurrence and differential co-occurrence analysis for pathway and gene-set pairs. Wnt pathway had the highest correlation with stemness gene-set in TS cells. However, in Adh cells, Wnt was not among top correlated pathways with stemness gene-set. We found that Wnt/beta-catenin pathways had a significantly higher correlation with the TGF-beta pathway in TS in comparison to Adh cells (<italic>P</italic>-value &lt; 0.05, Jaccard index = 0, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S4</xref>). However, TGF-beta pathway itself did not have a significant difference in enrichment among TS and Adh cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S15A</xref>). Both Wnt/beta-catenin and TGF-beta are known to promote the state of epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) in cancer cells which is associated with high tumorigenicity (<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>). Moreover, it has been previously shown that simultaneous over-activation of Wnt/beta-catenin and TGF-beta signaling promotes tumorigenicity and chemo-resistance in NSCLC cells (<xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>). Using hierarchical clustering of 31 chosen pathways, we found that TGF-beta, Wnt/beta-catenin and PDGFRB pathways co-clustered together in TS cells. In contrast, in Adh cells WNT/beta-catenin pathway grouped with ERBB1 and PI3K1 signaling. The difference in co-occurrence pattern of Wnt/beta-catenin pathway in TS and Adh cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>-<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">D</xref>) and prior knowledge about the effect of their co-stimulation with TGF-beta in NSCLC hints about a possible cause of higher tumorogenicity in TS cells.</p>
      <p>Wang <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>) also reported that glycolytic intermediates are more enriched in Adh cells. Our analysis revealed that among non-metabolic gene-sets, sonic hedgehog (SHH) pathway had the highest level of differential co-occurrence (<italic>P</italic>-value &lt; 0.05, Jaccard index = 0) with glycolysis gene-set (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S15C</xref>). SHH and glycolysis pathway had a correlation of 0.63 in Adh cell compared to -0.138 in TS cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5E</xref>). SHH pathway is known to be promoting glycolysis in multiple types of cancer (<xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>). In our hierarchical clustering result (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>), SHH pathway also seems to group with cell-cycle related gene-sets which hints about its involvement in the regulation of proliferation in Adh cells. Previously SHH pathway has been associated with proliferation and drug-resistance in NSCLC (<xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>). However, our analysis reveals that its role is context-specific, and it could have a more dominating role in Adh like NSCLC cells compared to TS cells. Similarly, many more such differences could be revealed among Adh and TS cells. However, our analysis here is meant to show that UniPath can help in building relevant hypothesis and help researchers in designing follow-up study of context-specific regulation in cancer cells.</p>

    <title>DISCUSSION</title>
    <p>Exploiting single-cell heterogeneity using pathways and gene-set enrichment can give rise to multiple new applications. UniPath fills the gap between the demand for consistent gene-set enrichment scores for a multitude of applications and the availability of single-cell transcriptome and open-chromatin profiles. The novel approach of processing each cell independently, using a global null model provides consistency and scalability to UniPath for calculating gene-set enrichment. Such approach of UniPath also provided independence of normalization w.r.t other cells which is needed to handle cell-to-cell variability in noise, dropout rate and sequencing depth. UniPath is robust to systematic dropout as well as it can handle batch effect in scRNA-seq profiles. Compared to other similar methods (PAGODA, AUCell and GSVA), UniPath based pathway scores provided better visualization and clustering accuracy for both UMI and non-UMI based scRNA-seq profiles. Thus, UniPath's approach of approximating the distribution of UMI-count of scRNA-seq to log-normal can provide a satisfactory result.</p>
    <p>For both scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq profiles, there is a similarity in the downstream procedures after the transformation to gene-set enrichment score. Thus, UniPath provides a uniform platform for analyzing both single-cell transcriptome and open-chromatin profiles with the new dimension of pathway enrichment scores. For better performance of UniPath on scATAC-seq profiles, it is advisable to perform imputation using other tools (<xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>). Overall, UniPath also provides an alternative solution to transform more than one scATAC-seq read-count matrices to same feature space, despite differences in their peak list.</p>
    <p>Due to the effect of cell-cycle or micro-environment, the expression of every gene is influenced slightly. Such subtle underlying covariate could influence down-stream analysis using raw-gene expression directly. However, when we take scores of the smaller set of genes (like pathways) we give more weightage to covariance due to grouping of genes (or functional similarity) which tend to overwhelm the underlying covariate effect due to cell-cycle or micro-environment. Therefore, UniPath based approach is successful in suppressing such covariates using temporal ordering and clustering. Clustering of MCA data-set using pathway scores revealed few clusters in which one of its member cell-type could be easily differentiated to the other. Such as cluster 40 having <italic>Afp+</italic> placental endodermal cells and fetal liver hepatocyte (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>) and cluster 52 with bonemarrow mesenchyme stromal, pre-osteoblast and chondrocytes cells (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>). Such results hint that biologist could use UniPath to find convergence and feasibility of convertibility between different cell-types.</p>
    <p>We have shown 3 results obtained through UniPath, which could not be achieved by using gene-expression directly. Those results are 1) Mixing of fresh and frozen sample scRNA-seq profiles in t-SNE based visualization 2) correct temporal ordering of differentiating hESC cells 3) co-clustering of cells from distant tissues which were not reported by original study relying on using gene-expression directly. The estimate of pathways and gene-sets enrichment scores by UniPath can provide a meaningful representation of underlying heterogeneity among cells. Such as while analysing Chu <italic>et al.</italic> data-set, we found a bimodal distribution of enrichment for few pathways at 36 h (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S12A</xref>). In Chu <italic>et al.</italic> data-set, at 36 h, cells are in mesendodermal stage and start differentiating towards definitive endoderm. Such bimodal distribution of pathway scores could provide a meaningful representation of underlying regulatory states involved in bifurcation and decision about the fate of cells. The pathway scores calculation using UniPath also opens an avenue for new ways of analysis which is not allowed while using gene-expression directly. Such new ways of analysis are (i) estimating co-occurrence among pathways and finding clusters of co-regulated pathways and (ii) calculating differential co-occurrence among two pathways to compare two groups of cells. UniPath based analysis of differentiating hESC towards DE revealed patterns of cooccurrence of Nodal pathway with other pathways (SMAD2, Wnt/beta-catenin) which are corroborative with existing literature (see Supplementary Methods, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S12</xref>).</p>
    <p>Using the null model to estimate the significance of cooccurrence of two pathways allows the prediction of changes in their co-enrichment across multiple groups of cells. Such analysis could prove very useful to link deregulation of a given pathway to a disease-associated gene-set in a target cell-type. Using a similar approach for NSCLC, we could estimate cooccurrences and differential co-occurrences of few pathway pairs, which had literature support (such as TGF-beta and Wnt/beta-catenin; SHH and glycolysis). Last but not least, the generalized statistical framework of UniPath makes it future-proof such that it can be easily adapted for spatial transcriptome based on single-cell expression profiling (<xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>) and other open chromatin profiles such as scDNASE-seq (<xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>) or SNARE-seq (<xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>).</p>
