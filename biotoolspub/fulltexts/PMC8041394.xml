      <p>The bio.tools registry
is a main catalogue of computational tools
in the life sciences. More than 17 000 tools have been registered
by the international bioinformatics community. The bio.tools metadata
schema includes semantic annotations of tool functions, that is, formal
descriptions of tools’ data types, formats, and operations
with terms from the EDAM bioinformatics ontology. Such annotations
enable the automated composition of tools into multistep pipelines
or workflows. In this Technical Note, we revisit a previous case study
on the automated composition of proteomics workflows. We use the same
four workflow scenarios but instead of using a small set of tools
with carefully handcrafted annotations, we explore workflows directly
on bio.tools. We use the Automated Pipeline Explorer (APE), a reimplementation
and extension of the workflow composition method previously used.
Moving “into the wild” opens up an unprecedented wealth
of tools and a huge number of alternative workflows. Automated composition
tools can be used to explore this space of possibilities systematically.
Inevitably, the mixed quality of semantic annotations in bio.tools
leads to unintended or erroneous tool combinations. However, our results
also show that additional control mechanisms (tool filters, configuration
options, and workflow constraints) can effectively guide the exploration
toward smaller sets of more meaningful workflows.</p>

    <title>Introduction</title>
    <p>Converting
experimental biological data into interpretable results
increasingly involves the combination of multiple, diverse computational
tools into pipelines or workflows performing specific sequences of
operations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>−<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref></sup> Working out which tools and combinations are applicable
and scientifically meaningful in practice is often hard, in particular,
when the tools were not developed by the same research group, consortium,
or company. The idea of automated workflow exploration and composition
is to let an algorithm perform or assist in this process. Different
approaches to this idea have been proposed in the past,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>−<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref></sup> the applicability and success of which depend on rich and consistent
semantic tool annotations.</p>
    <p>In 2018, we published the case study
“Automated Workflow
Composition in Mass Spectrometry-Based Proteomics”.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref></sup> There, we demonstrated based on four selected
proteomics use cases how the thorough semantic annotation of tools
with regard to operations, data types, and formats enables their automated
composition into tentatively viable workflows as permutations of a
data analysis plan. As a proof-of-concept study, the study used a
relatively small, well-defined set of tools, with carefully handcrafted
semantic annotations as a basis. In this Technical Note, we outline
the potential of the approach when applied to larger collections of
semantically annotated, complex tools with multiple inputs and outputs.</p>
    <p>Since our initial case study, much has happened: The bio.tools
registry<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref></sup> has grown and matured substantially<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref></sup> and currently covers more than 17 000
bioinformatics tools, including more than 750 tools in the specially
curated proteomics subset (<uri xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://proteomics.bio.tools">https://proteomics.bio.tools</uri>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref></sup> Furthermore,
bio.tools now has a REST application programming interface (API) that
allows for programmatic access to the registry and, in particular,
to the tools’ metadata through their unique bio.tools identifiers.
Along with the registration and annotation of proteomics tools in
bio.tools, the coverage of proteomics terms in the EDAM ontology of
bioinformatics operations, types of data, data identifiers, data formats,
and topics (<uri xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="http://edamontology.org/">http://edamontology.org/</uri>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref></sup> has evolved and matured.
Finally, the PROPHETS framework<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref></sup> used for automated
workflow exploration in the previous study has
been discontinued. With the Automated Pipeline Explorer (APE),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref></sup> we have developed a new framework that implements essentially the
same workflow composition method but is generally better tailored
to the work with scientific workflows.</p>
    <p>In this Technical Note,
we revisit the four proteomics use cases
from our previous study that describe typical scenarios for the analysis
of proteomics data. We use APE for the workflow exploration and move
“into the wild”: Instead of using a small, handcrafted
set of tools and annotations, we work with tools and annotations directly
from the bio.tools registry. This opens up an unprecedented wealth
of tools and, accordingly, a huge number of possible alternative workflows.
With APE, we systematically explore the space of possibilities; however,
as the quality of semantic annotations in bio.tools varies, deviations
in the quality of the automatically explored workflows are to be expected.
Therefore, we focus here on evaluating the quality of the suggested
workflows, in particular, checking for impossible solutions and discussing
possible ways of preventing their occurrence.</p>
    <p>The remainder
of this Technical Note is structured as follows.
In the next section, we describe the experimental setup. Then, we
present and discuss the results from the workflow exploration experiments
before concluding with a short summary and perspectives for future
work. The data and code for running this study, along with the workflow
exploration results and evaluation data, are available online at <uri xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://github.com/sanctuuary/Proteomics_domain_setup">https://github.com/sanctuuary/Proteomics_domain_setup</uri> and in the <xref rid="notes-1" ref-type="notes">Supporting Information</xref>.</p>

      <title>Automated Pipeline Explorer
(APE)</title>
      <p>APE<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref></sup> is a command line tool and Java
API for the automated exploration
of possible computational pipelines (scientific workflows) from large
collections of computational tools. We use it as a standalone tool
in this study, but in its capacity as an API, it could also be used
as a component for workflow exploration within a workflow management
system such as KNIME<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref></sup> or Galaxy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref></sup> Furthermore, APE can export the obtained workflows
in Common Workflow Language (CWL, <uri xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://w3id.org/cwl/">https://w3id.org/cwl/</uri>) format to facilitate integration with
other systems. APE is open-source software and is available on GitHub
(<uri xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://github.com/sanctuuary/APE">https://github.com/sanctuuary/APE</uri>).</p>
      <p>The workflow exploration algorithm used by APE is a variation
and extension of the Semantic Linear Time Logic (SLTL)-based process
synthesis approach originally introduced by Steffen et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref></sup> Operating on input/output-annotated tools in
combination with type and operation taxonomies, this approach aligns
perfectly with the information that is available through bio.tools
and EDAM. Therefore, we chose to follow this approach instead of potentially
more powerful synthesis or planning techniques. In particular, planning
approaches based on Description Logic<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref></sup> have been demonstrated to be applicable to the automated workflow
composition problem in the past.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref></sup> They do, however, require
more comprehensive domain models (sophisticated ontologies), which
are not readily available.</p>
      <p>Concretely, the semantic domain model
we provided to APE consists
of operation, type, and format taxonomies as controlled vocabularies
for the description of computational tools (directly derived from
EDAM) and functional tool annotations (inputs, outputs, operations
performed) using terms from these taxonomies (directly derived from
bio.tools). The domain setup process is described in further detail
as follows. The workflow specifications we provided to APE comprised
the available inputs and intended outputs (data type and format, again
in EDAM terms) and, in some cases, additional constraints (provided
through open text templates that internally translate to SLTL formulas).</p>
      <p>On this basis, APE computes possible workflows. Intuitively, this
is a two-step process:<list list-type="simple"><list-item><label>1.</label><p>The tools’ input/output annotations
imply a network of technically possible tool sequences, which constitutes
the search space for the workflow exploration.</p></list-item><list-item><label>2.</label><p>In this search space, APE looks for
paths that match the concrete workflow specification (from workflow
inputs to outputs, while respecting additional constraints).</p></list-item></list></p>
      <p>Technically, this process is implemented
as temporal logic-based
program synthesis with iterative deepening; that is, the algorithm
explores the workflows requiring the least amount of steps to solve
the given problem first. APE translates the domain knowledge and workflow
specification into propositional logical formulas and feeds them to
an automated constraint solver to compute satisfying instances. These
solutions are then translated into actual candidate workflows and
sorted by length. For a detailed description of the implementation,
we refer to Kasalica et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref></sup></p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec2.2">
      <title>Domain Models</title>
      <p>In our previous study,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref></sup> the domain
model comprised 26 tools (mostly but not exclusively
from the <uri xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="http://ms-utils.org">ms-utils.org</uri> collection
of mass-spectrometry data analysis tools) that we annotated in a CSV
file with input and output data type and formats as well as operations
using terms from the EDAM ontology. In this study, we fetched the
corresponding tool annotations directly from the bio.tools registry
via its REST API. The bio.tools annotation schema also uses the EDAM
ontology as reference vocabulary, but in contrast with our previous
tabular annotation format, it allows for the annotation of multiple
inputs and outputs per tool. Thus we now work with significantly more
comprehensive descriptions of the available tools’ functionality.</p>
      <p>For this study, we worked with three different domain models:<list list-type="simple"><list-item><label>1.</label><p>The <bold>original</bold> set of tools
(comet, enrichnet, genetrail, genetrail2, gprofile_r, idconvert, isobar,
libra, msconvert, mzXMLplot, Pep3D, PeptideProphet, peptideshaker,
proteinprophet, protk, PTMProphet, ssrcalc, searchgui, Tandem2XML,
rt, xml2tsv, xtandem, extract_protein_names), comprising the tools
from the previous study that are available in bio.tools.</p></list-item><list-item><label>2.</label><p>An <bold>extended</bold> set of proteomics
tools, corresponding to the labeled proteomics domain in bio.tools
(<uri xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://proteomics.bio.tools">https://proteomics.bio.tools</uri>), which extends the original set of tools.</p></list-item><list-item><label>3.</label><p>The <bold>full</bold> bio.tools set,
containing all of the tools currently available in the registry.</p></list-item></list></p>
      <p>To create the three domain models, we (1)
used the bio.tools REST
API to fetch the JSON files containing the respective bio.tools native
annotations (which can contain multiple function annotations per tool),
(2) cleaned the set of annotations by keeping only well-annotated
functions (details follow), and (3) transformed the annotations to
the APE annotation format. The quality of the domain model determines
the quality of the workflows obtained through automated exploration.
bio.tools contains thousands of tools, annotated by a diverse group
of contributors. Not surprisingly, this leads to mixed levels of annotation
quality. In particular, many of the tool annotations lack input or
output definitions, specify them vaguely or incompletely, or use outdated
EDAM references. Therefore, we discarded annotations that:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>do not specify an input, as these
tools can be used
at any step of the workflow and typically introduce unnecessary new
data</p></list-item><list-item><p>do not specify an output (typically
these are interactive
tools), as they do not contribute to solving a data analysis problem</p></list-item><list-item><p>miss a data type or format specification,
as these are
incomplete annotations</p></list-item><list-item><p>reference deprecated
EDAM data type or format terms,
as they are not part of the domain taxonomy anymore</p></list-item></list></p>
      <p>Note that there are also many tool annotations that
reference deprecated
EDAM operation terms; however, we classify those as noncritical annotation
errors and allow such tools. The only way that such domain model could
produce wrong results is by restricting usage of the missing tool
types through explicit constraints, which we rarely do in the studied
use cases.</p>
      <p><xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="other">Table <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="other">1</xref></xref> summarizes
the effects of cleaning the annotation sets while creating the three
domain models. The annotation quality of the small, original tool
set is again good, and only three tools were discarded. In the larger,
community-curated domain of proteomics, we find around a third of
the tools to be in a well-annotated format, whereas on the global
level, &lt;10% of bio.tools are directly suitable for automated exploration.
Still, these new domain models with 271 and 1642 tools, respectively,
provide a next-level challenge for automated workflow exploration
and resemble the variety of tools in a real-world setting better than
the original set.</p>

previous case study, we revised the workflow specifications to match
the now available terms. Concretely, we generalized the output specifications
in the first and the fourth use cases from the expected data types
to their parent classes, as none of the annotated tools used the originally
specified types as input/output anymore. In the first use case, we
substituted <italic>Amino acid index (hydropathy)</italic> with <italic>Amino acid property</italic>, whereas in the fourth use case, we
replaced <italic>Gene expression profile</italic> by <italic>Expression

The term <italic>validation of peptide-spectrum matches</italic> became
obsolete with EDAM 1.19, so instead, we opted for the similar <italic>Target-Decoy</italic> term. Furthermore, we updated the term <italic>gene-set enrichment analysis</italic> to <italic>enrichment analysis</italic>. Although it is not deprecated, it is not used in any of the tool
annotations.</p>

      <title>Workflow Exploration Runs</title>
      <p>As illustrated in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref></xref> (top), this study
comprised 24 different workflow exploration runs in total. For each
of the three domain models (Original, Extended, and Full bio.tools),
we let APE explore possible workflows for all four use cases. Furthermore,
we apply two different versions of the workflow specifications: desired
input/output only (I/O) and I/O with additional constraints (I/O+C).
This distinction allows us to evaluate the effects of these additional
constraints in comparison with I/O specification only when exploring
workflows in large collections of tools. In the previous case study,
even with a small set of tools, constraints were crucial to guide
the exploration toward the intended workflows, as an I/O specification
alone did not provide sufficient information. We expected this to
be even more needed with the increased size of the domain model.</p>
      <p>We limited the exploration runs to the first 100 (shortest) workflows.
This choice was motivated by two observations: First, as workflow
candidates get longer, they tend to simply extend already considered
shorter solutions and introduce redundant steps. Second, users of
automated workflow exploration tools are able to process and compare
only a limited number of workflows, and in our experience, 100 is
a reasonable bound in practice. Finally, because of resource limitation,
we terminate the search if no solutions are found until length 20
(workflows with 20 operation steps).</p>
      <p>The experiments were run
using bio.tools annotations as of November
25, 2020, EDAM version 1.24, and APE version 1.1.2 on a i7-6500U CPU
at 2.50 GHz and a 16 GB RAM machine running on Ubuntu 20.04. We did
not measure the runtime behavior of the workflow exploration algorithm
systematically in this study. For the smallest domain model, the runtime
was a few seconds; exploration using the largest domain model was
averaging ∼10 min, with the longest time of almost 1 h. In
general, runtime performance increases with the size of the domain
model and the length of the solutions.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec2.5">
      <title>Workflow Evaluation</title>
      <p>To evaluate the quality of the
suggested workflows, two domain experts (proteomics researchers with
extensive tool and workflow experience) scored the first 20 workflow
candidates of each exploration run on a scale from 0 to 3 according
to the following criteria:<list list-type="simple"><list-item><label>3:</label><p>Good workflow, have seen it or similar
before, I know it will work</p></list-item><list-item><label>2:</label><p>Interesting suggestion, seems viable,
could work, worth trying</p></list-item><list-item><label>1:</label><p>Might work, but does not seem very
useful or has unnecessary steps</p></list-item><list-item><label>0:</label><p>I know that it will not work</p></list-item></list></p>
      <p>The two
experts scored the workflows independently.
We calculated the averages of their scores for subsequent analysis.
Further evaluation through implementation, execution, and benchmarking,
like we performed in the previous study,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref></sup> was out of scope for this study and is left for future work.</p>

    <title>Results
and Discussion</title>
    <p>As follows, we summarize and discuss the workflows
found in all
exploration settings previously described. We use the number of obtained
workflows and the scores they received from the domain experts (see <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>) as indicators of
the workflow exploration comprehensiveness and the quality in the
different setups.</p>

    <p>As general observations, the workflow-evaluating domain experts
remarked that they found this to be an interesting and insightful
exercise. On the one hand, they came across several interesting, sometimes
even surprising, workflow suggestions that they would not have thought
about themselves but that seem worth trying. On the other hand, for
faulty or insensible workflow suggestions, they could usually see
how the (flawed) annotations of the involved tools set the automated
composer on a wrong track.</p>
    <sec id="sec3.1">
      <title>Use Case #1</title>
      <p>The workflows we obtained
for the first
use case with the original tool set closely resemble the corresponding
results from the previous study. First workflows for the specification
are found at a length of three, which corresponds to workflows of
three successive tools. As the examples in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref></xref> indicate, the main difference from the results
of the previous study is that some tools that were previously used
(e.g., <italic>X!Tandem</italic>, <italic>SSRCalc</italic>) are not
included anymore. This is due to different annotations of the tools,
which are both now annotated to expect two inputs instead of one.</p>
      <fig id="fig3" position="float">
        <label>Figure 3</label>
        <caption>
          <p>Example
workflow candidates: Use Case #1.</p>
        </caption>
        <graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="pr0c00983_0004" id="fx1" position="float"/>
      </fig>
      <p>The example workflows for the original tool set also show another
frequently observed pattern: Short workflows with a conversion step
(such as <italic>msConvert</italic>) often are contained again in
longer workflows that simply repeat the conversion step. These redundant
steps could be avoided by introducing constraints that prevent multiple
conversion operations over the same data. Currently, this requires
formulating such constraints per individual tool, so we are considering
ways of adding this as a more convenient configuration option to APE.</p>
      <p>When we explore workflows for the same specification but with the
extended and full sets of tools, the number of results significantly
increases. As <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref></xref> indicates, the additional results comprise several new and sometimes
surprising workflow suggestions, such as the combination of using <italic>MZmine</italic> before <italic>Mascot Server</italic>. However, there
are also workflow suggestions that are less sensible. For example,
some workflows start with the tool <italic>CompassXPort</italic>,
although it cannot read <italic>Thermo RAW</italic> files. The reason
is that <italic>CompassXPort</italic> is annotated in bio.tools to
read <italic>Mass spectrometry data format</italic> files, which is
the parent term for 30 specific file formats including <italic>Thermo
RAW. CompassXPort</italic> cannot read <italic>Thermo RAW</italic>, but this cannot be inferred when using general annotations including
parent terms. Ideally, <italic>CompassXPort</italic> would be annotated
in bio.tools with a precise list of accepted input formats and not
their parent term. To work around this with the current version of
APE, a constraint can be added that, for example, excludes <italic>CompassXPort</italic> from the exploration. Alternatively, one could
restrict the domain model to include only tools described by sufficiently
specific file formats. However, given the current state of tool annotations,
such a restriction is likely to strongly decrease the domain model
size. To solve such problems more generally, we are currently investigating
possibilities for extending APE with new configuration options or
heuristics for data format handling.</p>
      <p>Interestingly, we obtained
almost the same results for the extended
and full domain models. The only notable difference is the occurrence
of a rather new parsing tool <italic>ThermoRawFileParser</italic> in
the workflow solutions with the full domain model. <italic>ThermoRawFileParser</italic> is not yet included in the proteomics domain, as it has been recently
added. With the exception of this tool, extending the domain model
with tools from outside the bio.tools proteomics domain does not create
new possibilities for this use case. This can be interpreted as evidence
that the coverage of proteomics tools in the respective bio.tools
domain is comprehensive.</p>
      <p>A general observation from the evaluation
is that the constraints
do indeed have a considerable effect on the number and quality of
workflows obtained. As <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref> shows, for all domain models, the domain experts gave higher
scores to the workflows explored with constraints. This is especially
important with the extended and full domain models. There, the number
of solutions exceeds the threshold of 100 already at length 4 in the
unconstrained case. To a large extent, these are workflows that are
(presumably) implementable based on their input/output annotations
but that do not perform the operations actually intended by the workflow
developer. Constraints that specify these intentions thus better help
to drastically decrease the number of unfeasible workflows. Furthermore,
they allow for the exploration of longer and, at the same time, more
meaningful workflows. For this use case, the hand-curated domain model
appears to be more restrictive and effective for finding appropriate
solutions than the constrained case over a larger domain model. We
attribute this to the specific tailoring of the original domain model
to this use case, an approach that does, however, hardly scale in
practice. This reemphasizes the importance of using appropriate constraints
when dealing with larger collections of tools and annotations from
community repositories.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec3.2">
      <title>Use Case #2</title>
      <p>When exploring workflows
for the second
use case with the original tool set, somewhat surprisingly, we did
not find any. The reason is that the <italic>enrichment analysis</italic> tools (<italic>gProfiler</italic>, <italic>EnrichNet</italic>, etc.),
which are needed to generate the specified workflow output, are annotated
to expect a <italic>Gene ID</italic> type as one of the two obligatory
inputs. However, there is no tool in the domain model that would generate
a <italic>Gene ID</italic> as output, and hence there is a missing
link that prevents the exploration from finding corresponding workflows.
A “shim” tool that converts IDs into each other (e.g., <italic>UniProt protein accession</italic> into <italic>Gene IDs</italic>) could provide this missing link. It is an ongoing discussion, however,
if such shims should be registered in bio.tools or if that would lead
to an overload of tools with insignificant functionality. Many shims
are, in fact, included in larger software suites or libraries but
are not annotated as individual functions of these and thus are missed
by automated exploration. A related issue is incomplete annotations
due to large numbers of functions performed or formats supported.
For example, some enrichment tools accept tens of different ID types
but list only a few in their tool annotation. Thus some possible matches
are missed. However, using a more abstract parent term in the annotation
can cause erroneous matches, as previously described for <italic>CompassXPort</italic>.</p>
      <p>Such missing links are typical risks of using small domain
models. Interestingly, here the use of the larger sets of tools does
not resolve the issue. The exploration with the extended domain model
does return possible workflows, but these are questionable. As <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref></xref> shows, the first
suggestion is a single tool (<italic>ProCoNa</italic>) that matches
the input/output specification. Like <italic>CompassXPort</italic>, it is annotated as using the general <italic>Mass spectrometry
data format</italic> as input, whereas it actually accepts only some
of these formats (a table containing peptide identifications), so
the problem is similar to the one previously described. The other
suggestions are then actually meaningless extensions of this first
workflow. In the constrained case, no workflows are returned, as the
constraints try to enforce the aforementioned <italic>enrichment analysis</italic> tools, which cannot be used due to the missing shims.</p>

      </fig>
      <p>The unconstrained exploration
with the full domain model yields
the same results as that with the extended model, with the exception
of the <italic>ThermoRawFileParser</italic> tool for the initial file
conversion. As in the previous constrained cases, the constrained
exploration with the full domain model resulted in no solutions. Unfortunately,
in the case of the full model, we could not explore solutions up to
length 20. Because of the exponential runtime complexity and memory
requirements of the exploration algorithm, the composition for lengths
longer than 8 exceeded the available memory, so the exploration process
stopped there. However, on the basis of the results from the extended
model, we assumed that no solutions would have been found among longer
workflows either.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec3.3">
      <title>Use Case #3</title>
      <p>For this use case, the
workflows obtained
with the original tool set largely again correspond to the results
from the previous study. As <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref> shows, there is again a notable difference between
the runs with and without constraints. In fact, for this use case,
the constraints are crucial, as the input/output specification is
quite general and does not provide sufficient information to actually
solve the problem as intended. As <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref></xref> shows, the workflows obtained with the unconstrained
specification are, in principle, valid but lack the validation part
of the reference workflow scenarios. Only the use of constraints ensures
that <italic>Target-Decoy</italic> tools like <italic>PeptideProhphet</italic> and <italic>PTMProphet</italic> are included.</p>
      <fig id="fig5" position="float">

      </fig>
      <p>This observation also holds for
the extended and full tool sets.
Looking at the workflow candidates, we see that the slight difference
in results between the extended and the full domain model is, in fact,
again caused by the additional tool <italic>ThermoRawFileParser</italic> in the full domain. This aligns with our findings from Use Case
#1.</p>
      <p>Note that also for this use case we observe the spurious
use of <italic>CompassXPort</italic>, <italic>T2D converter</italic>, and similar
tools, for the same reasons as previously discussed.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec3.4">
      <title>Use Case #4</title>
      <p>Similar to Use Cases #1 and #3, the workflows
obtained for the fourth use case largely correspond to those from
the previous study when exploring workflows for the original tool
set (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref></xref>). Furthermore,
this scenario again affirms that the usage of additional constraints
to specify the problem decreases the number and increases the quality
of the workflows. (See <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>.) Interestingly, whereas the constrained solutions over the
extended and the full domain differ in the usage of the aforementioned <italic>ThermoRawFileParser</italic> tool, the unconstrained solutions differ
in two more tools, namely, <italic>TDimpute</italic> and <italic>pyQms</italic>. These two tools, similarly to <italic>ThermoRawFileParser</italic>, have not yet been added to the proteomics domain but in fact contain
the EDAM topic <italic>Proteomics</italic>.</p>

    <title>Conclusions</title>
    <p>Annotating
computational tools with ontologically defined terms
describing their operations, data types, and formats enables their
automated composition into tentatively viable workflows. Providing
such annotations (using terms from EDAM ontology) is one of the main
goals of the bio.tools registry, which has become a main catalogue
of computational tools in the life sciences. For this Technical Note,
we applied APE to the bio.tools registry and revisited workflow use
cases from a previous proof-of-concept study in proteomics. Our results
show that this combination can provide an effective means for searching
for possible purpose-specific workflows in large collections of semantically
annotated tools. We see this as another milestone on the long way
toward a workflow exploration system that would ultimately be as comprehensive,
reliable, and easy to use as contemporary route planners.</p>
    <p>Naturally,
the overall quality of the automatically obtained workflows
highly depends on the quality of the semantic domain model, here the
domain ontology (EDAM) and the tool annotations (bio.tools). Many
tools in the community-driven bio.tools registry are not accurately
annotated, presumably due to a lack of awareness and understanding
among curators of what constitutes good annotations for the purpose
of automated tool composition and workflow exploration. Even partially
inadequate annotations can lead to wrong compositions or the exclusion
of tools that suit a requested combination of input, output, and operation.
Hence, to use bio.tools with APE, the relevant tool sets have to be
preprocessed and filtered to sort out poorly annotated annotations.
Conversely, small curated domains can yield high-quality results,
but they tend to overfit, do not enable the exploration of new, possibly
better performing tools and workflows, and furthermore, hardly scale,
so they are not an ideal solution in the long term.</p>
    <p>Accepting
that domain models will never be perfect, APE’s
ability to incrementally provide additional workflow constraints to
the exploration algorithm gains importance. As our results show, such
constraints are crucial for filtering out nonsensical and undesirable
alternatives and for guiding the search toward actually desirable
tool combinations in a still huge space of possibilities. The resulting
workflows also contain valuable information that can be employed to
improve tool annotations. A knowledgeable researcher can adapt the
annotations of neglected tools and correct erroneous annotations in
tools that were assigned to a workflow despite their inability to
fulfill that particular task.</p>
    <p>In this Technical Note, we presented
a manual evaluation and comparison
of automatically composed workflows for four different proteomics
use cases. The evaluation relied mostly on our understanding of the
domain and our experiences with the used tools. To be able to objectively
evaluate each of the proposed workflows, the workflows should furthermore
be checked for the actual compatibility of the involved tools, implemented,
and benchmarked, like we did in our previous study.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref></sup> Indeed, our goal for the future is to develop a platform
that supports the automated exploration, implementation, execution,
and benchmarking in one coherent framework and thus assists the workflow
developer in systematically exploring and evaluating possible workflows
for a specific research question.</p>
    <p>Future work on the way toward
this vision requires addressing different
conceptual as well as practical issues of automated workflow exploration.
For example, constraint specification and tool annotation possibilities
need to be extended and flexibilized to allow for “identity
annotation” (i.e., for format conversion tools that change
the data format but maintain the data type) and quantified constraints
(such as constraints that should hold for all tools in a set individually,
e.g., when using constraints to avoid the redundant use of tools).
On the practical side, bio.tools entries need to be updated (or flagged)
automatically when EDAM changes and the used annotation terms become
obsolete. Another pragmatic next step could be the introduction of
an “automated exploration badge” in bio.tools that marks
tools with validated semantic tool annotations. Thinking further,
it might be desirable for bio.tools to provide quantitative annotations
that could be informative for automated workflow exploration tools
to prioritize possible workflows over others. In addition to the technical
monitoring information from OpenEBench<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref></sup> that is already now available for some tools, this could include
download numbers or marking of tools highly used in workflows (for
example, derived from the WorkflowHub, <uri xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://workflowhub.eu/">https://workflowhub.eu/</uri>) as indicators
of popularity and value to the community. Similarly, allowing the
community to rate or mark tools as useful or well-maintained could
be a basis for providing quality control on tools used within a workflow.</p>

      <p>The bio.tools registry
is a main catalogue of computational tools
in the life sciences. More than 17 000 tools have been registered
by the international bioinformatics community. The bio.tools metadata
schema includes semantic annotations of tool functions, that is, formal
descriptions of tools’ data types, formats, and operations
with terms from the EDAM bioinformatics ontology. Such annotations
enable the automated composition of tools into multistep pipelines
or workflows. In this Technical Note, we revisit a previous case study
on the automated composition of proteomics workflows. We use the same
four workflow scenarios but instead of using a small set of tools
with carefully handcrafted annotations, we explore workflows directly
on bio.tools. We use the Automated Pipeline Explorer (APE), a reimplementation
and extension of the workflow composition method previously used.
Moving “into the wild” opens up an unprecedented wealth
of tools and a huge number of alternative workflows. Automated composition
tools can be used to explore this space of possibilities systematically.
Inevitably, the mixed quality of semantic annotations in bio.tools
leads to unintended or erroneous tool combinations. However, our results
also show that additional control mechanisms (tool filters, configuration
options, and workflow constraints) can effectively guide the exploration
toward smaller sets of more meaningful workflows.</p>

    <title>Introduction</title>
    <p>Converting
experimental biological data into interpretable results
increasingly involves the combination of multiple, diverse computational
tools into pipelines or workflows performing specific sequences of
operations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>−<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref></sup> Working out which tools and combinations are applicable
and scientifically meaningful in practice is often hard, in particular,
when the tools were not developed by the same research group, consortium,
or company. The idea of automated workflow exploration and composition
is to let an algorithm perform or assist in this process. Different
approaches to this idea have been proposed in the past,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>−<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref></sup> the applicability and success of which depend on rich and consistent
semantic tool annotations.</p>
    <p>In 2018, we published the case study
“Automated Workflow
Composition in Mass Spectrometry-Based Proteomics”.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref></sup> There, we demonstrated based on four selected
proteomics use cases how the thorough semantic annotation of tools
with regard to operations, data types, and formats enables their automated
composition into tentatively viable workflows as permutations of a
data analysis plan. As a proof-of-concept study, the study used a
relatively small, well-defined set of tools, with carefully handcrafted
semantic annotations as a basis. In this Technical Note, we outline
the potential of the approach when applied to larger collections of
semantically annotated, complex tools with multiple inputs and outputs.</p>
    <p>Since our initial case study, much has happened: The bio.tools
registry<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref></sup> has grown and matured substantially<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref></sup> and currently covers more than 17 000
bioinformatics tools, including more than 750 tools in the specially
curated proteomics subset (<uri xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://proteomics.bio.tools">https://proteomics.bio.tools</uri>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref></sup> Furthermore,
bio.tools now has a REST application programming interface (API) that
allows for programmatic access to the registry and, in particular,
to the tools’ metadata through their unique bio.tools identifiers.
Along with the registration and annotation of proteomics tools in
bio.tools, the coverage of proteomics terms in the EDAM ontology of
bioinformatics operations, types of data, data identifiers, data formats,
and topics (<uri xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="http://edamontology.org/">http://edamontology.org/</uri>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref></sup> has evolved and matured.
Finally, the PROPHETS framework<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref></sup> used for automated
workflow exploration in the previous study has
been discontinued. With the Automated Pipeline Explorer (APE),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref></sup> we have developed a new framework that implements essentially the
same workflow composition method but is generally better tailored
to the work with scientific workflows.</p>
    <p>In this Technical Note,
we revisit the four proteomics use cases
from our previous study that describe typical scenarios for the analysis
of proteomics data. We use APE for the workflow exploration and move
“into the wild”: Instead of using a small, handcrafted
set of tools and annotations, we work with tools and annotations directly
from the bio.tools registry. This opens up an unprecedented wealth
of tools and, accordingly, a huge number of possible alternative workflows.
With APE, we systematically explore the space of possibilities; however,
as the quality of semantic annotations in bio.tools varies, deviations
in the quality of the automatically explored workflows are to be expected.
Therefore, we focus here on evaluating the quality of the suggested
workflows, in particular, checking for impossible solutions and discussing
possible ways of preventing their occurrence.</p>
    <p>The remainder
of this Technical Note is structured as follows.
In the next section, we describe the experimental setup. Then, we
present and discuss the results from the workflow exploration experiments
before concluding with a short summary and perspectives for future
work. The data and code for running this study, along with the workflow
exploration results and evaluation data, are available online at <uri xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://github.com/sanctuuary/Proteomics_domain_setup">https://github.com/sanctuuary/Proteomics_domain_setup</uri> and in the <xref rid="notes-1" ref-type="notes">Supporting Information</xref>.</p>

      <title>Automated Pipeline Explorer
(APE)</title>
      <p>APE<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref></sup> is a command line tool and Java
API for the automated exploration
of possible computational pipelines (scientific workflows) from large
collections of computational tools. We use it as a standalone tool
in this study, but in its capacity as an API, it could also be used
as a component for workflow exploration within a workflow management
system such as KNIME<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref></sup> or Galaxy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref></sup> Furthermore, APE can export the obtained workflows
in Common Workflow Language (CWL, <uri xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://w3id.org/cwl/">https://w3id.org/cwl/</uri>) format to facilitate integration with
other systems. APE is open-source software and is available on GitHub
(<uri xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://github.com/sanctuuary/APE">https://github.com/sanctuuary/APE</uri>).</p>
      <p>The workflow exploration algorithm used by APE is a variation
and extension of the Semantic Linear Time Logic (SLTL)-based process
synthesis approach originally introduced by Steffen et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref></sup> Operating on input/output-annotated tools in
combination with type and operation taxonomies, this approach aligns
perfectly with the information that is available through bio.tools
and EDAM. Therefore, we chose to follow this approach instead of potentially
more powerful synthesis or planning techniques. In particular, planning
approaches based on Description Logic<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref></sup> have been demonstrated to be applicable to the automated workflow
composition problem in the past.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref></sup> They do, however, require
more comprehensive domain models (sophisticated ontologies), which
are not readily available.</p>
      <p>Concretely, the semantic domain model
we provided to APE consists
of operation, type, and format taxonomies as controlled vocabularies
for the description of computational tools (directly derived from
EDAM) and functional tool annotations (inputs, outputs, operations
performed) using terms from these taxonomies (directly derived from
bio.tools). The domain setup process is described in further detail
as follows. The workflow specifications we provided to APE comprised
the available inputs and intended outputs (data type and format, again
in EDAM terms) and, in some cases, additional constraints (provided
through open text templates that internally translate to SLTL formulas).</p>
      <p>On this basis, APE computes possible workflows. Intuitively, this
is a two-step process:<list list-type="simple"><list-item><label>1.</label><p>The tools’ input/output annotations
imply a network of technically possible tool sequences, which constitutes
the search space for the workflow exploration.</p></list-item><list-item><label>2.</label><p>In this search space, APE looks for
paths that match the concrete workflow specification (from workflow
inputs to outputs, while respecting additional constraints).</p></list-item></list></p>
      <p>Technically, this process is implemented
as temporal logic-based
program synthesis with iterative deepening; that is, the algorithm
explores the workflows requiring the least amount of steps to solve
the given problem first. APE translates the domain knowledge and workflow
specification into propositional logical formulas and feeds them to
an automated constraint solver to compute satisfying instances. These
solutions are then translated into actual candidate workflows and
sorted by length. For a detailed description of the implementation,
we refer to Kasalica et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref></sup></p>

      <title>Domain Models</title>
      <p>In our previous study,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref></sup> the domain
model comprised 26 tools (mostly but not exclusively
from the <uri xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="http://ms-utils.org">ms-utils.org</uri> collection
of mass-spectrometry data analysis tools) that we annotated in a CSV
file with input and output data type and formats as well as operations
using terms from the EDAM ontology. In this study, we fetched the
corresponding tool annotations directly from the bio.tools registry
via its REST API. The bio.tools annotation schema also uses the EDAM
ontology as reference vocabulary, but in contrast with our previous
tabular annotation format, it allows for the annotation of multiple
inputs and outputs per tool. Thus we now work with significantly more
comprehensive descriptions of the available tools’ functionality.</p>
      <p>For this study, we worked with three different domain models:<list list-type="simple"><list-item><label>1.</label><p>The <bold>original</bold> set of tools
(comet, enrichnet, genetrail, genetrail2, gprofile_r, idconvert, isobar,
libra, msconvert, mzXMLplot, Pep3D, PeptideProphet, peptideshaker,
proteinprophet, protk, PTMProphet, ssrcalc, searchgui, Tandem2XML,
rt, xml2tsv, xtandem, extract_protein_names), comprising the tools
from the previous study that are available in bio.tools.</p></list-item><list-item><label>2.</label><p>An <bold>extended</bold> set of proteomics
tools, corresponding to the labeled proteomics domain in bio.tools
(<uri xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://proteomics.bio.tools">https://proteomics.bio.tools</uri>), which extends the original set of tools.</p></list-item><list-item><label>3.</label><p>The <bold>full</bold> bio.tools set,
containing all of the tools currently available in the registry.</p></list-item></list></p>
      <p>To create the three domain models, we (1)
used the bio.tools REST
API to fetch the JSON files containing the respective bio.tools native
annotations (which can contain multiple function annotations per tool),
(2) cleaned the set of annotations by keeping only well-annotated
functions (details follow), and (3) transformed the annotations to
the APE annotation format. The quality of the domain model determines
the quality of the workflows obtained through automated exploration.
bio.tools contains thousands of tools, annotated by a diverse group
of contributors. Not surprisingly, this leads to mixed levels of annotation
quality. In particular, many of the tool annotations lack input or
output definitions, specify them vaguely or incompletely, or use outdated
EDAM references. Therefore, we discarded annotations that:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>do not specify an input, as these
tools can be used
at any step of the workflow and typically introduce unnecessary new
data</p></list-item><list-item><p>do not specify an output (typically
these are interactive
tools), as they do not contribute to solving a data analysis problem</p></list-item><list-item><p>miss a data type or format specification,
as these are
incomplete annotations</p></list-item><list-item><p>reference deprecated
EDAM data type or format terms,
as they are not part of the domain taxonomy anymore</p></list-item></list></p>
      <p>Note that there are also many tool annotations that
reference deprecated
EDAM operation terms; however, we classify those as noncritical annotation
errors and allow such tools. The only way that such domain model could
produce wrong results is by restricting usage of the missing tool
types through explicit constraints, which we rarely do in the studied
use cases.</p>
      <p><xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="other">Table <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="other">1</xref></xref> summarizes
the effects of cleaning the annotation sets while creating the three
domain models. The annotation quality of the small, original tool
set is again good, and only three tools were discarded. In the larger,
community-curated domain of proteomics, we find around a third of
the tools to be in a well-annotated format, whereas on the global
level, &lt;10% of bio.tools are directly suitable for automated exploration.
Still, these new domain models with 271 and 1642 tools, respectively,
provide a next-level challenge for automated workflow exploration
and resemble the variety of tools in a real-world setting better than
the original set.</p>

      <title>Workflow Exploration Runs</title>
      <p>As illustrated in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref></xref> (top), this study
comprised 24 different workflow exploration runs in total. For each
of the three domain models (Original, Extended, and Full bio.tools),
we let APE explore possible workflows for all four use cases. Furthermore,
we apply two different versions of the workflow specifications: desired
input/output only (I/O) and I/O with additional constraints (I/O+C).
This distinction allows us to evaluate the effects of these additional
constraints in comparison with I/O specification only when exploring
workflows in large collections of tools. In the previous case study,
even with a small set of tools, constraints were crucial to guide
the exploration toward the intended workflows, as an I/O specification
alone did not provide sufficient information. We expected this to
be even more needed with the increased size of the domain model.</p>
      <p>We limited the exploration runs to the first 100 (shortest) workflows.
This choice was motivated by two observations: First, as workflow
candidates get longer, they tend to simply extend already considered
shorter solutions and introduce redundant steps. Second, users of
automated workflow exploration tools are able to process and compare
only a limited number of workflows, and in our experience, 100 is
a reasonable bound in practice. Finally, because of resource limitation,
we terminate the search if no solutions are found until length 20
(workflows with 20 operation steps).</p>
      <p>The experiments were run
using bio.tools annotations as of November
25, 2020, EDAM version 1.24, and APE version 1.1.2 on a i7-6500U CPU
at 2.50 GHz and a 16 GB RAM machine running on Ubuntu 20.04. We did
not measure the runtime behavior of the workflow exploration algorithm
systematically in this study. For the smallest domain model, the runtime
was a few seconds; exploration using the largest domain model was
averaging ∼10 min, with the longest time of almost 1 h. In
general, runtime performance increases with the size of the domain
model and the length of the solutions.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec2.5">
      <title>Workflow Evaluation</title>
      <p>To evaluate the quality of the
suggested workflows, two domain experts (proteomics researchers with
extensive tool and workflow experience) scored the first 20 workflow
candidates of each exploration run on a scale from 0 to 3 according
to the following criteria:<list list-type="simple"><list-item><label>3:</label><p>Good workflow, have seen it or similar
before, I know it will work</p></list-item><list-item><label>2:</label><p>Interesting suggestion, seems viable,
could work, worth trying</p></list-item><list-item><label>1:</label><p>Might work, but does not seem very
useful or has unnecessary steps</p></list-item><list-item><label>0:</label><p>I know that it will not work</p></list-item></list></p>
      <p>The two
experts scored the workflows independently.
We calculated the averages of their scores for subsequent analysis.
Further evaluation through implementation, execution, and benchmarking,
like we performed in the previous study,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref></sup> was out of scope for this study and is left for future work.</p>

    <title>Results
and Discussion</title>
    <p>As follows, we summarize and discuss the workflows
found in all
exploration settings previously described. We use the number of obtained
workflows and the scores they received from the domain experts (see <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>) as indicators of
the workflow exploration comprehensiveness and the quality in the
different setups.</p>

    </fig>
    <p>As general observations, the workflow-evaluating domain experts
remarked that they found this to be an interesting and insightful
exercise. On the one hand, they came across several interesting, sometimes
even surprising, workflow suggestions that they would not have thought
about themselves but that seem worth trying. On the other hand, for
faulty or insensible workflow suggestions, they could usually see
how the (flawed) annotations of the involved tools set the automated
composer on a wrong track.</p>
    <sec id="sec3.1">
      <title>Use Case #1</title>
      <p>The workflows we obtained
for the first
use case with the original tool set closely resemble the corresponding
results from the previous study. First workflows for the specification
are found at a length of three, which corresponds to workflows of
three successive tools. As the examples in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref></xref> indicate, the main difference from the results
of the previous study is that some tools that were previously used
(e.g., <italic>X!Tandem</italic>, <italic>SSRCalc</italic>) are not
included anymore. This is due to different annotations of the tools,
which are both now annotated to expect two inputs instead of one.</p>
      <fig id="fig3" position="float">
        <label>Figure 3</label>
        <caption>
          <p>Example
workflow candidates: Use Case #1.</p>

      </fig>
      <p>The example workflows for the original tool set also show another
frequently observed pattern: Short workflows with a conversion step
(such as <italic>msConvert</italic>) often are contained again in
longer workflows that simply repeat the conversion step. These redundant
steps could be avoided by introducing constraints that prevent multiple
conversion operations over the same data. Currently, this requires
formulating such constraints per individual tool, so we are considering
ways of adding this as a more convenient configuration option to APE.</p>
      <p>When we explore workflows for the same specification but with the
extended and full sets of tools, the number of results significantly
increases. As <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref></xref> indicates, the additional results comprise several new and sometimes
surprising workflow suggestions, such as the combination of using <italic>MZmine</italic> before <italic>Mascot Server</italic>. However, there
are also workflow suggestions that are less sensible. For example,
some workflows start with the tool <italic>CompassXPort</italic>,
although it cannot read <italic>Thermo RAW</italic> files. The reason
is that <italic>CompassXPort</italic> is annotated in bio.tools to
read <italic>Mass spectrometry data format</italic> files, which is
the parent term for 30 specific file formats including <italic>Thermo
RAW. CompassXPort</italic> cannot read <italic>Thermo RAW</italic>, but this cannot be inferred when using general annotations including
parent terms. Ideally, <italic>CompassXPort</italic> would be annotated
in bio.tools with a precise list of accepted input formats and not
their parent term. To work around this with the current version of
APE, a constraint can be added that, for example, excludes <italic>CompassXPort</italic> from the exploration. Alternatively, one could
restrict the domain model to include only tools described by sufficiently
specific file formats. However, given the current state of tool annotations,
such a restriction is likely to strongly decrease the domain model
size. To solve such problems more generally, we are currently investigating
possibilities for extending APE with new configuration options or
heuristics for data format handling.</p>
      <p>Interestingly, we obtained
almost the same results for the extended
and full domain models. The only notable difference is the occurrence
of a rather new parsing tool <italic>ThermoRawFileParser</italic> in
the workflow solutions with the full domain model. <italic>ThermoRawFileParser</italic> is not yet included in the proteomics domain, as it has been recently
added. With the exception of this tool, extending the domain model
with tools from outside the bio.tools proteomics domain does not create
new possibilities for this use case. This can be interpreted as evidence
that the coverage of proteomics tools in the respective bio.tools
domain is comprehensive.</p>
      <p>A general observation from the evaluation
is that the constraints
do indeed have a considerable effect on the number and quality of
workflows obtained. As <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref> shows, for all domain models, the domain experts gave higher
scores to the workflows explored with constraints. This is especially
important with the extended and full domain models. There, the number
of solutions exceeds the threshold of 100 already at length 4 in the
unconstrained case. To a large extent, these are workflows that are
(presumably) implementable based on their input/output annotations
but that do not perform the operations actually intended by the workflow
developer. Constraints that specify these intentions thus better help
to drastically decrease the number of unfeasible workflows. Furthermore,
they allow for the exploration of longer and, at the same time, more
meaningful workflows. For this use case, the hand-curated domain model
appears to be more restrictive and effective for finding appropriate
solutions than the constrained case over a larger domain model. We
attribute this to the specific tailoring of the original domain model
to this use case, an approach that does, however, hardly scale in
practice. This reemphasizes the importance of using appropriate constraints
when dealing with larger collections of tools and annotations from
community repositories.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec3.2">
      <title>Use Case #2</title>
      <p>When exploring workflows
for the second
use case with the original tool set, somewhat surprisingly, we did
not find any. The reason is that the <italic>enrichment analysis</italic> tools (<italic>gProfiler</italic>, <italic>EnrichNet</italic>, etc.),
which are needed to generate the specified workflow output, are annotated
to expect a <italic>Gene ID</italic> type as one of the two obligatory
inputs. However, there is no tool in the domain model that would generate
a <italic>Gene ID</italic> as output, and hence there is a missing
link that prevents the exploration from finding corresponding workflows.
A “shim” tool that converts IDs into each other (e.g., <italic>UniProt protein accession</italic> into <italic>Gene IDs</italic>) could provide this missing link. It is an ongoing discussion, however,
if such shims should be registered in bio.tools or if that would lead
to an overload of tools with insignificant functionality. Many shims
are, in fact, included in larger software suites or libraries but
are not annotated as individual functions of these and thus are missed
by automated exploration. A related issue is incomplete annotations
due to large numbers of functions performed or formats supported.
For example, some enrichment tools accept tens of different ID types
but list only a few in their tool annotation. Thus some possible matches
are missed. However, using a more abstract parent term in the annotation
can cause erroneous matches, as previously described for <italic>CompassXPort</italic>.</p>
      <p>Such missing links are typical risks of using small domain
models. Interestingly, here the use of the larger sets of tools does
not resolve the issue. The exploration with the extended domain model
does return possible workflows, but these are questionable. As <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref></xref> shows, the first
suggestion is a single tool (<italic>ProCoNa</italic>) that matches
the input/output specification. Like <italic>CompassXPort</italic>, it is annotated as using the general <italic>Mass spectrometry
data format</italic> as input, whereas it actually accepts only some
of these formats (a table containing peptide identifications), so
the problem is similar to the one previously described. The other
suggestions are then actually meaningless extensions of this first
workflow. In the constrained case, no workflows are returned, as the
constraints try to enforce the aforementioned <italic>enrichment analysis</italic> tools, which cannot be used due to the missing shims.</p>

      <p>The unconstrained exploration
with the full domain model yields
the same results as that with the extended model, with the exception
of the <italic>ThermoRawFileParser</italic> tool for the initial file
conversion. As in the previous constrained cases, the constrained
exploration with the full domain model resulted in no solutions. Unfortunately,
in the case of the full model, we could not explore solutions up to
length 20. Because of the exponential runtime complexity and memory
requirements of the exploration algorithm, the composition for lengths
longer than 8 exceeded the available memory, so the exploration process
stopped there. However, on the basis of the results from the extended
model, we assumed that no solutions would have been found among longer
workflows either.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec3.3">
      <title>Use Case #3</title>
      <p>For this use case, the
workflows obtained
with the original tool set largely again correspond to the results
from the previous study. As <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref> shows, there is again a notable difference between
the runs with and without constraints. In fact, for this use case,
the constraints are crucial, as the input/output specification is
quite general and does not provide sufficient information to actually
solve the problem as intended. As <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref></xref> shows, the workflows obtained with the unconstrained
specification are, in principle, valid but lack the validation part
of the reference workflow scenarios. Only the use of constraints ensures
that <italic>Target-Decoy</italic> tools like <italic>PeptideProhphet</italic> and <italic>PTMProphet</italic> are included.</p>
      <fig id="fig5" position="float">

      </fig>
      <p>This observation also holds for
the extended and full tool sets.
Looking at the workflow candidates, we see that the slight difference
in results between the extended and the full domain model is, in fact,
again caused by the additional tool <italic>ThermoRawFileParser</italic> in the full domain. This aligns with our findings from Use Case
#1.</p>
      <p>Note that also for this use case we observe the spurious
use of <italic>CompassXPort</italic>, <italic>T2D converter</italic>, and similar
tools, for the same reasons as previously discussed.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec3.4">
      <title>Use Case #4</title>
      <p>Similar to Use Cases #1 and #3, the workflows
obtained for the fourth use case largely correspond to those from
the previous study when exploring workflows for the original tool
set (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref></xref>). Furthermore,
this scenario again affirms that the usage of additional constraints
to specify the problem decreases the number and increases the quality
of the workflows. (See <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>.) Interestingly, whereas the constrained solutions over the
extended and the full domain differ in the usage of the aforementioned <italic>ThermoRawFileParser</italic> tool, the unconstrained solutions differ
in two more tools, namely, <italic>TDimpute</italic> and <italic>pyQms</italic>. These two tools, similarly to <italic>ThermoRawFileParser</italic>, have not yet been added to the proteomics domain but in fact contain
the EDAM topic <italic>Proteomics</italic>.</p>

    <title>Conclusions</title>
    <p>Annotating
computational tools with ontologically defined terms
describing their operations, data types, and formats enables their
automated composition into tentatively viable workflows. Providing
such annotations (using terms from EDAM ontology) is one of the main
goals of the bio.tools registry, which has become a main catalogue
of computational tools in the life sciences. For this Technical Note,
we applied APE to the bio.tools registry and revisited workflow use
cases from a previous proof-of-concept study in proteomics. Our results
show that this combination can provide an effective means for searching
for possible purpose-specific workflows in large collections of semantically
annotated tools. We see this as another milestone on the long way
toward a workflow exploration system that would ultimately be as comprehensive,
reliable, and easy to use as contemporary route planners.</p>
    <p>Naturally,
the overall quality of the automatically obtained workflows
highly depends on the quality of the semantic domain model, here the
domain ontology (EDAM) and the tool annotations (bio.tools). Many
tools in the community-driven bio.tools registry are not accurately
annotated, presumably due to a lack of awareness and understanding
among curators of what constitutes good annotations for the purpose
of automated tool composition and workflow exploration. Even partially
inadequate annotations can lead to wrong compositions or the exclusion
of tools that suit a requested combination of input, output, and operation.
Hence, to use bio.tools with APE, the relevant tool sets have to be
preprocessed and filtered to sort out poorly annotated annotations.
Conversely, small curated domains can yield high-quality results,
but they tend to overfit, do not enable the exploration of new, possibly
better performing tools and workflows, and furthermore, hardly scale,
so they are not an ideal solution in the long term.</p>
    <p>Accepting
that domain models will never be perfect, APE’s
ability to incrementally provide additional workflow constraints to
the exploration algorithm gains importance. As our results show, such
constraints are crucial for filtering out nonsensical and undesirable
alternatives and for guiding the search toward actually desirable
tool combinations in a still huge space of possibilities. The resulting
workflows also contain valuable information that can be employed to
improve tool annotations. A knowledgeable researcher can adapt the
annotations of neglected tools and correct erroneous annotations in
tools that were assigned to a workflow despite their inability to
fulfill that particular task.</p>
    <p>In this Technical Note, we presented
a manual evaluation and comparison
of automatically composed workflows for four different proteomics
use cases. The evaluation relied mostly on our understanding of the
domain and our experiences with the used tools. To be able to objectively
evaluate each of the proposed workflows, the workflows should furthermore
be checked for the actual compatibility of the involved tools, implemented,
and benchmarked, like we did in our previous study.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref></sup> Indeed, our goal for the future is to develop a platform
that supports the automated exploration, implementation, execution,
and benchmarking in one coherent framework and thus assists the workflow
developer in systematically exploring and evaluating possible workflows
for a specific research question.</p>
    <p>Future work on the way toward
this vision requires addressing different
conceptual as well as practical issues of automated workflow exploration.
For example, constraint specification and tool annotation possibilities
need to be extended and flexibilized to allow for “identity
annotation” (i.e., for format conversion tools that change
the data format but maintain the data type) and quantified constraints
(such as constraints that should hold for all tools in a set individually,
e.g., when using constraints to avoid the redundant use of tools).
On the practical side, bio.tools entries need to be updated (or flagged)
automatically when EDAM changes and the used annotation terms become
obsolete. Another pragmatic next step could be the introduction of
an “automated exploration badge” in bio.tools that marks
tools with validated semantic tool annotations. Thinking further,
it might be desirable for bio.tools to provide quantitative annotations
that could be informative for automated workflow exploration tools
to prioritize possible workflows over others. In addition to the technical
monitoring information from OpenEBench<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref></sup> that is already now available for some tools, this could include
download numbers or marking of tools highly used in workflows (for
example, derived from the WorkflowHub, <uri xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://workflowhub.eu/">https://workflowhub.eu/</uri>) as indicators
of popularity and value to the community. Similarly, allowing the
community to rate or mark tools as useful or well-maintained could
be a basis for providing quality control on tools used within a workflow.</p>

      <p>The bio.tools registry
is a main catalogue of computational tools
in the life sciences. More than 17 000 tools have been registered
by the international bioinformatics community. The bio.tools metadata
schema includes semantic annotations of tool functions, that is, formal
descriptions of tools’ data types, formats, and operations
with terms from the EDAM bioinformatics ontology. Such annotations
enable the automated composition of tools into multistep pipelines
or workflows. In this Technical Note, we revisit a previous case study
on the automated composition of proteomics workflows. We use the same
four workflow scenarios but instead of using a small set of tools
with carefully handcrafted annotations, we explore workflows directly
on bio.tools. We use the Automated Pipeline Explorer (APE), a reimplementation
and extension of the workflow composition method previously used.
Moving “into the wild” opens up an unprecedented wealth
of tools and a huge number of alternative workflows. Automated composition
tools can be used to explore this space of possibilities systematically.
Inevitably, the mixed quality of semantic annotations in bio.tools
leads to unintended or erroneous tool combinations. However, our results
also show that additional control mechanisms (tool filters, configuration
options, and workflow constraints) can effectively guide the exploration
toward smaller sets of more meaningful workflows.</p>

    <title>Introduction</title>
    <p>Converting
experimental biological data into interpretable results
increasingly involves the combination of multiple, diverse computational
tools into pipelines or workflows performing specific sequences of
operations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>−<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref></sup> Working out which tools and combinations are applicable
and scientifically meaningful in practice is often hard, in particular,
when the tools were not developed by the same research group, consortium,
or company. The idea of automated workflow exploration and composition
is to let an algorithm perform or assist in this process. Different
approaches to this idea have been proposed in the past,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>−<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref></sup> the applicability and success of which depend on rich and consistent
semantic tool annotations.</p>
    <p>In 2018, we published the case study
“Automated Workflow
Composition in Mass Spectrometry-Based Proteomics”.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref></sup> There, we demonstrated based on four selected
proteomics use cases how the thorough semantic annotation of tools
with regard to operations, data types, and formats enables their automated
composition into tentatively viable workflows as permutations of a
data analysis plan. As a proof-of-concept study, the study used a
relatively small, well-defined set of tools, with carefully handcrafted
semantic annotations as a basis. In this Technical Note, we outline
the potential of the approach when applied to larger collections of
semantically annotated, complex tools with multiple inputs and outputs.</p>
    <p>Since our initial case study, much has happened: The bio.tools
registry<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref></sup> has grown and matured substantially<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref></sup> and currently covers more than 17 000
bioinformatics tools, including more than 750 tools in the specially
curated proteomics subset (<uri xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://proteomics.bio.tools">https://proteomics.bio.tools</uri>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref></sup> Furthermore,
bio.tools now has a REST application programming interface (API) that
allows for programmatic access to the registry and, in particular,
to the tools’ metadata through their unique bio.tools identifiers.
Along with the registration and annotation of proteomics tools in
bio.tools, the coverage of proteomics terms in the EDAM ontology of
bioinformatics operations, types of data, data identifiers, data formats,
and topics (<uri xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="http://edamontology.org/">http://edamontology.org/</uri>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref></sup> has evolved and matured.
Finally, the PROPHETS framework<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref></sup> used for automated
workflow exploration in the previous study has
been discontinued. With the Automated Pipeline Explorer (APE),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref></sup> we have developed a new framework that implements essentially the
same workflow composition method but is generally better tailored
to the work with scientific workflows.</p>
    <p>In this Technical Note,
we revisit the four proteomics use cases
from our previous study that describe typical scenarios for the analysis
of proteomics data. We use APE for the workflow exploration and move
“into the wild”: Instead of using a small, handcrafted
set of tools and annotations, we work with tools and annotations directly
from the bio.tools registry. This opens up an unprecedented wealth
of tools and, accordingly, a huge number of possible alternative workflows.
With APE, we systematically explore the space of possibilities; however,
as the quality of semantic annotations in bio.tools varies, deviations
in the quality of the automatically explored workflows are to be expected.
Therefore, we focus here on evaluating the quality of the suggested
workflows, in particular, checking for impossible solutions and discussing
possible ways of preventing their occurrence.</p>
    <p>The remainder
of this Technical Note is structured as follows.
In the next section, we describe the experimental setup. Then, we
present and discuss the results from the workflow exploration experiments
before concluding with a short summary and perspectives for future
work. The data and code for running this study, along with the workflow
exploration results and evaluation data, are available online at <uri xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://github.com/sanctuuary/Proteomics_domain_setup">https://github.com/sanctuuary/Proteomics_domain_setup</uri> and in the <xref rid="notes-1" ref-type="notes">Supporting Information</xref>.</p>

      <title>Automated Pipeline Explorer
(APE)</title>
      <p>APE<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref></sup> is a command line tool and Java
API for the automated exploration
of possible computational pipelines (scientific workflows) from large
collections of computational tools. We use it as a standalone tool
in this study, but in its capacity as an API, it could also be used
as a component for workflow exploration within a workflow management
system such as KNIME<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref></sup> or Galaxy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref></sup> Furthermore, APE can export the obtained workflows
in Common Workflow Language (CWL, <uri xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://w3id.org/cwl/">https://w3id.org/cwl/</uri>) format to facilitate integration with
other systems. APE is open-source software and is available on GitHub
(<uri xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://github.com/sanctuuary/APE">https://github.com/sanctuuary/APE</uri>).</p>
      <p>The workflow exploration algorithm used by APE is a variation
and extension of the Semantic Linear Time Logic (SLTL)-based process
synthesis approach originally introduced by Steffen et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref></sup> Operating on input/output-annotated tools in
combination with type and operation taxonomies, this approach aligns
perfectly with the information that is available through bio.tools
and EDAM. Therefore, we chose to follow this approach instead of potentially
more powerful synthesis or planning techniques. In particular, planning
approaches based on Description Logic<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref></sup> have been demonstrated to be applicable to the automated workflow
composition problem in the past.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref></sup> They do, however, require
more comprehensive domain models (sophisticated ontologies), which
are not readily available.</p>
      <p>Concretely, the semantic domain model
we provided to APE consists
of operation, type, and format taxonomies as controlled vocabularies
for the description of computational tools (directly derived from
EDAM) and functional tool annotations (inputs, outputs, operations
performed) using terms from these taxonomies (directly derived from
bio.tools). The domain setup process is described in further detail
as follows. The workflow specifications we provided to APE comprised
the available inputs and intended outputs (data type and format, again
in EDAM terms) and, in some cases, additional constraints (provided
through open text templates that internally translate to SLTL formulas).</p>
      <p>On this basis, APE computes possible workflows. Intuitively, this
is a two-step process:<list list-type="simple"><list-item><label>1.</label><p>The tools’ input/output annotations
imply a network of technically possible tool sequences, which constitutes
the search space for the workflow exploration.</p></list-item><list-item><label>2.</label><p>In this search space, APE looks for
paths that match the concrete workflow specification (from workflow
inputs to outputs, while respecting additional constraints).</p></list-item></list></p>
      <p>Technically, this process is implemented
as temporal logic-based
program synthesis with iterative deepening; that is, the algorithm
explores the workflows requiring the least amount of steps to solve
the given problem first. APE translates the domain knowledge and workflow
specification into propositional logical formulas and feeds them to
an automated constraint solver to compute satisfying instances. These
solutions are then translated into actual candidate workflows and
sorted by length. For a detailed description of the implementation,
we refer to Kasalica et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref></sup></p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec2.2">
      <title>Domain Models</title>
      <p>In our previous study,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref></sup> the domain
model comprised 26 tools (mostly but not exclusively
from the <uri xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="http://ms-utils.org">ms-utils.org</uri> collection
of mass-spectrometry data analysis tools) that we annotated in a CSV
file with input and output data type and formats as well as operations
using terms from the EDAM ontology. In this study, we fetched the
corresponding tool annotations directly from the bio.tools registry
via its REST API. The bio.tools annotation schema also uses the EDAM
ontology as reference vocabulary, but in contrast with our previous
tabular annotation format, it allows for the annotation of multiple
inputs and outputs per tool. Thus we now work with significantly more
comprehensive descriptions of the available tools’ functionality.</p>
      <p>For this study, we worked with three different domain models:<list list-type="simple"><list-item><label>1.</label><p>The <bold>original</bold> set of tools
(comet, enrichnet, genetrail, genetrail2, gprofile_r, idconvert, isobar,
libra, msconvert, mzXMLplot, Pep3D, PeptideProphet, peptideshaker,
proteinprophet, protk, PTMProphet, ssrcalc, searchgui, Tandem2XML,
rt, xml2tsv, xtandem, extract_protein_names), comprising the tools
from the previous study that are available in bio.tools.</p></list-item><list-item><label>2.</label><p>An <bold>extended</bold> set of proteomics
tools, corresponding to the labeled proteomics domain in bio.tools
(<uri xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://proteomics.bio.tools">https://proteomics.bio.tools</uri>), which extends the original set of tools.</p></list-item><list-item><label>3.</label><p>The <bold>full</bold> bio.tools set,
containing all of the tools currently available in the registry.</p></list-item></list></p>
      <p>To create the three domain models, we (1)
used the bio.tools REST
API to fetch the JSON files containing the respective bio.tools native
annotations (which can contain multiple function annotations per tool),
(2) cleaned the set of annotations by keeping only well-annotated
functions (details follow), and (3) transformed the annotations to
the APE annotation format. The quality of the domain model determines
the quality of the workflows obtained through automated exploration.
bio.tools contains thousands of tools, annotated by a diverse group
of contributors. Not surprisingly, this leads to mixed levels of annotation
quality. In particular, many of the tool annotations lack input or
output definitions, specify them vaguely or incompletely, or use outdated
EDAM references. Therefore, we discarded annotations that:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>do not specify an input, as these
tools can be used
at any step of the workflow and typically introduce unnecessary new
data</p></list-item><list-item><p>do not specify an output (typically
these are interactive
tools), as they do not contribute to solving a data analysis problem</p></list-item><list-item><p>miss a data type or format specification,
as these are
incomplete annotations</p></list-item><list-item><p>reference deprecated
EDAM data type or format terms,
as they are not part of the domain taxonomy anymore</p></list-item></list></p>
      <p>Note that there are also many tool annotations that
reference deprecated
EDAM operation terms; however, we classify those as noncritical annotation
errors and allow such tools. The only way that such domain model could
produce wrong results is by restricting usage of the missing tool
types through explicit constraints, which we rarely do in the studied
use cases.</p>
      <p><xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="other">Table <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="other">1</xref></xref> summarizes
the effects of cleaning the annotation sets while creating the three
domain models. The annotation quality of the small, original tool
set is again good, and only three tools were discarded. In the larger,
community-curated domain of proteomics, we find around a third of
the tools to be in a well-annotated format, whereas on the global
level, &lt;10% of bio.tools are directly suitable for automated exploration.
Still, these new domain models with 271 and 1642 tools, respectively,
provide a next-level challenge for automated workflow exploration
and resemble the variety of tools in a real-world setting better than
the original set.</p>

      <title>Workflow Specification Use Cases</title>
      <p>We reuse the four
proteomics data analysis use cases from our previous study,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref></sup> which require workflows of increasing complexity:<list list-type="simple"><list-item><label>1.</label><p>Extraction of the <italic>Amino acid

      <p><xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="other">Table <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="other">2</xref></xref> summarizes
the corresponding workflow specifications, which are
the input for APE. Because EDAM and bio.tools have evolved since the
previous case study, we revised the workflow specifications to match
the now available terms. Concretely, we generalized the output specifications
in the first and the fourth use cases from the expected data types
to their parent classes, as none of the annotated tools used the originally
specified types as input/output anymore. In the first use case, we
substituted <italic>Amino acid index (hydropathy)</italic> with <italic>Amino acid property</italic>, whereas in the fourth use case, we
replaced <italic>Gene expression profile</italic> by <italic>Expression
data</italic>. Similarly, we updated some of the workflow constraints.
The term <italic>validation of peptide-spectrum matches</italic> became
obsolete with EDAM 1.19, so instead, we opted for the similar <italic>Target-Decoy</italic> term. Furthermore, we updated the term <italic>gene-set enrichment analysis</italic> to <italic>enrichment analysis</italic>. Although it is not deprecated, it is not used in any of the tool
annotations.</p>

      <title>Workflow Exploration Runs</title>
      <p>As illustrated in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref></xref> (top), this study
comprised 24 different workflow exploration runs in total. For each
of the three domain models (Original, Extended, and Full bio.tools),
we let APE explore possible workflows for all four use cases. Furthermore,
we apply two different versions of the workflow specifications: desired
input/output only (I/O) and I/O with additional constraints (I/O+C).
This distinction allows us to evaluate the effects of these additional
constraints in comparison with I/O specification only when exploring
workflows in large collections of tools. In the previous case study,
even with a small set of tools, constraints were crucial to guide
the exploration toward the intended workflows, as an I/O specification
alone did not provide sufficient information. We expected this to
be even more needed with the increased size of the domain model.</p>
      <p>We limited the exploration runs to the first 100 (shortest) workflows.
This choice was motivated by two observations: First, as workflow
candidates get longer, they tend to simply extend already considered
shorter solutions and introduce redundant steps. Second, users of
automated workflow exploration tools are able to process and compare
only a limited number of workflows, and in our experience, 100 is
a reasonable bound in practice. Finally, because of resource limitation,
we terminate the search if no solutions are found until length 20
(workflows with 20 operation steps).</p>
      <p>The experiments were run
using bio.tools annotations as of November
25, 2020, EDAM version 1.24, and APE version 1.1.2 on a i7-6500U CPU
at 2.50 GHz and a 16 GB RAM machine running on Ubuntu 20.04. We did
not measure the runtime behavior of the workflow exploration algorithm
systematically in this study. For the smallest domain model, the runtime
was a few seconds; exploration using the largest domain model was
averaging ∼10 min, with the longest time of almost 1 h. In
general, runtime performance increases with the size of the domain
model and the length of the solutions.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec2.5">
      <title>Workflow Evaluation</title>
      <p>To evaluate the quality of the
suggested workflows, two domain experts (proteomics researchers with
extensive tool and workflow experience) scored the first 20 workflow
candidates of each exploration run on a scale from 0 to 3 according
to the following criteria:<list list-type="simple"><list-item><label>3:</label><p>Good workflow, have seen it or similar
before, I know it will work</p></list-item><list-item><label>2:</label><p>Interesting suggestion, seems viable,
could work, worth trying</p></list-item><list-item><label>1:</label><p>Might work, but does not seem very
useful or has unnecessary steps</p></list-item><list-item><label>0:</label><p>I know that it will not work</p></list-item></list></p>
      <p>The two
experts scored the workflows independently.
We calculated the averages of their scores for subsequent analysis.
Further evaluation through implementation, execution, and benchmarking,
like we performed in the previous study,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref></sup> was out of scope for this study and is left for future work.</p>

    <title>Results
and Discussion</title>
    <p>As follows, we summarize and discuss the workflows
found in all
exploration settings previously described. We use the number of obtained
workflows and the scores they received from the domain experts (see <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>) as indicators of
the workflow exploration comprehensiveness and the quality in the
different setups.</p>

    </fig>
    <p>As general observations, the workflow-evaluating domain experts
remarked that they found this to be an interesting and insightful
exercise. On the one hand, they came across several interesting, sometimes
even surprising, workflow suggestions that they would not have thought
about themselves but that seem worth trying. On the other hand, for
faulty or insensible workflow suggestions, they could usually see
how the (flawed) annotations of the involved tools set the automated
composer on a wrong track.</p>
    <sec id="sec3.1">
      <title>Use Case #1</title>
      <p>The workflows we obtained
for the first
use case with the original tool set closely resemble the corresponding
results from the previous study. First workflows for the specification
are found at a length of three, which corresponds to workflows of
three successive tools. As the examples in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref></xref> indicate, the main difference from the results
of the previous study is that some tools that were previously used
(e.g., <italic>X!Tandem</italic>, <italic>SSRCalc</italic>) are not
included anymore. This is due to different annotations of the tools,
which are both now annotated to expect two inputs instead of one.</p>
      <fig id="fig3" position="float">
        <label>Figure 3</label>
        <caption>
          <p>Example
workflow candidates: Use Case #1.</p>
        </caption>
        <graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="pr0c00983_0004" id="fx1" position="float"/>
      </fig>
      <p>The example workflows for the original tool set also show another
frequently observed pattern: Short workflows with a conversion step
(such as <italic>msConvert</italic>) often are contained again in
longer workflows that simply repeat the conversion step. These redundant
steps could be avoided by introducing constraints that prevent multiple
conversion operations over the same data. Currently, this requires
formulating such constraints per individual tool, so we are considering
ways of adding this as a more convenient configuration option to APE.</p>
      <p>When we explore workflows for the same specification but with the
extended and full sets of tools, the number of results significantly
increases. As <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref></xref> indicates, the additional results comprise several new and sometimes
surprising workflow suggestions, such as the combination of using <italic>MZmine</italic> before <italic>Mascot Server</italic>. However, there
are also workflow suggestions that are less sensible. For example,
some workflows start with the tool <italic>CompassXPort</italic>,
although it cannot read <italic>Thermo RAW</italic> files. The reason
is that <italic>CompassXPort</italic> is annotated in bio.tools to
read <italic>Mass spectrometry data format</italic> files, which is
the parent term for 30 specific file formats including <italic>Thermo
RAW. CompassXPort</italic> cannot read <italic>Thermo RAW</italic>, but this cannot be inferred when using general annotations including
parent terms. Ideally, <italic>CompassXPort</italic> would be annotated
in bio.tools with a precise list of accepted input formats and not
their parent term. To work around this with the current version of
APE, a constraint can be added that, for example, excludes <italic>CompassXPort</italic> from the exploration. Alternatively, one could
restrict the domain model to include only tools described by sufficiently
specific file formats. However, given the current state of tool annotations,
such a restriction is likely to strongly decrease the domain model
size. To solve such problems more generally, we are currently investigating
possibilities for extending APE with new configuration options or
heuristics for data format handling.</p>
      <p>Interestingly, we obtained
almost the same results for the extended
and full domain models. The only notable difference is the occurrence
of a rather new parsing tool <italic>ThermoRawFileParser</italic> in
the workflow solutions with the full domain model. <italic>ThermoRawFileParser</italic> is not yet included in the proteomics domain, as it has been recently
added. With the exception of this tool, extending the domain model
with tools from outside the bio.tools proteomics domain does not create
new possibilities for this use case. This can be interpreted as evidence
that the coverage of proteomics tools in the respective bio.tools
domain is comprehensive.</p>
      <p>A general observation from the evaluation
is that the constraints
do indeed have a considerable effect on the number and quality of
workflows obtained. As <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref> shows, for all domain models, the domain experts gave higher
scores to the workflows explored with constraints. This is especially
important with the extended and full domain models. There, the number
of solutions exceeds the threshold of 100 already at length 4 in the
unconstrained case. To a large extent, these are workflows that are
(presumably) implementable based on their input/output annotations
but that do not perform the operations actually intended by the workflow
developer. Constraints that specify these intentions thus better help
to drastically decrease the number of unfeasible workflows. Furthermore,
they allow for the exploration of longer and, at the same time, more
meaningful workflows. For this use case, the hand-curated domain model
appears to be more restrictive and effective for finding appropriate
solutions than the constrained case over a larger domain model. We
attribute this to the specific tailoring of the original domain model
to this use case, an approach that does, however, hardly scale in
practice. This reemphasizes the importance of using appropriate constraints
when dealing with larger collections of tools and annotations from
community repositories.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec3.2">
      <title>Use Case #2</title>
      <p>When exploring workflows
for the second
use case with the original tool set, somewhat surprisingly, we did
not find any. The reason is that the <italic>enrichment analysis</italic> tools (<italic>gProfiler</italic>, <italic>EnrichNet</italic>, etc.),
which are needed to generate the specified workflow output, are annotated
to expect a <italic>Gene ID</italic> type as one of the two obligatory
inputs. However, there is no tool in the domain model that would generate
a <italic>Gene ID</italic> as output, and hence there is a missing
link that prevents the exploration from finding corresponding workflows.
A “shim” tool that converts IDs into each other (e.g., <italic>UniProt protein accession</italic> into <italic>Gene IDs</italic>) could provide this missing link. It is an ongoing discussion, however,
if such shims should be registered in bio.tools or if that would lead
to an overload of tools with insignificant functionality. Many shims
are, in fact, included in larger software suites or libraries but
are not annotated as individual functions of these and thus are missed
by automated exploration. A related issue is incomplete annotations
due to large numbers of functions performed or formats supported.
For example, some enrichment tools accept tens of different ID types
but list only a few in their tool annotation. Thus some possible matches
are missed. However, using a more abstract parent term in the annotation
can cause erroneous matches, as previously described for <italic>CompassXPort</italic>.</p>
      <p>Such missing links are typical risks of using small domain
models. Interestingly, here the use of the larger sets of tools does
not resolve the issue. The exploration with the extended domain model
does return possible workflows, but these are questionable. As <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref></xref> shows, the first
suggestion is a single tool (<italic>ProCoNa</italic>) that matches
the input/output specification. Like <italic>CompassXPort</italic>, it is annotated as using the general <italic>Mass spectrometry
data format</italic> as input, whereas it actually accepts only some
of these formats (a table containing peptide identifications), so
the problem is similar to the one previously described. The other
suggestions are then actually meaningless extensions of this first
workflow. In the constrained case, no workflows are returned, as the
constraints try to enforce the aforementioned <italic>enrichment analysis</italic> tools, which cannot be used due to the missing shims.</p>

      </fig>
      <p>The unconstrained exploration
with the full domain model yields
the same results as that with the extended model, with the exception
of the <italic>ThermoRawFileParser</italic> tool for the initial file
conversion. As in the previous constrained cases, the constrained
exploration with the full domain model resulted in no solutions. Unfortunately,
in the case of the full model, we could not explore solutions up to
length 20. Because of the exponential runtime complexity and memory
requirements of the exploration algorithm, the composition for lengths
longer than 8 exceeded the available memory, so the exploration process
stopped there. However, on the basis of the results from the extended
model, we assumed that no solutions would have been found among longer
workflows either.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec3.3">
      <title>Use Case #3</title>
      <p>For this use case, the
workflows obtained
with the original tool set largely again correspond to the results
from the previous study. As <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref> shows, there is again a notable difference between
the runs with and without constraints. In fact, for this use case,
the constraints are crucial, as the input/output specification is
quite general and does not provide sufficient information to actually
solve the problem as intended. As <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref></xref> shows, the workflows obtained with the unconstrained
specification are, in principle, valid but lack the validation part
of the reference workflow scenarios. Only the use of constraints ensures
that <italic>Target-Decoy</italic> tools like <italic>PeptideProhphet</italic> and <italic>PTMProphet</italic> are included.</p>
      <fig id="fig5" position="float">

      </fig>
      <p>This observation also holds for
the extended and full tool sets.
Looking at the workflow candidates, we see that the slight difference
in results between the extended and the full domain model is, in fact,
again caused by the additional tool <italic>ThermoRawFileParser</italic> in the full domain. This aligns with our findings from Use Case
#1.</p>
      <p>Note that also for this use case we observe the spurious
use of <italic>CompassXPort</italic>, <italic>T2D converter</italic>, and similar
tools, for the same reasons as previously discussed.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec3.4">
      <title>Use Case #4</title>
      <p>Similar to Use Cases #1 and #3, the workflows
obtained for the fourth use case largely correspond to those from
the previous study when exploring workflows for the original tool
set (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref></xref>). Furthermore,
this scenario again affirms that the usage of additional constraints
to specify the problem decreases the number and increases the quality
of the workflows. (See <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>.) Interestingly, whereas the constrained solutions over the
extended and the full domain differ in the usage of the aforementioned <italic>ThermoRawFileParser</italic> tool, the unconstrained solutions differ
in two more tools, namely, <italic>TDimpute</italic> and <italic>pyQms</italic>. These two tools, similarly to <italic>ThermoRawFileParser</italic>, have not yet been added to the proteomics domain but in fact contain
the EDAM topic <italic>Proteomics</italic>.</p>

    <title>Conclusions</title>
    <p>Annotating
computational tools with ontologically defined terms
describing their operations, data types, and formats enables their
automated composition into tentatively viable workflows. Providing
such annotations (using terms from EDAM ontology) is one of the main
goals of the bio.tools registry, which has become a main catalogue
of computational tools in the life sciences. For this Technical Note,
we applied APE to the bio.tools registry and revisited workflow use
cases from a previous proof-of-concept study in proteomics. Our results
show that this combination can provide an effective means for searching
for possible purpose-specific workflows in large collections of semantically
annotated tools. We see this as another milestone on the long way
toward a workflow exploration system that would ultimately be as comprehensive,
reliable, and easy to use as contemporary route planners.</p>
    <p>Naturally,
the overall quality of the automatically obtained workflows
highly depends on the quality of the semantic domain model, here the
domain ontology (EDAM) and the tool annotations (bio.tools). Many
tools in the community-driven bio.tools registry are not accurately
annotated, presumably due to a lack of awareness and understanding
among curators of what constitutes good annotations for the purpose
of automated tool composition and workflow exploration. Even partially
inadequate annotations can lead to wrong compositions or the exclusion
of tools that suit a requested combination of input, output, and operation.
Hence, to use bio.tools with APE, the relevant tool sets have to be
preprocessed and filtered to sort out poorly annotated annotations.
Conversely, small curated domains can yield high-quality results,
but they tend to overfit, do not enable the exploration of new, possibly
better performing tools and workflows, and furthermore, hardly scale,
so they are not an ideal solution in the long term.</p>
    <p>Accepting
that domain models will never be perfect, APE’s
ability to incrementally provide additional workflow constraints to
the exploration algorithm gains importance. As our results show, such
constraints are crucial for filtering out nonsensical and undesirable
alternatives and for guiding the search toward actually desirable
tool combinations in a still huge space of possibilities. The resulting
workflows also contain valuable information that can be employed to
improve tool annotations. A knowledgeable researcher can adapt the
annotations of neglected tools and correct erroneous annotations in
tools that were assigned to a workflow despite their inability to
fulfill that particular task.</p>
    <p>In this Technical Note, we presented
a manual evaluation and comparison
of automatically composed workflows for four different proteomics
use cases. The evaluation relied mostly on our understanding of the
domain and our experiences with the used tools. To be able to objectively
evaluate each of the proposed workflows, the workflows should furthermore
be checked for the actual compatibility of the involved tools, implemented,
and benchmarked, like we did in our previous study.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref></sup> Indeed, our goal for the future is to develop a platform
that supports the automated exploration, implementation, execution,
and benchmarking in one coherent framework and thus assists the workflow
developer in systematically exploring and evaluating possible workflows
for a specific research question.</p>
    <p>Future work on the way toward
this vision requires addressing different
conceptual as well as practical issues of automated workflow exploration.
For example, constraint specification and tool annotation possibilities
need to be extended and flexibilized to allow for “identity
annotation” (i.e., for format conversion tools that change
the data format but maintain the data type) and quantified constraints
(such as constraints that should hold for all tools in a set individually,
e.g., when using constraints to avoid the redundant use of tools).
On the practical side, bio.tools entries need to be updated (or flagged)
automatically when EDAM changes and the used annotation terms become
obsolete. Another pragmatic next step could be the introduction of
an “automated exploration badge” in bio.tools that marks
tools with validated semantic tool annotations. Thinking further,
it might be desirable for bio.tools to provide quantitative annotations
that could be informative for automated workflow exploration tools
to prioritize possible workflows over others. In addition to the technical
monitoring information from OpenEBench<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref></sup> that is already now available for some tools, this could include
download numbers or marking of tools highly used in workflows (for
example, derived from the WorkflowHub, <uri xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://workflowhub.eu/">https://workflowhub.eu/</uri>) as indicators
of popularity and value to the community. Similarly, allowing the
community to rate or mark tools as useful or well-maintained could
be a basis for providing quality control on tools used within a workflow.</p>
