      <title>Significance</title>
      <p>Recently, single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) assays have gained popularity in biomedical research. However, batch effects from multiple experiment batches may introduce noise into the dataset. Standard scRNA-seq experiments are too expensive to evaluate a large number of samples. These issues can be addressed by demultiplexing pooled scRNA-seq data using exogenous barcodes or genome-wide RNA mutations; however, these methods are computationally or experimentally challenging and limited. We demonstrated that mitochondrial RNA (mtRNA) variants can be used as an endogenous barcode for demultiplexing, and developed “mitoSplitter” to demultiplex large-scale scRNA-seq data. It has been demonstrated that mitoSplitter would accelerate the use of scRNA-seq assays in biomedical research by accurately analyzing large-scale scRNA-seq samples using cost-effective computational resources.</p>

      <p>Single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) analysis of multiple samples separately can be costly and lead to batch effects. Exogenous barcodes or genome-wide RNA mutations can be used to demultiplex pooled scRNA-seq data, but they are experimentally or computationally challenging and limited in scope. Mitochondrial genomes are small but diverse, providing concise genotype information. We developed “mitoSplitter,” an algorithm that demultiplexes samples using mitochondrial RNA (mtRNA) variants, and demonstrated that mtRNA variants can be used to demultiplex large-scale scRNA-seq data. Using affordable computational resources, mitoSplitter can accurately analyze 10 samples and 60,000 cells in 6 h. To avoid the batch effects from separated experiments, we applied mitoSplitter to analyze the responses of five non-small cell lung cancer cell lines to BET (Bromodomain and extraterminal) chemical degradation in a multiplexed fashion. We found the synthetic lethality of <italic toggle="yes">TOP2A</italic> inhibition and BET chemical degradation in BET inhibitor-resistant cells. The result indicates that mitoSplitter can accelerate the application of scRNA-seq assays in biomedical research.</p>

  <p content-type="flushleft">In recent decades, single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) assays have become widely recognized as useful for biomedical studies (<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). While scRNA-seq assays can robustly identify single cell clusters and genetic markers corresponding to cell types (<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>), the variation in different batches of experiments can introduce undesirable noise to the dataset, also known as batch effects. Moreover, the high cost of regular scRNA-seq experiments has limited their application in analyzing a large number of samples.</p>
  <p>To address these challenges, various technologies have been developed to demultiplex data from mixed samples in scRNA-seq experiments using chemical probes or genetic engineering-based exogenous barcodes (<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr"/>–<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). However, while the use of chemical probes can effectively demultiplex data based on labeling, it is limited by the need for universal antibodies suitable for various analytes, which also increases the cost and sample preparation time. On the other hand, genetic engineering-based exogenous barcodes do not require any antibodies, but their application is limited to cell culture systems or model organisms, making them unsuitable for acquiring scRNA-seq data from mixed clinical samples. Furthermore, the experimental expertise required for creating exogenous barcodes and properly transforming them into cells hinders the widespread adoption of these techniques.</p>
  <p>It is encouraging to note that the demultiplexing of scRNA-seq data can also be achieved by analyzing the natural genomic variants with (<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>) or without (<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr"/>–<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>) the use of whole genome sequencing (WGS) or whole exome sequencing (WES) as references. However, these methods are computationally expensive and complex due to the detection and analysis of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the whole genome as endogenous barcodes. Additionally, assigning demultiplexed cell groups to specific samples still requires data from either WGS or WES, which can significantly increase costs. Therefore, there is a need for a demultiplexing method that offers comparable accuracy but with significantly improved computational efficiency.</p>
  <p>Similar to the SNPs found in the nuclear genome, the mitochondrial genome also contains many variants. It has been validated recently that mitochondrial genome variants can be used as endogenous barcodes for lineage analysis (<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). And our previous study has shown that mitochondrial RNA (mtRNA) variants can be used for single cell lineage tracing (<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Based on this, we hypothesized that it would be feasible to demultiplex scRNA-seq data from mixed samples using the variants identified in the mtRNA. However, the application of mtRNA variants as endogenous barcodes is currently limited to lineage tracing analysis of full-length single-cell sequencing data with limited throughput (<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Due to the low mitochondrial genome coverage obtained from each single cell, the methods used to perform genotyping on droplet or microwell-based scRNA-seq data were lacking. To overcome these technical shortcomings, we developed a computational algorithm called “mitoSplitter” to demultiplex mixed scRNA-seq samples with limited coverage by referencing the SNPs found in mtRNA.</p>
  <p>The mitoSplitter algorithm uses bulk RNA-seq data from mitochondria or whole cells, rather than relying on WGS or WES data, as references. This approach significantly reduces the experimental cost of building the reference dataset and the computational cost of identifying the endogenous barcodes. Using a Label Propagation Algorithm (LPA), mitoSplitter can reliably demultiplex scRNA-seq data from human cell lines or clinical samples with high accuracy and computational efficiency. This allowed us to analyze 60,000 cells from 10 donors in a single experiment. Moreover, we utilized mitoSplitter to identify a specific synthetic lethality of Bromodomain and extraterminal (BET) and <italic toggle="yes">TOP2A</italic> inhibition in the non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell line A549.</p>

      <title>Working Principle of MitoSplitter.</title>
      <p>Compared to other chromosomes, the mitochondrial genome is much shorter, with only 16,569 base pairs, making a greater sequencing depth feasible compared to a different chromosome (<ext-link xlink:href="http://www.pnas.org/lookup/doi/10.1073/pnas.2307722120#supplementary-materials" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:show="new"><italic toggle="yes">SI Appendix</italic>, Fig. S1</ext-link>). The shorter length of the mitochondrial genome significantly reduced the required computational resources. In addition, the number of mitochondria in cells can vary greatly, with some cells containing more than 2,000 mitochondria, resulting in a rich diversity of mitochondrial genome sequences. All of these characteristics make the mitochondrial genome an ideal genotyping material. To estimate whether the mitochondrial genome variants within a population were diverse enough for genotyping, we analyzed published RNA sequencing data from Gene Expression Omnibus with accession number GSE107011 (<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). We found that the average mitochondrial SNP profile diversities between individuals (measured by Spearman correlation) were approximately 1.5 to 1.7 times greater than those found in other chromosomes (<xref rid="fig01" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 <italic toggle="yes">A</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">B</italic></xref>, the average mitochondrial SNP profile variations between individuals were also calculated using the WGS data from the 1000 Genomes Project (Phase 3) (<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>), detailed in <ext-link xlink:href="http://www.pnas.org/lookup/doi/10.1073/pnas.2307722120#supplementary-materials" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:show="new"><italic toggle="yes">SI Appendix</italic>, Fig. S2</ext-link>). Therefore, we hypothesized that it is indeed feasible to use mtRNA variants for genotyping based on bulk RNA-seq data of either mitochondria or whole cells. Furthermore, we contend that it is possible to demultiplex the scRNA-seq data from mixed samples (from different donors) based on mtRNA variants.</p>

SNPs were identified by aligning RNA-seq data to the reference genome for each sample. High-variability mitochondrial SNPs were identified based on variation frequency and dispersions in bulk RNA-seq and used to genotype samples. The mitochondrial genotyping correlation between bulk samples and cells was used to determine the sample label of some single cells. Only cells with high bulk sample correction were labeled. Then, the LPA was employed to give sample labels to unlabeled cells based on single-cell mtRNA SNPs.</p>

      <p>Subsequently, we established an algorithm named mitoSplitter to demonstrate these hypotheses (<xref rid="fig01" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic toggle="yes">C</italic></xref>). Briefly, the mitochondrial SNPs were identified through alignment and analysis of the RNA-seq data (including both bulk and single-cell) to the reference genome for each sample. The highly variable mitochondrial SNPs from the bulk data were selected for mitochondrial genotyping according to the variant’s frequency and dispersions. Once mitochondrial genotyping of samples was confirmed, a label representing which sample the individual cell was derived from was inferred according to correlation throughout bulk samples and cells, which was then included in the metadata of the scRNA-seq dataset. Due to the low and uneven depth of single-cell sequencing, some cells did not receive reads mapped to their selected highly variable sites (mitochondrial genotyping sites) and therefore did not receive labels. To overcome this challenge, a semisupervised machine learning strategy, known as an LPA, was integrated to transfer sample labels among cells according to specific mtRNA SNPs detected in single cells. Finally, the distribution of cells from different samples was visualized through the assignment of different colors to the samples on the t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (tSNE) plots. The source code and documentation for this computational algorithm, mitoSplitter, are available on GitHub (<ext-link xlink:href="https://github.com/lnscan/mitoSplitter" ext-link-type="uri">https://github.com/lnscan/mitoSplitter</ext-link>).</p>

      <title>Validation of MitoSplitter Using Virtually Multiplexed scRNA-seq Data.</title>
      <p>We first tested the reliability and robustness of mitoSplitter using two simulation datasets with different mixing scenarios involving 4 and 3 peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) samples (detailed in <ext-link xlink:href="http://www.pnas.org/lookup/doi/10.1073/pnas.2307722120#supplementary-materials" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:show="new"><italic toggle="yes">SI Appendix</italic>, Tables S1 and S2</ext-link>). The genotypes were obtained from the pooled scRNA-seq data for each donor (the sequencing depth of each donor’s mitochondrial genome is shown in <ext-link xlink:href="http://www.pnas.org/lookup/doi/10.1073/pnas.2307722120#supplementary-materials" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:show="new"><italic toggle="yes">SI Appendix</italic>, Fig. S3 <italic toggle="yes">A</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">B</italic></ext-link>). We compared the accuracy, running time, and required memory of mitoSplitter to four published computational algorithms, including Demuxlet (<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>), Souporcell (<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>), scSplit (<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>), and Vireo (<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) revealed that mitoSplitter demonstrated comparable or even higher accuracy (<ext-link xlink:href="http://www.pnas.org/lookup/doi/10.1073/pnas.2307722120#supplementary-materials" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:show="new"><italic toggle="yes">SI Appendix</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Methods</italic></ext-link>) than other tools for both datasets. However, the computation time and memory requirement of mitoSplitter were much lower than those of other methods (<xref rid="fig02" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2<italic toggle="yes">A</italic></xref>). Moreover, the accuracy of mitoSplitter’s demultiplexing was also validated using a tSNE plot based on mtRNA variants, where the “True” label from the original datasets and the “Predicted” label from mitoSplitter showed strong agreement (<xref rid="fig02" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2<italic toggle="yes">B</italic></xref>, the annotated cell types in the demultiplexed data are shown in <ext-link xlink:href="http://www.pnas.org/lookup/doi/10.1073/pnas.2307722120#supplementary-materials" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:show="new"><italic toggle="yes">SI Appendix</italic>, Fig. S4 <italic toggle="yes">A</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">B</italic></ext-link>).</p>

      <p>We tested mitoSplitter and the other methods using a large, virtually mixed scRNA-seq dataset comprising 60,000 cells from across 10 samples (<ext-link xlink:href="http://www.pnas.org/lookup/doi/10.1073/pnas.2307722120#supplementary-materials" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:show="new"><italic toggle="yes">SI Appendix</italic>, Table S3</ext-link>, the sequencing depth of each donor’s mitochondrial genome is shown in <ext-link xlink:href="http://www.pnas.org/lookup/doi/10.1073/pnas.2307722120#supplementary-materials" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:show="new"><italic toggle="yes">SI Appendix</italic>, Fig. S3<italic toggle="yes">C</italic></ext-link>). MitoSplitter demonstrated decent accuracy within 6 h on a server with ~80 Gigabytes (G) of memory, making it an ideal tool for splitting large datasets. In contrast, scSplit and Vireo indeed failed to analyze this large dataset with maximal memory (600 G) on our server (<xref rid="fig02" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2<italic toggle="yes">C</italic></xref>). The accuracy of mitoSplitter was further demonstrated in mtRNA variant-based tSNE plots (<xref rid="fig02" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2<italic toggle="yes">D</italic></xref><bold>,</bold> the annotated cell types in the demultiplexed data are shown in <ext-link xlink:href="http://www.pnas.org/lookup/doi/10.1073/pnas.2307722120#supplementary-materials" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:show="new"><italic toggle="yes">SI Appendix</italic>, Fig. S4<italic toggle="yes">C</italic></ext-link>). These experiments on simulated datasets suggested that mitoSplitter may demultiplex label-free scRNA-seq data with minimal computational resources.</p>
      <p>To further confirm the performance of mitoSplitter, we also attempted to use other existing algorithms to conduct mixed-sample splitting analysis based on mtRNA variants (detailed in <ext-link xlink:href="http://www.pnas.org/lookup/doi/10.1073/pnas.2307722120#supplementary-materials" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:show="new"><italic toggle="yes">SI Appendix</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Methods</italic></ext-link>). Unfortunately, Demuxlet and Souporcell cannot be employed in this manner for several reasons. For instance, Demuxlet requires diploid genotype information as its input which is absent in the mitochondrial data. Moreover, Souporcell filters out all mitochondrial variants and is unsuitable for this test. Although scSplit and Vireo can use mitochondrial information for mixed-sample splitting, their sample label assignment rates were very low, particularly when applied to large datasets such as dataset 3, with rates of 30.4% and 57.4%, respectively, while mitoSplitter had a label assignment rate of 89.5% (<ext-link xlink:href="http://www.pnas.org/lookup/doi/10.1073/pnas.2307722120#supplementary-materials" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:show="new"><italic toggle="yes">SI Appendix</italic>, Table S4</ext-link>). Additionally, both Vireo and scSplit had lower accuracy than mitoSplitter. Surprisingly, the results of scSplit were significantly better than those generated using genome-wide data, indicating that mitochondrial variants are an important resource for genotyping of scRNA-seq data. This comparative analysis demonstrated that mitoSplitter was a highly sensitive, accurate, and stable algorithm for sample demultiplexing based on an analysis of mtRNA variants.</p>
      <p>As the proportion of intersample doublets may increase substantially when the mixed-sample throughput increases (<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>), mitoSplitter also includes an intersample doublet identification module, which is described in <ext-link xlink:href="http://www.pnas.org/lookup/doi/10.1073/pnas.2307722120#supplementary-materials" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:show="new"><italic toggle="yes">SI Appendix, Methods</italic> and</ext-link>

The average AUC of the doublet recognition results from mitoSplitter was determined to be greater than 0.95 when validated using multiple simulation datasets containing various doublet ratios. Moreover, we evaluated the dependence of mitoSplitter on the proportion of initial labels (as determined by the correlation with the bulk samples) before the LPA step and demonstrated that mitoSplitter could achieve improved accuracy with a low proportion of initial labels (~25%; notably, labeled cells in this step often do not cover all genotyping sites, as detailed in <ext-link xlink:href="http://www.pnas.org/lookup/doi/10.1073/pnas.2307722120#supplementary-materials" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:show="new"><italic toggle="yes">SI Appendix</italic>, Fig. S6</ext-link>), further demonstrating the stability of mitoSplitter (detailed in <ext-link xlink:href="http://www.pnas.org/lookup/doi/10.1073/pnas.2307722120#supplementary-materials" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:show="new"><italic toggle="yes">SI Appendix, Methods</italic> and</ext-link>

      <p>Overall, we demonstrated that mtRNA SNPs can be used as exogenous barcodes for mixed-sample splitting of high-throughput single-cell data. Additionally, we established that mitoSplitter is at least as accurate as existing whole genome SNP-based splitting algorithms while requiring vastly fewer computational resources, making it ideal for large-scale samples.</p>

      <p>We evaluated the reliability and robustness of mitoSplitter using scRNA-seq data and paired mitochondrial bulk RNA-seq data from the PBMC samples. Mitochondrial genotypes were identified from low-depth bulk RNA-seq data of mitochondria (~3.7 G per sample).

      <p>We randomly selected a five-donor pseudo-multiplexed dataset to demonstrate the performance details of the mitoSplitter. The analysis of mitoSplitter on all five donors showed excellent accuracies (<xref rid="fig03" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3<italic toggle="yes">B</italic></xref>).

      <title>scRNA-seq Analysis of NSCLC Using MitoSplitter Identified Synthetic Lethality of a BET Degrader and <italic toggle="yes">TOP2A</italic> Inhibitor.</title>
      <p>NSCLC is a significant cancer type worldwide. Previous research has demonstrated that the inhibition or degradation of BET proteins may impede the proliferation of NSCLC cells (<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). However, it has also been reported multiple times that the sensitivity of NSCLC cells to chemical inhibition or degradation of BET is highly variable (<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr"/>–<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). Consequently, the drugs that can induce the synthetic lethality to overcome the resistance to BET inhibitors are still missing. The potential reasons for the inconsistencies among these studies include the lack of analysis in single-cell resolution as well as the batch effects of different studies. Therefore, we aimed to understand the mechanism for NSCLC’s resistance to BET inhibitors by employing multiplexed scRNA-seq and mitoSplitter.</p>
      <p>First, we observed different effects of chemical degradation of BET through the treatment of ARV-771 (<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>) on the proliferation rate of NSCLC cell lines (<ext-link xlink:href="http://www.pnas.org/lookup/doi/10.1073/pnas.2307722120#supplementary-materials" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:show="new"><italic toggle="yes">SI Appendix</italic>, Fig. S9<italic toggle="yes">A</italic></ext-link>). Interestingly, the A549 cell line exhibited significant resistance to ARV-771, prompting us to investigate the underlying resistance mechanism using mitoSplitter.</p>
      <p>To mitigate batch effects, we performed multiplexed scRNA-seq analysis of five NSCLC cell lines, treated or untreated with ARV-771 for 48 h, in a single experiment. The analysis revealed multiple clusters purely based on expression profiles (<xref rid="fig05" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5<italic toggle="yes">A</italic></xref>). Using bulk RNA-seq data of mitochondria, we assigned the cells to their origins and presented them in the tSNE plots (<xref rid="fig05" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5<italic toggle="yes">B</italic></xref> and <ext-link xlink:href="http://www.pnas.org/lookup/doi/10.1073/pnas.2307722120#supplementary-materials" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:show="new"><italic toggle="yes">SI Appendix</italic>, Table S12</ext-link>). Notably, ARV-771 treatment resulted in a decrease in the proportion of cells, except for A549 cells (<xref rid="fig05" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5<italic toggle="yes">C</italic></xref>).</p>

      <p>We investigated the mechanism of resistance to ARV-771 by performing a computational analysis of the scRNA-seq data from A549 cells. We observed the proliferation of two clusters (subgroups 0 and 2) in the presence of ARV-771 (<xref rid="fig05" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 <italic toggle="yes">D</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">E</italic></xref>) and identified a list of markers for these clusters (subgroup 1 compared to subgroups 0 and 2, <ext-link xlink:href="http://www.pnas.org/lookup/doi/10.1073/pnas.2307722120#supplementary-materials" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:show="new"><italic toggle="yes">SI Appendix</italic>, Table S13</ext-link>).

    <title>Discussion</title>
    <p content-type="flushleft">In the current study, we present a method called mitoSplitter for analyzing scRNA-seq data from multiple samples in a single experiment. This approach uses variants of mtRNA to deconvolute individual samples from pooled scRNA-seq data with reasonable computational time and memory usage. Our application of mitoSplitter to NSCLC revealed a synthetic lethality between <italic toggle="yes">TOP2A</italic> inhibition and BET chemical degradation.</p>
    <p>The high cost of scRNA-seq limits its application in studying complex diseases, which often require analysis of a large number of samples. To increase throughput, one strategy is to multiplex multiple samples in a single experiment (<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). However, existing strategies using endogenous or exogenous barcodes incur significant experimental or computational costs. In contrast, mitoSplitter only requires additional low-depth sequencing of mtRNA of each sample, which dramatically reduces the overall cost of multiplexed scRNA-seq assays. We anticipate that mitoSplitter will be useful for epidemiology and population genetics studies.</p>
    <p>The batch effects among different experiments represent a major technical challenge for scRNA-seq analysis. Despite several efforts from the community (<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr"/>–<xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>), performing multiplexed scRNA-seq analysis in a single experiment is still the ideal method to overcome this issue. The existing methods of demultiplexing scRNA-seq data using either exogenous or endogenous barcodes require extensive experimental or computational efforts. By launching mitoSplitter, we are now able to demultiplex label-free scRNA-seq data with minimal computational expertise. Using mitoSplitter, biologists with limited experimental and computational capability can analyze mixed samples from scRNA-seq assays.</p>
    <p>Before developing mitoSplitter, we were concerned that the lack of amount in SNPs within the mitochondrial genome may hinder the demultiplexing of complicated samples. However, our study validated the robustness of mitoSplitter using various datasets containing 2 to 10 samples. Compared to other methods, mitoSplitter exhibited comparable or even higher accuracy in assigning cells to samples, while requiring less RAM and running time for all tested datasets. We also endeavored to utilize preexisting algorithms for mtRNA variants-based mixed-sample splitting, but they either did not run smoothly or produced inadequate results. In contrast, mitoSplitter was designed from the ground up for analysis and use of mitochondrial variants. Notably, mitoSplitter performed similarly well on scRNA-seq data from both cell lines and primary cells.</p>
    <p>The BET inhibitor or chemical degrader has shown potential as an anticancer agent for a wide range of cancer cells. Therefore, it is crucial to understand the mechanism of resistance to ARV-771 in A549 cells. scRNA-seq is a useful assay for resistance studies since it can identify the features of resistant clones. But due to the batch effects of scRNA-seq assay, it is challenging to analyze the data of resistant and sensitive cells generated from separated experiments. In the current study, the application of mitoSplitter on multiplexed scRNA-seq data revealed a clear clonal evolution event of the resistant A549 cells, when they were mixed with four other sensitive cell lines and treated with BET degrader ARV-771. These results led us to further identify a specific synthetic lethality between BET degraders and <italic toggle="yes">TOP2A</italic> inhibitors. However, the detailed mechanism underlying the emergence of the resistant clone requires further investigation.</p>
    <p>Currently, mitoSplitter is limited by the requirement of mtRNA information in the scRNA-seq data, making it unsuitable for single nucleus RNA-seq (snRNA-seq) analysis. As snRNA-seq is becoming a popular assay for analyzing frozen clinical samples, methods specifically designed for demultiplexing snRNA-seq data will need to be established in the future. Additionally, similar to any genotype-dependent demultiplexing method, mitoSplitter relies on mtRNA to identify the sample, it requires that the pooled samples have high mitochondrial genome diversity (detailed in <ext-link xlink:href="http://www.pnas.org/lookup/doi/10.1073/pnas.2307722120#supplementary-materials" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:show="new"><italic toggle="yes">SI Appendix</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Methods and Fig. S10</italic></ext-link>). Therefore, it is unsuitable for the biological systems whose mtRNA are similar, for example, wild-type mouse models versus transgenic mice of the same genetic background. We also determined that mitoSplitter was occasionally unable to predict sample labels for some cells. This percentage varied across datasets but was typically less than 15% (<ext-link xlink:href="http://www.pnas.org/lookup/doi/10.1073/pnas.2307722120#supplementary-materials" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:show="new"><italic toggle="yes">SI Appendix</italic>, Table S14</ext-link>). Indeed, we found no significant correlation between the “assignability” and the mitochondrial genomic similarities (<ext-link xlink:href="http://www.pnas.org/lookup/doi/10.1073/pnas.2307722120#supplementary-materials" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:show="new"><italic toggle="yes">SI Appendix</italic>, Fig. S11</ext-link>). In contrast, the assignability was highly correlated to the sequencing depth and SNP coverage of the cells themselves. By increasing the sequencing depth, these shortcomings can be mitigated.</p>
    <p>As the throughput of single-cell sequencing increases, the proportion of doublets rises correspondingly, mostly representing intersample doublets (<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). By fitting a mixed normal distribution to the average mutation frequency per mutation site, mitoSplitter can distinguish intersample doublets and singlet cells with high precision and sensitivity. Additionally, mitoSplitter can be seamlessly integrated with doublet identification tools, including scrublet, to avoid the impact of doublets. Last, it is crucial to note that as single-cell sequencing technology continues to develop, methods that permit high-throughput single cells without overloading the cells will become more commonplace. Using a combination of quasi-static hydrodynamic and size-exclusion principles in dual wells, for example, Well-Paired-Seq achieves improved pairing efficiency (~82%), a low doublet rate, and a throughput spanning four orders of magnitude (10<sup>2</sup> to 10<sup>5</sup>) without overloading the cells (<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). In conjunction with these high-performance single-cell sequencing technologies, mitoSplitter promises to facilitate the analysis of pooled samples with minimal doublet exposure.</p>
    <p>In conclusion, we developed the mitoSplitter assay to reliably and efficiently analyze multiple single-cell samples in one scRNA-seq experiment. With mitoSplitter, we have overcome many technical obstacles for biologists to perform scRNA-seq experiments with mixed samples. The availability of mitoSplitter will further accelerate the application of scRNA-seq assay in biomedical research.</p>

      <title>Validation of the Effect of Combined ARV-771 and Etoposide on the Proliferation of A549 Cells.</title>
      <p>Pre-experiments were conducted to determine the dose range of etoposide that could effectively inhibit the proliferation rate of A549 cells. Subsequently, A549 cells were exposed to ARV-771 and etoposide (MedChemExpress, HY-13629) at the following combinations of doses, 0 μM, 0.0625 μM, 0.125 μM, 0.25 μM, 0.5 μM, 1 μM, and 2 μM of ARV-771, and 0 μM, 0.01 μM, 0.1 μM, 0.2 μM, 0.4 μM, 0.8 μM, and 1 μM of etoposide. This experiment included a total of 48 independently treated cell populations, including vehicle controls, and each combination had six replicates. Cell viability was measured using the CCK-8 assay, and the combination of 0.5 μM ARV-771 and 0.2 μM etoposide was selected for statistical analysis with controls.</p>

For datasets 4 to 6 and NSCLC cell lines datasets, mitochondrial bulk RNA-seq was generated using a modified Smart-Seq2 protocol (<xref rid="r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="r32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>), and scRNA-seq data were generated using Well-paired-seq (<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>) platform.

      <title>Generation of Single-Cell and Bulk Mitochondrial Mutation Matrices.</title>
      <p>To generate single-cell and bulk mtRNA variants matrices, three steps were undertaken: sequence alignment, remapping, and variant calling. The scRNA-seq data were aligned to the GRCh38 genome using CellRanger v3.1.0 (for 10× Genomic RNA-seq data) or zUMIs v2.9.7e (<xref rid="r33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>) (for Well-Paired-Seq data), during the sequence alignment process, and the bulk mitochondria RNA-seq data were quality-filtered using cutadapt v1.18 (<xref rid="r34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>) and aligned to the mitochondrial sequence in the GRCh38 genome using STAR v2.7.3a (<xref rid="r35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). To improve the quality of alignment and reduce the false positive rate of variant calling, the obtained bam files were remapped to the reference genome using minimap2 v2.24 (<xref rid="r36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>) with parameters: -ax splice -t 8 -G50k -k 21 -w 11 --sr -A2 -B8 -O12,32 -E2,1 -r200 -p.5 -N20 -f1000,5000 -n2 -m20 -s40 -g2000 -2K50m --secondary=no. The variant calling was performed using a Python mtRNA genotyping pipeline (<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). In detail, reads in the remapping single-cell bam file with base quality or alignment quality lower than 20 were filtered, and the allele frequency of each cell was then extracted. For the bulk mitochondria RNA-seq bam file, the threshold value of base quality and alignment quality was set to 10. Finally, all the mutations from all samples or cells were integrated to create a bulk or single-cell mutation matrix.</p>

      <title>Demultiplexing of Mixed Sequencing Data Using MitoSplitter.</title>
      <p>We used scanpy v1.9.1 (<xref rid="r37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>) to select high-variable SNPs across bulk samples from a mitochondrial mutation matrix for mitochondrial genotyping. These mitochondrial sites were more donor-specific, so we calculated the correlation between single cells and each bulk sample based on the variants frequency of these sites to evaluate the probability of cells from each donor. A single cell was considered to be from the same donor as the bulk sample whose bulk sample exhibited the highest correlation unless it lacked a positively correlated bulk sample. Cells that lacked mitochondrial genotyping sites were unable to receive donor labels through this pipeline due to the uneven coverage of scRNA-seq data. To infer the donor origin of each unbiased cell, we predicted it based on the mtRNA SNPs in scRNA-seq and the inferred labels. We defined this task as a semisupervised learning problem and used LPA to propagate labels through cells using mtRNA SNPs in scRNA-seq.</p>
      <p>In detail, we classified (X, Y) into labeled data as (x<sub>1</sub>, y<sub>1</sub>) … (x<sub>l</sub>, y<sub>l</sub>) and unlabeled data as (x<sub>l+1</sub>, y<sub>l+1</sub>) … (x<sub>l+u</sub>, y<sub>l+u</sub>), depending on whether the sample source labels were obtained. X was the matrix of mtRNA SNPs, and Y was the matrix of cell sample source label, <bold>Y<sub>L</sub></bold> = {y<sub>1</sub>, … y<sub>l</sub>} consisted of inferred labels, and <bold>Y<sub>U</sub></bold> = {y<sub>l+1</sub> … y<sub>l+u</sub>} was undetermined. The task was to estimate <bold>Y<sub>U</sub></bold> from <bold>X</bold> and <bold>Y<sub>L</sub></bold>. LPA created a fully connected graph according to the similarity matrix constructed from <bold>X</bold>, where the nodes represented all cells. The edges between nodes were weighted by calculating the normalized graph Laplacian matrix. Then, labeled nodes acted as sources to spread labels <bold>Y<sub>L</sub></bold> among cells through the edges. Larger edge weights meant easier label propagation. Finally, unlabeled cells received persistent sample labels <bold>Y<sub>U</sub></bold> when the network of the graph reached a globally stable state. We set the clamping factor α = 0.8, which helped the algorithm keep 80% of input labels and change the confidence of labels within 20% during propagation. This optimization was based on inferred labels from unlabeled data. Based on the LPA model, we calculated the probability of each unlabeled cell belonging to each donor. The final cell sample label was determined by the LPA result with a probability greater than (1 to 10<sup>–10</sup>).</p>

      <p>To simulate multiplexed scRNA-seq data, we utilized a combination of multiple single-cell sequencing datasets. Singlets of each dataset were predicted by scrublet v0.2.3 (<xref rid="r38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>) and their corresponding reads were mixed as simulated multiplexed scRNA-seq data. The bulk mtRNA mutation matrix was produced by combining the reads of all singlets within a sample.
