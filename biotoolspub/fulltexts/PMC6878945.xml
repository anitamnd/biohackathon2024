      <title>Abstract</title>
      <p>Sickle cell disease (SCD) is one of the most common monogenic diseases in humans with multiple phenotypic expressions that can manifest as both acute and chronic complications. Although described more than a century ago, challenges in comprehensive disease management and collaborative research on this disease are compounded by the complex molecular and clinical phenotypes of SCD, environmental and psychosocial factors, limited therapeutic options and ambiguous terminology. This ambiguous terminology has hampered the integration and interoperability of existing SCD knowledge, and SCD research translation. The SCD Ontology (SCDO), which is a community-driven integrative and universal knowledge representation system for SCD, overcomes this issue by providing a controlled vocabulary developed by a group of experts in both SCD and ontology design. SCDO is the first and most comprehensive standardized human- and machine-readable resource that unambiguously represents terminology and concepts about SCD for researchers, patients and clinicians. It is built around the central concept ‘hemoglobinopathy’, allowing inclusion of non-SCD haemoglobinopathies, such as thalassaemias, which may interfere with or influence SCD phenotypic manifestations. This collaboratively developed ontology constitutes a comprehensive knowledge management system and standardized terminology of various SCD-related factors. The SCDO will promote interoperability of different research datasets, facilitate seamless data sharing and collaborations, including meta-analyses within the SCD community, and support the development and curation of data-basing and clinical informatics in SCD.</p>

    <title>Introduction</title>
    <p>Haemoglobinopathies in general are the most common monogenic diseases of human, with sickle cell disease (SCD) the most common recessive condition (<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>), having variable incidence and prevalence across countries (<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). SCD is mainly caused by a single-point mutation yielding a single amino acid substitution in the beta-subunit of haemoglobin, the principal oxygen transporter in red blood cells (<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Because of the protective effect of the sickle cell mutation against malaria, SCD has the highest incidence and prevalence in tropical regions, particularly in Sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries, where more than 70% of SCD patients live (<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>), affecting ~300 000 newborn babies every year (<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). SCD affects more than 20 million people globally (<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>), with associated healthcare cost exceeding a billion US dollars annually (<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). While it was previously thought that the SCD mutation arose independently in different regions, recent evidence has suggested a single origin of the sickle cell allele over 7000 years ago (<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). The widespread increase in population migration patterns has changed the distribution of SCD frequencies in different countries, making it a global health concern (<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). SCD is a chronic disease of variable phenotypes, associated with increased morbidity and mortality, and with limited effective drugs to address the clinical manifestations (<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>); this is particularly true in the developing world, posing a substantial burden to the healthcare system of affected countries (<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Fortunately, over the past decade, there have been numerous promising clinical trials that address all aspects of potential therapy based on sickle cell pathophysiology: from haemoglobin sickling (<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>), to endothelial dysfunction (<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>), to oxidative stress (<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>), to transplant (<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>) and to gene therapy (<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>).</p>
    <p>In the last decades, SCD researchers have utilized large datasets and biomedical knowledge discovery to develop a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms of the disease (<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). However, a model that can incorporate results from basic biological research into clinical decision-making processes is still needed (<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). Most scientific knowledge is still held in natural language text that is generally unstructured, ambiguous and subjective. With the constant evolution and growing complexity of biomedical knowledge (<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>), a system is needed for standardized and well-defined knowledge representation. This standard knowledge representation system should enable efficient and reliable exchange of information and integration of new knowledge by (i) more concisely defining SCD concepts, (ii) ensuring common understanding amongst scientists and clinicians and (iii) fostering more efficient data integration and interoperability with other existing systems.</p>
    <p>Ontologies are commonly used in biomedical research to represent knowledge in a given domain, in a structured and computable format (<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). An ontology defines a formal/standardized common vocabulary and relations that exist in a domain and provides an unambiguous means of communication amongst humans and between humans and computers (<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). Several biomedical ontologies exist that have captured knowledge that cover some aspects of SCD, such as the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO), which describes abnormal phenotypes encountered in human diseases (<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>), and the Human Disease Ontology (DO), which describes various disease domains (<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). However, these ontologies do not capture all the elements that are specific to SCD, including more granular phenotypes and therapeutics that are specific to this disease state. This indicates that no ontology presently exists that can serve as a definitive and comprehensive source of SCD knowledge.</p>
    <p>We have constructed an SCD ontology (SCDO), an integrative and universal knowledge representation system for SCD that was collaboratively developed by domain experts, including clinicians, basic scientists, bioinformaticians and data scientists. The SCDO provides a consistent vocabulary that describes key concepts and properties that establish hierarchical relationships between concepts and axioms (evidence or truths). These data are collated into a human- and machine-readable format in order to help process, reuse and reapply knowledge in biomedical research and in healthcare systems. SCDO is built around the key component, haemoglobinopathy, by linking it to phenotypes, modes of inheritance, therapeutics, diagnostics, diseases and other environmental and behavioural information for patients (personal attributes, quality of life and care). The comprehensiveness in content and structure of the SCDO makes it a model for other disease-specific ontologies.</p>

      <title>Ontology development process</title>
      <p>The development of the SCDO was a collaborative and interactive process that included three workshops with subject matter experts from diverse backgrounds, including SCD and ontology experts, geneticists, adult and paediatric clinicians, specialists in organ systems involved in SCD, bioinformaticians and social and data scientists. At each of the annual workshops organized over 3 years, participants were split into five groups according to their expertise (phenotype, diagnostics, therapeutics, quality of life and care, disease modifiers) and each group contained 8 to 12 contributors. In between each workshop, follow-up sessions were organized in subgroups, either online or face-to-face, to continue reviewing the SCDO following steps shown in <xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>. The work produced at each workshop was submitted to specific curation and ontology teams for further curation.</p>

    <sec id="sec4">
      <title>First workshop activity and outcome</title>
      <p>The aim of the first workshop was to (i) develop competency questions that could be addressed by the SCDO and (ii) extract the initial concepts to be included in the SCDO. The initial set of SCDO concepts was retrieved from existing ontologies and knowledge resources, including the HPO, the DO and the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) database (<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>), as well as Genotype Ontology (GENO) at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/ontologies/geno">https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/ontologies/geno</ext-link>. The second set of concepts was manually extracted by SCDO curators from existing SCD guidelines and standards of care (Ghana, Nigeria, Tanzania, Jamaica, UK, Europe, Canada and USA Sickle Cell Disease Management Guidelines), as well as from literature. Different SCDO classes were merged in a spreadsheet and reviewed in two successive steps by a review team consisting of curators and SCD domain experts, including researchers and clinicians. In addition, an ontology team, which consisted of members from the European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI), Oregon State University and the SCDO team, ensured that best practices, such as OBO Foundry principles, were followed and the OWL file was produced and uploaded to BioPortal. The dynamic and iterative ontology development process is shown in <xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>. As an outcome of this workshop, an initial list of concepts was created and further reviewed and refined by the curation team to further refine the data (<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>).</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec5">
      <title>Second workshop activity and outcome</title>
      <p>After the curation team reviewed, cleaned up and fleshed out the original list of concepts to be included in the SCDO, a second workshop was convened, during which attendees reviewed the current version of the SCDO and further refined the classes and definitions. Annotation and object properties were also reviewed, and additional relationships between classes were made using the list of approved object properties. This process led to the identification of new classes that needed to be included in the ontology, probably the most notable being the ‘SCD Genotype’ and ‘SCD Causal Mutation’ classes. Discussions around the structuring of the haemoglobinopathy class and naming of haemoglobinopathies and SCD genotypes highlighted subtle differences between concepts and how ambiguous and even misleading some of the names are, thus underscoring the difficulty and importance of the SCDO’s endeavour to define these concepts.</p>

    </sec>
    <sec id="sec6">
      <title>Third workshop activity and outcome</title>
      <p>The third workshop was convened to conduct final edits on the ontology terms, with different working groups tackling the various classes. Each group had a curator who edited the terms as they were discussed. The groups were tasked with accepting the term label and text definition. Appropriate modifications were made based on the review. Some terms and relationships were added to the existing ontology; others were reclassified upon review. These classes included ‘Research’ (which includes ‘Ethnolinguistics’ as a subclass), ‘Mode of Inheritance’, ‘Association’, ‘Disease’ and ‘Gene’. Discussions after the workshop led to the ‘Gene’ class being replaced by ‘Genetic Phenomena’ and ‘Gene Product’ and to the inclusion of the upper level ‘Guidelines’ class.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec7">
      <title>Refinement and evolution of the ontology</title>
      <p>An ontology is always dynamic and evolving as new domain knowledge discovered is added. This results in changes within an ontology, depending on the nature of transformations applied to ontology objects. These transformations may consist of updating or removing an old object or adding a novel object, leading to ontology extension, refinement and enrichment (<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). The SCDO has undergone significant enrichment, in which the central concept ‘hemoglobinopathy’, which includes SCD, has been linked to phenotypes, diagnostics, therapeutics, disease modifiers, modes of inheritance, SCD-related diseases, genetic phenomena and gene product, as well as other environmental data (personal attribute, quality of life and care for patients and research), as described in <xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>. Properties and axioms were built mostly around this central concept in connection to other SCDO concepts, as illustrated in <xref rid="f3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>.</p>
    </sec>
  </sec>
  <sec id="sec8">
    <title>Results</title>
    <p>The SCDO describes the ‘hemoglobinopathy’ class as a key aspect linking the various classes through SCDO axioms and properties as illustrated in <xref rid="f3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>. This has enabled the incorporation of other haemoglobinopathies, which are related to SCD, to be included into the SCDO. These include, but are not limited to, thalassaemias and other haemoglobinopathies, which may interact or even interfere with the phenotypic manifestation of SCD.</p>
    <sec id="sec9">
      <title>Current states of specific SCDO classes</title>
      <p>The current SCDO has 1477 well-described terms of which 300 are terms specific to SCD and not defined previously in existing ontologies, and 1177 were retrieved terms from other ontologies (see online supplementary material for <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S1</xref>). These terms are categorized based on the upper-level classes shown in <xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref> above, with the number of subclasses in each upper-level class shown in <xref rid="f4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>. They are topologically linked by 1676 associations.</p>

      <p>It is worth mentioning a few notable changes to some terms suggested by SCD experts. For example, the term ‘beta plus thalassemia’ has been replaced with ‘beta minus thalassemia’ based on the description of the concept ‘beta-zero’ (See Supplementary File Section 1 for more details). <xref rid="TB1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> provides some new terms unique to the SCDO in the phenotype class for illustration, highlighting the SCDO contribution to advancing existing knowledge and expanding scientific content in this field.</p>

      <title>Evaluation of the ontology</title>
      <p>Generally, data-driven quality evaluation of a given knowledge-based system, such as an ontology, is based on its performance in associated applications, for which there is a need for an independent specification against which the ontology should be assessed. However, since SCDO is only in its infancy, instead, we used rules and questions sketched by SCD experts, referred to as competency questions, to check whether the ontology addresses its scope by ensuring that it contains appropriate information to satisfy these rules or answer these questions.</p>
      <p>Competency questions (see Supplementary File Section 4) were related to SCD signs, symptoms and complications, focusing specifically on pain, skin, chest infection, stroke and kidney disease to explore potential connections for knowledge discovery. To enable SCDO to answer these questions and its structure to contain different rules and constraints, we have modelled SCDO in such a way that it contains concepts specific to SCD (see <xref rid="TB1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), appropriate relations and properties or axioms as shown in <xref rid="f5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref> and illustrated in the SCDO schema (<xref rid="f3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). We expect that SCDO can serve as a template for knowledge acquisition and reuse and is applicable to future SCD research applications, specifying a standardized common vocabulary verified by SCD experts from diverse specialized backgrounds.</p>

    <title>Discussion</title>
    <p>SCDO is the first and most comprehensive standardized human- and machine-readable resource that unambiguously represents terminology and concepts about SCD and other haemoglobinopathies for researchers, patients and clinicians. The SCDO was derived through an exhaustive, iterative and collaborative process drawing on expertise of individuals across multiple disciplines worldwide. Prior to its development, existing ontologies included items relevant to SCD, but none of these ontologies fully encompassed all elements of this uniquely complex and frequent genetic disease. The utilization of the SCDO can have far-reaching outcomes in areas where the burden of disease is greatest, narrowing the gap of evidence-based SCD care management.</p>
    <sec id="sec14">
      <title>SCDO and other disease ontologies</title>
      <p>Disease ontologies provide coverage of disease and disorder domains and help in disease annotations in different biomedical applications, supporting clinical and research applications, including clinical data aggregation of electronic health records, clinical decision processes and literature-based mining. In most cases, existing disease-related ontologies (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.obofoundry.org/">http://www.obofoundry.org/</ext-link>) attempt to describe global disease domains and abnormal phenotypes encountered in disease conditions, including the DO (<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>), the HPO (<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>), the Mouse Pathology Ontology (MPATH—<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.pathbase.net/">http://www.pathbase.net/</ext-link>), the Mammalian Phenotype Ontology (MPO—<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://obofoundry.org/ontology/mp.html">http://obofoundry.org/ontology/mp.html</ext-link>) (<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>) and Phenotype And Trait Ontology (PATO—<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://obofoundry.org/ontology/pato">http://obofoundry.org/ontology/pato</ext-link>). As pointed out previously, these ontologies do not capture concepts specific or unique to SCD. The SCDO team is submitting terms and properties for inclusion in existing ontologies including the HPO, the OBO Relations Ontology (RO) (<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>) and the Data Usage Ontology (DUO) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ontobee.org/ontology/DUO">http://www.ontobee.org/ontology/DUO</ext-link>).
</p>
      <p>There are specialized and disease-specific ontology projects, such as the Infectious Disease Ontology (IDO—<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.infectiousdiseaseontology.org/">http://www.infectiousdiseaseontology.org/</ext-link>), which aims at providing a set of interoperable ontologies that should cover entities related to specific pathogens and diseases, including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), dengue fever, influenza, malaria and tuberculosis. Another hematology-related ontology project is the Blood ontology (BLO—<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://mba.eci.ufmg.br/BLO/">http://mba.eci.ufmg.br/BLO/</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://bioportal.bioontology.org/projects/Blood_Ontology">http://bioportal.bioontology.org/projects/Blood_Ontology</ext-link>), integrating different existing blood terminologies. More recently, an ontology of Type 2 diabetes (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://purl.bioontology.org/ontology/DIAB">http://purl.bioontology.org/ontology/DIAB</ext-link>), DIAB, has been developed around Phenotype (<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>) as have other existing disease-specific ontologies. However, there is neither deterministic nor systematic mapping between phenotype (manifestation) and disease (condition), except for some specific ‘pathognomonic’ manifestations. Thus, for consistency, SCDO is built around the ‘hemoglobinopathy’ concept, which is then linked to other disease-related aspects, such as diagnostics, therapeutics and phenotypes, as well as several other aspects pertinent to SCD research, patient outcomes and care, including Personal Attribute with Ethnolinguistic groups, Quality of Life and Care, Guidelines and Disease Modifier, which may orient phenotypic manifestations and inform clinical management. This suggests that the SCDO development approach may constitute a model that can drive implementation of other disease-specific ontologies.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec15">
      <title>Challenges encountered in the development</title>
      <p>The main aim is to provide an ontology that will conceptualize SCD disease management and research domains and be effectively applicable across a range of biomedical applications (<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). Designing such an ontology is a tedious and daunting process, requiring expertise from varying specialized backgrounds, including geneticists, adult and paediatric clinicians, specialists in organ systems involved in SCD, biologists, philosophers, anthropologists, ontologists and data scientists. These experts should share a common understanding of existing SCD knowledge, make domain assumptions explicit, discuss the scope of the model through competency questions and define SCD concepts, relations and other axioms to be included (<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). However, it was not always easy to converge to a single conceptualization of a domain, and this process was particularly time-consuming as each expert conceptualizes the domain depending on how he/she came to understand it, which is often related to particular experiences.</p>
      <p>It is known that an ontology is never complete and always dynamic, and we expect the SCDO to continue to evolve for many years considering the context in which it has been developed. Currently, the SickleInAfrica consortium (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.sickleinafrica.org/">https://www.sickleinafrica.org</ext-link>), which includes the Sickle Pan-African Research Consortium (SPARCo), Sickle Africa Data Coordinating Center (SADaCC) and Sickle Pan African Network (SPAN), intends to collaboratively collect large-scale SCD patient datasets, using the SCDO to harmonize these datasets and facilitate data integration, information retrieval and analysis. SCDO should be able to handle the challenges of a potential exponential growth of SCD datasets by keeping SCD knowledge updated, possibly on a daily basis, revealing gaps in the existing knowledge and identifying new hypotheses and research questions. To achieve this, some of the processes involved in ontology update and evolution need to be automated to minimize time and resources invested by curators.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec16">
      <title>Limitations</title>
      <p>Despite the successful international collaborative effort to develop this SCDO, there were some notable limitations. The absence of experts from South Asia (i.e. India) leaves a void of characteristics that might be specific to that region, which has one of the highest prevalence rates of SCD in the world (11). Furthermore, the SCDO in its current iteration is available only in the English language, limiting its applicability to regions where the majority of individuals are non-English speakers. While constructing SCDO has been a successful effort, it has yet to be applied; hence, the full strength of its utility is unknown. Some efforts are in progress to mitigate these limitations.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec17">
      <title>Future directions</title>
      <p>Future efforts include translation of the ontology into French and Portuguese, to make it more accessible to native French and Portuguese speakers in Africa and beyond. In addition, we aim to create a lay person version of the SCDO to make terms accessible to non-medical experts, as has been previously done with the HPO (<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). Offering an SCDO layperson-friendly version enables the use of SCDO in patient data collection forms, allowing patients to perform standardized self-phenotyping.</p>
      <p>To enable semantic interoperability with other ontologies, future efforts will be made to add logical definitions or equivalence axioms that utilize other OBO Foundry ontologies (<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). This will allow for machine readable definitions and allow automated reasoning and inferencing. Moreover, the annotations of SCDO terms will continue to be enriched in numerous ways to ensure a high coverage of existing and future SCD knowledge. An example would be to include terms for measurement units into the ontology and to link diagnostic measurements to their relevant units and information about the measurement normal ranges, amongst many other aspects that will enrich SCDO terms.</p>
      <p>An SCDO application is already under way. Using the SCDO design, an SCD-based case report form (SCD-CRF) has been developed. The SCD-CRF provides a standardized tool that can be utilized and adapted as needed in multi-national cohort studies. Because it is linked to and derived from the SCDO, studies utilizing the SCD-CRF will capture data more uniformly in comparison to prior studies for which tools were created <italic>ad hoc</italic> for a single study. Currently, research in rare disease has been hampered by a lack of standardization across studies with individual research groups employing definitions for exposures, measures and outcomes that may differ substantially. Developing a knowledge base and data capture tools for a specific disease will impose greater rigor on these cohort studies as well as better inter-study comparability if standardized, agreed-upon definitions are used. The process herein described for the SCDO offers a model approach for the construction of other genetic disease-specific ontologies.</p>

  <sec id="sec18">
    <title>Conclusion</title>
    <p>The SCDO was created via a collaborative and iterative process, and this first SCDO release provides a comprehensive description of clinically relevant aspects of SCD, standardizing common SCD vocabulary. This will facilitate seamless data sharing and collaborations including meta-analysis within the SCD community and support the development and curation of data-basing and clinical informatics in SCD. The ontology will continue to be developed by the SCD community using best practices and guidelines. We hope that the SCDO will prove to be a valuable resource for researchers, clinicians, patients and anyone affected by SCD and facilitate the global unification of SCD knowledge. Currently, the SCDO represents the most comprehensive compendium in the SCD field to our knowledge. We anticipate that the SCDO will drive the expansion of scientific content in this field and enhance information structuring, searching and retrieval and can lead to new hypotheses and discoveries.</p>
