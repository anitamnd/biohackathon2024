        <title>Summary</title>
        <p>The increasing prevalence and importance of machine learning in biological research have created a need for machine learning training resources tailored towards biological researchers. However, existing resources are often inaccessible, infeasible or inappropriate for biologists because they require significant computational and mathematical knowledge, demand an unrealistic time-investment or teach skills primarily for computational researchers. We created the Machine Learning for Biologists (ML4Bio) workshop, a short, intensive workshop that empowers biological researchers to comprehend machine learning applications and pursue machine learning collaborations in their own research. The ML4Bio workshop focuses on classification and was designed around three principles: (i) emphasizing preparedness over fluency or expertise, (ii) necessitating minimal coding and mathematical background and (iii) requiring low time investment. It incorporates active learning methods and custom open-source software that allows participants to explore machine learning workflows. After multiple sessions to improve workshop design, we performed a study on three workshop sessions. Despite some confusion around identifying subtle methodological flaws in machine learning workflows, participants generally reported that the workshop met their goals, provided them with valuable skills and knowledge and greatly increased their beliefs that they could engage in research that uses machine learning. ML4Bio is an educational tool for biological researchers, and its creation and evaluation provide valuable insight into tailoring educational resources for active researchers in different domains.</p>

    <title>1 Introduction</title>
    <p>Machine learning (ML) is a powerful tool for analyzing biological data and is increasingly popular in biological research. Biological publications using ML have increased exponentially over the past decades (<xref rid="btac233-B36" ref-type="bibr">Walsh <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2021</xref>). In 2017, almost 90% of 704 NSF principal investigators reported that they âare currently or will soon be analyzing large datasetsâ (<xref rid="btac233-B4" ref-type="bibr">Barone <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>). However, the most commonly reported unmet needs were training based. As of 2017, only about a quarter of life-sciences training programs taught necessary skills for data stewardship (<xref rid="btac233-B7" ref-type="bibr">Brazas <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>). In the USA, the National Science Foundation and National Institutes of Health have recognized the need for training at the intersection of ML and biology (<xref rid="btac233-B27" ref-type="bibr">National Institutes of Health, 2021</xref>; <xref rid="btac233-B28" ref-type="bibr">National Science Foundation, 2020</xref>). The breadth of this gap means that biologists often lack the computational skills that are prerequisites for existing ML educational resources (<xref rid="btac233-B14" ref-type="bibr">Dinsdale <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>). This gap can lead to missed insights from biological data (<xref rid="btac233-B11" ref-type="bibr">Chang, 2015</xref>) and contributes to the improper use of ML in biology (<xref rid="btac233-B20" ref-type="bibr">Jones, 2019</xref>; <xref rid="btac233-B36" ref-type="bibr">Walsh <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2021</xref>).</p>
    <p>Many resources have been created to help researchers acquire skills in ML. Comprehensive resources such as textbooks (<xref rid="btac233-B25" ref-type="bibr">Mitchell, 1997</xref>; <xref rid="btac233-B31" ref-type="bibr">Raschka <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2022</xref>) and online courses require significant time investment, which may not be feasible for active researchers, and teach to a depth that is often unneeded for biological researchers. Other resources such as graphical research and education tools (<xref rid="btac233-B13" ref-type="bibr">DemÅ¡ar <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="btac233-B16" ref-type="bibr">Elia <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2021</xref>; <xref rid="btac233-B32" ref-type="bibr">Roushangar and Mias, 2018</xref>), workshops (<xref rid="btac233-B34" ref-type="bibr">Teal <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>) and written guides and reviews (<xref rid="btac233-B18" ref-type="bibr">Greener <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2022</xref>; <xref rid="btac233-B23" ref-type="bibr">Liu <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2019</xref>; <xref rid="btac233-B35" ref-type="bibr">Vercio <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2020</xref>), still often focus on coding, mathematics or running ML. Although these resources are important, not all biological researchers will necessarily need to code and run ML experiments independently (<xref rid="btac233-B26" ref-type="bibr">Mulder <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2018</xref>).</p>
    <p>Thus, resources are needed that provide researchers with skills to productively navigate partnerships and collaborations around ML without necessarily directly executing ML research themselves. When designing these resources, it is essential to consider what skills are needed to interpret research that involves ML, communicate with collaborators about ML and identify biological questions ML can solve. Resources centered around coding, the mathematical underpinnings of ML or practical advice for using a certain technique do not necessarily fulfill this role.</p>
    <p>We created the Machine Learning for Biologists (ML4Bio) workshop to introduce ML to biological researchers. The workshop aims to provide the skills biologists need to be active researchers in a landscape where ML is increasingly prevalent. It focuses on practical research skills such as reading academic papers that use ML and drawing conclusions from ML experiments. We designed the ML4Bio workshop to be approachable and a reasonable time investment; it requires minimal mathematical and computational background and runs for 5âh over 2âdays. A key feature of the ML4Bio workshop is custom software based on the scikit-learn (<xref rid="btac233-B29" ref-type="bibr">Pedregosa <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>) library, which allows participants to explore and experiment with classification through a graphical interface without computational fluency.</p>
    <p>We used an iterative design process to refine the workshop over a series of five sessions from 2018 to 2021. The first four sessions were conducted in person, and the fifth was conducted online over Zoom. These iterations gave us insight into how to better align the workshop to our overall goals and address the needs of the workshopâs audience. We then evaluated the effectiveness of the workshop over three additional sessions in 2021.</p>
    <p>Participants were generally able to achieve the learning goals of the ML4Bio workshop and especially reported an increase in self-reported beliefs that they can engage with ML research. We feel that this success hinges on the workshopâs approachability, careful design and flexibility. The ML4Bio workshop effectively introduces ML to biological researchers, preparing them for future learning, collaboration and comprehension of ML experiments in biological domains.</p>

    <sec>
      <title>2.1 Learning goals</title>
      <p>The ML4Bio workshop began with the intention to create a short, intensive workshop that empowers biological researchers to operate in fields where ML is increasingly common and identify where they might pursue ML collaborations in their own research. Rather than tackling the entire field of ML, we chose to focus on classification to limit the scope of the workshop to 1â2âdays. The original topics we selected for the workshop involved identifying problems in computational biology, understanding all parts of a typical ML workflow, being able to compare specific classifiers, performing model selection, evaluating a model on new data and judging the use of ML in biological contexts. These topics were defined based on our professional experiences interacting with biological researchers around ML and through our observations of common challenges in published biological papers that use ML.</p>
      <p>Early iterations of the workshop using those topics revealed (i) a mismatch between the selected topics and the coding and mathematical background that is typical of our biological researcher audience and (ii) an incorrect scope of the selected topics (too large). To remedy these problems, we employed backward design (<xref rid="btac233-B39" ref-type="bibr">Wiggins and McTighe, 1998</xref>) to construct realistic learning goals, create assessments for those goals and develop activities to support participants in achieving those goals. In that process, we focused on preparedness for ML research instead of fully equipping participants to perform ML research independently. The result was the following four learning goals whose justification and purpose we discuss in detail below. ML4Bio workshop participants should be able to:
</p>
      <list list-type="order">
        <list-item>
          <p>Identify ML applications and differentiate aspects of a ML workflow.</p>
        </list-item>
        <list-item>
          <p>Examine a ML problem for common factors that influence model selection and problem difficulty.</p>
        </list-item>
        <list-item>
          <p>Discover major methodological flaws in a ML experiment presented in an academic paper.</p>
        </list-item>
        <list-item>
          <p>Demonstrate the belief that they can engage with research that uses ML in biology.</p>
        </list-item>
      </list>
      <p>Learning goal 1: Characterizing common steps of ML workflowsâdata pre-processing, training and model selection and testing and evaluationâgives participants a basis for understanding how ML works and provides a framework for dissecting and understanding unfamiliar ML concepts in the future. Thus, we consider characterizing a ML workflow as an important objective for preparing participants. Additionally, while familiarity with ML terminology is important for research comprehension and communication with collaborators, participants do not need to deeply know all ML terminology by the end of the workshop. As long as participants can generally identify parts of ML and a ML workflow, they are prepared to learn the terminology that is used by their collaborators and is most relevant to their research.</p>
      <p>Learning goal 2: Specific classifiers are another area of ML that required careful consideration. We originally chose a number of classifiers that we felt were a good introduction to the types of classifiers available and their limitations. General knowledge of what classifiers can and cannot do, and facets of problems such as linear separability that affect model selection, are required to evaluate problem difficulty, but detailed knowledge of specific classifiers is not. Ultimately, we felt that while the classifiers we had chosen do help demonstrate classifiersâ range and limits, participantsâ general understanding of the factors that influence model selection will help them irrespective of which classifiers are popular in problems they are interested in.</p>
      <p>Learning goal 3: ML in biological applications often lacks proper validation or experimental design, especially when those who use it lack a technical background (<xref rid="btac233-B22" ref-type="bibr">Littmann <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2020</xref>; <xref rid="btac233-B38" ref-type="bibr">Whalen <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2022</xref>). Thus, we consider the ability to find major flaws in a ML experiment, as presented in a research paper, an important part of preparing participants. Since we focus on assessing instead of performing experiments, we teach the types of evidence presented in a paper that indicate overfitting, data leakage or improper evaluation metrics. However, subtle errors in a ML workflow, such as indirect data leakage, are difficult to find. Researchers whose primary field is ML often miss indirect data leakage, and consistently detecting data leakage is considered an open challenge in ML (<xref rid="btac233-B2" ref-type="bibr">Ashmore <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2021</xref>; <xref rid="btac233-B38" ref-type="bibr">Whalen <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2022</xref>). Therefore, while participants learn the process of assessing a ML workflow, expecting them to be able to consistently find all subtle methodological errors is likely unrealistic.</p>
      <p>Learning goal 4: Finally, a major focus of the workshop is the affective objective of demonstrating a belief that they can engage in research that uses ML. Affective learning outcomes are those that, as opposed to skills or knowledge, relate to individual dispositions, willingness, preferences and enjoyment (<xref rid="btac233-B9" ref-type="bibr">Buissink-Smith <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="btac233-B30" ref-type="bibr">Pierre and Oughton, 2007</xref>). Given that the overarching purpose of the workshop is for biologists to consider pursuing ML as a possible way to solve a problem, including this affective goal is critical to assessing our success. Specifically, while we do not expect them to feel like confident experts, we want participants to believe they can pursue collaborations with ML experts when they identify a problem well-suited to ML.</p>
      <p>The resulting ML4Bio workshop that addresses these four learning goals is an online five-h workshop divided evenly between twoâdays. Data from the initial workshops, coupled with our analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of existing ML resources, led us to follow three key design principles (<xref rid="btac233-B8" ref-type="bibr">Brown and Campione, 1996</xref>) for our workshop. Specifically, we were committed to our workshop (i) focusing on preparedness over fluency or expertise, (ii) necessitating minimal coding and mathematical background and (iii) requiring low time investment. The workshop format is a mixture of software activities, active learning (<xref rid="btac233-B17" ref-type="bibr">Freeman <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>) activities and lectures. Participants use their personal computers to follow along with the online workshop materials and run the ml4bio software. The workshop introduces supervised ML workflows, evaluation metrics, a few common classifiers, and how ML experiments are presented in biological literature. <xref rid="btac233-F1" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 1</xref> shows the various workshop activities and how they relate to the four learning goals. Below, we explore threeâkey features of the workshop design (software, active learning and drawing on prior knowledge) that support participants in achieving the learning goals.</p>

      <title>2.2 Software design</title>
      <p>The firstâand perhaps most fundamentalâlearning goal of the workshop involves understanding a ML workflow. In fact, without understanding that workflow, participants cannot successfully achieve the other objectives. As a result, we wanted to create structural supports in the workshop for this learning goal. Specifically, we wanted to scaffold participantsâ learning about the workflow in a way that did not rely on field-specific terminology or existing computational skills. To do so, we created the ml4bio software so biological researchers could visually explore the ML workflow.</p>
      <p>The ml4bio software is written in Python using the popular ML library scikit-learn (<xref rid="btac233-B29" ref-type="bibr">Pedregosa <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>). It uses PyQt5 (v5.15.4) for the graphical user interface. Participants are asked to download and install the Anaconda Python distribution and the ml4bio software before the workshop using step-by-step instructions provided on the workshopâs website. We use Anaconda to create a conda Python environment for the ml4bio software via a script that installs and runs the software. In doing so, our software instantiates our design principle of minimizing the need for extensive coding background. The ml4bio package is also available from GitHub (<ext-link xlink:href="https://github.com/gitter-lab/ml4bio" ext-link-type="uri">https://github.com/gitter-lab/ml4bio</ext-link>) or PyPI (<ext-link xlink:href="https://pypi.org/project/ml4bio/" ext-link-type="uri">https://pypi.org/project/ml4bio/</ext-link>).</p>
      <p>Once installed, participants and instructors use the software throughout the workshop to walk through ML workflows, compare models and hyperparameters and visualize decision boundaries and model performance. The softwareâs user experience is optimized for education instead of other similar software that is designed to perform research-quality data analyses. Workshop participants are warned that the software is not meant to be used in research and is an educational tool. We purposefully limit certain user actions to encourage correct experimental setup and only show a subset of models and hyperparameters to avoid overwhelming users. These restrictions are consistent with our design focus on preparedness (rather than expertise) and low time investment.</p>
      <p>The softwareâs interface is laid out into the left and right halves of the screen. The left half lets the user navigate through the steps of a ML workflow: data selection, training and testing/predicting, thus directly supporting learning goal #1 (<xref rid="btac233-F2" ref-type="fig">Fig.Â 2</xref>). Laying out each of these steps is a key part of the softwareâs design. At each step, the user is presented with reasonable choices for how to proceed to the next step of the workflow. The software allows users to move forward to the next step, but users generally cannot go back a step without fully resetting and choosing a new dataset. This prevents users from accidentally causing data leakage by performing additional model selection after viewing test set performance or choosing a different test set that might include data from a previous training set. Thus, the user can only perform a complete and standard ML workflow using the software, reinforcing the purpose and flow of each step.</p>

      </fig>
      <p>When <italic toggle="yes">selecting data</italic>, users can view a summary of the data instances and features in a data summary window. The data are assumed to already be pre-processed. This mirrors our decision to keep detailed data pre-processing methods outside of the scope of the ML4Bio workshop, as pre-processing methods are often domain specific. Users can select a data splitting strategy for both a final test set and a validation set for model selection and whether to use stratified sampling.</p>
      <p>In the <italic toggle="yes">training</italic> step, users can train and compare different classifiers and hyperparameters on their training set and validation set. The software includes popular classifiers such as decision trees, random forests, support vector machines, neural networks, k-nearest neighbors and logistic regression. A subset of hyperparameters available in scikit-learn can be changed for each model, and each configuration can be given a name and comment.</p>
      <p>As each model is trained, it is added to a table summarizing all trained modelsâ performances (top half of <xref rid="btac233-F3" ref-type="fig">Fig.Â 3</xref>), where a number of classification performance metrics can be viewed for each model on either the validation set or the training set. Each model can be selected, where it is then shown in more detail (bottom half of <xref rid="btac233-F3" ref-type="fig">Fig.Â 3</xref>). Here, users can choose to view evaluation curves, a confusion matrix, or a plot of the data with the modelâs decision boundary for 2D datasets. Throughout the workshop, we especially focus on the decision boundary visualization to show the differences between classifiers, the limits of different classifiers, how certain hyperparameters can affect how a classifier learns. This focus allows us to move away from the specific features of each classifier, which we removed based on feedback from early sessions and refining our learning goals, and instead to focus on how different facets of classifiers and problems affect performance (Learning goal #2).</p>

        <graphic xlink:href="btac233f3" position="float"/>

      <p>Finally, users can move to <italic toggle="yes">testing and predicting</italic>. In this step, users can select one of the currently trained models for final classification and evaluation. Users can select a model manually or select the model that performed best on a certain metric. The software presents a warning that after the test set performance is shown, no more model selection can be performed. After acknowledging this, the right half of the software interface will show only the selected model, but training and validation set performance can still be viewed.</p>

      <title>2.3 Active learning</title>
      <p>Although our early sessions involved mostly lecture and a summative assessment activity, our use of the backward design paradigm to define learning goals also led us to redesign the workshop activities. Specifically, we transformed the workshop to involve more active learning opportunities for participants (<xref rid="btac233-B17" ref-type="bibr">Freeman <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>).</p>
      <p>The workshop now uses a variety of active learning strategies such as scenarios, polls, discussions and problem solving. It is in an HTML format derived from The Carpentries (Wilson, 2016) lesson template and hosted on GitHub pages (<ext-link xlink:href="https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/ml4bio-workshop/" ext-link-type="uri">https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/ml4bio-workshop/</ext-link>). This allows anyone to access, propose modifications to or reuse any workshop materials through GitHub.</p>
      <p>As an example of how active learning was added to the workshop, the introductory lesson was changed from a lecture to a debate activity. After sharing a textbook definition of ML (<xref rid="btac233-B25" ref-type="bibr">Mitchell, 1997</xref>), three scenarios are presented to participants. One such scenario is a person hand-writing a decision tree from personal knowledge. For each scenario, participants are asked to individually rate how much they do or do not think the scenario is an instance of ML and then justify their position in discussion. We end each scenario by showing how the instructors view the scenario.</p>
      <p>Our redesign of the workshop to support participant preparedness (Learning goal #3) led to the largest shift in the workshop towards active learning. Specifically, we added a ML paper charting activity, which is introduced in Day 1 and occurs on Day 2. On the first day, we ask participants to choose a biological paper that uses ML from a list or a paper they brought, but we make sure that each paper is selected by two or more participants. We ask participants to skim this paper before the second day of the workshop.</p>
      <p>On the second day of the workshop, after working through an example paper (<xref rid="btac233-B21" ref-type="bibr">Listgarten <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>) as a group, participants attempt to fill out a chart cataloging the steps of the ML workflow (Learning goal #1), evaluating model performance (Learning goal #2) and critiquing the experimental design (Learning goal #3). Participants first spend some time individually, then in groups by paper. Finally, we rejoin as a group and discuss issues or interesting conversations that came up.</p>
      <p>This activity gives participants a guided experience in the interpretation of research involving ML. The transition from learning about ML to having to interpret real ML experiments begins during the workshop. In doing so, we scaffold the participants in moving from lower levels of Bloomâs taxonomy (<xref rid="btac233-B12" ref-type="bibr">Crowe <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>) to higher levels. Additionally, the choice of paper allows participants to select a paper that interests them. Most of the papers do not cleanly fit into the standard ML workflow taught on the first day, as is expected given the huge variety of ways ML is used. This âmessinessâ gives participants support in activities that look more like what they will experience in their professional lives.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec>
      <title>2.4 Drawing on prior knowledge</title>
      <p>Learners come to learning environments with prior knowledge, which can both help or hinder their learning (<xref rid="btac233-B1" ref-type="bibr">Ambrose <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>). The ML4Bio workshop is no exception: the workshop is intended for those who are involved in biological research, typically graduate students, postdocs and staff scientists. These participants come to the workshop as trained researchers in a biological domain. Thus, when designing the workshop, we considered an andragogical approach, where <italic toggle="yes">andra</italic>gogy is an approach that specifically focuses on adult learners (<xref rid="btac233-B10" ref-type="bibr">Chan, 2010</xref>). Adult learners tend to be motivated by potential applications and learn through drawing on their own prior experiences. We designed workshop lessons to be task-oriented and use real biological applications of ML.</p>
      <p>In the second lesson of the workshop, where participants are introduced to the ml4bio software and walk through the ML workflow, we use a motivating example of classifying T cells as active or quiescent using imaging data (<xref rid="btac233-B37" ref-type="bibr">Wang <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2020</xref>). Throughout the workshop, we refer back to this dataset as well as synthetic datasets with the same features and classes that are designed to specifically show some facet of classifier behavior. Other real datasets are included in the ML4Bio GitHub repository from the UCI Machine Learning Repository (<xref rid="btac233-B15" ref-type="bibr">Dua and Graff, 2017</xref>). Using motivating biological problems leverages participantsâ prior knowledge to help them understand how classification works. Participants can more easily see what is reasonable or unreasonable in a familiar problem domain. Tailoring ML education to learnersâ primary domains has also been effective in undergraduate education (<xref rid="btac233-B33" ref-type="bibr">Sulmont <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2019</xref>).</p>
      <p>We use participantsâ prior knowledge by centering the academic paper critique activity in the workshop. We expect all participants to be able to interpret and evaluate biological literature. This activity draws on participantsâ existing abilities to read and analyze academic papers and merely has them extend those abilities to papers that include ML components. Introducing the skill of reading academic papers from the ground up would take much more than an hour or two to attain (<xref rid="btac233-B19" ref-type="bibr">Hubbard and Dunbar, 2017</xref>). We structured the ML paper charting activity to use this prior knowledge, as participants are encouraged to choose a paper to chart that they are interested in or come from their research area.</p>
      <p>Although participantsâ prior knowledge generally enhances their learning, we also considered areas where prior knowledge could hinder it. Misconceptions can occur if participants incorrectly apply their prior knowledge and we do not catch and confront the misconception. We were especially cautious when designing the lesson on evaluation metrics. Many of the metrics used to evaluate classifier performance, such as precision and recall, have different meanings in laboratory settings. We directly address this and other possible overlapping terminology to participants.</p>
    </sec>
  </sec>
  <sec>
    <title>3 Study design</title>
    <p><bold>Participants.</bold> After we reformulated the workshopâs learning goals and activities, we held 3 ML4Bio workshops online over Zoom on May 4 and 6, August 2 and 5 and September 14 and 16 2021. Participants were recruited to the workshops via email and could choose to participate in the study after registering for the workshop during the pre-workshop survey. A total of 10, 18 and 19 workshop participants consented to participate in the study in the May, August and September workshops, respectively. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the University of Wisconsin-Madison (#2021-036), and we obtained electronic informed consent from all study participants. Participants could participate in the workshop and provide informal feedback on the workshop without participating in the study. Here, we report only on those who consented to study participation. A breakdown of participant demographics is presented in <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table S1</xref>.</p>
    <p><bold>Data collection.</bold> To collect data on the workshop experience and its efficacy in achieving its learning goals, we designed three different data collection instruments: a pre-survey, a skills assessment and a post-survey. The pre-survey was emailed to participants in the week before the workshop; the assessment was given during the workshop; and the post-survey was emailed to participants immediately after the workshop. No directly identifying participant information was collected.</p>
    <p>The pre- and post-surveys were designed to collect participant demographic data, record their workshop experiences, and evaluate the workshopâs affective learning goal (#4). In the pre-survey, we collected participant demographic data including current career stage; experience with statistics, ML, coding and the command line; and overall goals and expectations for the workshop. In the post-survey, participants were asked about their experience in the workshop with regards to their expectations, pacing, time allocation and general feedback.</p>
    <p>The post-survey also included embedded retrospective preâpost questions that were used to assess the workshopâs affective learning goal. Retrospective self-assessment has been shown to help prevent response-shift bias, where understanding of the question being asked can change between pre- and post-assessments, while still identifying learning (<xref rid="btac233-B5" ref-type="bibr">Bhanji <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). For instance, a participantâs increased understanding of ML could lead them to realize that they initially understood less than they thought they did, thus resulting in a decrease in self-assessed knowledge after learning. One paired preâpost question was included for verifying the retrospective questions.</p>
    <p>In contrast to the surveys, the in-workshop assessment was designed to ascertain whether or not participants had achieved the content learning goals of the workshop (#1â3) and to verify participantsâ self-assessment of their knowledge and confidence in ML after the workshop. Participants were given a heavily modified excerpt from a paper that uses random forests to predict microRNA targets (<xref rid="btac233-B24" ref-type="bibr">Mendoza <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). The modifications included feature simplification and the changing model selection to be based on the test set, introducing data leakage into the workflow. Participants were asked to identify parts of the ML experiment such as the model, features and data splitting strategy and to assess the experiment for overfitting, choice of performance metrics and data leakage. This assessment allows direct measurement of participantsâ ability to understand and assess ML as presented in academic papers. Identifying parts of the ML experiment assesses achievement of Learning goal #1, and evaluating the experimental design and model performance assesses achievement of Learning goals #2 and #3. Note that without a pre-assessment of learning goals, this assessment strategy does not provide causal evidence that the workshop caused learning goal achievement. We decided that requiring participants to complete a pre-assessment would significantly lower interest in the workshop. Additionally, when paired with the retrospective self-assessment, we can draw conclusions about self-assessment of learning goal achievement and use the in-workshop assessment to verify the level of knowledge post-workshop.</p>
    <p><bold>Data analysis.</bold> The first step in data analysis involved creating matched datasets for each consenting participant. Four digit codes for each participant linked their pre-survey, in-workshop assessment and post-survey.</p>
    <p>The second step involved analyzing the self-reported survey data. Pre- and post-survey questions related to background, expectations and experiences (rather than questions related to preparation for future work with ML) were analyzed using basic counts and descriptive statistics. However, both retrospective and paired preâpost questions were compared with two-sided Wilcoxon signed-rank tests. Tests were performed using the scipy.stats.wilcoxon method in SciPy v1.7.1 with default parameters.</p>
    <p>The in-workshop assessment was âgradedâ for correctness. Workshop designers (who are also ML researchers) determined correct answers for each question on the assessment. Author C.S.M. coded all answers given by participants. Additionally, authors C.S.M. and R.S.R. looked at the participantsâ explanations for their responses. From those explanations, we identified common themes in correct (and incorrect) answers. Although many questions in the assessment have straightforward answers, later questions are less clear. The final two questions in particular, âHow well did the model perform?â and âDo you trust the validity of these results?â, do not have an obvious correct answer. We instead compare participantsâ responses to possible factors they were asked to identify the presence or absence of in other questions: data leakage, improper performance metrics and overfitting. How the presence or absence of these factors, and the degree to which they occur, affects participantsâ trust in the presented results provides insight into how the participant will engage with ML research.</p>

    <title>4 Results</title>
    <sec>
      <title>4.1 Attendeesâ backgrounds and expectations</title>
      <p>Over the 3 workshop sessions, there were 47 participants in total who completed the pre-survey. A summary of participants is shown in <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table S1</xref>. 15 participants only completed the pre-survey, 6 completed only the pre-survey and assessment, and 26 completed all instruments. The 21 incomplete responses include participants who did not return for the second day and participants who completed the workshop but did not fill out the post-survey.</p>
      <p>Of the 47 participants, 46 had never taken a ML course, and 6 had never taken a calculus or statistics course. Before the workshop, 13 self-reported as knowing nothing about ML, 27 as knowing a little and 7 as knowing a moderate amount. Only 3 participants reported having more than a little research experience with ML. Half of participants had at least a moderate amount of coding experience and experience with the command line interface. These data align with our experiences in the initial workshop sessions and provide strong support for our design choice to minimize the need for coding and mathematical background knowledge.</p>
      <p>Participantsâ expectations generally aligned with the workshopâs learning goals. 33 participants were interested in generally learning about ML with responses such as âbasic overview of MLâ and âunderstanding how ML worksâ<italic toggle="yes">.</italic> 24 participants specifically mentioned wanting to learn about questions they could answer in their own research using ML or how to apply ML to their research. These expectations align with the current learning goals of the workshop and are consistent with our focus on preparedness rather than ML expertise.</p>

    <sec>
      <title>4.2 In-workshop assessment</title>
      <p>In-workshop assessment results (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table S2</xref>) show that learning goals #1 to #3 were generally achieved, though identifying subtle instances of data leakage proved challenging for many participants. When presented with an altered excerpt from an academic paper, almost all responses correctly identified the target variable, number of instances, model, data splitting strategy and performance metrics.</p>
      <p><bold>Data leakage.</bold> A methodological error, data leakage, was added to the excerpt. About half of responses correctly identified the presence of data leakage in the experiment (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table S2</xref>). Almost all of the responses that provided an explanation for the presence of data leakage correctly cited the lack of validation set or the choice of the final model based on test set performance as evidence of data leakage.</p>
      <p><bold>Overfitting and performance metrics.</bold> Most participants who provided an explanation for their response to the presence of overfitting were correct in their reasoning. Participantsâ critique of metric choice also showed an understanding of the correct factors to consider, such as how false negatives were more important than false positives in this setting, so sensitivity was an important metric.</p>
      <p><bold>Trust</bold>. Finally, when asked whether or not they trusted the validity of the results, participants had split opinions. Participants who provided an explanation for their response provided correct explanations, such as the data splitting strategy or overfitting as reasons to not trust the results. We are not sure how to interpret other participantsâ lack of trust in the paper, and it suggests opportunities for further learning may be necessary to differentiate the severity of different problems with ML workflows.</p>

      <title>4.3 Affective outcome</title>
      <p>In addition to achieving the content-based learning goals, the data indicates that the workshop was also successful in helping participants achieve the affective learning goal (#4). Recall that our goal here is to support participants in developing the belief that they can engage with ML research. We looked at those beliefs for several domains including training classifiers, reviewing a paper with ML, and identifying a problem well-suited to ML. Based on the self-reported data, participantsâ comfort in training classifiers for a research project generally increased after the workshop (<inline-formula id="IE1"><mml:math id="IM1" display="inline" overflow="scroll"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>2.2</mml:mn><mml:mo>Ã</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>10</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>â</mml:mo><mml:mn>4</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>, <italic toggle="yes">nâ</italic>=<italic toggle="yes">â</italic>26, Wilcoxon signed-rank test) as shown in <xref rid="btac233-F4" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 4</xref>. Before the workshop, over half of participants reported being not at all or a little comfortable, whereas after, among those who responded the majority were either a little or somewhat comfortable. Some participants who reported being very comfortable training classifiers after the workshop might show an overestimation of ML skills. We do not expect participants to be able to use ML in their own research without assistance after the workshop.</p>

      <p>There was an almost universal increase in self-reported knowledge and confidence from before to after the workshop (<xref rid="btac233-F5" ref-type="fig">Fig.Â 5</xref>). Participants reported a marked increase in their confidence in identifying a problem that is well-suited to ML in their research (<inline-formula id="IE2"><mml:math id="IM2" display="inline" overflow="scroll"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>5.3</mml:mn><mml:mo>Ã</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>10</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>â</mml:mo><mml:mn>6</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>, <italic toggle="yes">nâ</italic>=<italic toggle="yes">â</italic>26, Wilcoxon signed-rank test).

Finally, the most direct evidence we have in their belief that they can engage in ML is the substantial and significant increase in their likelihood to pursue ML for future problems in their work (<inline-formula id="IE5"><mml:math id="IM5" display="inline" overflow="scroll"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>9.4</mml:mn><mml:mo>Ã</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>10</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>â</mml:mo><mml:mn>6</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>, <italic toggle="yes">nâ</italic>=<italic toggle="yes">â</italic>26, Wilcoxon signed-rank test).

      <title>4.4 Workshop experiences and expectations</title>
      <p>Participants generally reported that the workshop met their expectations. Satisfaction with the workshop was high. 10 participants responded that the workshop exceeded expectations, 10 that the workshop met all expectations, 6 that the workshop met most expectations and none that the workshop met some or did not meet expectations. There was no clear consensus on which expectations were not met. More real-world examples, coding, clustering and how to use ML were mentioned.</p>
      <p>When asked which workshop topics were most valuable, almost every part of the workshop was named by at least some participants. The two most commonly named parts of the workshop were lessons that involved classifiers and the paper charting activity, with 12 and 7 participants naming those parts, respectively. Participants generally valued learning the variety of classifiers available. Typical responses were focused on âdifferent classifiers and how they compareâ or âdiscussing the different classifiersâ. Three participants specifically mentioned that being able to visualize data or how classifiers work was particularly helpful.</p>
      <p>A number of the responses mentioning the paper charting activity noted that it was particularly valuable because of its applicability and realism:</p>
      <p>
        <disp-quote content-type="extract">
          <p>Working through the topics with the ML4bio sample where we could see all the different graphs and assessment statistics to understand how they relate. Also discussing papers where not everything is laid out the same way or fully documented and learning to recognize that. I thought the research paper exercise was helpful. Specifically because we could bring in articles that interest us.</p>
        </disp-quote>
      </p>
      <p>Two participants said that the in-workshop assessment was the most valuable part of the workshop for them. Their responses mention that performing an assessment, then checking it as a group, gave immediate feedback on their learning. Other participants noted that scenarios and polls used throughout the workshop also helped them check their own learning:</p>
      <p>
        <disp-quote content-type="extract">
          <p>I found all of it really valuable. I especially liked the knowledge check at the end through literature evaluations. This course solidified a lot of the ideas behind ML for me.</p>
        </disp-quote>
      </p>
      <p>Participants were asked which workshop topics they would find difficult to explain at a high level. Details of classifiers were reported as the most common topic participants would have the most trouble explaining. 13 responses mention classifiers in some form in their response. Most responses name specific classifiers and focus on more detail: âThe details of how each algorithm worksâ, âLogistic regression versus neural networksâ and âExplaining how a neural network worksâ. Other common areas of confusion were model selection and data leakage, with five and three responses mentioning them, respectively. Despite these continued areas of confusion, participants highlight that the workshop met their goals and provided them with valuable skills and knowledge around ML.</p>

    <title>5 Discussion</title>
    <sec>
      <title>5.1 Lessons learned</title>
      <p><bold>Provide flexibility for participants to bring their own goals.</bold> When asked in the pre-survey what they were hoping to learn from the workshop, most participants named a specific research question they were interested in exploring with ML. This aligns with previous literature on adult learners; adult learners are typically more motivated than non-adult learners by real problems (<xref rid="btac233-B10" ref-type="bibr">Chan, 2010</xref>). Thus, we found it especially important to ground workshop activities in real or at least realistic data wherever possible.</p>
      <p>Although having a problem in mind for the workshop can motivate participants, it also complicates meeting participant expectations. The research questions participants bring likely require tools and knowledge beyond a general introduction to ML. Therefore, in workshops geared towards active researchers, it is more likely that the workshopâs learning goals may not perfectly align with a participantâs needs.</p>
      <p>We mitigate this possible misalignment in a number of ways. We provide a variety of applications throughout the workshop, so that participants are likely to see at least one problem that is similar to their research area. However, we do not cover application-specific pre-processing and feature generation. This is evidenced by multiple participants mentioning that they would want more information on image analysis techniques with ML, even though the first presented dataset is an image classification problem.</p>
      <p>Additionally, we provide resources for participants to continue learning about ML. These resources allow participants, even if their goals were not fully met during the workshop, to have an accessible next step for learning about their specific application. We present these resources to participants in the final workshop lesson. The resources include online textbooks, a Jupyter notebook demonstrating a ML workflow, ML-focused code tutorials and Carpentries workshops for participants interested in learning more technical skills. We plan to continue to grow this list of resources as we are presented with new participant interests.</p>
      <p>Finally, during the workshop, we give participants space to explore what they find to be interesting. This exploration is clearest during the literature charting activity where participants can choose from a variety of papers to investigate or bring their own. Multiple participants found this activity to be the most valuable part of the workshop. Participants can explore a specific application of ML with support from fellow participants and workshop instructors.</p>
      <p>Participants bring their own goals to the workshop. Accommodating these goals can be seen as counter to the backwards-design paradigm, where learning goals are chosen in advance. Incorporating application breadth, resources for participants to continue to learn on their own and flexibility in the workshop structure are effective tools for creating room for these goals while still conducting a learning goal-driven workshop.</p>
      <p><bold>Assessments are worth the time.</bold> Participants found both formative and summative assessments valuable throughout the workshop. Despite assessment being a well-known tool in school-based learning environments (<xref rid="btac233-B6" ref-type="bibr">Black and Wiliam, 2009</xref>), we were initially hesitant to include assessments because we felt they might lower interest from participants. However, multiple participants named the in-workshop assessment the most valuable part of the workshop, though this assessment was originally designed for the study and not directly as a learning tool. Reviewing the assessment afterwards allowed participants to catch misconceptions they otherwise would have taken away from the workshop.</p>
      <p>Participants mentioned that other in-workshop assessments, polls and scenarios throughout each lesson were valuable checks of their knowledge. These quick assessments also allowed the workshop instructors to notice and spend extra time on areas participants were especially confused about.</p>
      <p>An additional possible positive effect of the assessments was providing a mastery experience: a challenge that is successfully completed, demonstrating improvement. Mastery experiences lead to increased efficacy and confidence (<xref rid="btac233-B3" ref-type="bibr">Bandura, 1977</xref>). In the final assessment, almost all participants were able to correctly identify parts of the presented ML experiment. This may have helped demonstrate to participants their new knowledge of ML and helped lead to the marked increases in self-rated confidence and knowledge of ML participants expressed.</p>
      <p><bold>Set expectations as clearly as possible.</bold> Every iteration of the workshop included more information about what participants should expect. However, while the number of participants who noted they had misaligned expectations decreased over subsequent iterations of the workshop, every workshop still had some participants who noted something they were hoping or expecting to learn from the workshop that was not covered.</p>
      <p>The nature of the workshopâs audience may have exacerbated this issue. Participants may have come to the workshop having already heard of methods that are popular in their field and expected to learn about them during the workshop. Beyond more general expectations, it may help set expectations if we had noted specific, popular concepts that would not be covered in the workshop. Explicitly stating popular terms and buzzwords can help communicate with participants and manage expectations.</p>
      <p>Participants were also uncertain about how deeply they should understand some of the workshop content. This confusion was especially apparent during the lesson on logistic regression and neural networks. Multiple participants expressed that they felt they did not understand all the details of how logistic regression and neural networks work in their post-survey. However, we did not expect participants to understand the mathematics behind these models. Better delimiting what we expected participants to learn about these models and what was out of scope may have reduced this confusion.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec>
      <title>5.2 Future directions</title>
      <p>We plan to continue to refine and expand the ML4Bio workshop. One area of improvement is to further pare down the knowledge participants need to achieve the workshopâs learning goals. Although we have already adapted the scope of some lessons, for instance, by removing the mathematical details of how logistic regression works, it would be productive to systematically approach this refinement. This streamlining could free time to explore more nuanced examples of experimental design flaws like data leakage.</p>
      <p>Further clarifying the limitations of the workshop and ML in general would aid participants in choosing their next steps. This could include adding additional cautionary language to the concluding lesson and emphasizing the importance of data cleaning and pre-processing, which often require domain-specific strategies, to help participants leave with a correct understanding of their current skills in ML.</p>
      <p>Although we are able to determine the achievement of learning goals through the current set of surveys and assessment, some of the questions on the assessment do not encourage useful feedback. Questions on whether or not the results are valid or if the metrics are appropriate do not have a definitive answer, but a large proportion of participants answered them with a one-word âyesâ or ânoâ. Ideally, these questions would encourage participants to rephrase their answer or to change the question so that it has a clear correct answer. A large proportion of participantsâ answers were not useful for analysis, though they did still appear to provide a valuable learning experience for participants.</p>
      <p>A tool to export workflows in the ml4bio software to Jupyter notebooks would provide a powerful link to technical skills. Participants interested in coding could see how workflows they perform in the ml4bio software are expressed as code, giving a smoother transition to coding ML workflows. Currently, we provide a Jupyter notebook with Python code demonstrating an example ML workflow similar to those implemented in the ml4bio software. Participants can run this notebook in a web browser with Binder.</p>
      <p>A few participants in each workshop consistently struggled with software installation before and during the workshop. Some issues arose from installing and configuring Anaconda. Others were due to the scripts we provided to create the required conda environment or the environment itself. Including more details about expected behavior and installation screenshots in our setup instructions partially alleviated but did not eliminate these issues. A cross-platform installer that provides the ml4bio software and required datasets, possibly using the conda constructor tool, would make the workshop more accessible and reduce the amount of command line troubleshooting required. Rewriting the ml4bio software to run in a web browser would minimize the technical requirements and help scale the workshop to larger audiences. However, this would require substantial software development. There are also numerous ways to improve the ml4bio software such as support for more classifiers, visualization of datasets with more than two features, saving models and settings, more interface tooltips and better text scaling.</p>
      <p>We plan to expand our current instructor notes to the point that we could provide the ML4Bio workshop as a full lesson plan others could teach. Although all activities in the workshop are laid out in the online materials and current instructor notes, they are not detailed enough for someone to teach the workshop without first observing it. The workshop could also be scaled up to larger sessions if additional helpers were present to lead group activities and troubleshoot software issues. The ML4Bio workshop has joined The Carpentries Incubator to gain additional support and feedback and to expand the audience and possible future instructors. Our workshop design and instruction have already benefited from the principles taught in The Carpentries Instructor Training and specific suggestions from Carpentries instructors. We hope to expand and improve the ML4Bio workshop so that it continues to be an effective tool for helping biologists participate in an increasingly computational research world.</p>
