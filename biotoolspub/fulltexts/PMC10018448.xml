      <p>Liquid chromatography-high-resolution mass spectrometry
(LC-HRMS)
is widely used to detect chemicals with a broad range of physiochemical
properties in complex biological samples. However, the current data
analysis strategies are not sufficiently scalable because of data
complexity and amplitude. In this article, we report a novel data
analysis strategy for HRMS data founded on structured query language
database archiving. A database called ScreenDB was populated with
parsed untargeted LC-HRMS data after peak deconvolution from forensic
drug screening data. The data were acquired using the same analytical
method over 8 years. ScreenDB currently holds data from around 40,000
data files, including forensic cases and quality control samples that
can be readily sliced and diced across data layers. Long-term monitoring
of system performance, retrospective data analysis for new targets,
and identification of alternative analytical targets for poorly ionized
analytes are examples of ScreenDB applications. These examples demonstrate
that ScreenDB makes a significant improvement to forensic services
and that the concept has potential for broad applications for all
large-scale biomonitoring projects that rely on untargeted LC-HRMS
data.</p>

    <title>Introduction</title>
    <p>Liquid-chromatography-high-resolution
mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS)
is widely used for comprehensive screening of complex samples in environmental,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref></sup> forensic,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref></sup> clinical,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref></sup> and food<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref></sup> chemistry.
The screening is considered comprehensive because it can cover chemicals
with a wide range of physiochemical properties and allows the use
of a flexible target list since data acquisition typically occurs
in an untargeted manner. The acquired data set is rich, with each
analytical compound identified as an <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic>-retention time pair, possibly supported by additional parameters
such as the fragment ions, adduct pattern, or isotopic pattern. LC-HRMS
data originally acquired for one purpose is reanalyzed to answer new
research questions using retrospective screening,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>−<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref></sup> metabolomics
applications,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>−<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref></sup> and nontargeted screening.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref></sup> The data files are mostly queried at the batch level using vendor
or open-source software via open file formats. The data analysis strategies
for re-use of &gt;1000 LC-HRMS data files typically involve either
significant
data reduction or are limited to the original research question, thereby
requiring process-heavy reanalysis for new questions. This article
reports a novel data analysis strategy for LC-HRMS data that involves
the additional storage of peak deconvoluted data in a structured query
language (SQL) database format, allowing for quick reanalysis to answer
new research questions.</p>
    <p>Untargeted and unannotated analytical
data from our LC-HRMS forensic
drug screening collected in 8 years was parsed to an SQL database,
referred to as ScreenDB. Forensic analyses adhere to strict quality
assurance schemes to ensure the traceability and reproducibility of
results. After a method development, validation, and implementation
phase, a screening workflow will run with only minor modifications
resulting in data that is comparable over time. ScreenDB was set up
with the objective of linking the screening data with other forensic
metadata, and the database should allow the access to all relevant
data layers including adduct, isotope, and fragment ions. Our applications
of ScreenDB show functional data workflows with &gt;10,000 LC-HRMS
data
files.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref></sup> This novel
data analysis strategy for LC-HRMS data is scalable to at least 40,000
data files, although only the server hardware theoretically sets the
limit. SQL archiving is thus ideal for active storage of large amounts
of comparable LC-HRMS data sets if the data owner wishes to frequently
query data.</p>

      <title>Instrumentation</title>
      <p>The sample preparation, LC-HRMS settings,
and subsequent data evaluation workflow were previously described
by Mollerup et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref></sup> Briefly, chromatographic
retention was performed with reversed-phase LC in the gradient mode
with a total run time of 15 min. Data were acquired on three different
Xevo G2-S QTOF HRMS instruments (Waters, Milford, USA) with comparable
parameters and sensitivities, in the MS<sup>E</sup> data-independent
acquisition mode.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec2.2">
      <title>Drug Screening</title>
      <p>Internal standards were added to all
samples prior to sample preparation. Within-run quality control (QC)
samples included blank matrices, internal-standard blank injections,
and injection of three methanolic standard mixtures, each containing
approximately 100 compounds at 0.5 mg L<sup>–1</sup>. The quality
of every batch and injection was verified as part of routine forensic
data analysis. Only data from analytical runs that fulfilled set forensic
QC criteria were transferred to the database. All data was analyzed
in UNIFI instrument software (Waters, Milford, USA) and then exported
as the UNIFI export package format (.uep). Since the data was previously
used in forensic drug screening workflows, data files were reprocessed
to remove annotations and to lower the ion count threshold. The count
threshold was lowered to allow evaluation of these set thresholds.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec2.3">
      <title>Data Analysis</title>
      <p>LC-HRMS measurement variables were read
directly from the uep data files and subsequently parsed to the SQL
archive. To prepare plots, data were extracted from ScreenDB with
the SQL server (Microsoft, Redmond, Washington, USA), and subsequent
analysis steps were made using Python. Data variables of internal
standards for all biological samples and selected QC analytes analyzed
between 2014 and 2020 were extracted from ScreenDB with one diagnostic
fragment ion with precursor ion limits of exact mass ± 3 mDa.
These ions were then grouped using the mean-shift clustering algorithm
from the SciKit-learn Python package. All peaks were scaled using
tolerances of 3 mDa and 0.5 min between samples. The mean-shift clustering
algorithm was subsequently applied using a bandwidth of 1. Diagnostic
fragment ions were grouped if present at 0.015 min from the precursor
ion.</p>

      <title>ScreenDB Architecture and Content</title>
      <p>Different types of
forensic cases were screened with the same LC-HRMS method, including
driving-under-the-influence-of-drugs, drug seizure, biological samples
from autopsy, and drug-facilitated crime cases. Registration and documentation
are handled through a laboratory information management system, STARLIMS
(STARLIMS Corporation, Hollywood, FL, USA). The sample name, analytical
run number, and analysis identifier nomenclature in ScreenDB refer
to the entries in the LIMS. Via this structured connectivity, data
from each LC-HRMS injection can be matched with well-curated data
consisting of quantitative results from complementary methods, the
sample age, case characteristics, and other historical data. ScreenDB
consists of two tables, with <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.analchem.2c03769/suppl_file/ac2c03769_si_001.pdf">Tables S1 and S2</ext-link> presenting the most important variables parsed from the uep files.
A sample table holds sample-specific information, such as the sample
identifier, file directory, run name, and a unique data identifier
(uid) assigned to the raw data using vendor software. Each analytical
injection corresponds to one line in the sample table. In the peak
table, each line corresponds to one ion signal from either low- or
high-energy channels. Each signal has an accurate mass, retention
time, and signal intensity, together with diagnostic variance parameters
calculated in the compression (componentization) process from the
profile data. The UNIFI componentization step involves peak detection
and subsequent grouping of co-eluting ions in the high- and low-energy
spectra,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref></sup> and thus filtering out of some
background signals that do not show chromatographic retention. The
precursor ion, <italic>in-source</italic> fragment ions, isotopes,
and adducts are available from the low-energy spectra, and the residual
precursor ion and fragment ions are available from the high-energy
spectra, along with some co-eluting interferences. Ions are decomponentized
in ScreenDB, meaning that each measured ion at a given retention time
results in a line in the peak table, and it can be queried independently
from the assigned component. Variables available from the ScreenDB
peak table are illustrated in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref></xref> for the drug cocaine. The spectra show how isotopic
peaks, diagnostic fragment ions, and protonated molecules are available
for queries. Extracted spectra for cocaine and morphine are available
in <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.analchem.2c03769/suppl_file/ac2c03769_si_001.pdf">Figures S1A</ext-link> and <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.analchem.2c03769/suppl_file/ac2c03769_si_001.pdf">S2A</ext-link>, respectively, from the lock-mass corrected and centroided
raw files and from the uep files from the same injection as that in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref></xref> and <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.analchem.2c03769/suppl_file/ac2c03769_si_001.pdf">S2B</ext-link> to illustrate data retention in the componentization
step. Complex, multiparametric queries are not easy to build in vendor
software but can be coded in general-purpose programming languages
with extracts from ScreenDB. A legacy version of ScreenDB used for
earlier applications<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref></sup> was based on mascot generic format
files that associated each low-energy ion with the component’s
high-energy spectrum. This inflated the legacy ScreenDB and also required
conversion of the data files prior to storage. Reading the uep files
directly allows the retention of more analytical information and access
to the extra data layers arising from profile acquisition. The use
of the mascot generic format in combination with MS<sup>1</sup>-level
features is used in feature-based molecular networking, where only
representative MS<sup>2</sup> spectra are selected to eliminate this
data inflation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref></sup> Feature-based LC-HRMS
data with linked fragment ion spectra could work well in an SQL database
structure, although ions recorded in low and high energy would have
variable levels of information. The database architecture would have
to be modified accordingly and may need separate tables for features
and fragment ions. Other acquisition and processing software or peak-picking
algorithms provide different data variables available for parsing.
Without the UNIFI componentization step, another lock-mass correction
and peak-picking algorithm should be used to centroid ions in the
mass and retention time domains. It is, however, crucial for retrospective
and non-targeted data analysis workflows that the data layers remain
accessible separately for flexible queries that are not locked in
feature formats. Our purpose of making this structured digital archive
was to mirror and support the in-house screening, which uses UNIFI
peak components, and therefore, alternative approaches were not evaluated
as this would not fulfill our research goals.</p>

      <title>Measurement Uncertainty</title>
      <p>Reproducible measurements are
imperative for the meaningful comparison of data variables acquired
over years of analysis. A strength of ScreenDB is that stored QC sample
variables and internal standard signals are accessible for further
quality check and to set informed limits. Histograms of the protonated
molecules in the mass and retention time domains from internal standards
in around 14,000 biological samples are presented in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>. Fragmentation reproducibility
is presented in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref></xref>, with 5 standards from around 1000 methanolic QC sample injections.
When performing big data analyses with ScreenDB, the extracted ion
chromatograms and fragment ion spectra are not evaluated individually,
as opposed to forensic screening evaluation. Therefore, well-informed
and more tailored decisions need to be made, as presented in Pan et
al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref></sup></p>

        <title>ScreenOmics</title>
        <p>The in-house drug screening workflow is
improved by identification of new targets for analytes that cannot
otherwise be detected via metabolomics-type workflows.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref></sup> A toxicological screening is frequently carried out with positive
electrospray ionization and therefore has lower sensitivity for neutral
and acidic compounds. Comparing the LC-HRMS data from samples with
known positive and negative quantitative results for a given drug
allows the identification of alternative targets (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref></xref>A). This is referred to as
ScreenOmics. The ScreenOmics approach does not use signal intensities
for prioritization of targets but instead takes advantage of the large

may be adducts and/or metabolites that ionize better in positive electrospray

        <title>Retrospective Data Analysis</title>
        <p>When a new drug emerges,
ScreenDB can be queried to disclose whether a feature with those characteristics
has ever been acquired. Retrospective data analysis is performed in
a matter of seconds, making this approach for retrospective screening
more efficient than reprocessing data or reanalyzing samples. Recently,
13,514 data files from driving-under-the-influence-of-drugs samples
stored in ScreenDB were queried for designer drugs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref></sup> A data workflow was tailored to common benzodiazepines
using quantitative results from a complementary analytical method
as a true condition (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref></xref>B). This study revealed 43 tentative positive findings that
were not detected in the screening when the case was open and only
9 false positive findings.</p>
        <p>Feature-based data analysis can answer
many of the same and more research questions than ScreenDB but can
only scale to 2000 samples by limiting the number of features for
downstream analysis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref></sup> Vendor software
used for the drug screening workflow in our laboratory becomes slow
in batches of &gt;100 samples, and ion signal data is locked in components.
ScreenDB was therefore developed as a structured library of ion signals
to enable active reuse of LC-HRMS data and flexible access to available
data layers. The scalability and flexibility of LC-HRMS<sup>E</sup> data analysis via SQL database archiving are not achievable with
other platforms. Moving data to an SQL archive is an alternative to
relying on memory upgrades to run larger batches. When the ion signals
are archived as tabular data, the data can no longer be directly imported
in the vast number of computational tools available for LC-HRMS data
analysis workflows. Consequently, data analysis workflows need to
be developed de novo, and some programming is necessary to make use
of the data. Storing data in the SQL format increases storage space
demands and most often requires a separate database server. However,
the price of the necessary hardware or cloud services is minuscule
compared to the price of the LC-HRMS hardware.</p>

    <title>Conclusions and Perspectives</title>
    <p>In this study, we report
a novel scalable strategy for LC-HRMS
data analysis. ScreenDB is an SQL database that currently stores data
from around 40,000 data files, acquired with a single analytical method
from 2014 onward. ScreenDB can be used as a stand-alone data source,
but its main value for forensic toxicology lies in the linking with
digitalized laboratory and case data. In our laboratory, we frequently
query the database for contaminant trouble shooting and retrospective
data analysis and to improve our drug screening method. Easy access
to historic data is a prerequisite for it to be of any value in high-throughput
laboratories. Being an SQL database, we only have to connect with
ScreenDB (&lt;1 min), and then, we can query 8 years’ worth
of LC-HRMS data with the same level of information available in vendor
software but with both flexibility and speed. Scalable data analysis
approaches as presented here are necessary as large-scale biomonitoring
with LC-HRMS becomes more prevalent. Active storage in SQL databases
can expand the impact of large-scale biomonitoring projects by making
the data more accessible, reusable, and interoperable. However, robust
analytical systems that are evaluated with QC systems are imperative
to compare data over long periods of time.</p>
    <p>Readily retrievable,
curated, and untargeted analytical data enable
fast and simple retrospective analyses for new targets and active
use of stored intelligence in historic LC-HRMS data. Consequently,
transferring data to a structured digital archive augments active
data reuse and, in our case, improves forensic services.</p>
