      <p>Top-down liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS)
analyzes
intact proteoforms and generates mass spectra containing peaks of
proteoforms with various isotopic compositions, charge states, and
retention times. An essential step in top-down MS data analysis is
proteoform feature detection, which aims to group these peaks into
peak sets (features), each containing all peaks of a proteoform. Accurate
protein feature detection enhances the accuracy in MS-based proteoform
identification and quantification. Here, we present TopFD, a software
tool for top-down MS feature detection that integrates algorithms
for proteoform feature detection, feature boundary refinement, and
machine learning models for proteoform feature evaluation. We performed
extensive benchmarking of TopFD, ProMex, FlashDeconv, and Xtract using
seven top-down MS data sets and demonstrated that TopFD outperforms
other tools in feature accuracy, reproducibility, and feature abundance
reproducibility.</p>

    <title>Introduction</title>
    <p>Top-down mass spectrometry (MS) has attracted
increasing attention
owing to its unique capacity to analyze intact proteoforms and characterize
proteoforms with multiple alterations, such as sequence mutations,
splicing events, and post-translational modifications (PTMs).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>−<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref></sup> Advances in high-resolution and high-accuracy MS instruments significantly
increased proteoform identifications and amino acid sequence coverage
in proteome-wide top-down proteomics analysis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref></sup> Recent top-down MS studies identified more than 23 000 proteoforms
from colorectal cancer cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref></sup> and about
30 000 proteoforms from human blood and bone marrow cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref></sup> Top-down MS-based proteoform profiling has successfully
identified differentially expressed proteoforms associated with diseases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>−<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref></sup></p>
    <p>Proteoform feature detection is a fundamental computational
problem
in top-down MS-based proteoform quantification. In proteome-wide top-down
MS analysis, proteoforms extracted from samples are first separated
by liquid chromatography (LC) or other separation methods and then
analyzed by tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). Each proteoform has
an elution profile (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref></xref>a), which depicts the abundance of the proteoform eluted over
time in proteoform separation. A mass spectrum contains a list of
peaks, each represented by its mass-to-charge ratio (<italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic>) and intensity. The isotopologues of a proteoform
with the same charge state are detected as a group of isotopic peaks
in a mass spectrum, called an isotopic envelope (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref></xref>b). The peak intensities in
an isotopic envelope follow a distribution determined by the isotopic
frequencies of the atoms in the proteoform. A mass spectrum often
contains multiple isotopic envelopes of a proteoform with different
charge states (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref></xref>b). Feature detection in top-down MS aims to identify all isotopic
peaks of each proteoform over retention time (RT) and across charge
states in a liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) data file
and reports its elution profile and total signal intensity (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref></xref>c).</p>

    <p>Many methods have been proposed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>−<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref></sup> for peptide feature detection in bottom-up MS (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.analchem.2c05244/suppl_file/ac2c05244_si_001.pdf">Supporting Table S1</ext-link>), which is similar to proteoform feature
detection in top-down MS. These methods are focused on solving three
computational problems in feature detection: (1) grouping peak signals
with similar <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> values in consecutive
MS1 scans into an <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> or envelope
trace (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref></xref>c),
(2) splitting a trace into several corresponding to single peptides
if the trace contains peak signals from two or more peptides, and
(3) evaluating and ranking reported features.</p>
    <p>To identify an <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> or envelope
trace, a seed peak or envelope of a feature and its corresponding
scan are selected. The peak or envelope is then extended along the
RT in both directions until one or several scans do not contain peaks
or envelopes with similar <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> values
matched to the seed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref></sup></p>
    <p>Trace splitting
methods can be divided into three groups. The first
is to split a trace at the scans lacking matched peaks or envelopes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref></sup> In the second approach, the elution profile
of a feature is fitted to a distribution or function, such as a Gaussian
distribution or wavelet function, and a cutoff signal intensity is
used to determine feature boundaries.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref></sup> The third
approach is to use a function, such as a Savitzky–Golay filter,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref></sup> to smooth a trace locally and
use local minima to determine feature boundaries in the trace.</p>
    <p>Reported features are in general evaluated by their peak intensities,
peak <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> errors, and RT ranges.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref></sup> The quality of envelope features is also determined
by the similarity of theoretical and experimental isotopic peak intensity
distributions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref></sup> Recently, deep learning
methods have been proposed to evaluate envelope features.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref></sup></p>
    <p>Feature detection in top-down MS is more
challenging than in bottom-up
MS, as top-down mass spectra tend to have higher charge state ions,
more complex isotopic envelopes, and more overlapping envelopes than
bottom-up spectra. As a result, feature detection methods designed
for bottom-up MS may fail to achieve good performance for top-down
MS.</p>
    <p>Several methods have been proposed for feature detection
in top-down
MS, e.g., Xtract,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref></sup> ProMex,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref></sup> and FlashDeconv.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref></sup> ProMex uses a greedy
algorithm to cluster isotopic envelopes of the same proteoform across
MS1 scans. The peak intensities in the experimental envelopes of a
proteoform are aggregated to reduce the measurement errors between
theoretical and experimental isotopic distributions. The elution profile
of each proteoform feature is constructed and smoothed by a Savitzky–Golay
filter. Finally, the RT range is obtained using 1% of the apex intensity
as the signal intensity cutoff. The quality of each feature is evaluated
by a likelihood ratio function based on a Bayesian network model.
In FlashDeconv,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref></sup> candidate features are
identified by searching a mass spectrum for peak groups that are generated
from proteoform molecules with the same mass and different charge
states. The RT range of a feature is determined by a mass trace detection
algorithm, in which features are extended along RT, and feature boundaries
are found using a smoothing method.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref></sup> A
feature is evaluated by fitting a Gaussian distribution to the peak
intensities with different charge states and computing the cosine
similarity between the fitted and experimental intensities. The methods
in Xtract have not been published.</p>
    <p>In this paper, we propose
TopFD, a method for proteoform feature
detection in top-down MS, in which the functions in MS-Deconv<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref></sup> are employed to identify feature candidates,
and RT boundaries of feature signals are determined using local minima
of envelope traces. In addition, a neural network model that takes
eight attributes of proteoform features as the input was trained for
feature evaluation. TopFD was extensively assessed and compared with
ProMex,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref></sup> FlashDeconv,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref></sup> and Xtract using seven top-down MS data sets (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.analchem.2c05244/suppl_file/ac2c05244_si_001.pdf">Supporting Methods S1</ext-link>). Experimental results
demonstrated that TopFD outperforms these tools in the accuracy, reproducibility
of proteoform feature detection, and reproducibility of proteoform
quantification.</p>

    <title>Methods</title>
    <p>In an LC-MS experiment, the start, apex, and
end RTs of a proteoform
are determined by the separation column, the experimental parameters,
and the chemical and physical properties of the proteoform. An MS1
spectrum collected during the RT range of a proteoform contains peaks
of the proteoform, which can be grouped into one or several isotopic
envelopes based on their charge states (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref></xref>b). The set of all isotopic envelopes of
a proteoform with a specific charge state in the LC-MS map is an envelope
set (single charge feature) of the proteoform. The collection of the
envelope sets of the proteoform for all charge states is the envelope
collection (multicharge feature) of the proteoform. The proteoform
feature detection problem aims to find all envelope collections in
an LC-MS map and report the monoisotopic mass, RT range, and abundance
of each envelope collection (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref></xref>c).</p>

      <p><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref> shows the overall scheme of TopFD for proteoform
feature detection. In preprocessing, TopFD filters out noise peaks
in an LC-MS map and then uses the functions in MS-Deconv<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref></sup> to identify experimental isotopic envelopes
of proteoforms in single MS1 spectra. A theoretical isotopic envelope
is computed for each experimental isotopic envelope using the Averagine
model.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref></sup> The reported isotopic envelopes
are ranked based on their total peak intensities and then used iteratively
as seed envelopes for feature detection (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.analchem.2c05244/suppl_file/ac2c05244_si_001.pdf">Supporting Methods S2</ext-link>).</p>

          <p>Overview of the pipeline for proteoform feature identification
in TopFD. (a) Preprocessing. Experimental centroided peaks are processed
to remove those that have a low intensity or appear in only one MS1
spectrum. Then, MS-Deconv is used to deconvolute MS1 spectra to obtain
seed envelopes. (b) Proteoform feature extraction. (1) The reported
seed envelopes are ranked based on the sum of the peak intensities
of the theoretical envelope. The one with the highest intensity is
selected. (2) To extract an envelope set, peaks in the seed theoretical
envelope are matched with experimental peaks and extended in both
forward and backward directions until no matching experimental peaks
are found. (3) The RT boundaries of the reported envelope set are
refined if it contains peaks from neighboring envelope sets. (4) The
charge state of the envelope set is evaluated and corrected if needed.
(5) Once an envelope set is extracted, the neighboring charge states
are explored to find other envelope sets in the envelope collection.
(6) The experimental peaks included in the envelope collection are
removed from the data. The six steps are repeated for the next seed
envelope, which has the highest intensity in the remaining seed list.
(c) Postprocessing. The precursor masses of reported envelope collections
are first refined. Envelope collections are then merged if they have
similar precursor masses and similar retention time ranges. Finally,
an ECScore is computed for each envelope collection and those with
low ECScore are removed.</p>

      </fig>
      <p>In feature detection, TopFD first extends a seed
envelope to neighboring
MS1 scans to obtain an envelope set, then the RT boundaries and charge
state of the envelope set are adjusted. Next, the envelope set is
extended to identify envelope sets with the same precursor mass and
neighboring charge states, resulting in an envelope collection. Finally,
peaks used in the envelope collection in the LC-MS map will be removed
or reduced (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.analchem.2c05244/suppl_file/ac2c05244_si_001.pdf">Supporting Methods S3</ext-link>).</p>
      <p>In postprocessing, the precursor mass of each envelope collection
is refined using its isotopic peaks, and then envelope collections
with similar precursor masses and RTs are merged. Finally, a neural
network model is used to assign an envelope collection score (ECScore)
to each envelope collection, and those with low ECScore are removed

of envelope collections for training ECScore was generated from three
top-down MS data sets: one from SW480 cells with triplicates and the
other two from breast cancer (BC) samples, each with six replicates
(<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.analchem.2c05244/suppl_file/ac2c05244_si_001.pdf">Supporting Methods S1</ext-link>). On average, 21
190 envelope collections were reported from each SW480 replicate and
1765 from each BC replicate (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.analchem.2c05244/suppl_file/ac2c05244_si_001.pdf">Supporting Table S2</ext-link>) using the methods for envelope collection identification
(<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>) with the
default parameter settings (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.analchem.2c05244/suppl_file/ac2c05244_si_001.pdf">Supporting Table S3</ext-link>). Note that all envelope collections reported from the three data
sets were used for generating training and validation data sets. We
labeled the envelope collections identified from the first SW480 replicate,
and the first replicate of each BC data set as follows: An envelope
collection was labeled negative if it was reported in only the first
replicate and labeled positive if it was reported in all of the three
SW480 replicates or ≥5 BC replicates. The unlabeled envelope
collections were removed. A total of 8579 envelope collections were
labeled positive, and 10 876 were negative. We randomly split the
envelope collections with a 67:33 ratio into training and validation
sets. There was no overlap among the training set, validation set,
and test data sets used in the following experiments. We trained the
ECScore model using the training set (<xref rid="sec2" ref-type="other">Methods</xref> section), and ECScore achieved a balanced accuracy of 87.03% and
the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC)
value of 94.18% on the validation data set. The default cutoff of
ECScore was set to 0.5 for filtering out low-quality envelope collections
because the ECScore distributions of the validation envelope collections
show that the cutoff value can efficiently separate positive envelope
collections from negative ones (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.analchem.2c05244/suppl_file/ac2c05244_si_001.pdf">Supporting Figure S1a</ext-link>). With the cutoff of 0.5, the estimated false discovery
rate (FDR) of reported envelope collections is 16.4% in the validation
set (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.analchem.2c05244/suppl_file/ac2c05244_si_001.pdf">Supporting Figure S1b</ext-link>), which is acceptable
because protein database search-based proteoform identification will
remove most false-positive features in downstream analysis. In addition,
the FDR may be overestimated due to inaccurate labeling of negative
envelope collections.</p>

      <title>Comparison of ECScore and EnvCNN</title>
      <p>We compared the accuracy
of ECScore and the EnvCNN score<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">32</xref></sup> on two
top-down MS data sets: one from SW620 cells with three replicates
and the other from ovarian cancer (OC) samples with 10 replicates
(<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.analchem.2c05244/suppl_file/ac2c05244_si_001.pdf">Supporting Methods S1</ext-link>). Using the methods
in the previous section, we labeled the envelope collections reported
from the first replicates of the SW620 and OC data. An envelope collection
was labeled negative if it was reported in only one replicate and
labeled positive if it was reported in all three SW620 replicates
or ≥8 OC replicates. This resulted in an SW620 test set of
8376 positive and 3175 negative envelope collections and an OC test
set of 6223 positive and 304 negative envelope collections. Because
the EnvCNN model takes single isotopic envelopes, not envelope collections,
as the input, all test envelope collections were converted to aggregate
experiment envelopes (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.analchem.2c05244/suppl_file/ac2c05244_si_001.pdf">Supporting Methods S3.3</ext-link>), which were used as the input of the EnvCNN model.</p>
      <p>ECScore
achieved higher ROC AUC values (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.analchem.2c05244/suppl_file/ac2c05244_si_001.pdf">Supporting Figure S2</ext-link>) than the EnvCNN score on the OC test set (91.52 vs 83.79%)
and the SW620 test set (80.56 vs 61.83%). We also compared the rank-sum
values of the two scoring functions on the OC and SW620 test sets.
To compute the rank-sum of a list of envelope collections, all envelope
collections were ranked in the decreasing order of their scores, and
the ranks of all positive envelope collections were summed up. ECScore
reduced the rank-sum values compared with the EnvCNN score on the
OC data set (2.02 × 10<sup>8</sup> vs 2.18 × 10<sup>8</sup>) and the SW620 data set (1.42 × 10<sup>8</sup> vs 1.67 ×
10<sup>8</sup>).</p>

      <title>Evaluation Using a Protein Mixture</title>
      <p>The accuracy of
TopFD in determining proteoform monoisotopic masses and charge states
was assessed using a top-down LC-MS/MS data of a five-protein mixture:
bovine ubiquitin (8559.62 Da), bovine superoxide dismutase (15 581.78
Da), equine myoglobin (16 941.96 Da), bovine trypsinogen (23 965.49
Da), and bovine carbonic anhydrase (29 006.82 Da) (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.analchem.2c05244/suppl_file/ac2c05244_si_001.pdf">Supporting Methods S1</ext-link>). TopFD identified the proteoform features
of all of the five proteins, demonstrating that TopFD can accurately
identify proteoform features with a mass &lt;30 kDa (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.analchem.2c05244/suppl_file/ac2c05244_si_001.pdf">Supporting Tables S4 and S5</ext-link>). The identified features of the
last four proteins contained PTMs. The charge states of the seed envelopes
of the features ranged from 11 to 33. The errors of reported monoisotopic
masses were ≤0.06 Da for the first four proteoforms, and the
error of the bovine carbonic anhydrase proteoform was 1.04 Da, which
is a common ±1 Da error in spectral deconvolution.</p>
      <p>TopFD
relies on isotopic peaks of proteoforms for feature detection, so
it can deconvolute only isotopically resolvable proteoforms. The <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> difference between two neighboring
isotopic peaks of a proteoform with a charge state <italic>z</italic> is about 1.00235/<italic>z</italic>, where 1.00235 Da is an estimated
mass difference between two isotopologues whose numbers of neutrons
differ by one.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">33</xref></sup> When the mass spectrometer
cannot resolve such two isotopic peaks, TopFD will fail to correctly
report the charge state and monoisotopic mass of the proteoform feature.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec3.4">
      <title>Evaluation of Overlapping Features</title>
      <p>To evaluate the
performance of TopFD on overlapping features, we extracted the peaks
of the proteoform feature of bovine ubiquitin in the five-protein
mixture data and used the peaks to generate simulated proteoform features
with shifts in <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> value and RT.
Specifically, we obtained all peaks in the LC-MS window defined by
the <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> range [693, 697] and RT
range [24, 27] min, which contained an envelope set of bovine ubiquitin
with charge state 7. The set of all peaks, denoted as <italic>E</italic><sub>0,0</sub>, was used to generate a total of 90 simulated LC-MS
windows <italic>E</italic><sub><italic>i</italic>,<italic>j</italic></sub> for <italic>i</italic> = 0, ···, 9 and <italic>j</italic> = 1, ··· , 9. To generate <italic>E</italic><sub><italic>i</italic>,<italic>j</italic></sub> from <italic>E</italic><sub>0,0</sub>, we shifted the RTs of all peaks by <italic>j</italic> MS1 scans and the <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> values of
all peaks by <italic>i</italic> shift units (each unit is 1.00235/7).
That is, the monoisotopic mass of the feature was shifted by 1.00235<italic>i</italic> Da. For each <italic>E</italic><sub><italic>i</italic>,<italic>j</italic></sub>, we generated a simulated LC-MS map containing
only peaks in <italic>E</italic><sub>0,0</sub> and <italic>E</italic><sub><italic>i,j</italic></sub>, and then merged all peaks with similar <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> values (with an error tolerance of
0.01 <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic>) in the same scan. The
intensity of a merged peak was set to the sum of the intensities of
all peaks being merged. As a result, the map contained two overlapping
features with known proteoform monoisotopic masses. TopFD successfully
identified the monoisotopic masses of the two features (some with
±1 Da or ±2 Da errors) in the LC-MS maps with ≥6
shifted <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> units or ≥5 shifted
scans (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.analchem.2c05244/suppl_file/ac2c05244_si_001.pdf">Supporting Figure S3</ext-link>), showing that
TopFD can identify overlapping features when they are slightly separated
by the <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> value or RT.</p>

      <title>Evaluation of the Artifacts of Reported Proteoform Features</title>
      <p>Following the methods in Jeong et al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref></sup> we assessed the quality of proteoform features reported by feature
detection tools using three types of artifact masses: low harmonic
masses, high harmonic masses, and isotopologues. Incorrect charge
state assignments to isotopic envelopes will result in low and high
harmonics masses, which are integer fractions and multiples of true
masses of proteoforms, respectively. Errors in computing the monoisotopic
masses of envelope collections will introduce isotopologues, which
are shifted by the mass of one or several neutrons compared with true
masses.</p>
      <p>An envelope collection <italic>A</italic> is a mass
artifact of another envelope collection <italic>B</italic> if (1)
the total peak intensity of <italic>B</italic> is higher than <italic>A</italic>, (2) the overlapping RT range of <italic>A</italic> and <italic>B</italic> is larger than 80% of the RT range of <italic>A</italic>, and (3) the monoisotopic mass of <italic>A</italic> is an isotopologue,
low harmonic mass, or high harmonic mass of the monoisotopic mass
of <italic>B</italic> (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.analchem.2c05244/suppl_file/ac2c05244_si_001.pdf">Supporting Methods S5</ext-link>). An envelope collection is valid if it is not a mass artifact of
another envelope.</p>
      <p>We benchmarked TopFD, ProMex (version 1.1.8082),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref></sup> FlashDeconv (version 2.0),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref></sup> and Xtract (Thermo BioPharma Finder 4.1)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref></sup> in the ratio of valid proteoform features using the first OC replicate
and the first SW620 replicate. Parameter settings, running times,
and numbers of reported proteoform features of the tools are given
in <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.analchem.2c05244/suppl_file/ac2c05244_si_001.pdf">Supporting Tables S3, S6–S8, Figure S4, and Table S9</ext-link>, respectively. Valid masses were selected
for each software tool separately. After a tool reported a list of
proteoform masses from a data set, the method in Jeong et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref></sup> was employed to choose valid masses from the
mass list for the tool. For each tool, we ranked the reported proteoform
features based on their total peak intensities, obtained the corresponding
mass artifacts and valid features, and plotted the ratio of the valid
ones against the number of top features. We chose total peak intensities,
not software tool-specific scores, to rank features to ensure a fair
comparison of the tools. Proteoform features reported by TopFD achieved
the best valid ratios (&gt;80%) among the four tools (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref></xref>a,d). The valid ratios for
Xtract and FlashDeconv are also high, and the distributions of the
three types of artifacts are similar for TopFD, FlashDeconv, and Xtract
(<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref></xref>b,c,e,f).
ProMex reported many isotopologues, resulting in low valid percentages.
We used Fisher’s exact test to compare valid and invalid (mass
artifacts) proteoform features reported by TopFD and FlashDeconv as
these two outperformed Xtract and ProMex. The <italic>p</italic>-values
for the differences between proteoform features reported by TopFD

      <title>Comparison between Total Ion Currents (TICs) and Feature Intensities</title>
      <p>While the TIC of an MS1 scan depicts the number of ions detected
by the scan, the total peak intensity of reported proteoform features
for an MS1 scan gives the number of ions reported by feature detection
tools. These two measurements are expected to be consistent with each
other. So following the method in Jeong et al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref></sup> we compared the TICs and total feature intensities reported
by the four tools.</p>
      <p>To evaluate the correlation between TICs
and proteoform feature intensities, we divided the RT range of an
MS data set into 1 min RT bins and computed the TIC and total proteoform
feature intensity for each bin. The TIC of an RT bin is the sum of
the total TIC of all MS1 scans in the bin; the total proteoform feature
intensity of an RT bin is the sum of the intensities of the proteoform
features whose apex RTs are in the bin. All mass artifacts were removed
before the computation of total proteoform feature intensities. The
total feature intensities reported by TopFD achieved the best similarity
with the TICs on the OC and SW620 data sets (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.analchem.2c05244/suppl_file/ac2c05244_si_001.pdf">Supporting Figures S5 and S6</ext-link>). For the first OC replicate, the cosine
similarity scores between the two measurements are 78.04, 77.46, 77.40,
and 61.37% for TopFD, ProMex, FlashDeconv, and Xtract, respectively

the first SW620 replicate, the cosine similarities are 74.65, 23.61,
73.68, and 67.67% for TopFD, ProMex, FlashDeconv, and Xtract, respectively

      <p>The software
tools reported different feature intensities due to
missing envelope sets. We compared the feature intensities reported
by the tools in the RT range [114, 115] min of the first OC replicate.
TopFD, ProMex, FlashDeconv, and Xtract reported total feature intensities
of 1.3 × 10<sup>9</sup>, 1.65 × 10<sup>8</sup>, 7.6 ×
10<sup>8</sup>, and 1.49 × 10<sup>8</sup>, respectively. TopFD
reported 214 envelope sets (from 52 features) from the RT range, whereas

      <title>Reproducibility of Proteoform Features in MS Replicates</title>
      <p>We benchmarked the feature reproducibility of TopFD against ProMex,
FlashDeconv, and Xtract on the OC and SW620 data sets (see the <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.analchem.2c05244/suppl_file/ac2c05244_si_001.pdf">Supporting Material</ext-link>). In MS technical replicates,
a true proteoform feature is expected to be observed in all of the
replicates, so the frequencies of proteoform features reported from
MS technical replicates are a good metric for evaluating proteoform
features.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref></sup> Because mass artifact removal
can improve the quality of reported proteoform features, we removed
mass artifacts from proteoform features reported by the tools.</p>
      <p>We first examined the overlapping features and proteoform mass distributions
reported by the four tools in the first OC and SW620 replicates. The
four tools reported different numbers of proteoform features from
each MS data file (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.analchem.2c05244/suppl_file/ac2c05244_si_001.pdf">Supporting Figure 7a,b</ext-link>). TopFD, ProMex, FlashDeconv, and Xtract reported 7672, 5811, 6067,
and 7773 features in the first OC replicate and 11 552, 3025, 12 240,
and 8322 features in the first SW620 replicate, respectively. The
two data sets have different distributions of feature masses (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.analchem.2c05244/suppl_file/ac2c05244_si_001.pdf">Supporting Figure 8a,b</ext-link>). The most observed masses
reported by TopFD are between 3 and 4.5 kDa for the OC data and between
1.5 and 3 kDa for the SW620 data. Of the 7672 TopFD features from
the OC data, 3233 (42.1%) are shared with all of the other three tools
and 6164 (80.1%) are shared with at least one of the three tools.
Of the 11 552 TopFD features from the SW620 data, 1535 (13.3%) are
shared with all of the other three tools and 7707 (66.7%) are shared
with at least one of the three tools. The low overlap for the SW620
data may indicate high false-positive rates of the reported features
due to the high complexity of the data.</p>
      <p>We further studied the
overlapping features and proteoform mass
distributions in the same number of top features reported by the four
tools in the first OC and SW620 replicates. For each data file, we
selected the top <italic>n</italic> features from each of the four
feature lists provided by the tools, where <italic>n</italic> is the
smallest size among the four feature lists (<italic>n</italic> = 5811
for OC and 3025 for SW620). Note that this method was used to keep
only top features for all replicates in the following evaluation of
proteoform feature reproducibility. These top features have higher
percentages of overlapping features (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.analchem.2c05244/suppl_file/ac2c05244_si_001.pdf">Supporting Figure 7c,d</ext-link>) compared with all reported features. Of the top
TopFD features from the OC data, 2932 (50.5%) are shared with all
of the other three tools and 5071 (87.3%) are shared with at least
one of the three tools. Of the top TopFD features from the SW620 data,
507 (16.8%) are shared with all of the other three tools and 2382
(78.7%) are shared with at least one of the three tools. The proteoform
mass distributions of the top features reported by TopFD (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.analchem.2c05244/suppl_file/ac2c05244_si_001.pdf">Supporting Figure 8c,d</ext-link>) are similar to those
in all of the features.</p>
      <p>We investigated the reproducibility
of the four tools on the first
two replicates of the OC and SW620 data sets. We kept only the top
features in each of the four feature lists reported by the tools from
each replicate to make sure that the same number of features were
used for comparison: OC replicate 1: 5811, OC replicate 2: 5819, SW620
replicate 1: 3025, SW620 replicate 2: 2984. TopFD reported the highest
percentage (4781, 83.82%) of proteoform features shared in the two
OC replicates compared with ProMex (4327, 74.46%), FlashDeconv (3803,
65.44%), and Xtract (3841, 66.09%). TopFD also outperformed other
tools in feature reproductivity on the first two SW620 replicates.
A total of 75.86% proteoform features reported by TopFD (2295 out
of 3025) were observed in both SW620 replicates, which was better
than ProMex (2028, 67.04%), FlashDeconv (1850, 61.15%), and Xtract
(1994, 65.19%).</p>
      <p>We further extended the feature reproducibility
analysis to the
10 replicates of the OC data and three replicates of the SW620 data.
Similarly, we kept only the top features in valid feature lists reported
by the tools to make sure the same number of features were used for
each replicate. On average, 6034 features were used for each of the
OC replicates and 3048 for each of the SW620 replicates (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.analchem.2c05244/suppl_file/ac2c05244_si_001.pdf">Supporting Table S10</ext-link>). For each tool, the features
reported from the first replicate (5811 for OC and 3025 for SW620)
were compared with those reported from other replicates to obtain
their numbers of occurrences. TopFD reported the highest number (3546
out of 5811) of proteoform features reported in all 10 replicates
of the OC data set (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.analchem.2c05244/suppl_file/ac2c05244_si_001.pdf">Supporting Figure S9a</ext-link>) and the highest percentage (77.66%) of proteoform features in 8
or more replicates compared with ProMex (65.96%), FlashDeconv (57.76%),
and Xtract (62.14%). Similarly, TopFD outperformed the other tools
in feature reproductivity on the SW620 data set (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.analchem.2c05244/suppl_file/ac2c05244_si_001.pdf">Supporting Figure S9b</ext-link>). A total of 66.47% proteoform features
reported by TopFD were observed in all three replicates, which was
better than ProMex (57.45%), FlashDeconv (47.80%), and Xtract (55.63%).
As ProMex achieved the best performance among the other tools, we
utilized Kolmogorov–Smirnov test<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34">34</xref></sup> to compare the distributions of feature observation frequencies
between TopFD and ProMex. The <italic>p</italic>-values are 4.64 ×
10<sup>–35</sup> and 3.87 × 10<sup>–11</sup> for
the distribution differences in the OC and SW620 data sets, respectively,
showing that TopFD can report a significantly larger number of reproducible
features compared with other tools.</p>

      <title>Quantitative Reproducibility</title>
      <p>We benchmarked the four
tools in the reproducibility of proteoform abundances using the top
valid features (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.analchem.2c05244/suppl_file/ac2c05244_si_001.pdf">Supporting Table S10</ext-link>) reported
from the OC and SW620 data sets. High-accuracy proteoform feature
detection is essential for increasing the reproducibility of proteoform
abundances measured in MS replicates. To compare the abundance reproducibility
between two replicates for a tool, we obtained the overlapping top
valid features reported by the tool in the replicates and computed
the Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) of the log-abundances of
the overlapping features. We first compared the quantitative reproducibility
of the four tools using the first two replicates of the OC and SW620
data sets. For the OC data, TopFD reported a PCC of 98.12% while ProMex,
FlashDeconv, and Xtract reported 96.57, 94.97, and 94.37%, respectively.
For the SW620 data, TopFD, ProMex, FlashDeconv, and Xtract reported
similar PCC values of 94.42, 94.19, 94.70, and 92.13%, respectively.
We further extended the PCC analysis to all of the replicates in the
OC and SW620 data sets. TopFD reported better proteoform abundance
reproducibility compared with other tools, thus indicating good reproducibility
in proteoform quantification on the OC (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.analchem.2c05244/suppl_file/ac2c05244_si_001.pdf">Supporting Figure S10</ext-link>) and SW620 (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.analchem.2c05244/suppl_file/ac2c05244_si_001.pdf">Supporting Figure S11</ext-link>) data sets.</p>

      <title>Feature Reproducibility in Different Mass Ranges</title>
      <p>We
first compared the feature reproducibility of the four tools in different
mass ranges using the first two replicates of the OC and SW620 data
sets. We divided the top valid features reported by each tool into
the mass ranges [0, 1.5k], [1.5k, 3k], [3k, 4.5k], [4.5k, 6k], [6k,
7.5k], and [7.5k, 100k] Da. Using the methods described in the previous
sections, we compared overlapping proteoform features and proteoform
quantitative reproducibility of the four tools in each mass range.
TopFD reported the highest overlapping feature ratios in all mass
ranges compared with other tools in the two data sets except for the
range [7.5k, 100k] in the SW620 (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.analchem.2c05244/suppl_file/ac2c05244_si_001.pdf">Supporting Figure S12</ext-link>). The reason is that the ratio might not be correctly estimated
due to the small number (11) of proteoform features reported by TopFD
in the range. TopFD also achieved a slightly better PCC for reported
proteoform abundances in most mass ranges in the two data sets (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.analchem.2c05244/suppl_file/ac2c05244_si_001.pdf">Supporting Figure S13</ext-link>).</p>

      <title>Comparison between Technical Replicates and Biological Replicates</title>
      <p>We further compared the feature reproducibility in technical and

to identify proteoform features from three runs of the data set: SP11
(technical replicate 1 of biological replicate 1), SP21 (technical
replicate 2 of biological replicate 1), and SP12 (technical replicate
1 of biological replicate 2) using the parameters in <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.analchem.2c05244/suppl_file/ac2c05244_si_001.pdf">Supporting Table S3</ext-link>, and mass artifacts were removed from
the proteoform features reported by TopFD. The features (1726) reported
from SP11 were compared with those reported from SP21 and SP12 separately
to evaluate feature reproducibility between technical and biological
replicates. TopFD obtained a reproducibility of 51.39% (887 of 1726)
for the proteoform features reported from the two technical replicates
and a reproducibility of 40.90% (706 of 1726) for features reported
from the two biological replicates. The correlation of the proteoform
log-abundances reported by TopFD was 90.90% for the technical replicates,
which was better than the correlation (80.21%) for the biological
replicates.</p>

    <title>Conclusions and Discussion</title>
    <p>In this paper, we proposed
TopFD, a software tool for top-down
MS feature detection that integrates algorithms for proteoform feature
detection, feature boundary refinement, and machine learning models
for proteoform feature evaluation. Using a standard protein mix, we
demonstrated that TopFD can accurately report proteoform features.
We further demonstrated TopFD’s ability to parse overlapping
envelopes using a simulated data set. An extensive benchmarking of
TopFD, ProMex, FlashDeconv, and Xtract using several top-down MS data
sets demonstrated that TopFD outperforms other tools in feature accuracy,
reproducibility, and feature abundance reproducibility. In comparison
with other tools, TopFD also reported fewer artifacts and reported
feature intensities had the highest correlation with total ion current.</p>
    <p>Accurate proteoform feature detection in top-down MS is essential
for proteoform quantification. Proteoform feature detection results
show that more than 61% of features reported from one replicate are
observed in all three replicates of the SW620 data and all 10 replicates
of the OC data, and the PCCs of proteoform abundances between MS replicates
are higher than 94%. This level of reproducibility makes it possible
to identify differentially expressed proteoforms in two types of samples
in proteome-wide top-down MS studies.</p>
    <p>Accurate precursor monoisotopic
mass calculation in top-down MS
is indispensable for identifying PTMs and other alterations in proteoforms.
Proteoform feature detection tools often report monoisotopic masses
of features with ±1 Da errors due to noise in measured isotopic
peak intensities in experimental envelopes and errors in isotopic
peak intensities in theoretical envelopes. Following the method in
Park et al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref></sup> TopFD aggregates isotopic
envelopes in an envelope collection to improve the accuracy of experimental
isotopic peak intensities. The errors in theoretical peak intensities
are mainly introduced by the difference between the chemical composition
of the proteoform and that computed based on the Averagine model.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref></sup> To address this problem, a postprocessing step
can be employed to recalculate the theoretical isotopic peak intensities
when the proteoform sequence of the feature is identified and its
chemical composition is known.</p>
    <p>ECScore in TopFD outperforms
the EnvCNN score<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">32</xref></sup> for computing confidence
scores for identified envelope
collections, showing that neural network-based models have the potential
to improve the accuracy in proteoform feature detection. ECScore is
based on a simple fully connected neural network with eight attributes
of envelope collections as the input. As complex neural network models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref></sup> have been successfully used for peptide feature
detections in bottom-up MS, a future research direction is to employ
deep learning models to solve various problems in proteoform feature
detection, such as feature boundary detection and scores of envelope
collections, and use these models to further improve the accuracy
in proteoform feature detection.</p>
    <p>There are still many challenging
problems in proteoform feature
detection, like feature boundary detection and the identification
of overlapping proteoform features and low abundance features. TopFD
identifies overlapping proteoform features by comparing isotopic peak
intensities in experimental and theoretical envelopes. If there is
a significant difference between the intensities of a pair of matched
experimental and theoretical peaks, the experimental peak is treated
as an overlapping peak. TopFD relies on seed envelopes for proteoform
feature identification and may fail to find seed envelopes for low
abundance features. Deep learning models are promising to provide
better solutions for identifying overlapping features and low abundance
features.</p>
