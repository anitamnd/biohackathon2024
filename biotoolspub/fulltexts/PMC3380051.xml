    <abstract>
      <p>Using a combination of genomic and post-genomic approaches is rapidly altering the number of identified human influx carriers. A transmembrane protein bilitranslocase (TCDB 2.A.65) has long attracted attention because of its function as an organic anion carrier. It has also been identified as a potential membrane transporter for cellular uptake of several drugs and due to its implication in drug uptake, it is extremely important to advance the knowledge about its structure. However, at present, only the primary structure of bilitranslocase is known. In our work, transmembrane subunits of bilitranslocase were predicted by a previously developed chemometrics model and the stability of these polypeptide chains were studied by molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. Furthermore, sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) micelles were used as a model of cell membrane and herein we present a high-resolution 3D structure of an 18 amino acid residues long peptide corresponding to the third transmembrane part of bilitranslocase obtained by use of multidimensional NMR spectroscopy. It has been experimentally confirmed that one of the transmembrane segments of bilitranslocase has alpha helical structure with hydrophilic amino acid residues oriented towards one side, thus capable of forming a channel in the membrane.</p>

    <title>Introduction</title>
    <p>Bilitranslocase (BTL) is a plasma membrane protein functioning as an organic anion carrier. It is found in liver cell membranes being involved in the uptake of bilirubin from blood to liver cells <xref rid="pone.0038967-Passamonti1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0038967-Passamonti3" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. BTL is also expressed in other tissues including the vascular endothelium <xref rid="pone.0038967-Maestro1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0038967-Ziberna2" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref> or epithelia of the gastric mucosa <xref rid="pone.0038967-Nicolin1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. It has been shown that BTL has an active role in the transport of many organic anions through the cell membrane <xref rid="pone.0038967-Maestro1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0038967-Vanzo1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0038967-uperl1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Therefore, it is also likely to be involved in the drug uptake, since carrier-mediated and active uptake of pharmaceutical drugs may be more common than is usually assumed, and should be considered as an essential step in rational drug discovery and development as reviewed in a recent perspective by Dobson and Kell <xref rid="pone.0038967-Dobson1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Thus, it is of significant importance for the drug discovery process to understand at a mechanistic level the specificities of a known drug transporter for both drugs already in clinical use and potential drug candidates in development. An atomic resolution protein structure is needed for any detailed study of the drug-protein interactions and consequently for illuminating the mechanism of transport. Unfortunately, very few transmembrane proteins have their 3D structure solved using X-ray crystallography or NMR methods; less than 2% of solved structures in the PDB database can be ascribed to membrane proteins <xref rid="pone.0038967-Berman1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0038967-Tusnady1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. The main experimental obstacle is low ability of membrane proteins to form a crystal structure, and even when soluble their inability of isotropic reorientation might prevent a suitable experimental approach using NMR spectroscopy <xref rid="pone.0038967-Opella1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Slow reorientation is the principal reason why it is difficult to obtain high resolution spectra of proteins incorporated in micelles or small bicelles. For this reason, it is crucial to select a proper solution medium for NMR studies of membrane proteins. Choice of detergent is empirical and protein-specific, and has to be optimized during the sample preparation procedure <xref rid="pone.0038967-Kim1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. The solid state NMR technique is suitable to proteins of higher molecular weight, because in contrast to the solution state, the coherence lifetimes in the solid state are not affected by molecular tumbling <xref rid="pone.0038967-Linser1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>.</p>
    <p>Disappointingly, BTL is very problematic for experimental determination of its 3D structure although its primary structure has been available for some time <xref rid="pone.0038967-Lunazzi1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. BTL (UniProt O88750) consists of 340 amino acids with presumably four transmembrane regions which have not, however, been absolutely confirmed by neither experimental nor computational methods <xref rid="pone.0038967-Passamonti4" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0038967-RoyChoudhury1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. The amino-acid sequence of BTL displays no homology with known proteins, which makes it difficult to use a standard homology modeling approach in case of proteins with an unknown 3D structure. It is also not clear whether the BTL is present in the membrane as a monomer, or whether two or even three units should be associated for enabling active transport across the cell membrane <xref rid="pone.0038967-Passamonti6" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>.</p>
    <p>Having in mind the considerable interest for resolving the 3D structure of BTL on one side and all difficulties regarding parsimonious experimental data on the other, we have employed the chemometrics approach to predict the four alpha helical transmembrane subunits of BTL, which is in agreement with sparse available experimental data based on affinity-purified anti-sequence antibodies <xref rid="pone.0038967-Passamonti5" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Molecular dynamics (MD) studies are used successfully to gain insight into the protein folding problem, biological function of the protein structure and in studies of ligand-protein interaction <xref rid="pone.0038967-Elofsson1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0038967-Duong1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. In the present work the initially predicted transmembrane regions of BTL have been reexamined and we substantiated that 3D structure of one of the transmembrane peptides (TM 3) is alpha helical by MD simulations in the standard DPPC (dipalmitoyl phosphatidyl choline) membrane. This result was further confirmed by the means of NMR spectroscopic study performed in an SDS (sodium dodecyl sulfate) micelle environment as well. The schematic workflow is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0038967-g001">Figure 1</xref>.</p>

    <p>It is to be stressed that BTL has no homolog in the PDB <xref rid="pone.0038967-Lunazzi1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, and therefore, the conventional theoretical approaches for 3D structure prediction are not feasible in this case. Here we show for the first time 3D structure of one of the alpha helices of BTL spanning the membrane, which has been predicted by computational methods and confirmed experimentally. The other three predicted transmembrane segments of BTL are also in alpha helical conformation during molecular dynamics simulations; and in our subsequent work, we intend to examine the implications of the already resolved transmembrane structure for interactions with other helical peptides of the BTL protein sequence forming the channel and its transport properties for the uptake of drugs.</p>

      <title>Prediction of BTL Transmembrane Regions</title>
      <p>The transmembrane region prediction model <xref rid="pone.0038967-RoyChoudhury1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref> requires dividing the protein sequence into 20 residues long overlapping segments, each of which is then given to the model for prediction. Segmenting a 340 residues long BTL sequence yielded 329 such segments, which were then predicted by the model as either transmembrane or non-transmembrane. Only the long stretches of 10 or more consecutive overlapping segments predicted as transmembrane are considered for the final transmembrane region predictions. In the case of BTL, four such stretches of more than 10 consecutive overlapping segments were predicted as transmembrane, which were then further analyzed. These segments span over the residues 16–53 (19 segments), 65–103 (20 segments), 213–246 (15 segments), and 250–285 (17 segments). However, the whole transmembrane stretch is not reported as a final prediction because the terminal residues overlap with segments predicted as non-transmembrane. Hence, only the central residues of these four overlapping transmembrane segment stretches that are common to more segments predicted as transmembrane are considered and reported as the predicted transmembrane residues (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0038967.s005">Text S1</xref>). Thus, the transmembrane regions of BTL, TM 1, TM 2, TM 3, and TM 4, were accordingly predicted to be at residues 24–45, 73–95, 221–238, 258–277 <xref rid="pone.0038967-RoyChoudhury1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The final stage of transmembrane region prediction includes statistical data obtained from position specific amino acid preference analysis. This was done to fine-tune the transmembrane boundaries. Instead of reporting only the central residues of the overlapping transmembrane segments as final predictions, we considered the residues that are more statistically favored. The terminal residues of all the segments in the transmembrane stretches predicted by the model were considered for this purpose, and were scored based on the statistically generated amino acid preference patterns (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0038967.s006">Text S2</xref>). The position-specific scoring matrix has been already successfully applied in an automated multiple protein sequence alignment to classify proteins to a predefined family, in order to identify related proteins, which was reported in a survey of integral alpha helical membrane proteins <xref rid="pone.0038967-Kelly1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. In our research the best scoring terminal residues were reported as a final prediction if the region bounded by them met the minimum length criteria. In the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0038967.s003">Table S1</xref>, such combinations of terminal residues are listed and scored for the third stretch of transmembrane segments 213–246. The terminals of the segment 220–238 show the highest positive score of 13. Therefore, instead of the segment 221–238, the segment 220–238 with more statistically plausible terminals was now reported as the third transmembrane region of BTL. The other three transmembrane regions were predicted accordingly. Finally, the statistically improved four transmembrane regions of BTL, TM 1A, TM 2A, TM 3A, and TM 4A, were predicted to be at residues 24–48, 75–94, 220–238, and 254–276 respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0038967-g002">Figure 2</xref>). It must be noted that the statistical scoring method was introduced to fine-tune the transmembrane region terminals, and therefore, the central parts of the predicted transmembrane regions remain the same in both the initial and final predictions with only difference at the terminal residues. A comparison of the predicted transmembrane regions with the results from other available predictors was also performed (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0038967.s007">Text S3</xref>) <xref rid="pone.0038967-RoyChoudhury1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Except for three predictors, the other tested predictors failed to predict all of the four proposed transmembrane regions of BTL. In our subsequent molecular dynamics simulations, we have checked the stability of both variants - TM 3 and TM 3A.</p>

      <p>The four transmembrane regions predicted by the chemometric model are in accordance with experimental results from anti-sequence antibody studies that indicate the loops at N-terminus of TM 2 and C-terminus of TM 3 to be extracellular. Antibody A against the residues 65–75, the bilirubin-binding motif, establishes the segment to be extracellular. The bound antibody also inhibits transport function, confirming this sequence motif to be important for substrate binding and transport <xref rid="pone.0038967-Passamonti3" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0038967-Passamonti5" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Immediately next to it is the second proposed transmembrane region TM 2 (75–94) with two of its initial residues overlapping with the two terminal residues of the binding motif. Antibody B against segment 235–246 also shows the segment to be an extracellular one. Further, transport inhibition experiments signify the importance of the segment in transport mechanism <xref rid="pone.0038967-Passamonti3" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0038967-Passamonti6" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. The segment B is located immediately after the third transmembrane region TM 3 (220–238) such that a few of the residues overlap. The observations from prediction model and antibody studies, therefore, indicate that the transporting channel possibly consists of the second (75–94) and third (220–238) transmembrane regions. The extracellular segments immediate to these two transmembrane regions assist in binding and guiding the ligands to the transporting channel. It was also concluded that both the N- and C-terminals of the protein are intracellular <xref rid="pone.0038967-RoyChoudhury1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Owing to the functional importance of the transmembrane regions TM 2 and TM 3, a detailed study of these two transmembrane regions is crucial to understand the structural and functional mechanisms of the transporter BTL.</p>

      <p>The only difference between the two systems is that the TM 3A has an additional BTL amino acid Gly220 constrained to the alpha helical conformation as predicted by the model. The generated alpha helices were subsequently inserted into the membrane. The two additional amino acids that were added on the C-terminal and the N-terminal end of each of the alpha helices served to soften the boundary and enabled both ends of the alpha helix to explore more conformational space. The water molecules located on top and below the lipid bilayer mimicked the extracellular and intracellular compartments.</p>
      <p>After performing the equilibration, the production MD simulations were yielding MD trajectories of the 20 ns length for each system. The produced 20 ns trajectories were first visually inspected for the overall conformational changes from the initial alpha helix structure, and it was revealed that in both systems the alpha helical conformation was retained. High resolution animations for TM 3A system is available in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0038967.s009">Movie S1</xref>.</p>
      <p>Representative snapshots of the alpha helices from the molecular dynamics (MD) simulation in the lipid membrane are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0038967-g003">Figure 3</xref>. Secondary structure was predicted using the STRIDE program available in VMD software suite <xref rid="pone.0038967-Frishman1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. The conformational behavior in time showed comparable overall structure (see animation available in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0038967.s009">Movie S1</xref>). Interestingly, the additional two residues located above and below the predicted alpha helical sequences did not adopt the alpha helical conformation; whereas the both predicted sequences TM 3 and TM 3A displayed highly conserved alpha helical conformation. The presence of proline in the predicted transmembrane sequence (Pro231) resulted in a kink formation in both helices due to the sterical interference with the backbone of the preceding turn inside a helix. This induced a bend of about 20–30° in both TM 3 and TM 3A helices. These observations are in accordance with the literature data and both helices remained stable in these conformations throughout the 20ns MD simulation <xref rid="pone.0038967-Richardson1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. Structural behavior of TM 3A was comparable with the one amino acid shorter TM 3 helix, and thus from the qualitative perspective an additional Gly220 provides also a stable helix in BTL structure within the performed MD simulation times.</p>
      <p>In order to provide initial assessment of the alpha helix stability during the production stage, RMSD values for all backbone atoms initially generated in the alpha helical positions were calculated. Despite reasonably long 20 ns MD simulation runs a caveat must be stated that this simulation time still does not encompass sufficient conformational space necessary for a complete quantitative stability assessment of the helix under study. As during the MD simulation each alpha helix is allowed to move freely within the membrane, the occurring translational motion of the structure would obstruct the interpretation of the RMSD analysis. Thus, the RMSD values were calculated by aligning all conformations of the individual alpha helix to the last MD-generated alpha helix conformation. For the structural alignment, the backbone atoms (C', CA, N) were used for those residues that were chemometrically predicted to form the alpha helix. In addition, the average RMSD values along with standard deviations were calculated for these atoms using the average structure calculated from all the align frames in the MD trajectory (20000 structures) as a reference.</p>
      <p>Calculated RMSD parameters indicate that alpha helix conformations of both TM 3 and TM 3A do not change extensively during the MD simulations, thus retaining the conformations obtained after the equilibration procedure. The average RMSD for helix TM 3 was 0.83 Å with a standard deviation of 0.24 Å (54 aligned atoms), and for the helix TM 3A the average RMSD value was 0.52 Å with the standard deviation of 0.21 Å (57 aligned atoms). We can conclude that a rather uniform and stable RMSD deviation was observed for both cases. To further analyze the conformation movement of the studied systems, RMSD graphs were plotted for both MD trajectories as a function of the simulation time. They are schematically presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0038967-g004">Figure 4</xref> and display a high level of structural integrity during the simulation procedure.</p>

      <p>The analysis of the MD trajectories was further focused on the distribution of the backbone torsion angles φ and ψ for both systems during the MD simulations using the available graphical tools. Whereas the standard Ramachandran plots can efficiently display the φ and ψ backbone torsion angles for each residue in a protein for a single frame only, further extension to three dimensional histograms is useful for viewing the frequency distribution of all dihedral backbone angle values observed during the MD simulation. As only certain values for these angles are allowed in the alpha helical conformation, this provides a way of assessing the integrity of the alpha helical conformation in both simulated systems. The obtained 3D Ramachandran histograms are displayed in the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0038967-g005">Figure 5B</xref> for the backbone angles of those residues that were predicted to be in the alpha helical conformation. The initial φ and ψ torsion angles of −57° and −47°, which were used to constrain the predicted BTL protein sequence to alpha helical conformation, were in line with the experimental observations. In alpha helical conformation the ψ dihedral angle of one residue and the φ dihedral angle of the subsequent residue sum to approximately −105° and that residues in α-helices typically adopt backbone φ and ψ dihedral angles around −60° and −45° respectively <xref rid="pone.0038967-Richardson1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0038967-g005">Figure 5A</xref>, a very uniform and stable distribution of backbone dihedral angles reveal the values of torsion angles typical for the alpha helix structures. Thus, residues that were modeled into the alpha helical conformation retained such conformation throughout of the molecular dynamics simulation of the protein inserted in the DPPC membrane.</p>

      <p>The overall conclusion of our initial MD assessment was that BTL sequences TM 3 and TM 3A predicted by the chemometrics approach to encompass the third transmembrane region of the BTL can adopt a stable alpha helical conformation when inserted into the DPPC membrane during 20 ns MD simulation. The inclusion of Gly220 in TM 3A also enabled the stable conformation of the prolonged alpha helix with virtually all qualitative and quantitative characteristics preserved (RMSD, Ramachandran histogram, secondary structure analysis) compared to the one amino acid shorter TM 3 helix. A subsequent experimental investigation was performed to gain an even more detailed and precise structural insight.</p>

      <p>Detail analysis of the RDF data obtained with Ptraj program in AMBER 11 software suite reveals some conclusions about the positioning of the peptide in the SDS micelle. In particular, there are several residues (Ala225, Ile228, Pro231, Ala233, and Ile234) with the side-chains buried into the hydrophobic part of a micelle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0038967-g009">Figure 9</xref>).

      <title>In Summary, Towards Revealing the Potential Mechanism of Transport of BTL</title>
      <p>Our present study started with the prediction of four transmembrane segments of BTL using the developed chemometrics model. The predictions were fine-tuned using statistical data. The proposed transmembrane regions are also in accordance with the results from previously performed antibody studies <xref rid="pone.0038967-Passamonti5" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0038967-Passamonti6" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. For all predicted segments, we have observed the stability of their 3D structure by MD simulation in a model membrane environment. Both TM 3 and TM 3A were shown to retain stable alpha helical conformation in MD. The experimental NMR results in SDS micelle have also confirmed the alpha-helix structure of one of the helices, TM 3A, the final statistical variant of the third transmembrane region. Furthermore, the orientation of hydrophilic/hydrophobic amino acids in the 18-residues long transmembrane segment TM 3A and the analysis of their radial distribution functions support the hypothesis that it could form a building block of a hydrophilic channel within the membrane. This is in agreement with antibody studies, which along with TM 3, also strongly suggest TM 2 to be an important functional unit in the transport channel formation. The role of TM 1 and TM 4, whether they form the channel functional for transport of hydrophilic molecules, is not yet known. While peptide TM 3 consists mainly of amino acids that are weak or strong electron donors, TM 2 also contains those that are electron acceptors. Both TM 2 and TM 3, however, have aromatic amino acids – phenylalanine and tyrosine - that are weak electron acceptors at their extracellular terminal overlapping with the binding motifs. NMR studies revealed Glu235 of TM 3 to be exposed to the aqueous phase and thus forming the transport channel wall. Glutamic acid is a strong electron donor; and is also forming the substrate-binding region (corresponding to Ab B, residues 235–246) <xref rid="pone.0038967-Passamonti5" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0038967-Passamonti6" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. It is therefore probable that Glu235 plays an important role in substrate binding and transportation through a BTL channel acting as a hydrogen bond acceptor for the substrate molecules. Another amino acid of TM 3 that may potentially play a role in transport mechanism is the nucleophilic Ser229, which is also exposed to the hydrophilic environment. In partial support of this hypothesis are the results of several previous experimental studies <xref rid="pone.0038967-Passamonti7" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, in which the transport of a number of flavonoids as well as nucleotides and nucleosides by BTL were evaluated. The structure - activity correlations of molecules in these series strongly associated the hydrogen bond formation parameters with their experimental transport properties in BTL <xref rid="pone.0038967-Vanzo1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0038967-uperl1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. In our subsequent studies, we plan to analyze the peptide TM 2 and the transport mechanism in detail. We would also like to analyze the inter-relation of the four transmembrane peptides of BTL to get a more detailed picture regarding the structure and functional mechanism of the protein.</p>

When building the initial sequences, two additional amino acids corresponding to the residues located prior to the start (219–220 BTL residues RG for TM 3 system and 218–219 BTL residues GR from the TM 3A system) and subsequent to (239–240 BTL residues QL for both TM 3 and TM 3A systems) the end of the transmembrane helix on the BTL sequences were added on the C-terminal and N-terminal end of TM 3 and TM 3A. These additional amino acid residues were not constrained to the alpha helical conformation.</p>
      <p>For the construction of the lipid-protein systems CHARMM-GUI Membrane builder generator was exploited <xref rid="pone.0038967-Jo1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>. The CHARMM generated alpha helices were first oriented along the principal Z-axis. DPPC lipid molecules were selected to represent the lipid bilayer <xref rid="pone.0038967-Zidar1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>. A rectangular box consisting of two layers of DPPC lipids along with 12 Å thick layers of water molecules above and below the lipids surface was constructed. Based on the system size determined, CHARMM-GUI was used to construct the individual parts such the lipid bilayer around the protein and additional water molecules to fully solvate the system. Each alpha helix was inserted into the membrane using the insertion method, where a protein is inserted into a pre-equilibrated lipid bilayer <xref rid="pone.0038967-Jo1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>. Finally, all building parts were assembled together to form the molecular systems with the size of 18874 (TM 3 system) and 18130 atoms (TM 3A system), respectively.</p>

      <p>In the first two equilibration steps (1–2) the system was simulated twice for 25 ps using the Langevin dynamics along with a 1 fs integration time step. Further four equilibration steps (3–6) were performed with the standard molecular dynamics using leapfrog integration scheme. To reduce the possible problem with the numerical integration with the uncorrelated system, 1 fs time-step was used only in the third step with the total equilibration time of 25 ps. In the next stages of the integration scheme, 2 fs step along with SHAKE algorithm was applied. The simulation times for steps 4–6 were 100 ps long. Production trajectories were generated using a leapfrog integration scheme and 2 fs simulation step using SHAKE algorithm. 20 ns long MD simulation was performed for both TM 3 and TM 3A trajectories.

      <p>Synthetic peptides used in this study were purchased from CASLO Laboratory, Denmark (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.caslo.com">www.caslo.com</ext-link>). The peptide (TM 3) is a lyophilized trifluoroacetate salt with four lysines at the C-terminus with the sequence GSVQCAGLISLPIAIEFTKKKK and purity 93.87%.

      <p>The NMR sample was obtained by making a solution of about 1 mM peptide in partially deuterated water (90%/10% H<sub>2</sub>O/D<sub>2</sub>O) containing about 32 mg of deuterated sodium dodecyl sulfate micelles (SDS-d<sub>25</sub>) (Sigma Aldrich). The concentration of SDS-d<sub>25</sub> exceeded the critical micelle concentration (8.3 mM) and SDS-d<sub>25</sub> : peptide ratio was adjusted to approximately 40∶1 to be sure that the peptides were in micelle bound state. To increase homogeneity of the peptide:micelle complex, the NMR sample was placed into an ultrasound bath for nearly 20 minutes. The pH was measured just before the start of the NMR experiments and its uncorrected value was 6.5.</p>

      <p>3D structure calculations were done using <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>1</sup>H distance constraints evaluated on the base of 2D homonuclear NOESY spectrum acquired with mixing times 120 ms. The manually selected NOESY cross peaks yielded 180 nontrivial distance constraints (107 intraresidual, 58 sequential, and 15 medium range) which were applied for structure solution. The calculation protocol started with generating 200 initial structures created with randomly chosen torsion angles. The calibration of peaks’ volume to distance constraints was done with the CALIBA program in semiautomatic way. Finally, simulated annealing procedure with 10000 steps of molecular dynamic in torsion angle space was performed with the ANNEALING program.

      <title>Construction of Peptide: SDS Complex and Molecular Dynamic Simulations</title>
      <p>Molecular dynamics simulations were carried out with the program AMBER 11 <xref rid="pone.0038967-Case1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>. Micelle preparation was initiated by construction of a single molecule of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) on the basis of previously published parameters <xref rid="pone.0038967-Schweighofer1" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0038967-RodziewiczMotowido1" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref> using united atoms presentation and all bonds in <italic>trans</italic> configuration. According to previously established protocol <xref rid="pone.0038967-Case1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>, a starting model containing 60 monomers of SDS was subjected to minimization in vacuum. Later, minimized micelle was placed in a cubic box enlarged by about 8 Å in each direction that included water molecules. As a result, 7126 water molecules were added to simulated peptide:micelle complex increasing the total number of atoms up to 22458. Finally, a 1 ns simulation was carried out in order to reach an equilibrium density of the entire system. The final density was 1.0080 g/mL which is in agreement with reported experimental value of 1.0093 g/mL for SDS/water solution <xref rid="pone.0038967-Bruce1" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Molecular dynamic procedure was started by positioning the peptide into the simulation box with its center of mass coinciding with that of the micelle. The initial peptide structures were taken from results of calculations with the CYANA program. Owing to micelle spherical symmetry, orientation of the peptide was not important. Taking into account the pH of NMR sample, the side chains of four lysines and N-terminus were defined as protonated, whereas the side chains of one glutamate and C-terminus were negatively charged. The chloride ions were used to neutralize a total charge +3 of the entire system.</p>
      <p>To remove the initial bad contact between the peptide and the micelle core and to prevent penetration of water during equilibration the peptide and bulk water were kept under weak harmonic constraints with force constants of 10 and 5 kcal/(mol×Å), respectively. Those constraints were removed after 20000 steps of minimization (the steepest descent method). Later, the entire system was minimized for 20000 steps without any constraints. Thereafter, the whole complex was subjected to molecular dynamic simulations under the constant pressure and the temperature of 301 K for 5 ns with TAV distance restraints derived from NMR spectroscopy. The interproton distances were introduced with the force constants f = 20 kcal/(mol×Å<sup>2</sup>). The geometry of the peptide groups was kept fixed according to NMR data (all <italic>trans</italic>) with the force constant f = 50 kcal/(mol×rad<sup>2</sup>). MD simulations were performed with a time step 2 fs and 9.0 Å cutoff radius. The coordinates were recorded at 4 ps (2000<sup>th</sup> step) each and 10 conformations obtained in the last steps of MD simulation were chosen for final structure analysis.</p>
      <p>Obtained 3D structures were analyzed with Ptraj program included in the AMBER 11.0 package. To characterize interactions of the peptide with the micelle or aqueous phase, the radial distribution functions for peptide side chains and negatively charged groups, hydrophobic part of the SDS-d<sub>25</sub> micelle and water, were calculated. The presented data were evaluated on the average of over the last 200 ps of MD simulation.</p>
