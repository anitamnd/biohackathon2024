      <p>Cross-linking mass
spectrometry (XL-MS) has become a powerful technique
that enables insights into protein structures and protein interactions.
The development of cleavable cross-linkers has further promoted XL-MS
through search space reduction, thereby allowing for proteome-wide
studies. These new analysis possibilities foster the development of
new cross-linkers, which not every search engine can deal with out
of the box. In addition, some search engines for XL-MS data also struggle
with the validation of identified cross-linked peptides, that is,
false discovery rate (FDR) estimation, as FDR calculation is hampered
by the fact that not only one but two peptides in a single spectrum
have to be correct. We here present our new search engine, MS Annika,
which can identify cross-linked peptides in MS2 spectra from a wide
variety of cleavable cross-linkers. We show that MS Annika provides
realistic estimates of FDRs without the need of arbitrary score cutoffs,
being able to provide on average 44% more identifications at a similar
or better true FDR than comparable tools. In addition, MS Annika can
be used on proteome-wide studies due to fast, parallelized processing
and provides a way to visualize the identified cross-links in protein
3D structures.</p>

    <title>Introduction</title>
    <p>Cross-linking mass
spectrometry (XL-MS) allows for the identification
of protein–protein interactions as well as protein structure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref></sup> Until now, these two problems were tackled by
individual methods that are usually expensive or time-consuming, such
as NMR and X-ray crystallography.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref></sup> Very
recently, computational approaches to estimate protein structures
have shown large potential but remain to be thoroughly evaluated.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref></sup> With the emergence of cross-linking technology,
these two areas of interest can be investigated with one technique.
XL-MS builds atop MS, a field that has reliably produced high-quality
scientific results for decades.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>−<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref></sup></p>
    <p>In XL-MS, linker molecules are used to connect
one or more residues
of one or more proteins (usually two). There are many different types
of linkers, which can be grouped into MS-cleavable and noncleavable
linkers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref></sup> The initially developed linkers
were noncleavable linkers, realized as sturdy connections between
two residues. Cleavable cross-linkers are an extension of this idea
but enable cleavage of specific position in the linker molecule, allowing
for increased speeds and confidence in data analysis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref></sup></p>
    <p>In both cases, the resulting mass spectra contain
two peptides
that must be identified to determine the parent proteins and subsequently
identify the interactions thereof. The identification of single, linear
peptides is a field well studied and continuously expanding. There
are numerous different concepts for the search for peptides and search
engines that implement these ideas.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>−<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref></sup> In this work, we focus on database search engines,
but there are also other approaches for the identification of peptides
such as <italic>de novo</italic> search and spectral library search.
Standard peptide search algorithms cannot be used for the search for
cross-linked peptides out of the box since they are designed to work
not with multiple but with only one peptide in each spectrum.</p>
    <p>In addition to the search engines not being able to tackle this
challenge, another problem emerges: as the name suggests, a search
engine traverses a database (or even all possible combinations of
amino acids) for the most likely peptide sequence. This search can
take a long time, depending on the number and size of proteins of
interest.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref></sup> For data of noncleavable cross-linking
experiments, this is an even greater issue as the spectrum contains
two potential peptides but no clear information about the individual
peptides’ masses. Therefore, all potential combinations of
two peptides must be considered. By combining each potential peptide
with each other potential peptide, a quadratic search space is created.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref></sup> For small database sizes, this problem can be
solved using brute force algorithms, but as the database size increases
(e.g., for proteome-wide studies), the runtime exceeds sensible time
constraints even on high-performance computing clusters.</p>
    <p>Cleavable
cross-linkers aim to alleviate this so-called n-squared
problem. Their ability to break apart in the mass spectrometer can
cleverly be used to identify the masses of the two individual peptides.
Then, the two peptides can be identified independently and reconstructed
into a whole cross-link spectrum match (CSM). With the emergence of
cleavable cross-linkers, new methods for measurement were developed.
MS2-based approaches generally require less instrument time. MS2–MS3-based
methods require more time due to the additional measurements and an
MS3-capable mass spectrometer but can lead to improved results.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>−<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref></sup></p>
    <p>Another question almost always present in proteomics MS relates
to the correctness of identifications. Search engines generally identify
the peptide that is most likely the correct peptide, but in some cases,
the chosen sequence is wrong. The percentage of wrong identifications
compared to all identifications is often referred to as the false
discovery rate (FDR). To estimate this FDR, an equally sized database
of incorrect potential peptides, so-called decoys, is searched simultaneously.
By assuming that the number of false positives is not higher than
the number of identified decoys, the result can be filtered to a desired
estimated FDR.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref></sup> FDRs are usually calculated
either by the search software or in an additional step after the search.</p>
    <p>Due to recent advances in instrumentation and protocols, the popularity
of XL-MS has steadily increased.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref></sup> With
that, the need for new and improved algorithms is apparent.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref></sup></p>
    <p>The question of FDR estimation is a crucial point in the development
of any search tool, cross-linking or otherwise.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref></sup> As incorrect results are almost guaranteed to appear in the output,
it is important to estimate their amount and filter accordingly. For
cross-linking experiments, the chance of identifying at least one
decoy among the two peptides is much higher than for linear peptides,
and several methods to deal with this problem have been proposed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref></sup> Multiple studies have shown that established tools often fail catastrophically
to estimate true FDRs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref></sup> Arbitrary score cutoffs and aggressive
postsearch filtering steps have been suggested to come to grips with
these results. However, this often obscures the method used for FDR
estimation, prohibits understanding of the underlying score distribution,
and removes more true positives than necessary. Therefore, the cross-linking
community pushes toward more reliability and transparency in cross-linking
experiments and error estimation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref></sup></p>
    <p>Identifying cross-links is helpful for numerous applications, for
example, drawing of protein–protein interaction networks or
mapping of cross-links to three-dimensional (3D) structures. Multiple
platforms have been developed to visualize such data. One of them
is xiView,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref></sup> an online platform that allows
user upload and provides visualizations and information about the
submitted data. One rather interesting functionality is the possibility
of creating protein interaction networks from the data in a fully
automated way. This is especially relevant for proteome-wide studies
and provides a great overview of the proteins in the sample and their
connections. Furthermore, xiView, provided with a protein data bank
(PDB) accession number, can display the 3D model of the protein in
question. The software also displays the cross-links in the 3D model
and can color the links according to their length in space, which
is crucial for the verification of cross-links.</p>
    <p>In this work,
we present a new search engine, MS Annika, for the
identification of cross-links from tandem MS data, which is transparent
in peptide identification and reliable in FDR calculation. Our algorithm
is focused on MS2 spectra, alleviating the need for an additional
measurement. MS Annika can deal with a wide variety of cleavable cross-linkers
such as DSSO,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref></sup> DSBU,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref></sup> DSAU,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref></sup> DSBSO,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref></sup> and PIR linkers (e.g., BDP-NHP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref></sup>), as well as cleavable zero-length cross-linkers (e.g., CDI<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref></sup>). Furthermore, MS Annika offers support for
data containing ion mobilities. MS Annika is fully integrated with
Thermo Proteome Discoverer (versions 2.3, 2.4, and 2.5). The fast
implementation is available free of charge at <uri xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://ms.imp.ac.at/index.php?action=ms-annika">https://ms.imp.ac.at/index.php?action=ms-annika</uri> and can be used to search data sets up to a proteome-wide scale.</p>
  </sec>
  <sec id="sec2">
    <title>Methods</title>
    <p>Our newly implemented search algorithm makes use of the typical
fragmentation patterns of cleavable cross-links in the MS2 spectrum
of tandem MS experiments. The alternative to this approach is to use
a third MS stage (MS2–MS3 based approaches), which increases
the time needed to acquire mass spectra and therefore decreases throughput.
Furthermore, this approach requires a mass spectrometer with MS3 capabilities.</p>
    <p>It has been shown that using stepped collision energies improves
the MS2 fragmentation pattern, which further decreases the requirement
for additional measurements.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref></sup> Therefore,
we focused our development effort on creating a powerful search engine
that requires only MS2 data. Two crucial steps are required for the
determination of cross-links from tandem MS data. First, spectra containing
cross-links have to be identified. The development of cleavable cross-linkers
provides a means for the identification of peptide masses from MS2
spectra. This identification is facilitated in the MS Annika Detector.
The second step is to identify the cross-links from the spectra, which
is implemented as the MS Annika Search Node. Finally, a validation
step is often added to control the number of false positives (MS Annika
Validator). An overview of the different components of MS Annika is
depicted in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref></xref>. A complete workflow to identify cross-linked peptides in tandem
mass spectra using MS Annika in Thermo Proteome Discoverer is shown

ion doublets and passes the spectra to the search node if doublets
are found. Spectra with identified ion doublets are searched using
the MS Annika Search node. The final combination of CSM matches to
cross-links as well as multilevel FDR control fall into the scope
of the MS Annika Validator node. The optional xiView Exporter node
can be used to export cross-links at different confidence levels,
which can then be uploaded to xiView for evaluation.</p>

      <title>MS Annika Detector: Separation of Spectra with and without Cross-Linked
Peptides</title>
      <p>Before identifying cross-links from spectra, MS
Annika investigates whether a spectrum contains cross-linked peptides
or not. Cleavable cross-linkers are often symmetric, with two fragmentation
sites. These potential cleavage sites are positioned such that the
linker breaks at an off-center position. Therefore, one peptide is
attached to the heavier and one peptide is connected to the lighter
side of the linker. Since multiple identical peptide pairs are contained
in the sample and the linker does not always break on the same side,
both peptides are ideally present with the lighter and heavier linker
part. The two differently modified peptides (light and heavy) are
separated by a specific mass difference in the mass spectrum, which
depends on the used cross-linker. This unique information can be used
to identify spectra containing cross-linked peptides<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref></sup> In the ideal case, all four possible peaks (the two doublets)
are present. These doublets are complete light-heavy peak pairs for
each peptide. However, it is not always guaranteed that all four ions
are present in the spectrum. In some cases, only one doublet and one
ion of the other doublet are present. This method to identify spectra
as cross-link spectra is named <italic>evidence mode</italic> since
it requires ions from both peptides to be present.</p>
      <p>To handle
the remaining peptide pairs, MS Annika also offers <italic>indication
mode</italic>. If one of the doublets is complete, while the other
doublet is missing, MS Annika infers the missing peptide pair using
the precursor mass. MS Annika calculates all four possible combinations
(light–light, light–heavy, heavy–light, and heavy–heavy)
as it is not clear if the peptides carry the light or heavy part of
the linker. All pairs that fulfil the requirement of matching the
precursor mass are stored for the search step. Visual representations
of the different modes are shown in <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.jproteome.0c01000/suppl_file/pr0c01000_si_001.pdf">Supporting Information</ext-link> Figures S2 and S3. Spectra not containing any cross-link
information can be searched with a standard database search tool.
MS Amanda, for example, provides the possibility to search for dead-end
links by defining cross-linker specific modifications (see <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.jproteome.0c01000/suppl_file/pr0c01000_si_001.pdf">Supporting Information</ext-link> Figure S1). Annotated
spectra containing these doublet peaks are exemplarily shown in <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.jproteome.0c01000/suppl_file/pr0c01000_si_001.pdf">Supporting Information</ext-link> Figures S9 and S10.</p>
      <p>MS Annika can also search spectra in <italic>combined mode</italic>, which combines indication and evidence modes to cover as many cases
as possible. However, looking at more cases inadvertently increases
the runtime consumption of the search process.</p>
      <p>Additional features
that are often present in the cross-linking
mass spectra are the so-called diagnostic ions. These are ions that
represent partial or broken cross-linkers without a peptide residue
attached to it. These diagnostic ions can be deliberate (e.g., in
the BDP-NHP linker) or a byproduct (cross-link residues that fragmented
at the peptide connection instead of the intended fragmentation position,
etc.; e.g., in DSSO<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref></sup>). Identifying such
ions in a spectrum provides strong evidence that the spectrum is indeed
a cross-link spectrum. The MS Annika Detector can use these diagnostic
ions to identify spectra containing cross-linked peptides.</p>
      <p>In
certain cases, there is no clear isotope pattern in the MS1
spectrum, and the precursor assigned to an MS2 spectrum is wrong,
representing the first isotope (1xC13). It has been shown that this
problem occurs even more often with cross-linked peptides due to their
higher masses.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">32</xref></sup> MS Annika can also handle
such cases and provides two ways to search for alternative precursors:
one that is based on the ions that are present in the MS1 spectrum
and the one that ignores whether the ions are present in the MS1 or
not and simply assumes their positions. It is possible to specify
the desired mode and the number of offsets that should be considered.</p>

      <title>MS Annika Search: Determination of Cross-Links from Spectrum
Matches</title>
      <p>After the identification of spectra containing cross-linked
peptides, the actual search step is performed. Identification of peptides
in the spectrum is based on the MS Amanda search engine, which was
extended to allow for searches of cross-link modifications on the
individual peptides. In the search step, these modified peptide masses
are used to search for each of the two individual peptides in the
mass spectrum. MS Annika takes advantage of the fact that MS Amanda
provides multiple peptides for each peptide mass. The top <italic>N</italic> peptides for each of the two peptide masses are used,
where <italic>N</italic> is a user-defined parameter. Then, all combinations
between the potential candidates for the first identified peptide
mass and the candidates for the second peptide mass are created. This
search results in several peptide pairs, with a combined score—the
AnnikaScore—for each of the pairs. MS Annika uses the AmandaScore <italic>S</italic> (ref (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>), eq 7) to evaluate the quality of a match of a peptide with a spectrum.
The AmandaScore is a probability-based score and calculates the probability
that a match happened by chance using the binomial distribution. This
probability is weighted by the explained intensity based on the matched
peaks and log transformed for better readability.</p>
      <p>The AnnikaScore <italic>A</italic> for a spectrum <italic>s</italic> and two potential peptides <italic>pep1</italic> and <italic>pep2</italic> is calculated as the minimum
of the AmandaScore<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref></sup> for each of the two
peptides<disp-formula id="ueq1"><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="pr0c01000_m001" position="anchor"/></disp-formula></p>
      <p>Only peptides that,
together with the cross-linker mass, make up
the precursor mass with consideration of some user-defined tolerance
are used for the result. The two peptides are considered only if the
following mass relation is fulfilled<disp-formula id="ueq2"><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="pr0c01000_m002" position="anchor"/></disp-formula>where mass<sub>P</sub> is the (converted uncharged)
precursor mass, mass(XL) is the mass of the cross-linker, and <italic>T</italic><sub>D</sub> is the detection tolerance. <italic>T</italic><sub>D</sub> can be defined in Da or ppm and is then converted accordingly.</p>
      <p>We refer to two peptides identified from one spectrum as a CSM.
The highest-scoring CSM, that is, the peptide pair with the highest
AnnikaScore A, is selected and stored for the subsequent validation
step. A step-by-step score calculation available in the pseudo-code
can be found in the <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.jproteome.0c01000/suppl_file/pr0c01000_si_001.pdf">Supporting Information</ext-link> (Supporting Information S1).</p>

      <title>MS Annika Validator: Validation
at CSM and Cross-Link Levels</title>
      <p>A CSM represents the two identified
peptides found in one spectrum.
However, there are cases in which the same peptide pair appears in
multiple spectra. Furthermore, one peptide can be a part of a longer
peptide. In that case, CSMs of two different peptides can represent
the same position in a protein. MS Annika alleviates these ambiguities
in the list of CSM results by combining CSMs into cross-links, that
is, a cross-link contains one or multiple CSMs that describe the same
position in the protein (see also <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref></xref>). This method ensures that even if one of
the peptides in a CSM is a substring of another peptide, these two
CSMs are attributed to the same cross-link. When several CSMs merge
in a cross-link, the score assigned to the cross-link is the maximum
score of all included CSMs.</p>
      <p>The final mandatory step in each
experiment is the validation step. As with most experiments, using
a combination of MS and database searching, a target-decoy approach
to estimate the FDR is a natural choice, using a reversed database
to generate decoys. A decoy hit is present when at least one of the
two cross-linked peptides originates from the decoy database (see
also <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref></xref>). MS
Annika estimates the FDR at both levels at the CSM as well as at the
cross-link level. For both levels, it is possible to set two thresholds
for estimated FDRs. By default, these are set to 1 and 5%, respectively.
To distinguish these results, MS Annika will assign a confidence to
each CSM and cross-link. High-confidence results correspond to the
lower threshold (e.g., 1%), and medium-confidence results correspond
to the higher FDR threshold (e.g., 5%). This means filtering for results
having an assigned confidence of at least “medium” provides
all hits above the 5% FDR threshold. These confidences will be displayed
in Proteome Discoverer and can be used to filter data to two different
FDR levels without having to rerun the entire analysis, as is often
the case with other tools.</p>
      <p>In addition, MS Annika provides inter/intralink
separated FDR as
an additional separation technique. Intralink results are cross-linked
peptides that occur on the same protein, whereas intralink results
correspond to links between two different proteins. In inter/intralink
separation, these two sets are validated separately, that is, a horizontal
split is applied to the data set. The FDR is estimated for the two
data sets individually. Then, the two data sets are reconcatenated.</p>

      <title>MS Annika xiView Exporter: Export-Validated Cross-Links to xiView</title>
      <p>Visualization of identified cross-links is often essential for
further validation and identification of interesting sites. xiView<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref></sup> is a tool offering such a functionality. We
therefore developed an MS Annika xiView Exporter node that can optionally
be applied. This allows users to write identified cross-links to the
hard drive, from where they can be uploaded to xiView.</p>

    <sec id="sec2.5">
      <title>Evaluation</title>
      <p>To test our novel cross-linking search engine,
we applied MS Annika (version 1.2.17302 in PD 2.4) to a wide variety
of publicly available data sets from different groups, some of which
allow for the estimation of true FDR to compare the tool-estimated
FDR, and compared the results to two other solutions, MeroX (version
2.0.1.4<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref></sup>) and XlinkX (version 1.0.0.0,
for Proteome Discoverer 2.4 and 2.5<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34">34</xref></sup>), the most used cross-link search engines available
to our knowledge. The peptide library has also been processed with
pLink (version 2.3.9<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref35">35</xref></sup>). .raw files were
converted to .mgf files for all MeroX runs using Thermo Raw File Parser
(v.1.1.11).</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec2.6">
      <title>FDR Estimation</title>
      <p>To evaluate FDR estimation
of MS Annika,
we used two different data sets and compared the estimated and calculated
FDRs.</p>
      <p>The first data set was the peptide library by Beveridge
and co-workers,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref></sup> which was developed as
a gold standard to determine true FDRs. It contains synthetic peptides
separated in multiple groups. Peptides in each group are cross-linked;
groups are pooled and then measured on a Q Exactive HF-X mass spectrometer.
The resulting mass spectra should contain cross-links between peptides
of the same group. Cross-links between peptides of different groups
are understood to be incorrect. Therefore, the true FDR can be calculated
using cross-links that connect two peptides from different groups
(which are therefore incorrect).</p>
      <p>The data used in this experiment
was measured using the stepped
collision energy acquisition mode, which results in one MS2 spectrum
containing fragments from both peptides individually, as well as the
peptides themselves. Therefore, these data are well-suited to identify
cross-links. The peptide library was measured twice, once cross-linked
with DSSO and once with DSBU. We compared the estimated FDR to the
calculated FDR of results provided by four different tools (MS Annika,
MeroX, pLink, and XlinkX). To calculate the true FDR for each of the
four tools, the tools were run with comparable settings (search settings
are displayed in <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.jproteome.0c01000/suppl_file/pr0c01000_si_001.pdf">Supporting Information</ext-link> Table S2). pLink has been developed for noncleavable cross-linkers
but can be tuned to also work with cleavable cross-linkers. For pLink,
we converted the .raw file to an .mgf file using MSConvert<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref36">36</xref></sup> (version 3.0.20079-3280b8471). XlinkX was run
in Proteome Discoverer version 2.4 and 2.5, as in PD 2.5, and an updated
FDR calculation for XlinkX was introduced. No cutoff score was used
for XlinkX.</p>
      <p>The results reported for each tool at the desired
FDR cutoffs were
then postprocessed using an in-house script in R to generate the figures
(<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.jproteome.0c01000/suppl_file/pr0c01000_si_002.pdf">Supporting Information</ext-link> S2). For MeroX,
CSMs had to be manually combined to cross-links, and for all other
tools, cross-links at the desired FDR were exported. Using the identified
peptide sequences, it is possible to map the group to which the peptide
initially belonged back to each individual peptide. This enables the
comparison of the groups for each of the two peptides. A cross-link
is assumed to be correct if the two groups are the same and flagged
as incorrect if they are not. One peptide (VKYVTEGMR) appears in two
groups (2 and 10), and cross-links containing this peptide are assumed
to be correct if the second peptide is in either one of the two groups.</p>
      <p>The second data set used for FDR estimation was published by Ser
and colleagues.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref></sup> In this data set, bovine
serum albumin (BSA) proteins were cross-linked with DSSO and measured
either mixed with a background of HEK293T cells or on their own. By
searching these data against a human database containing common contaminants
(CRAPome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref37">37</xref></sup>), which includes BSA, it is
possible to approximate true false positive rates: cross-links between
residues of BSA are considered correct since they were possible in
the originally cross-linked sample and cross-links that form with
any other protein are considered incorrect. With this experimental
setup, it is not possible to validate the BSA–BSA crosslinks,
so we assume all BSA–BSA links to be correct.</p>
      <p>We focused
our analysis on the samples measured as CIDMS2-HCDMS2
acquisition mode, which can be converted for use in MS Annika using
the Spectrum Grouper node in Proteome Discoverer. Due to the lack
of that functionality, MeroX cannot be applied to these data out of
the box, so we used the Spectrum Grouper Node (Proteome Discoverer
2.4) and exported the data as MGF files, which were then supplied
to MeroX. We analyzed the data with MeroX, XlinkX for Proteome Discoverer
2.5, and MS Annika for Proteome Discoverer 2.4.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec2.7">
      <title>Search Speed</title>
      <p>As discussed briefly above, the search
for cross-linked peptides can quickly become computationally expensive
due to the quadratic search space expansion. This poses little to
no problems in small-scale studies as the increasing power of modern
compute systems can solve these problems by enumerating all possible
solutions. However, for proteome-wide applications, the quadratic
growth of the search space combined with a large sequence database
can quickly exceed the limits of simply adding more compute power.
Therefore, smart solutions are required within the software to search
only a small, relevant part of the solution space.</p>
      <p>Cleavable
cross-linkers provide a crucial piece of the puzzle of determining
areas of interest for the search engine. The ion doublets from the
heavy and light parts of the linked peptides provide information about
the peptides’ masses, thereby narrowing the search space to
areas around these masses. MS Annika provides multiple different search
modes [evidence mode, indication mode, and combined mode (see MS Annika
Detector)], all of which are optimized for fast execution times. This
allows our new search engine to process large numbers of spectra in
conjunction with extensive databases in comparatively small timeframes.</p>
      <p>To test the applicability of MS Annika to proteome-wide data, we
searched a data set on <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> embryos.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref38">38</xref></sup> We analyzed the first of three
replicates consisting of just over 800,000 MS2 spectra.</p>
      <p>In addition,
we performed a runtime and memory analysis where we
searched the data set by Ser and colleagues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref></sup> against protein databases of different sizes. We randomly sampled
proteins from the Uniprot human database including isoforms combined
with common contaminants, comprising approximately 42,000 proteins.
The resulting FASTA files contain 1000, 5000, 10,000, 15,000, 20,000,
25,000, 30,000, 35,000, and 40,000 proteins. Searches were performed
on a Virtual Machine (oVirt, Windows Server 2016, Intel Core Skylake,
2.9 GHz, 16 Cores, 80 GB RAM).</p>

      <title>Analysis of timsTOF Data</title>
      <p>Trapped ion mobility mass
spectrometry (tims) has recently been shown to improve the results

the availability of data analysis tools that are able to tackle such
data is limited. Therefore, pre- or postprocessing steps are necessary
to work with these data. MS Annika works with ion mobility data out
of the box, without requiring any additional preprocessing steps.
In fact, the workflow in Proteome Discoverer barely changes when compared
to the standard MS Annika workflow (see <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.jproteome.0c01000/suppl_file/pr0c01000_si_001.pdf">Supporting Information</ext-link> Figure S8).</p>

      <title>MS Annika Provides Realistic Estimates of
FDRs</title>
      <p>As mentioned
before, the peptide library can be used to compare estimated and calculated
FDRs for cross-linking search engines.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref></sup><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref> shows the
results for the four different tools at 1 and 5% estimated FDR and
compared to the calculated FDR based on the wrongly identified cross-linkers
from separate groups (given in dark orange). In all cases, MS Annika
outperforms MeroX and XlinkX not only in the number of identified
cross-links but also in the correctness of the estimated FDR. Only
when using DSBU and 5% FDR, MeroX provides a slightly better FDR estimate
(5.64 vs 5.9% of MS Annika). Still, in that special case, MS Annika
provides a higher number of correctly identified cross-links (255
vs 251 of MeroX). This implies that the distribution of scores is
more easily separable for MS Annika.</p>

False-positive XLs (dark orange) are cross-linked peptides in different
groups, enabling the comparison between the estimated FDR (based on
a target-decoy search) and the calculated FDR based on the false-positive
XLs. Calculated FDRs are generally higher than the estimated FDRs.
Results shown were obtained using no score cutoff for any of the tools.
For XlinkX, a minimum score difference (delta score) of 4 was set.
Score cutoffs can often remove many true positives and can obfuscate
the selection of cross-links. In PD 2.5, a new FDR calculation strategy
was introduced for XlinkX.</p>

Still, there are massive discrepancies between the calculated and

of identified correct cross-links than all other tools.</p>

performs similar when looking at CSM level FDRs. At 1%
estimated CSM level FDR, the calculated FDR for the DSBU data set

can be considered as correct, and cross-links with non-BSA proteins
are considered to be incorrect. Strikingly, MS Annika is the only
tool that provides a true FDR of 1% at an estimated FDR of 1%. For
MeroX, 75% of identified cross-links are not connecting BSA residues,
while 46 and 39% of all identifications are non-BSA cross-links in
the XlinkX results. We confirmed that the score cutoff of 100 for
XlinkX proposed by Ser and co-workers corresponds to 1% true FDR (blue
bars). Items in gray are BSA cross-links that would be removed by
applying the 1% true FDR cutoff. In all of the above cases, a single
incorrect cross-link is enough to exceed the 1% FDR cutoff, highlighting
the importance of strong separation between true and false positives.</p>

    <title>Discussion and Conclusions</title>
    <p>We have developed a new cross-linking search engine, called MS
Annika, that can deal with a wide variety of cleavable cross-linkers.
We have tested our search engine to work with DSSO, DSBU, DSAU, BPD-NHP,
or DSBSO linkers, but it can in theory deal with any (novel) cleavable
linker. The focus of the search engine lies on the reliable and fast
identification of CSMs and cross-links of cleavable cross-linkers
from MS2 data only. MS Annika uses the MS Amanda search engine to
identify each of the two cross-linked peptides in a mass spectrum.
The final Annika score is the minimum Amanda score of the two peptides.
Taking the minimum score of the two identified peptides rather than,
for example, a geometric mean, penalizes CSMs that have one very high-scoring
identification and one with a rather low score, which would otherwise
add potentially wrong identifications to the result.</p>
    <p>In this
work, we have shown that MS Annika can outperform other
search engines on the tested data sets, both in the number of identifications
as well as in the correctness of results. For data sets where a real
FDR can be calculated and compared to the estimated FDR, MS Annika
is able to provide a better FDR estimation than other tools, such
as XlinkX or MeroX. Interestingly, these estimates are closer to the
truth for DSBU data, whereas all tools perform significantly worse
when estimating FDR for DSSO data. Estimating FDRs on small data sets,
such as the peptide library or the BSA data set used in this manuscript,
is of course very fragile as a single false identification can easily
hamper the estimation. For cross-linking experiments, this is even
worse as always two peptides must be considered. Still, this is also
true for the DSBU data where this phenomenon did not emerge. This
discrepancy has to be further investigated but just might be dependent
on the fine tuning of the used settings or the data set quality.</p>
    <p>In this manuscript, we also show that MS Annika can tackle proteome-wide
studies and export results to validate cross-links in protein 3D structures
using xiView. In addition, the integrated workflow allows not only
for Thermo raw data but also trapped ion mobility data from Bruker
instruments using the Ion Mobility Reader node provided by the Institute
of Molecular Pathology, Vienna (included with the MS Annika installer).</p>

    <title>Availability
and Limitations</title>
    <p>MS Annika is implemented in C# as nodes for
Thermo Proteome Discoverer
(2.3, 2.4, and 2.5) and available free of charge at <uri xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://ms.imp.ac.at/index.php?action=ms-annika">https://ms.imp.ac.at/index.php?action=ms-annika</uri>. It is currently limited to only work with cleavable cross-linkers.
A standalone version is in development that is being implemented in
.NET Core and .NET Standard to ensure operating system independent
usability and includes a developer documentation. Pseudo-code documenting
the functionality of the main features of MS Annika are available
in <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.jproteome.0c01000/suppl_file/pr0c01000_si_001.pdf">Supporting Information</ext-link> S1. The license
information and a detailed user manual including parameter descriptions
and a step-by-step instruction with sample files, how to run MS Annika,
and how results look like are also available on the homepage. System
requirements are similar to requirements of Proteome Discoverer, and
we were able to run it without problems on a desktop machine (Win10,
Intel Core i5, 4 Cores, 3.20 Ghz, 16 GB RAM). Data sets comprising
more than a million spectra will still run on such a system; however,
it will definitely take a significant amount of time.</p>
    <p>All data
sets used are freely available. Data for the timsTOF measurements
of the synthetic peptide library have been deposited on the PRIDE
repository (<uri xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/">https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/</uri>, PXD022772).</p>
