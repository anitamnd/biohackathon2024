      <p>Scholars traditionally receive career credit for a paper based on where in the author list they appear, but position in an author list often carries little information about what the contribution of each researcher was. “Contributorship” refers to a movement to formally document the nature of each researcher’s contribution to a project. We discuss the emerging CRediT standard for documenting contributions and describe a web-based app and R package called <italic>tenzing</italic> that is designed to facilitate its use. <italic>tenzing</italic> can make it easier for researchers on a project to plan and record their planned contributions and to document those contributions in a journal article.</p>

    <title>Introduction</title>
    <p>Scholarly journal articles evolved from letters penned by individuals reporting scientific observations or experiment results. These letters listed only a single author, and it was clear that that person was claiming credit for all aspects of the work reported.</p>
    <p>Today, over three hundred years later, most science is done by groups of people, not by lone individuals [<xref rid="pone.0244611.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Different members of the team usually have different roles. Yet until recently, journals still operated as if there was no need to provide any information other than a list of names—the author list. Some information could be tentatively inferred from the order of names in the list, but how order is determined reflects often-unwritten practices around authorship that can be obscure to people outside a subfield and can differ substantially between labs [<xref rid="pone.0244611.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p>
    <p>When uncertain, people fall back on their prior beliefs. This is unfortunate for junior authors who do not have many papers to their name: when people see a list of authors with no explicit indication of who did what, they may give an outsize amount of credit to the senior author.</p>
    <p>Fortunately, over the last few decades, many journals have begun to encourage, and some to require, that teams give some indication of who did what in the work reported by a paper. In some journals, this is done in a brief “Author Note” or “Author Information” section [e.g., <xref rid="pone.0244611.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Thanks to this development, researchers are more likely to get the specific recognition they deserve.</p>
    <p>The included information would ideally be utilized by funders of scientists to allocate resources more effectively, so that teams with the right combination of skills would more often be supported. Moreover, those who hire scientists, such as universities and research institutes, should be able to assemble more effective teams for particular disciplines and projects.</p>
    <p>Unfortunately, these potential benefits have been held back by a lack of standardization. Without a consistent vocabulary for describing what each researcher did in a project, and without a structured format for that information, it is difficult to aggregate across papers the type of contributions a researcher makes. For institutions and funders interested in supporting the right combinations of people, it is difficult to tally the sorts of contributions typically involved in different sorts of projects.</p>
    <p>This issue is also faced by business and industry, where some solutions were devised. For commercial music for example, the recording industry uses an International Standard Musical Work Code (ISWC). This contains metadata for musical works that provide the identities of contributors and indicates whether they served the roles of, for example, composer, lyricist, or arranger [<xref rid="pone.0244611.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0244611.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. A search of the associated ISWC database allows people to find the works that a musician has contributed to and what their role was in each work (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://iswcnet.cisac.org/">http://iswcnet.cisac.org/</ext-link>).</p>
    <p>In scientific research, roles may not be as clear cut as typical in the music industry. Nonetheless, useful distinctions can be made, such as contributions to the analysis of data versus to the drafting of a manuscript, or to the acquisition of data.</p>
    <sec id="sec002">
      <title>CRediT</title>
      <p>In 2014, the first formal taxonomy was developed for scientific research—CRediT, the Contributor Role Taxonomy [<xref rid="pone.0244611.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. CRediT defines fourteen different types of contributions (<xref rid="pone.0244611.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), and over the last several years, it has been taken up by hundreds of journals [<xref rid="pone.0244611.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and dozens of publishers (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://credit.niso.org/adopters/">http://credit.niso.org/adopters/</ext-link>) and been endorsed by a number of journal editors [<xref rid="pone.0244611.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p>

      <p>The use of CRediT not only can provide better documentation of the contributions of individual researchers, but also it enables meta-scientific research, such as into the different distribution of contributions indicated for women and men [<xref rid="pone.0244611.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p>
      <p>To facilitate researcher reporting of contributorship information in manuscripts and journal articles, we created <italic>tenzing</italic>, a web app and R package [<xref rid="pone.0244611.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] for researchers and publishers. In the following, we will review how journals are currently using and reporting CRediT information. We then explain how <italic>tenzing</italic> can facilitate researcher and journal use of CRediT. Finally, we describe broader issues associated with CRediT contributorship that should be addressed as fields move forward with the usage of contributorship.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec003">
      <title>How publishers are using CRediT</title>
      <p>The CRediT standard includes a specification for how to report contributorship information in the metadata that is associated with manuscript webpages (JATS-XML). But many publishers do not yet have the capability to do this. For example, it appears that none of the organizations behind preprint servers currently create CRediT metadata in JATS-XML format. In such cases, it can be useful for researchers to publish CRediT information in plain text in their manuscripts. Many journals make no mention of CRediT but ask researchers to indicate what each author did in the “Author Note” or similar section of the manuscript. Researchers can use CRediT to do this, in their preprints and in their submitted manuscripts.</p>
      <p>An increasing number of scientific journals offer authors forms to indicate which CRediT category each author contributed to. For example, in the submission interface of <italic>eLife</italic>, authors encounter an array of checkboxes to indicate which category each author contributed to (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0244611.g001">Fig 1</xref>).</p>

      </fig>
      <p>Many authors encounter the CRediT roles for the first time when they are submitting to a journal. Or even if an author has used CRediT for a previous paper, they may be unlikely to explicitly consider these roles for a new paper until the time of journal submission. From multiple perspectives, not considering contributor roles until the time of submission is not ideal.</p>
      <p>By the time an author submits a manuscript, the associated research project sometimes was completed months or even years before. At the time of journal submission, memory of each collaborator’s contributions may be fuzzy. Ideally, authors will arrive at a consensus regarding who did what. But even if memories and records are adequate for this task, establishing such a consensus necessitates interruption of the submission of the manuscript until the submitting author hears from all the other authors and works to resolve any disagreement about various contributions, such as who contributed to the original draft of the manuscript.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, there is reason to believe that, when not discussed until after project completion, the rate of disagreement regarding author contributions may be high. Surveys suggest that between between a third and two-thirds of researchers have been involved in authorship disagreements [<xref rid="pone.0244611.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0244611.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In many fields, the submitting author is often the most junior author. This is typically the case when a PhD student submits her first paper, for example. Yet a student or other junior author is not in the best position to arbitrate disputes or push back on project contributors who may be overclaiming regarding their contribution [<xref rid="pone.0244611.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. For this and other reasons, there are many recommendations that authors communicate more about authorship expectations and roles, and that they should do so at the beginning of a project [<xref rid="pone.0244611.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0244611.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. This may be even more important when the manuscript is to provide not only a list of author names, but also a specification of each author’s contributions.</p>
      <p>Most authorship disputes are settled informally, but still may leave some people bitter at being excluded, or resentful that some people were included on an authorship list without any evidence they deserved it. The same likely applies to disputes over which contribution categories a researcher contributed to. It is probably best to get some agreement on these at the beginning of a project, so that researchers can proceed with some confidence around both what they are expected to do and what kind of credit they will get for it.</p>
      <p>To facilitate project and credit attribution planning, an “authorship grid” system was described by Philippi et al. [<xref rid="pone.0244611.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Each row of the grid is a task category or high-level responsibility associated with the project, and the columns are the researchers. At the intersection of the rows and columns, researchers indicate the more specific tasks they plan to perform, if any, in that category. This approach is likely very useful for complex projects. For CRediT-using journals, this needs to be translated into CRediT information, which <italic>tenzing</italic> can facilitate.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec004">
      <title>How <italic>tenzing</italic> helps authors use CRediT</title>
      <p><italic>tenzing</italic> is a web app and associated R package that allows researchers to record contributorship information at any time, for eventual provision to a journal. The app is named after the mountaineer Tenzing Norgay, who together with Edmund Hillary was the first to reach the summit of Mount Everest. Norgay arguably received less credit than was appropriate given his contribution.</p>
      <p>Here we will describe the use of <italic>tenzing</italic> solely in terms of the web app (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://martonbalazskovacs.shinyapps.io/tenzing/">https://martonbalazskovacs.shinyapps.io/tenzing/</ext-link>), although one can also use it via the underlying R package (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/marton-balazs-kovacs/tenzing">https://github.com/marton-balazs-kovacs/tenzing</ext-link>)—full documentation for <italic>tenzing</italic> can be found online at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://marton-balazs-kovacs.github.io/tenzing/">https://marton-balazs-kovacs.github.io/tenzing/</ext-link>.</p>
      <p>Use of <italic>tenzing</italic> starts with a spreadsheet template (provided as a Google Sheet, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://bit.ly/tenzingTemplate">http://bit.ly/tenzingTemplate</ext-link>, but one can also use it in any spreadsheet editor, such as Excel). For a given research project, researchers make a copy of the template and then, in the rows, enter the names of their collaborators (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0244611.g003">Fig 3</xref>). One column is dedicated to each of the fourteen CRediT categories, to be checked off to indicate which categories each researcher contributed to. Because some CRediT categories are not entirely self-explanatory, one can hover the cursor over the column names to see some additional defining information.</p>
      <fig id="pone.0244611.g003" orientation="portrait" position="float">

        <graphic xlink:href="pone.0244611.g003"/>
      </fig>
      <p>Around the time of the start of a project, a lead researcher may choose to send the link to the Sheet to all those involved, who can then indicate the areas they plan to contribute to. At the end of the project, or when plans change during the project, this Sheet can be revisited. Google Sheet services track the changes made in the template, thus by visiting the version history one can review the evolution of contributorship roles throughout the project.</p>
      <p>When the researchers are ready to submit to a journal, they upload their filled-out spreadsheet to the <italic>tenzing</italic> app. They can then click a button to generate any of various outputs.</p>
      <p>For CRediT, <italic>tenzing</italic> outputs a brief report in the form of a list indicating which contributor did what (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0244611.g004">Fig 4</xref>). This can be pasted into the section known at some journals as the Author Note. It is particularly appropriate for journals whose publishing platform does not support the machine-readable CRediT metadata. For example, the journal <italic>Collabra</italic>: <italic>Psychology</italic> encourages researchers to provide CRediT information in the “Author Contributions” section, because their publisher has not yet implemented creation of CRediT metadata in the article contents.</p>

      <p>The publishing platforms used by dozens of publishers can include CRediT metadata in JATS-XML-format in the journal article webpages (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://credit.niso.org/implementing-credit/">http://credit.niso.org/implementing-credit/</ext-link>). <italic>tenzing</italic> can generate this JATS-XML information itself for users to download (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0244611.g005">Fig 5</xref>). Ideally, researchers would be able to upload this to a journal submission portal when submitting their manuscript, obviating the need to fill in arrays of checkboxes for each contributor. Unfortunately, at present no journal is capable of processing the uploaded JATS-XML, although a few publishers have privately indicated that they’re interested in adding support for this.</p>

      <p>The current user interface for <italic>tenzing</italic> is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0244611.g006">Fig 6</xref>, although its design is likely to evolve–a usability study is presently underway.</p>

      <title>The future of CRediT</title>
      <p>The CRediT standard was primarily designed to allow researchers to indicate what type of contribution they made. However, it also has a facility that allows one to indicate the <italic>degree</italic> of contribution. Specifically, one can optionally indicate whether each contributor to a particular category played a “lead”, “equal”, or “supporting” role in the associated work. It appears that most journals that use CRediT have opted not to use this feature, at least not yet. Editorial Manager, a journal platform used by thousands of journals, has integrated the degree of contribution feature but as a specific configuration, and most journals using Editorial Manager currently do not appear to have activated it.</p>
      <p>An unresolved issue with CRediT’s degree of contribution facet is how it should be used. It seems likely that if the “equal” degree is used, it must be used for multiple co-authors as it may not make sense when applied to just one. This is not currently addressed, however, by the CRediT documentation, nor are other possible constraints such as whether “equal” can be used as an intermediate indicator in cases where there are already authors with the “lead” and “supporting” labels. In addition, there is no indication to publishers of how they should indicate degrees of contribution in the machine-readable JATS-XML associated with journal articles, although Aries Systems, the creator of Editorial Manager, has done this by using the “specific-use” attribute (Caroline Webber, personal communication, 8 July 2020).</p>
      <p>The degree of contribution under-specification is one of the issues that will likely be addressed by the group convened by the American National Information Standards Organization to formalize CRediT as an ANSI/NISO standard (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://niso.org/press-releases/2020/04/niso-launches-work-contributor-role-taxonomy-credit-initiative">https://niso.org/press-releases/2020/04/niso-launches-work-contributor-role-taxonomy-credit-initiative</ext-link>). For now, we have chosen to not yet implement the degree of contribution feature in <italic>tenzing</italic>.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec006">
      <title>The future of contributorship</title>
      <p>The number of contributors to the average scientific paper has steadily increased over the last several decades [<xref rid="pone.0244611.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0244611.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. In part, this has occurred because as knowledge in an area increases, specialization facilitates further advances. Some forms of research today, such as systematic reviews and meta-analyses, are based on bringing together large amounts of evidence from the literature. Library professionals contribute to some such projects with sophisticated searches of papers and databases. For other projects, technicians provide invaluable guidance regarding equipment, programmers create needed software, statisticians provide statistical advice, and informaticists create visualizations or collate information from databases. With science increasingly depending on these tasks getting done, funders need to be able to assess what sorts of projects have most benefited from specialists in order to resource science most effectively. However, people in these specialist roles are often not included in author lists, making it difficult to determine the number of specialists contributing to various projects.</p>
      <p>One obstacle to greater inclusion of specialist contributors is the current state of journal authorship guidelines. The authorship guidelines for thousands of journals are based on the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors. These guidelines stipulate that only those who contribute to the writing or revising of a manuscript are eligible for authorship [<xref rid="pone.0244611.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Journals should consider expanding authorship eligibility, for example by adopting the proposal of McNutt et al. [<xref rid="pone.0244611.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] to eliminate the writing requirement and endorse the use of CRediT [<xref rid="pone.0244611.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p>
      <p>Some fields, such as genomics, already have a tradition of including groups, often known as consortia, on an author list, without enumeration of individual researcher names. This is often used to indicate those who only contributed data, which is a useful alternative to making that particular distinction with CRediT [<xref rid="pone.0244611.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].</p>
      <p>CRediT is not a good fit for all disciplines or even all projects within a discipline [<xref rid="pone.0244611.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. An ontology of roles that is both broader than those of CRediT and also more specific has been developed by the National Center for Data to Health, an initiative of the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) at the National Institutes of Health [<xref rid="pone.0244611.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The scheme is called the Contributor Role Ontology (CRO, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://data2health.github.io/contributor-role-ontology/">https://data2health.github.io/contributor-role-ontology/</ext-link>), and it extends the CRediT ontology to include more than fifty roles, including “specimen collection”, “librarian”, “community engagement”, “coordination”, and “software testing” [<xref rid="pone.0244611.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0244611.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Given the adoption of CRediT that has already occurred, we anticipate that improvements will occur via extensions or generalizations such as CRO. The CRO scheme could be integrated into <italic>tenzing</italic> in the future.</p>
      <p>If author contributions to a journal’s articles are explicitly indicated by a contributorship taxonomy such as CRediT or CRO, how should one think about the order of authorship? One might expect order to still be used for communicating the relative amount that different authors contributed, despite its limitations due to ambiguity around interpreting the meaning of first author and last author in different fields and cultures. However, note that CRediT also allows an indication of degree of contribution, beyond just how many categories a researcher contributed to. Specifically, where multiple individuals serve in the same role, the degree of contribution can optionally be specified as ‘lead’, ‘equal’, or ‘supporting’, but as described in the previous section, the proper usage of as well as the metadata for this has not yet been fully specified in the CRediT standard.</p>
      <p>Deciding on order of authorship may get more and more difficult as the number of authors increases. Having a discussion among the researchers to decide this, without a clear decision process, may be unwieldy. Some have suggested a points system for different types of contributions. The American Psychological Association online authorship resources site for several years has included an example “scorecard” that assigns different types of contributions different numbers of points [<xref rid="pone.0244611.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. For CRediT, one such points system has been created by Mojtaba Soltanlou [<xref rid="pone.0244611.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. However, the relative value of different sorts of contributions likely differs across projects.</p>
      <p>A critically important document for communicating contributions to scholarship is the CV. Traditionally, the extent of different authors’ contributions is communicated entirely by the order of authorship. In the future, however, we anticipate that funders or individual researchers will move to CVs that communicate the nature of the contributions made to each journal article. The Rescognito site [<xref rid="pone.0244611.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] has created experimental visualizations, as did Ebersole, Adie, &amp; Cook in a SIPS hackathon [<xref rid="pone.0244611.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] with a bar graph indicating, for each CRediT category, how many papers a researcher contributed to.</p>
      <p>Another piece of infrastructure already supporting CRediT usage is the ORCiD database and metadata for identifying researchers and linking them to their papers and other scholarly contributions [<xref rid="pone.0244611.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Usage has grown rapidly, with over 7,000 papers a month indexed in Crossref because at least one author used ORCiD [<xref rid="pone.0244611.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. The ORCiD registry includes CRediT information. While <italic>tenzing</italic> could potentially pull author information such as name, email and affiliation from the ORCiD database rather than requiring manual entry, the selection of the information to import can have complications that require user intervention (for example, one might need to include an old affiliation and not the current one). A prototype shiny app available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://colomb.shinyapps.io/contributorlist_creator/">https://colomb.shinyapps.io/contributorlist_creator/</ext-link> facilitates that [<xref rid="pone.0244611.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] and is now compatible with <italic>tenzing</italic>, as it can be used to create an infosheet one can further complete manually before uploading it into <italic>tenzing</italic>.</p>
      <p>With adoption of CRediT growing rapidly, it is becoming more urgent to attend to any problems being encountered in its use or with the standard itself. The NISO effort to formalize CRediT will include a solicitation of feedback, which will be an important opportunity for the scholarly community to shape how contributorship information is recorded. We hope that the usage of CRediT facilitated by <italic>tenzing</italic> during the feedback period will result in a greater understanding of what about CRediT should be prioritized for refinement or change.</p>

    <p>Reviewer #1: The article summarizes advantages and limitations of traditional methods (e.g. “Author Note”, “Author information”) which have been used by scientific journals for many years. Then the authors briefly describe Contributor Role Taxonomy (CRediT) which was developed in 2014. CRediT tool has an advantage over existing methods by being more detailed and structured. CRediT defines 14 different types of author contributions. If this method would be widely adopted by publishers, it could help to provide a better documentation of the contribution of researchers. Finally, the paper presents the new web app and R package (tenzing) which helps to facilitate CRediT tool.</p>
    <p>The authors aimed:</p>
    <p>1. To revise the current state of how journals use CRediT tool for documentation of author contribution and difficulties associated with the use of CRediT during submission process.</p>
    <p>2. To present R package and web app (tenzing) which they developed to overcome these difficulties.</p>
    <p>In my opinion, the authors have achieved both aims. The paper summarizes how some journals are currently using new author contribution documentation tool CRediT, and explains difficulties of using it based on illustrative examples. Free web app and R package tenzing, developed by authors, achieves its purpose. Figures included in the paper are very informative and help to understand how tenzing package works.</p>
    <p>I find the paper very interesting and I think it would be beneficial to replace traditional author contribution methods by more sophisticated methods such as CRediT in the future.</p>
    <p>If the structure of the paper meets the requirements of PLUS ONE journal, then I would suggest accepting the paper.</p>
    <p>Reviewer #2: Dear authors,</p>
    <p>I thoroughly enjoyed reading your manuscript titled "Documenting contributions to scholarly articles using CRediT and tenzing", discussing the CRediT standard and the associated tenzing R package. The issue of authorship or “contributorship” is timely and deserving of more attention, and the development of software packages and web applications is – in my view – an excellent way of raising discussion while also providing a solution. I only have a few minor suggestions that I hope could improve the manuscript, and the app, even further.</p>
    <p>Section: The future of contributorship</p>
    <p>It would be interesting to see a bit more discussion raised concerning large(r)-scale projects and group authorship vis-à-vis the CRediT guidelines (e.g., Fontanarosa, Bauchner, &amp; Flanagin, 2017; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2667044">https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2667044</ext-link>). Given that assigning the correct role to authors and collaborators has proven to be difficult, is crediting the entire research group as a whole (and thus no individual authors) perhaps a viable alternative? The specific roles (following, e.g., CRediT guidelines) of each author could then be specified on the group’s website, for instance.</p>
    <p>Section: The future of CRediT</p>
    <p>It is unfortunate that the “lead”, “equal”, and “supporting” specifications are not more widely adopted, and thus not a feature of tenzing. While I understand your reasons, I hope that you may add such a feature in coming releases. Perhaps showing how it can be done in practice will lead to faster adoption?</p>
    <p>The tenzing app</p>
    <p>I tested the Shiny app (using Firefox) with an edited template file (edited with LibreOffice Calc on Pop_OS! 20.04 Linux, saved as xlsx). All features worked as intended, with one exception. The papaja YAML output fails to retrieve all roles; all roles are stated as "Conceptualization" (see attachments). I had a look at the code and could not find any obvious source for this error (overall, while browsing through the GitHub repo, I found the code to be clean, consistent, and nicely commented).</p>
    <p>While the app works well, apart from the above error, I have two feature suggestions that may encourage quicker adoption by users:</p>
    <p>(1) Allow users to create a template from scratch within the Shiny app (thus not having to download a template, edit it, and then upload it). It's a minor issue, but it is always nice to avoid having to move from one program to another. This could be done on a separate tab or page, and the final sheet could shown as a datatable, or similar, to allow editing within the browser (similar to the “Show infosheet” feature, but with editing capabilities). A download button would allow users to save the sheet locally, if need be.</p>
    <p>(2) It would be helpful to allow for more than two affiliations. Perhaps this could be a dynamic variable?</p>
    <p>Formatting errors</p>
    <p>• Line 49, missing abbreviation (ISWC) following mention of International Standard Musical Work Code.</p>
    <p>• Line 70, CRediT is misspelled as CrediT.</p>
    <p>• Line 169, which is misspelled as whichh.</p>
    <p>Best of luck,</p>
    <p>Carl Delfin</p>
    <p>Reviewer #3: The authors describe a very important tool that appears to solve an emerging problem about authorship and contributions to scholarly articles. Their recommended tool is useful, and would help to initiate change in the way in which scientist conduct and report research/outputs.</p>
    <p>However, the “CRediT and tenzing” tool in itself does not solve all the problems. For instance, one challenge that has not been well elucidated is how to fairly document the depth of involvement by an author per category. This will help resolve issues where some authors may contribute to a very great depth in just one category, which may surpass the total contributions from other authors who would be checking the boxes in more categories on the CRediT scale.</p>
    <p>Reviewer #4: Comments to the authors:</p>
    <p>In this report, the authors discussed the issue with authorship position in scientific publications, which can carry little information about the actual contribution of each co-author. Authors briefly review the emerging CRediT standard for documenting contributions and discuss their web app and R package “tenzing” application that facilitates researcher reporting of contributorship information in manuscripts and journal articles. The topic itself is interesting and scientifically relevant, and could be suitable for the scope of the journal. Some minor comments for the authors:</p>
    <p>- The manuscript still needs editing and language revision.</p>
    <p>- The manuscript lacks some important references, for example, in the “introduction” section and “how journals are using CRediT”.</p>
    <p>- The facility of PLoS journals can be provided as a separate figure e.g. Figure 2 (as for eLife)</p>
    <p>- Instead of links to external blogs, I recommend authors to provide tables describing different features of CRediT e.g. limitations and applicability.</p>
    <p>Reviewer #5: Thank you for allowing me to read this article in which the authors describe the challenges by informing who did what in the project manuscript. Lack of standardization on how to report contributorship in multi-authored published scholarly works is one of the issues. The authors find this to be particularly problematic since researchers indicate contributions late in the process, namely when submitting a manuscript. They suggest that developing a structured format would help, for instance, be more transparent, and give researchers specific recognition.</p>
    <p>Authors describe the use of Contributor Roles Taxonomy (CRediT), developed in 2014, and widely utilized by scientific journals. Authors created a web-based app tenzing designed to make it easier for researchers to plan and record contributions of each team member. The presentation of tenzing is relatively short. Tenzing is a pre-filled Google Sheet (or Excel) template containing all 14 CRediT categories and rows for entering the collaborator’s information. The authors present tenzing as a component that can be used with an existing system (via the underlying R package). Uploading the spreadsheet to the application enables to generate various outputs. The authors provide pictures where they illustrate the use of tenzing on their project. There is no information if other research groups have tested the application.</p>
    <p>I would appreciate having more information on how tenzing is advantageous? In what way is this method more superior to existing ones? Is there any possibility to trace the changes researches make in tenzing?</p>
    <p>Many different components of the same problem emerge in most parts of the manuscript, which illustrates how multidimensional the question is. At the same time, it would be clearer if authors were to focus on a limited inquiry, what part of the problem do authors want to solve? Another possible alternative is to choose a different article type.</p>
    <p>I find the structure of this article unclear. The authors should clarify the following sections: problem definition, proposed solution, discussion, conclusion.</p>
    <p>The main strength of this manuscript is that it addresses a timely question with great potential for improvement. I agree with the authors that there is a need to develop methods and strategies to ensure transparency in the research were contribution plays a significant part. But still, there is an unresolved question regarding what approach would solve the particularly chosen part of the issue.</p>

    <p>Dear Dr. Nwaru,</p>
    <p>We greatly appreciate the five reviews for our manuscript. This provides a lot of value, and not only due to the constructive suggestions - thanks to PLoS’s option for open peer reviews, which we plan to take up, it also provides a public indication of the extent to which our manuscript was vetted and evaluated.</p>
    <p>Response to comment by Napsi Szincsak of PLoS ONE</p>
    <p>After the action letter, I received an email from Napsi Szincsak asking us to address the fact that PLoS ONE has specific guidelines on software sharing. We had already cited the Github page, where the source code is archived. We have now also added an MIT license (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/marton-balazs-kovacs/tenzing/blob/master/LICENSE.md">https://github.com/marton-balazs-kovacs/tenzing/blob/master/LICENSE.md</ext-link>).</p>
    <p>Response to “journal requirements” comments</p>
    <p>-1. Please ensure that your manuscript meets PLOS ONE's style requirements, including those for file naming.</p>
    <p>We have adjusted the title page and believe the rest of the manuscript and files comport with the specified style.</p>
    <p>-2. In your Data Availability statement, you have not specified where the minimal data set underlying the results described in your manuscript can be found. </p>
    <p>That is correct – this is because there is no underlying data set, as there are no results described in the manuscript.</p>
    <p>Response to reviewer 1’s comments</p>
    <p>We appreciate that the reviewer believes the manuscript is interesting and that it achieves its aims of reviewing the state of author/contribution issues and presenting the R package and app for improving things.</p>
    <p>Response to reviewer 2’s comments</p>
    <p>We appreciate the reviewer’s praise for the manuscript as well as the multiple detailed “minor suggestions”.</p>
    <p>It would be interesting to see a bit more discussion raised concerning large(r)-scale projects and group authorship vis-à-vis the CRediT guidelines (e.g., Fontanarosa, Bauchner, &amp; Flanagin, 2017; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2667044">https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2667044</ext-link>). Given that assigning the correct role to authors and collaborators has proven to be difficult, is crediting the entire research group as a whole (and thus no individual authors) perhaps a viable alternative? The specific roles (following, e.g., CRediT guidelines) of each author could then be specified on the group’s website, for instance.</p>
    <p>We agree that group (or consortium, as it is sometimes called) authors is a viable alternative to contributor schemes such as CRediT and use of them has become a strong tradition in some fields, such as genomics. Documenting CRediT information on the group’s website, however, would not be considered a great solution as websites are typically not as permanent as journal article records. We were not aware of the JAMA editorial the reviewer provided, which is helpful, so we have added a paragraph on this with that citation to this section.</p>
    <p>It is unfortunate that the “lead”, “equal”, and “supporting” specifications are not more widely adopted, and thus not a feature of tenzing. While I understand your reasons, I hope that you may add such a feature in coming releases. Perhaps showing how it can be done in practice will lead to faster adoption? </p>
    <p>Indeed, we do think that this is very important to specify in some projects, see some of our discussion here <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/marton-balazs-kovacs/tenzing/issues/15">https://github.com/marton-balazs-kovacs/tenzing/issues/15</ext-link> . As mentioned at the discussion, there is presently no JATS (the underlying machine-readable metadata) specification in CRediT for lead vs. equal vs. supporting, but we expect that the group at the National Information Standards Organization (NISO) presently working on CRediT will address this, which will lead us to move this feature up in the development plan.</p>
    <p>I tested the Shiny app… The papaja YAML output fails to retrieve all roles; all roles are stated as "Conceptualization".</p>
    <p>This error has since been fixed. </p>
    <p>I found the code to be clean, consistent, and nicely commented</p>
    <p>We appreciate your gracious comment.</p>
    <p>I have two feature suggestions that may encourage quicker adoption by users:</p>
    <p>(1) Allow users to create a template from scratch within the Shiny app (thus not having to download a template, edit it, and then upload it). It's a minor issue, but it is always nice to avoid having to move from one program to another. This could be done on a separate tab or page, and the final sheet could shown as a datatable, or similar, to allow editing within the browser (similar to the “Show infosheet” feature, but with editing capabilities). A download button would allow users to save the sheet locally, if need be.</p>
    <p>We have been discussing this feature, but implementing spreadsheet functionality within Shiny is currently beyond our programming resources as well as, possibly, the Shiny hosting infrastructure we have access to. However, we have been exploring the feasibility and usability of users entering into Tenzing the Google Doc URL for their contributorship spreadsheet so that users do not need to download and upload a template.</p>
    <p>(2) It would be helpful to allow for more than two affiliations. Perhaps this could be a dynamic variable?</p>
    <p>Yes, we have been working on this feature for a while, actually, trying different formats for the interface to avoid creating major usability problems. We hope to have it implemented in the next few months.</p>
    <p>• Line 49, missing abbreviation (ISWC) following mention of International Standard Musical Work Code</p>
    <p>•Line 70, CRediT is misspelled as CrediT.</p>
    <p>• Line 169, which is misspelled as whichh.</p>
    <p>Thanks for pointing these out – we have fixed them.</p>
    <p>Response to Reviewer 3’s comments</p>
    <p>The authors describe a very important tool that appears to solve an emerging problem about authorship and contributions to scholarly articles. Their recommended tool is useful, and would help to initiate change in the way in which scientist conduct and report research/outputs.</p>
    <p>Thank you for the positive comments about tenzing.</p>
    <p>one challenge that has not been well elucidated is how to fairly document the depth of involvement by an author per category.</p>
    <p>We agree that this remains a big challenge. The CRediT standard itself has a way to partially address it, by allowing indication of whether a contributor made a “leading”, “equal”, or “supporting” role, but it is not yet fully implemented by CRediT: There is presently no JATS (the underlying machine-readable metadata) specification in CRediT for lead vs. equal vs. supporting, but we expect that the group at the National Information Standards Organization (NISO) presently working on CRediT will address this, which will likely prompt us to move this feature up in the development plan (see some of our discussion here <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/marton-balazs-kovacs/tenzing/issues/15">https://github.com/marton-balazs-kovacs/tenzing/issues/15</ext-link>).</p>
    <p>Response to Reviewer 4’s comments</p>
    <p>The topic itself is interesting and scientifically relevant, and could be suitable for the scope of the journal. Some minor comments for the authors:</p>
    <p>Thank you for the positive comments.</p>
    <p>- The manuscript still needs editing and language revision.</p>
    <p>We have made many edits to improve the wording, as can be seen in the track changes version.</p>
    <p>- The manuscript lacks some important references, for example, in the “introduction” section and “how journals are using CRediT”.</p>
    <p>Thank you for pointing this out - we have now added several references to these sections.</p>
    <p>- The facility of PLoS journals can be provided as a separate figure e.g. Figure 2 (as for eLife)</p>
    <p>Done.</p>
    <p>- Instead of links to external blogs, I recommend authors to provide tables describing different features of CRediT e.g. limitations and applicability.</p>
    <p>Thank you for the suggestion. We have added a table describing the basic features of CRediT (Table 1), which also provides some indication of CRediT’s limitations.</p>
    <p>Response to Reviewer 5’s comments</p>
    <p>I would appreciate having more information on how tenzing is advantageous? In what way is this method more superior to existing ones?</p>
    <p>One reason that this aspect of the manuscript may have appeared lacking is because we don’t know of any alternative methods to tenzing, in the sense of an easy to use (no programming) tool to facilitate CRediT reporting. To address the reviewer’s comment, however, we have added more references to somewhat related approaches, and have added a paragraph about “authorship grids” to better explicate the unique utility of tenzing.</p>
    <p>Is there any possibility to trace the changes researches make in tenzing?</p>
    <p>The researchers enter the contributorship information into a Google Sheet (or they can download that and make changes in a spreadsheet of their choice). Google provides a version history that can be reviewed, for example to understand how contributorship roles evolve during the course of the project.</p>
    <p>Many different components of the same problem emerge in most parts of the manuscript, which illustrates how multidimensional the question is. At the same time, it would be clearer if authors were to focus on a limited inquiry, what part of the problem do authors want to solve? Another possible alternative is to choose a different article type.</p>
    <p>I find the structure of this article unclear. The authors should clarify the following sections: problem definition, proposed solution, discussion, conclusion.</p>
    <p>The main strength of this manuscript is that it addresses a timely question with great potential for improvement. I agree with the authors that there is a need to develop methods and strategies to ensure transparency in the research were contribution plays a significant part. But still, there is an unresolved question regarding what approach would solve the particularly chosen part of the issue.</p>
    <p>We tentatively agree that doing nearly a complete rewrite of the manuscript with the structure proposed by the reviewer should make it clearer to some readers. However, given that the other four reviewers did not suggest that a rewrite was necessary, we prefer not to make too many changes that might perturb the manuscript in a way that might make the other reviewers less happy. We also agree that ideally, an argument could be made that tenzing is the optimal way to address the needs of researchers and the interests of science broadly. However, we make no such claim in the manuscript – instead we aimed only to explain some of the issues and that tenzing partially addresses some of them. We think that the limited rewrite that we have done makes that a bit more clear.</p>
