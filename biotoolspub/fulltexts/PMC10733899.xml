      <p>The market for illicit drugs has
been reshaped by the emergence
of more than 1100 new psychoactive substances (NPS) over the past
decade, posing a major challenge to the forensic and toxicological
laboratories tasked with detecting and identifying them. Tandem mass
spectrometry (MS/MS) is the primary method used to screen for NPS
within seized materials or biological samples. The most contemporary
workflows necessitate labor-intensive and expensive MS/MS reference
standards, which may not be available for recently emerged NPS on
the illicit market. Here, we present NPS-MS, a deep learning method
capable of accurately predicting the MS/MS spectra of known and hypothesized
NPS from their chemical structures alone. NPS-MS is trained by transfer
learning from a generic MS/MS prediction model on a large data set
of MS/MS spectra. We show that this approach enables a more accurate
identification of NPS from experimentally acquired MS/MS spectra than
any existing method. We demonstrate the application of NPS-MS to identify
a novel derivative of phencyclidine (PCP) within an unknown powder
seized in Denmark without the use of any reference standards. We anticipate
that NPS-MS will allow forensic laboratories to identify more rapidly
both known and newly emerging NPS. NPS-MS is available as a web server
at <uri xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://nps-ms.ca/">https://nps-ms.ca/</uri>, which
provides MS/MS spectra prediction capabilities for given NPS compounds.
Additionally, it offers MS/MS spectra identification against a vast
database comprising approximately 8.7 million predicted NPS compounds
from DarkNPS and 24.5 million predicted ESI-QToF-MS/MS spectra for
these compounds.</p>

    <title>Introduction</title>
    <p>Over the past few decades, the illicit
drug market has been reshaped
by the proliferation of novel psychoactive substances (NPS). These
compounds, which are often referred to as designer drugs, synthetic
drugs, or bath salts, are designed to exert the same psychoactive
effects as conventional drugs of abuse (e.g., methamphetamine, cocaine,
and heroin). However, enterprising clandestine chemists introduce
sufficient structural differences into NPS to ensure that they circumvent
the legislative measures imposed around conventional drugs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref></sup> The vast majority of the resulting compounds
have never been tested in humans, and as a result, many NPS(s) have
been associated with life-threatening toxidromes and fatalities.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref></sup> The resulting public health burden has led many
countries to amend their drug laws to include known NPS. Paradoxically,
however, these laws have only resulted in further proliferation of
NPS analogues.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>−<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref></sup> As of the end of 2021, the European Monitoring Centre
for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA) is currently monitoring 830
NPS, with two new NPS emerging per week on average.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref></sup> Globally, as many as 1100 NPS are currently monitored by
the United Nations Office of Drugs and Crime (UNODC) early warning
advisory (EWA).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref></sup></p>
    <p>The proliferation
of NPS presents a major challenge for forensic
chemistry and toxicology laboratories that are tasked with identifying
these compounds. Mass spectrometry (MS) is the primary method used
for NPS detection and identification, with most contemporary screening
workflows relying on the diagnostic product ions produced by tandem
mass spectrometry (MS/MS) for high-confidence NPS identification.
The gold standard for identification of a putative NPS by MS/MS is
through comparison to reference MS/MS data collected from a certified
reference material (CRM), most commonly a synthetic reference standard.
However, the expense of maintaining (and constantly extending) large
collections of CRMs can be formidable.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref></sup> This financial burden is compounded by the rapid rate at which novel
compounds emerge from, and disappear from, the illicit market. By
the time a newly purchased CRM has been integrated into an NPS screening
workflow, the NPS itself may already have disappeared from circulation.
Moreover, for NPS that have just emerged on the illicit market, the
CRMs necessary to detect and identify these compounds may not yet
even be commercially available.</p>
    <p>The limitations of workflows
based on CRMs have led many forensic
laboratories to complement these approaches by performing MS/MS database
matching. This entails the use of in-house MS/MS databases that contain
product and precursor ion data of known or theoretical substances
for which the laboratory does not possess a CRM. This MS/MS information
can be acquired from the scientific literature, monographs by SWGDRUG<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref></sup> or NPS Discovery,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref></sup> and commercial MS/MS libraries (e.g., mzCloud<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref></sup>). MS/MS database matching allows forensic laboratories
to monitor a much larger number of NPS samples in a more cost-effective
way.</p>
    <p>Of particular interest for forensic laboratories is the
crowd-sourced
MS/MS database, HighResNPS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref></sup> HighResNPS represents,
to our knowledge, the largest publicly available database of MS/MS
data for NPS, which has been made available for direct implementation
in NPS screening.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref></sup> However, there are
often very limited MS/MS data on newly emerging NPS compounds. Approximately
one-third of the compounds in the HighResNPS database have missing
product ion information. Many of these compounds have recently been
reported by different drug monitoring agencies but do not yet have
published analytical data.</p>
    <p>The difficulty of acquiring analytical
data for emerging NPS has
led to efforts to predict MS/MS spectra from the chemical structures
of known or hypothesized NPS. Several studies have investigated the
collision-induced dissociation (CID) pathways for established classes
of NPS in order to enable manual prediction of MS/MS spectra for structurally
related compounds.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>−<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref></sup> Unfortunately, this manual prediction of MS/MS spectra is limited
in both throughput and accuracy. Recently, many are using a more viable
solution to overcome the current dearth of experimental MS/MS spectra,
which would be to use <italic>in silico</italic> MS spectral prediction
models capable of accurately predicting MS/MS spectra directly from
a given (known) structure. Programs such as MetFrag<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref></sup> and MAGMa<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref></sup> use heuristic or
combinatorial fragment modeling techniques to predict the position
and likelihood of bond breakages in molecules and the corresponding
MS/MS spectra. Among the most accurate approaches to MS/MS prediction
is an in-house previously described method, i.e., CFM-ID,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>−<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref></sup> which uses machine learning to predict CID pathways for small molecules.
This approach renders the MS/MS spectra predicted by CFM-ID highly
interpretable and explainable as each product ion in a predicted MS/MS
spectrum is assigned a hypothetical fragment structure by the model.
Beyond its interpretability, CFM-ID 4.0 is also a highly accurate
tool, outperforming other popular <italic>in silico</italic> mass
spectra tools when evaluated on the CASMI 2016 Cat3 data set.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref></sup></p>
    <p>The NPS community has already started
to explore the use of CFM-ID
and <italic>in silico</italic>-predicted MS/MS spectra for MS/MS database
matching. For instance, Polettini et al. applied CFM-ID 2.0 to predict
and compare spectra acquired from 99 synthetic cannabinoids (SCs).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref></sup> More recently, we used CFM-ID 4.0 to predict
MS/MS spectra for 8.9 million hypothetical NPS structures anticipated
by a chemical language model, DarkNPS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref></sup> Our findings indicated that the predicted MS/MS spectra could be
used to help identify a substantial number of recently discovered
NPSs. However, we also noted that the agreement between the observed
MS/MS spectra and the predicted CFM-ID MS/MS spectra was highly variable,
especially at higher collision energies.</p>
    <p>Because CFM-ID was
developed to be a very general MS/MS spectral
prediction tool, we investigated the possibility of developing a more
specialized version of CFM-ID that could perform substantially better
on the task of predicting MS/MS spectra specifically for NPS. Here,
we describe this new version of CFM-ID for NPS, which we have dubbed
NPS-MS. NPS-MS was trained exclusively on experimental QTOF MS/MS
spectra acquired from NPS using a technique called “transfer
learning.”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref></sup> We evaluate the accuracy
of NPS-MS for both MS/MS prediction and compound identification and
find that it is substantially more accurate than both earlier versions
of CFM-ID and other widely used tools such as MetFrag<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref></sup> and SIRIUS 4.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref></sup> In this manuscript,
we refer to the MS/MS prediction task as “compound-to-mass
spectrum” or “C2MS” and the compound identification
task as “mass spectrum-to-compound” or “MS2C.”
We anticipate that the performance of NPS-MS is sufficiently good
that it could be routinely and reliably used for the putative identification
of newly emerging NPS, as well as for the identification of never-before-seen
NPS.</p>

      <title>MS/MS Spectra Data Sets</title>
      <p>To train and evaluate NPS-MS,
we assembled a data set comprising 1872 MS/MS spectra for 624 NPS,
obtained from the Institute for Legal Medicine (Johannes Gutenberg
University, Mainz, Germany, <italic>n</italic> = 585 NPS) and ChemCentre
(Perth, Australia, <italic>n</italic> = 39 NPS). The MS/MS data were
acquired using two independent Agilent Technologies quadrupole time-of-flight
mass spectrometer (QTOF) systems. Both systems were operated in positive
electrospray ionization (ESI<sup>+</sup>) with collision energies
of 10, 20, and 40 eV applied for CID experiments of the protonated
precursor ion [M + H]<sup>+</sup>. For each MS/MS spectrum, we obtained
product ion mass-to-charge ratios (<italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic>) and percent relative intensities (% rel. int.) after removing <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> values (peaks) with a relative intensity
less than 3%. The instances were then randomly shuffled and split
into a training set of 494 compounds (1482 spectra) and a held-out
test set of 130 compounds (390 spectra) at approximately an 80:20
ratio.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec2.2">
      <title>NPS-MS Model Training</title>
      <p>The architecture of the NPS-MS
model is based on that previously described for CFM-ID 4.0.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref></sup> Conceptually, for the C2MS task, given an input
molecule, CFM-ID first employs a combinatorial bond cleavage approach
to enumerate all theoretically possible fragments. The output of this
procedure is a molecular fragmentation graph, in which each node represents
a theoretically possible fragment from the parent molecule with one
bond cleavage, and each edge (also known as transition) between nodes
encodes the chance that one fragment directly produces another fragment
through a fragmentation event. The probability of each transition
is estimated by parameters that CFM-ID learns from its training data
set of known molecules and their associated MS/MS spectra. Finally,
CFM-ID uses the fragmentation graph and associated transition probability
estimates to reconstruct the corresponding MS/MS spectrum for the
input molecule. The parameters of CFM-ID are learned from a training
data set of known molecule-MS/MS spectrum pairs, using expectation
maximization (EM) to attempt to optimize a negative-log-likelihood
loss function.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref></sup></p>
      <p>We trained NPS-MS using
a machine learning technique called transfer learning.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref></sup> Transfer learning entails the reuse of a pretrained
model to address a new task or problem. Here, we used the pretrained
model from CFM-ID 4.0, which was trained on a large and diverse data
set of generic MS/MS spectra. We then fine-tuned the learnable parameters
of CFM-ID 4.0 by then training it on a smaller data set of MS/MS spectra
obtained from authentic standards of NPS, as described above. We fine-tuned
NPS-MS by freezing all but the last layer of the neural network in
CFM-ID 4.0 during the retraining process. For comparison, we also
trained a model with an identical architecture to CFM-ID 4.0 from
scratch on the NPS-MS/MS spectra data set. We refer to this model
as “NPS-MS <italic>De Novo</italic>.” For both models,
training was limited to 30 iterations of the EM algorithm, and within
each iteration, the neural network training was limited to 600 minibatches.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec2.3">
      <title>Model Evaluation</title>
      <p>We evaluated the performance of NPS-MS
on two tasks. In the first task, we applied NPS-MS to predict the
MS/MS spectra of known NPS, and then we directly evaluated the accuracy
of the MS/MS spectrum predictions (C2MS Tasks). In the second task,
we used NPS-MS to identify known and unknown NPS from the experimentally
acquired MS/MS spectra. That is, we first applied NPS-MS to predict
MS/MS spectra for every molecule within a data set of known NPS chemical
structures and then searched experimentally acquired MS/MS spectra
against this data set of predicted spectra to match the experimentally
acquired spectra to chemical structures (MS2C Tasks).</p>
      <p>The primary
evaluation metric in the C2MS task was the Dice coefficient, which
quantifies the similarity between experimental and predicted MS/MS
spectra by measuring the ratio between the number of matched peaks
and the total number of peaks. We also used the dot product (also
known as the cosine similarity) as a secondary measure of MS/MS spectral
similarity. This method computes the cosine of the angle between the
unit vectors obtained from two MS/MS spectra and, therefore, considers
both the <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> values of each peak
as well as their relative intensities. In addition, we also measured
the precision and recall between the peaks in the experimental and
predicted MS/MS spectra to further understand the performance of NPS-MS
and the baseline models to which it was compared. Precision measures
the number of peaks in the predicted spectra that are also present
in the experimental spectra. Conversely, recall measures the percentage
of peaks in the experimental spectra that are correctly predicted.</p>
      <p>For the MS2C task, we evaluated the accuracy of compound identification
when searching in three different data sets of NPS chemical structures.
Data Set #1 comprised the dedicated NPS compound candidate database,
HighResNPS,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref></sup> consisting of 1922 compounds.
Data Set #2 constructed a more diverse library of candidate structures
by supplementing HighResNPS with the PubChem chemical structure database,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref></sup> comprising an additional 94.7 million compounds.
Data Set #3 consisted of both the known NPS structures from HighResNPS,
as well as a library of 8.9 million theoretical NPS compounds generated
by DarkNPS,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref></sup> a chemical language model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">32</xref>−<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref35">35</xref></sup> trained on known NPS, which we previously demonstrated to be capable
of anticipating the structures of novel NPS that subsequently emerge
on the illicit market.</p>
      <p>For each NPS data set, the experimentally
measured precursor ion <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> was used
to filter the data set to
generate a subset of potential candidates, using a window of ±10
ppm. The predicted MS/MS spectra of each candidate were then compared
with the experimental MS/MS spectra to identify the top-scoring spectral
matches. To avoid overestimating performance, we required that there
were at least three candidates from each precursor ion. Each of the
three NPS structural databases was preprocessed by removing all charged
and zwitterionic chemicals. Stereochemistry was removed, and the resulting
compounds merged into their base form. Spectral matches were scored
and ranked based on the average of the Dice coefficient and dot product.
The performance of each C2MS model was evaluated by using a cost score.
In this setting, a cost score was assigned to each compound identification
based on the rank relative to the correct answer, considering the
possibility of equally ranked candidates. This cost score reflects
the amount of expected MS/MS experiments required to reach the ground
truth compound, given a list of identification results for a single
task. Details of this score can be found in the Supporting Information
(SI): <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.analchem.3c02413/suppl_file/ac3c02413_si_001.pdf">Details for Cost Score</ext-link>.</p>
      <p>In
cases in which the top-ranked spectral match does not correspond
to the ground truth NPS, we also assessed the structural similarity
between the ground truth NPS and the top-ranked candidates. Structural
similarity was quantified using the Tanimoto coefficient between ECFP4
fingerprints<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref37">37</xref></sup> and the Euclidean distance between
Continuous and Data-Driven Descriptors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref38">38</xref></sup> (CDDD) representations. The CDDD is a 512-dimensional continuous
representation of a given compound generated by a deep learning model.
If the top-ranked compound is the correct compound, the CDDD distance
will be zero, whereas if multiple candidates are ranked equally, the
Tanimoto coefficient and CDDD distances are averaged over all equally
ranked candidates.</p>

      <p>For the C2MS task, we compared NPS-MS and the version of NPS-MS
trained without transfer learning (i.e., NPS-MS <italic>De Novo</italic>) to CFM-ID 2.0<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref></sup> and CFM-ID 4.0.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref></sup> (We did not consider CFM-ID 3.0,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref></sup> which was released in 2019, as it differed from
CFM-ID 2.0 primarily in the incorporation of hand-crafted fragmentation
rules to improve the handling of lipids.) For the MS2C task, we evaluated
the performance of all four methods used in the C2MS task, as well
as MetFrag<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref></sup> and SIRIUS 4.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref></sup> Interestingly, MetFrag could only be evaluated against
Data sets #1 and #2 since several structures in Data Set #3 cause
it to crash. Only results using the 20 eV spectra are reported here,

      <title>NPS-MS Enables Accurate MS/MS Spectrum Prediction</title>
      <p>We
initially assessed its ability to predict MS/MS spectra for molecules
in the test set (i.e., the C2MS task). We compared NPS-MS to an identical
model trained without transfer learning (NPS-MS <italic>De Novo</italic>), as well as two generic MS/MS prediction models (CFM-ID, versions
2.0 and 4.0). The performance of each model was quantified by using
the average Dice coefficient and dot product of predicted MS/MS spectra
against the held-out test set, as summarized in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref></xref>. In general, models designed specifically
to predict MS/MS spectra for NPS (NPS-MS and NP-MS <italic>De Novo</italic>) outperformed generic MS/MS prediction models (CFM-ID versions 2.0
and 4.0). Specifically, NPS-MS (Dice coefficient = 0.55; dot product
= 0.67) and NPS-MS <italic>De Novo</italic> (Dice coefficient = 0.62;
dot product = 0.69) outperformed CFM-ID 4.0 by margins of 44 and 59%,
respectively, as quantified by the Dice coefficient and by margins
of 72 and 77%, as quantified by the dot product. Notably, for 36 of
the 390 MS/MS spectra in the test data set (9.2%), NPS-MS predictions
achieved a perfect Dice coefficient of 1.0, as compared to just 10
(2.6%) for CFM-ID 4.0. Detailed discussion of individual predicted
MS/MS is provided in the <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.analchem.3c02413/suppl_file/ac3c02413_si_001.pdf">SI</ext-link> under Inspection

      <p>In addition, we observed that the mean recall values
of CFM-ID
and NPS-MS were essentially identical. Instead, the improved performance
of NPS-MS over CFM-ID can be attributed to a nearly 3-fold increase
in the precision of NPS-MS. In other words, although CFM-ID can correctly
predict true-positive peaks that appear in the experimentally acquired
MS/MS spectra of known NPS, it also predicts many false-positive peaks.</p>

asked whether these more accurate MS/MS spectra would, in turn, enable
more accurate compound identification. In this task, we first used
NPS-MS to predict MS/MS spectra for a data set of NPS chemical structures
and then searched the experimentally measured MS/MS spectra against
this database of predicted spectra.</p>
      <p>We evaluated the performance
of NPS-MS when using three different chemical structure databases
of varying sizes and diversity as input. Data Set #1 comprised the
1922 compounds in the HighResNPS database. Data Set #2 supplemented
HighResNPS with 94.7 million compounds from PubChem. Data Set #3 supplemented
HighResNPS with 8.9 million hypothetical NPS structures anticipated

to the four models evaluated on the C2MS task. The performance of
each method was quantified using the cost score, an extension of the

      <p>In Data Set #1, NPS-MS correctly identified the
ground truth
NPS
as the highest-ranked candidate in 69.8% (<italic>n</italic> = 37)
of cases. This represented an improvement of 12.0 and 15.4% over CFM-ID
versions 2.0 and 4.0, respectively, as well as an improvement of 270%
over MetFrag. The MS2C performance difference between each method
diminished rapidly with increasing cost scores. This can likely be
attributed to the small number of candidates per experimental MS/MS
spectrum in this data set, which renders compound identification far
less challenging than in more diverse databases such as Data sets
#2 and #3.</p>
      <p>In Data Set #2, NPS-MS achieved a 58.4% cost-1 score,
an improvement
of 165 and 136% over CFM-ID 3.0 and 4.0, respectively, and 250% better
than MetFrag. This performance improvement was observed consistently
for varying cost scores: for instance, NPS-MS achieved an 80% improvement
in the cost-5 score compared to CFM-ID 4.0. Moreover, in cases in
which NPS-MS failed to correctly identify the ground truth NPS, the
top-ranked candidate was generally structurally similar to the correct
compound. For example, the top-3 candidates predicted by NPS-MS from
Data Set #2 based on the MS/MS spectra of ocfentanil (i.e., 2-fluoromethoxyacetyl
fentanyl; 2-methoxy-<italic>N</italic>-(1-phenethylpiperidin-4-yl)-<italic>N</italic>-2-fluorophenylacetamide) were all clearly structurally
related to ocfentanil (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref></xref>a). In this example, the correct structure was the third-highest

by CFM-ID 4.0 hardly resembled the correct structure, with Tanimoto

      <p>Finally, we evaluated the
performance of NPS-MS when searching
against a database of 8.9 million predicted NPS structures anticipated
by our previously described chemical language model, DarkNPS (Data
Set #3). This data set presents a unique challenge for compound identification,
since the DarkNPS compounds are far less chemically diverse than the
candidates in PubChem (Data Set #2), and thus more difficult to distinguish.
Consequently, the performance of both CFM-ID and NPS-MS was generally
lower than in Data sets #1 and #2, with NPS-MS achieving a cost-1
score of 25.8%. However, this nonetheless represented an improvement
of 416% compared with CFM-ID 4.0. NPS-MS was also 474% better than
CFM-ID 4.0 in terms of the cost-5 score. Notably, NPS-MS also achieved
a substantial improvement over NPS-MS <italic>De Novo</italic> in
this data set (cost-1 score, 20.3%). The improved identification performance
of NPS-MS over NPS-MS <italic>De Novo</italic> can be attributed to
the use of transfer learning, which allowed NPS-MS to inherit more
general knowledge about bond fragmentation captured by CFM-ID 4.0.</p>

      <title>NPS-MS Enables Identification of NPS without Reference Materials
in Forensic Samples</title>
      <p>In January 2022, the Danish Customs Agency
(Toldstyrelsen) seized an unknown powder that was then submitted to
the Section of Forensic Chemistry (Retskemisk Afdeling) at the University
of Copenhagen for analysis. Routine analysis using a Waters Corporation
LC-QTOF-MS revealed the main constituent of the powder to be the novel
arylcyclohexylamine 3-chloro-phencyclidine (3-Cl-PCP), which had first
emerged on the illicit market in December 2020. Although the identity
of the powder was determined without the use of NPS-MS, we believed
this would be a useful example to simulate the applicability of NPS-MS
in a forensic chemistry context, given that this NPS was unknown until
very recently and consequently could not have been identified using
a workflow that relied exclusively on CRMs.</p>
      <p>We first asked whether
NPS-MS was capable of accurately predicting the MS/MS spectra of 3-Cl-PCP,
which was not part of either the training or test data sets. We also
applied NPS-MS to predict the MS/MS spectra of 2-Cl-PCP and 4-Cl-PCP,
two other known chlorinated PCP derivatives (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.analchem.3c02413/suppl_file/ac3c02413_si_001.pdf">Figure S4a</ext-link>). Inspection of the resulting predicted spectra revealed
excellent correspondence between the predicted and experimentally
acquired 3-Cl-PCP spectra with an average Dice coefficient of 0.66
and an average dot product of 0.72. Moreover, for all three PCP derivatives,
the major <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> peaks at each collision
energy were correctly predicted, with the lone exception being <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> 125.0153 for 2-Cl-PCP. This corresponds
to the 2-chlorophenyl cation, [C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>4</sub>Cl]<sup>+</sup>. This application also underscores the interpretability of NPS-MS,
with each predicted <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> value assigned
a corresponding fragment ion structure (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.analchem.3c02413/suppl_file/ac3c02413_si_001.pdf">Figure S4b</ext-link>). While we are aware that the proposed structures for some
of the product ions are unlikely to exist, potentially undergoing
rearrangement or cyclization (e.g., structures 5, 8, 10, and 13),
the major product ions (i.e., 1, 2, and 3) that were proposed, are
close to what is likely to exist in the gas-phase based on the proposed
pathways for other phencyclidine-related compounds.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref41">41</xref></sup></p>
      <p>As a further test of NPS-MS, we asked whether searching
the experimentally
acquired spectra for 3-Cl-PCP against Data Set #3 would have led to
the identification of this unknown NPS, given that 3-Cl-PCP was among
the novel NPS structures anticipated by DarkNPS. To this end, we applied
NPS-MS to predict MS/MS spectra for a total of 1582 compounds in Data
Set #3 with a precursor mass within 10 ppm of 3-Cl-PCP. Strikingly,
among these 1582 candidates, 3-Cl-PCP correctly emerged as the top-ranked
candidate (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref></xref>b). Moreover, the second-ranked candidate was the structurally related
derivative 4-Cl-PCP. Interestingly, the third-ranked compound was
not 2-Cl-PCP but a structurally related isomer, wherein the cyclohexane
ring is replaced with a 2-methylcyclopentane ring (i.e., 1-[1-(3-chlorophenyl)-2-methylcyclopentyl]piperidine).
In contrast, the candidates suggested by CFM-ID 4.0, while structurally
related to 3-Cl-PCP, did not include the correct compound. Instead,
the top-ranked compound was the 2,2-dimethylcyclopropyl derivative
with the chlorine atom at position 4 (i.e., 1-[1-(4-chlorophenyl)-2,2-dimethylcyclopropyl]piperidine).
Collectively, these observations highlight the potential applications
of NPS-MS to identify previously unknown NPS within real forensic
samples.</p>

    <title>Conclusions</title>
    <p>Here, we present NPS-MS,
and we demonstrate that it can accurately
predict MS/MS spectra for both known and predicted NPS chemical structures.
By leveraging transfer learning from a generic MS/MS prediction model,
we show that NPS-MS can generate remarkably accurate MS/MS spectra
in a variety of C2MS tests and substantially outperforms generic models
on this task. Moreover, we demonstrate that this highly accurate MS/MS
spectrum prediction, in turn, enables substantially more accurate
identification of known NPS on a variety of MS2C tasks, even when
searching in databases comprising millions of chemical structures.
NPS-MS can be also used in conjunction with DarkNPS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref></sup> to search experimentally acquired MS/MS spectra against
unknown NPS structures anticipated by a chemical language model, and
in a retrospective evaluation, we show that NPS-MS would have enabled
the identification of a previously unknown PCP derivative without
the use of any reference materials. Collectively, these results open
the possibility of using NPS-MS to identify emerging NPSs for which
reference MS/MS spectra are not yet available or even never-before-seen
NPS, within law enforcement seizures or biological samples. The improvement
in prediction accuracy for NPS-MS can be largely attributed to the
fact that it was optimized to work with NPS-like compounds. Future
research could explore the potential of transfer learning to enhance
CFM-ID for other specific subdomains, specifically, the relationship
between prediction performance and structure diversity for targeted
data sets.</p>

      <p>The market for illicit drugs has
been reshaped by the emergence
of more than 1100 new psychoactive substances (NPS) over the past
decade, posing a major challenge to the forensic and toxicological
laboratories tasked with detecting and identifying them. Tandem mass
spectrometry (MS/MS) is the primary method used to screen for NPS
within seized materials or biological samples. The most contemporary
workflows necessitate labor-intensive and expensive MS/MS reference
standards, which may not be available for recently emerged NPS on
the illicit market. Here, we present NPS-MS, a deep learning method
capable of accurately predicting the MS/MS spectra of known and hypothesized
NPS from their chemical structures alone. NPS-MS is trained by transfer
learning from a generic MS/MS prediction model on a large data set
of MS/MS spectra. We show that this approach enables a more accurate
identification of NPS from experimentally acquired MS/MS spectra than
any existing method. We demonstrate the application of NPS-MS to identify
a novel derivative of phencyclidine (PCP) within an unknown powder
seized in Denmark without the use of any reference standards. We anticipate
that NPS-MS will allow forensic laboratories to identify more rapidly
both known and newly emerging NPS. NPS-MS is available as a web server
at <uri xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://nps-ms.ca/">https://nps-ms.ca/</uri>, which
provides MS/MS spectra prediction capabilities for given NPS compounds.
Additionally, it offers MS/MS spectra identification against a vast
database comprising approximately 8.7 million predicted NPS compounds
from DarkNPS and 24.5 million predicted ESI-QToF-MS/MS spectra for
these compounds.</p>

    <title>Introduction</title>
    <p>Over the past few decades, the illicit
drug market has been reshaped
by the proliferation of novel psychoactive substances (NPS). These
compounds, which are often referred to as designer drugs, synthetic
drugs, or bath salts, are designed to exert the same psychoactive
effects as conventional drugs of abuse (e.g., methamphetamine, cocaine,
and heroin). However, enterprising clandestine chemists introduce
sufficient structural differences into NPS to ensure that they circumvent
the legislative measures imposed around conventional drugs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref></sup> The vast majority of the resulting compounds
have never been tested in humans, and as a result, many NPS(s) have
been associated with life-threatening toxidromes and fatalities.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref></sup> The resulting public health burden has led many
countries to amend their drug laws to include known NPS. Paradoxically,
however, these laws have only resulted in further proliferation of
NPS analogues.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>−<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref></sup> As of the end of 2021, the European Monitoring Centre
for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA) is currently monitoring 830
NPS, with two new NPS emerging per week on average.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref></sup> Globally, as many as 1100 NPS are currently monitored by
the United Nations Office of Drugs and Crime (UNODC) early warning
advisory (EWA).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref></sup></p>
    <p>The proliferation
of NPS presents a major challenge for forensic
chemistry and toxicology laboratories that are tasked with identifying
these compounds. Mass spectrometry (MS) is the primary method used
for NPS detection and identification, with most contemporary screening
workflows relying on the diagnostic product ions produced by tandem
mass spectrometry (MS/MS) for high-confidence NPS identification.
The gold standard for identification of a putative NPS by MS/MS is
through comparison to reference MS/MS data collected from a certified
reference material (CRM), most commonly a synthetic reference standard.
However, the expense of maintaining (and constantly extending) large
collections of CRMs can be formidable.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref></sup> This financial burden is compounded by the rapid rate at which novel
compounds emerge from, and disappear from, the illicit market. By
the time a newly purchased CRM has been integrated into an NPS screening
workflow, the NPS itself may already have disappeared from circulation.
Moreover, for NPS that have just emerged on the illicit market, the
CRMs necessary to detect and identify these compounds may not yet
even be commercially available.</p>
    <p>The limitations of workflows
based on CRMs have led many forensic
laboratories to complement these approaches by performing MS/MS database
matching. This entails the use of in-house MS/MS databases that contain
product and precursor ion data of known or theoretical substances
for which the laboratory does not possess a CRM. This MS/MS information
can be acquired from the scientific literature, monographs by SWGDRUG<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref></sup> or NPS Discovery,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref></sup> and commercial MS/MS libraries (e.g., mzCloud<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref></sup>). MS/MS database matching allows forensic laboratories
to monitor a much larger number of NPS samples in a more cost-effective
way.</p>
    <p>Of particular interest for forensic laboratories is the
crowd-sourced
MS/MS database, HighResNPS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref></sup> HighResNPS represents,
to our knowledge, the largest publicly available database of MS/MS
data for NPS, which has been made available for direct implementation
in NPS screening.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref></sup> However, there are
often very limited MS/MS data on newly emerging NPS compounds. Approximately
one-third of the compounds in the HighResNPS database have missing
product ion information. Many of these compounds have recently been
reported by different drug monitoring agencies but do not yet have
published analytical data.</p>
    <p>The difficulty of acquiring analytical
data for emerging NPS has
led to efforts to predict MS/MS spectra from the chemical structures
of known or hypothesized NPS. Several studies have investigated the
collision-induced dissociation (CID) pathways for established classes
of NPS in order to enable manual prediction of MS/MS spectra for structurally
related compounds.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>−<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref></sup> Unfortunately, this manual prediction of MS/MS spectra is limited
in both throughput and accuracy. Recently, many are using a more viable
solution to overcome the current dearth of experimental MS/MS spectra,
which would be to use <italic>in silico</italic> MS spectral prediction
models capable of accurately predicting MS/MS spectra directly from
a given (known) structure. Programs such as MetFrag<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref></sup> and MAGMa<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref></sup> use heuristic or
combinatorial fragment modeling techniques to predict the position
and likelihood of bond breakages in molecules and the corresponding
MS/MS spectra. Among the most accurate approaches to MS/MS prediction
is an in-house previously described method, i.e., CFM-ID,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>−<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref></sup> which uses machine learning to predict CID pathways for small molecules.
This approach renders the MS/MS spectra predicted by CFM-ID highly
interpretable and explainable as each product ion in a predicted MS/MS
spectrum is assigned a hypothetical fragment structure by the model.
Beyond its interpretability, CFM-ID 4.0 is also a highly accurate
tool, outperforming other popular <italic>in silico</italic> mass
spectra tools when evaluated on the CASMI 2016 Cat3 data set.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref></sup></p>
    <p>The NPS community has already started
to explore the use of CFM-ID
and <italic>in silico</italic>-predicted MS/MS spectra for MS/MS database
matching. For instance, Polettini et al. applied CFM-ID 2.0 to predict
and compare spectra acquired from 99 synthetic cannabinoids (SCs).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref></sup> More recently, we used CFM-ID 4.0 to predict
MS/MS spectra for 8.9 million hypothetical NPS structures anticipated
by a chemical language model, DarkNPS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref></sup> Our findings indicated that the predicted MS/MS spectra could be
used to help identify a substantial number of recently discovered
NPSs. However, we also noted that the agreement between the observed
MS/MS spectra and the predicted CFM-ID MS/MS spectra was highly variable,
especially at higher collision energies.</p>
    <p>Because CFM-ID was
developed to be a very general MS/MS spectral
prediction tool, we investigated the possibility of developing a more
specialized version of CFM-ID that could perform substantially better
on the task of predicting MS/MS spectra specifically for NPS. Here,
we describe this new version of CFM-ID for NPS, which we have dubbed
NPS-MS. NPS-MS was trained exclusively on experimental QTOF MS/MS
spectra acquired from NPS using a technique called “transfer
learning.”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref></sup> We evaluate the accuracy
of NPS-MS for both MS/MS prediction and compound identification and
find that it is substantially more accurate than both earlier versions
of CFM-ID and other widely used tools such as MetFrag<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref></sup> and SIRIUS 4.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref></sup> In this manuscript,
we refer to the MS/MS prediction task as “compound-to-mass
spectrum” or “C2MS” and the compound identification
task as “mass spectrum-to-compound” or “MS2C.”
We anticipate that the performance of NPS-MS is sufficiently good
that it could be routinely and reliably used for the putative identification
of newly emerging NPS, as well as for the identification of never-before-seen
NPS.</p>

    <sec id="sec2.1">
      <title>MS/MS Spectra Data Sets</title>
      <p>To train and evaluate NPS-MS,
we assembled a data set comprising 1872 MS/MS spectra for 624 NPS,
obtained from the Institute for Legal Medicine (Johannes Gutenberg
University, Mainz, Germany, <italic>n</italic> = 585 NPS) and ChemCentre
(Perth, Australia, <italic>n</italic> = 39 NPS). The MS/MS data were
acquired using two independent Agilent Technologies quadrupole time-of-flight
mass spectrometer (QTOF) systems. Both systems were operated in positive
electrospray ionization (ESI<sup>+</sup>) with collision energies
of 10, 20, and 40 eV applied for CID experiments of the protonated
precursor ion [M + H]<sup>+</sup>. For each MS/MS spectrum, we obtained
product ion mass-to-charge ratios (<italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic>) and percent relative intensities (% rel. int.) after removing <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> values (peaks) with a relative intensity
less than 3%. The instances were then randomly shuffled and split
into a training set of 494 compounds (1482 spectra) and a held-out
test set of 130 compounds (390 spectra) at approximately an 80:20
ratio.</p>

    <sec id="sec2.2">
      <title>NPS-MS Model Training</title>
      <p>The architecture of the NPS-MS
model is based on that previously described for CFM-ID 4.0.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref></sup> Conceptually, for the C2MS task, given an input
molecule, CFM-ID first employs a combinatorial bond cleavage approach
to enumerate all theoretically possible fragments. The output of this
procedure is a molecular fragmentation graph, in which each node represents
a theoretically possible fragment from the parent molecule with one
bond cleavage, and each edge (also known as transition) between nodes
encodes the chance that one fragment directly produces another fragment
through a fragmentation event. The probability of each transition
is estimated by parameters that CFM-ID learns from its training data
set of known molecules and their associated MS/MS spectra. Finally,
CFM-ID uses the fragmentation graph and associated transition probability
estimates to reconstruct the corresponding MS/MS spectrum for the
input molecule. The parameters of CFM-ID are learned from a training
data set of known molecule-MS/MS spectrum pairs, using expectation
maximization (EM) to attempt to optimize a negative-log-likelihood
loss function.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref></sup></p>
      <p>We trained NPS-MS using
a machine learning technique called transfer learning.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref></sup> Transfer learning entails the reuse of a pretrained
model to address a new task or problem. Here, we used the pretrained
model from CFM-ID 4.0, which was trained on a large and diverse data
set of generic MS/MS spectra. We then fine-tuned the learnable parameters
of CFM-ID 4.0 by then training it on a smaller data set of MS/MS spectra
obtained from authentic standards of NPS, as described above. We fine-tuned
NPS-MS by freezing all but the last layer of the neural network in
CFM-ID 4.0 during the retraining process. For comparison, we also
trained a model with an identical architecture to CFM-ID 4.0 from
scratch on the NPS-MS/MS spectra data set. We refer to this model
as “NPS-MS <italic>De Novo</italic>.” For both models,
training was limited to 30 iterations of the EM algorithm, and within
each iteration, the neural network training was limited to 600 minibatches.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec2.3">
      <title>Model Evaluation</title>
      <p>We evaluated the performance of NPS-MS
on two tasks. In the first task, we applied NPS-MS to predict the
MS/MS spectra of known NPS, and then we directly evaluated the accuracy
of the MS/MS spectrum predictions (C2MS Tasks). In the second task,
we used NPS-MS to identify known and unknown NPS from the experimentally
acquired MS/MS spectra. That is, we first applied NPS-MS to predict
MS/MS spectra for every molecule within a data set of known NPS chemical
structures and then searched experimentally acquired MS/MS spectra
against this data set of predicted spectra to match the experimentally
acquired spectra to chemical structures (MS2C Tasks).</p>
      <p>The primary
evaluation metric in the C2MS task was the Dice coefficient, which
quantifies the similarity between experimental and predicted MS/MS
spectra by measuring the ratio between the number of matched peaks
and the total number of peaks. We also used the dot product (also
known as the cosine similarity) as a secondary measure of MS/MS spectral
similarity. This method computes the cosine of the angle between the
unit vectors obtained from two MS/MS spectra and, therefore, considers
both the <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> values of each peak
as well as their relative intensities. In addition, we also measured
the precision and recall between the peaks in the experimental and
predicted MS/MS spectra to further understand the performance of NPS-MS
and the baseline models to which it was compared. Precision measures
the number of peaks in the predicted spectra that are also present
in the experimental spectra. Conversely, recall measures the percentage
of peaks in the experimental spectra that are correctly predicted.</p>
      <p>For the MS2C task, we evaluated the accuracy of compound identification
when searching in three different data sets of NPS chemical structures.
Data Set #1 comprised the dedicated NPS compound candidate database,
HighResNPS,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref></sup> consisting of 1922 compounds.
Data Set #2 constructed a more diverse library of candidate structures
by supplementing HighResNPS with the PubChem chemical structure database,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref></sup> comprising an additional 94.7 million compounds.
Data Set #3 consisted of both the known NPS structures from HighResNPS,
as well as a library of 8.9 million theoretical NPS compounds generated
by DarkNPS,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref></sup> a chemical language model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">32</xref>−<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref35">35</xref></sup> trained on known NPS, which we previously demonstrated to be capable
of anticipating the structures of novel NPS that subsequently emerge
on the illicit market.</p>
      <p>For each NPS data set, the experimentally
measured precursor ion <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> was used
to filter the data set to
generate a subset of potential candidates, using a window of ±10
ppm. The predicted MS/MS spectra of each candidate were then compared
with the experimental MS/MS spectra to identify the top-scoring spectral
matches. To avoid overestimating performance, we required that there
were at least three candidates from each precursor ion. Each of the
three NPS structural databases was preprocessed by removing all charged
and zwitterionic chemicals. Stereochemistry was removed, and the resulting
compounds merged into their base form. Spectral matches were scored
and ranked based on the average of the Dice coefficient and dot product.
The performance of each C2MS model was evaluated by using a cost score.
In this setting, a cost score was assigned to each compound identification
based on the rank relative to the correct answer, considering the
possibility of equally ranked candidates. This cost score reflects
the amount of expected MS/MS experiments required to reach the ground
truth compound, given a list of identification results for a single
task. Details of this score can be found in the Supporting Information
(SI): <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.analchem.3c02413/suppl_file/ac3c02413_si_001.pdf">Details for Cost Score</ext-link>.</p>
      <p>In
cases in which the top-ranked spectral match does not correspond
to the ground truth NPS, we also assessed the structural similarity
between the ground truth NPS and the top-ranked candidates. Structural
similarity was quantified using the Tanimoto coefficient between ECFP4
fingerprints<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref37">37</xref></sup> and the Euclidean distance between
Continuous and Data-Driven Descriptors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref38">38</xref></sup> (CDDD) representations. The CDDD is a 512-dimensional continuous
representation of a given compound generated by a deep learning model.
If the top-ranked compound is the correct compound, the CDDD distance
will be zero, whereas if multiple candidates are ranked equally, the
Tanimoto coefficient and CDDD distances are averaged over all equally
ranked candidates.</p>

of NPS-MS
on the compound-to-mass spectrum and mass spectrum-to-compound tasks

      <p>For the C2MS task, we compared NPS-MS and the version of NPS-MS
trained without transfer learning (i.e., NPS-MS <italic>De Novo</italic>) to CFM-ID 2.0<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref></sup> and CFM-ID 4.0.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref></sup> (We did not consider CFM-ID 3.0,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref></sup> which was released in 2019, as it differed from
CFM-ID 2.0 primarily in the incorporation of hand-crafted fragmentation
rules to improve the handling of lipids.) For the MS2C task, we evaluated
the performance of all four methods used in the C2MS task, as well
as MetFrag<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref></sup> and SIRIUS 4.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref></sup> Interestingly, MetFrag could only be evaluated against
Data sets #1 and #2 since several structures in Data Set #3 cause
it to crash. Only results using the 20 eV spectra are reported here,
as MetFrag performed much better when using this collision energy
compared to others. SIRIUS 4 was only evaluated against a subset of
Data Set #2 since its underlying model (CSI:FingerID<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref39">39</xref></sup>) was trained on a number of NPS, some of which were present
in our test set.</p>

      <title>NPS-MS Enables Accurate MS/MS Spectrum Prediction</title>
      <p>We
initially assessed its ability to predict MS/MS spectra for molecules
in the test set (i.e., the C2MS task). We compared NPS-MS to an identical
model trained without transfer learning (NPS-MS <italic>De Novo</italic>), as well as two generic MS/MS prediction models (CFM-ID, versions
2.0 and 4.0). The performance of each model was quantified by using
the average Dice coefficient and dot product of predicted MS/MS spectra
against the held-out test set, as summarized in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref></xref>. In general, models designed specifically
to predict MS/MS spectra for NPS (NPS-MS and NP-MS <italic>De Novo</italic>) outperformed generic MS/MS prediction models (CFM-ID versions 2.0
and 4.0). Specifically, NPS-MS (Dice coefficient = 0.55; dot product
= 0.67) and NPS-MS <italic>De Novo</italic> (Dice coefficient = 0.62;
dot product = 0.69) outperformed CFM-ID 4.0 by margins of 44 and 59%,
respectively, as quantified by the Dice coefficient and by margins
of 72 and 77%, as quantified by the dot product. Notably, for 36 of
the 390 MS/MS spectra in the test data set (9.2%), NPS-MS predictions
achieved a perfect Dice coefficient of 1.0, as compared to just 10
(2.6%) for CFM-ID 4.0. Detailed discussion of individual predicted
MS/MS is provided in the <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.analchem.3c02413/suppl_file/ac3c02413_si_001.pdf">SI</ext-link> under Inspection

      <p>In addition, we observed that the mean recall values
of CFM-ID
and NPS-MS were essentially identical. Instead, the improved performance
of NPS-MS over CFM-ID can be attributed to a nearly 3-fold increase
in the precision of NPS-MS. In other words, although CFM-ID can correctly
predict true-positive peaks that appear in the experimentally acquired
MS/MS spectra of known NPS, it also predicts many false-positive peaks.</p>

      <title>NPS-MS Enables Accurate Compound Identification from Experimental
MS/MS Spectra</title>
      <p>Having shown that NPS-MS affords a substantial
increase in the accuracy of the MS/MS spectrum prediction, we next
asked whether these more accurate MS/MS spectra would, in turn, enable
more accurate compound identification. In this task, we first used
NPS-MS to predict MS/MS spectra for a data set of NPS chemical structures
and then searched the experimentally measured MS/MS spectra against
this database of predicted spectra.</p>
      <p>We evaluated the performance
of NPS-MS when using three different chemical structure databases
of varying sizes and diversity as input. Data Set #1 comprised the
1922 compounds in the HighResNPS database. Data Set #2 supplemented
HighResNPS with 94.7 million compounds from PubChem. Data Set #3 supplemented
HighResNPS with 8.9 million hypothetical NPS structures anticipated
by DarkNPS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref></sup> We compared the performance

to the four models evaluated on the C2MS task. The performance of
each method was quantified using the cost score, an extension of the
top-<italic>k</italic> accuracy that is robust to the presence of
ties (Methods). In addition, we quantified the structural similarity

      <p>In Data Set #1, NPS-MS correctly identified the
ground truth
NPS
as the highest-ranked candidate in 69.8% (<italic>n</italic> = 37)
of cases. This represented an improvement of 12.0 and 15.4% over CFM-ID
versions 2.0 and 4.0, respectively, as well as an improvement of 270%
over MetFrag. The MS2C performance difference between each method
diminished rapidly with increasing cost scores. This can likely be
attributed to the small number of candidates per experimental MS/MS
spectrum in this data set, which renders compound identification far
less challenging than in more diverse databases such as Data sets
#2 and #3.</p>
      <p>In Data Set #2, NPS-MS achieved a 58.4% cost-1 score,
an improvement
of 165 and 136% over CFM-ID 3.0 and 4.0, respectively, and 250% better
than MetFrag. This performance improvement was observed consistently
for varying cost scores: for instance, NPS-MS achieved an 80% improvement
in the cost-5 score compared to CFM-ID 4.0. Moreover, in cases in
which NPS-MS failed to correctly identify the ground truth NPS, the
top-ranked candidate was generally structurally similar to the correct
compound. For example, the top-3 candidates predicted by NPS-MS from
Data Set #2 based on the MS/MS spectra of ocfentanil (i.e., 2-fluoromethoxyacetyl
fentanyl; 2-methoxy-<italic>N</italic>-(1-phenethylpiperidin-4-yl)-<italic>N</italic>-2-fluorophenylacetamide) were all clearly structurally
related to ocfentanil (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref></xref>a). In this example, the correct structure was the third-highest
scoring candidate, while the top-2 candidates were its 3-fluoro (<italic>T</italic><sub>c</sub> = 0.64) and 4-fluoro (<italic>T</italic><sub>c</sub> = 0.67) isomers. In contrast, the top-3 candidates given
by CFM-ID 4.0 hardly resembled the correct structure, with Tanimoto
coefficients of just 0.12, 0.09, and 0.23.</p>

      <p>We also evaluated the
performance of SIRIUS 4 within a subset of
Data Set #2 after removing compounds that were used to train SIRIUS
4. As seen in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>, SIRIUS 4 outperformed CFM-ID 4.0, but NPS-MS predictors performed
substantially better than SIRIUS 4. We also observed that despite
its generally good accuracy, SIRIUS 4 nominated structurally very
different compounds in several cases. This resulted in both the Tanimoto
coefficient and the CDDD distance of SIRIUS 4 compounds having a much
greater spread compared to NPS-MS.</p>
      <p>Finally, we evaluated the
performance of NPS-MS when searching
against a database of 8.9 million predicted NPS structures anticipated
by our previously described chemical language model, DarkNPS (Data
Set #3). This data set presents a unique challenge for compound identification,
since the DarkNPS compounds are far less chemically diverse than the
candidates in PubChem (Data Set #2), and thus more difficult to distinguish.
Consequently, the performance of both CFM-ID and NPS-MS was generally
lower than in Data sets #1 and #2, with NPS-MS achieving a cost-1
score of 25.8%. However, this nonetheless represented an improvement
of 416% compared with CFM-ID 4.0. NPS-MS was also 474% better than
CFM-ID 4.0 in terms of the cost-5 score. Notably, NPS-MS also achieved
a substantial improvement over NPS-MS <italic>De Novo</italic> in
this data set (cost-1 score, 20.3%). The improved identification performance
of NPS-MS over NPS-MS <italic>De Novo</italic> can be attributed to
the use of transfer learning, which allowed NPS-MS to inherit more
general knowledge about bond fragmentation captured by CFM-ID 4.0.</p>

      <title>NPS-MS Enables Identification of NPS without Reference Materials
in Forensic Samples</title>
      <p>In January 2022, the Danish Customs Agency
(Toldstyrelsen) seized an unknown powder that was then submitted to
the Section of Forensic Chemistry (Retskemisk Afdeling) at the University
of Copenhagen for analysis. Routine analysis using a Waters Corporation
LC-QTOF-MS revealed the main constituent of the powder to be the novel
arylcyclohexylamine 3-chloro-phencyclidine (3-Cl-PCP), which had first
emerged on the illicit market in December 2020. Although the identity
of the powder was determined without the use of NPS-MS, we believed
this would be a useful example to simulate the applicability of NPS-MS
in a forensic chemistry context, given that this NPS was unknown until
very recently and consequently could not have been identified using
a workflow that relied exclusively on CRMs.</p>
      <p>We first asked whether
NPS-MS was capable of accurately predicting the MS/MS spectra of 3-Cl-PCP,
which was not part of either the training or test data sets. We also
applied NPS-MS to predict the MS/MS spectra of 2-Cl-PCP and 4-Cl-PCP,
two other known chlorinated PCP derivatives (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.analchem.3c02413/suppl_file/ac3c02413_si_001.pdf">Figure S4a</ext-link>). Inspection of the resulting predicted spectra revealed
excellent correspondence between the predicted and experimentally
acquired 3-Cl-PCP spectra with an average Dice coefficient of 0.66
and an average dot product of 0.72. Moreover, for all three PCP derivatives,
the major <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> peaks at each collision
energy were correctly predicted, with the lone exception being <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> 125.0153 for 2-Cl-PCP. This corresponds
to the 2-chlorophenyl cation, [C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>4</sub>Cl]<sup>+</sup>. This application also underscores the interpretability of NPS-MS,
with each predicted <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> value assigned
a corresponding fragment ion structure (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.analchem.3c02413/suppl_file/ac3c02413_si_001.pdf">Figure S4b</ext-link>). While we are aware that the proposed structures for some
of the product ions are unlikely to exist, potentially undergoing
rearrangement or cyclization (e.g., structures 5, 8, 10, and 13),
the major product ions (i.e., 1, 2, and 3) that were proposed, are
close to what is likely to exist in the gas-phase based on the proposed
pathways for other phencyclidine-related compounds.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref41">41</xref></sup></p>
      <p>As a further test of NPS-MS, we asked whether searching
the experimentally
acquired spectra for 3-Cl-PCP against Data Set #3 would have led to
the identification of this unknown NPS, given that 3-Cl-PCP was among
the novel NPS structures anticipated by DarkNPS. To this end, we applied
NPS-MS to predict MS/MS spectra for a total of 1582 compounds in Data
Set #3 with a precursor mass within 10 ppm of 3-Cl-PCP. Strikingly,
among these 1582 candidates, 3-Cl-PCP correctly emerged as the top-ranked
candidate (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref></xref>b). Moreover, the second-ranked candidate was the structurally related
derivative 4-Cl-PCP. Interestingly, the third-ranked compound was
not 2-Cl-PCP but a structurally related isomer, wherein the cyclohexane
ring is replaced with a 2-methylcyclopentane ring (i.e., 1-[1-(3-chlorophenyl)-2-methylcyclopentyl]piperidine).
In contrast, the candidates suggested by CFM-ID 4.0, while structurally
related to 3-Cl-PCP, did not include the correct compound. Instead,
the top-ranked compound was the 2,2-dimethylcyclopropyl derivative
with the chlorine atom at position 4 (i.e., 1-[1-(4-chlorophenyl)-2,2-dimethylcyclopropyl]piperidine).
Collectively, these observations highlight the potential applications
of NPS-MS to identify previously unknown NPS within real forensic
samples.</p>

    <title>Conclusions</title>
    <p>Here, we present NPS-MS,
and we demonstrate that it can accurately
predict MS/MS spectra for both known and predicted NPS chemical structures.
By leveraging transfer learning from a generic MS/MS prediction model,
we show that NPS-MS can generate remarkably accurate MS/MS spectra
in a variety of C2MS tests and substantially outperforms generic models
on this task. Moreover, we demonstrate that this highly accurate MS/MS
spectrum prediction, in turn, enables substantially more accurate
identification of known NPS on a variety of MS2C tasks, even when
searching in databases comprising millions of chemical structures.
NPS-MS can be also used in conjunction with DarkNPS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref></sup> to search experimentally acquired MS/MS spectra against
unknown NPS structures anticipated by a chemical language model, and
in a retrospective evaluation, we show that NPS-MS would have enabled
the identification of a previously unknown PCP derivative without
the use of any reference materials. Collectively, these results open
the possibility of using NPS-MS to identify emerging NPSs for which
reference MS/MS spectra are not yet available or even never-before-seen
NPS, within law enforcement seizures or biological samples. The improvement
in prediction accuracy for NPS-MS can be largely attributed to the
fact that it was optimized to work with NPS-like compounds. Future
research could explore the potential of transfer learning to enhance
CFM-ID for other specific subdomains, specifically, the relationship
between prediction performance and structure diversity for targeted
data sets.</p>

      <p>The market for illicit drugs has
been reshaped by the emergence
of more than 1100 new psychoactive substances (NPS) over the past
decade, posing a major challenge to the forensic and toxicological
laboratories tasked with detecting and identifying them. Tandem mass
spectrometry (MS/MS) is the primary method used to screen for NPS
within seized materials or biological samples. The most contemporary
workflows necessitate labor-intensive and expensive MS/MS reference
standards, which may not be available for recently emerged NPS on
the illicit market. Here, we present NPS-MS, a deep learning method
capable of accurately predicting the MS/MS spectra of known and hypothesized
NPS from their chemical structures alone. NPS-MS is trained by transfer
learning from a generic MS/MS prediction model on a large data set
of MS/MS spectra. We show that this approach enables a more accurate
identification of NPS from experimentally acquired MS/MS spectra than
any existing method. We demonstrate the application of NPS-MS to identify
a novel derivative of phencyclidine (PCP) within an unknown powder
seized in Denmark without the use of any reference standards. We anticipate
that NPS-MS will allow forensic laboratories to identify more rapidly
both known and newly emerging NPS. NPS-MS is available as a web server
at <uri xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://nps-ms.ca/">https://nps-ms.ca/</uri>, which
provides MS/MS spectra prediction capabilities for given NPS compounds.
Additionally, it offers MS/MS spectra identification against a vast
database comprising approximately 8.7 million predicted NPS compounds
from DarkNPS and 24.5 million predicted ESI-QToF-MS/MS spectra for
these compounds.</p>

    <title>Introduction</title>
    <p>Over the past few decades, the illicit
drug market has been reshaped
by the proliferation of novel psychoactive substances (NPS). These
compounds, which are often referred to as designer drugs, synthetic
drugs, or bath salts, are designed to exert the same psychoactive
effects as conventional drugs of abuse (e.g., methamphetamine, cocaine,
and heroin). However, enterprising clandestine chemists introduce
sufficient structural differences into NPS to ensure that they circumvent
the legislative measures imposed around conventional drugs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref></sup> The vast majority of the resulting compounds
have never been tested in humans, and as a result, many NPS(s) have
been associated with life-threatening toxidromes and fatalities.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref></sup> The resulting public health burden has led many
countries to amend their drug laws to include known NPS. Paradoxically,
however, these laws have only resulted in further proliferation of
NPS analogues.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>−<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref></sup> As of the end of 2021, the European Monitoring Centre
for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA) is currently monitoring 830
NPS, with two new NPS emerging per week on average.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref></sup> Globally, as many as 1100 NPS are currently monitored by
the United Nations Office of Drugs and Crime (UNODC) early warning
advisory (EWA).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref></sup></p>
    <p>The proliferation
of NPS presents a major challenge for forensic
chemistry and toxicology laboratories that are tasked with identifying
these compounds. Mass spectrometry (MS) is the primary method used
for NPS detection and identification, with most contemporary screening
workflows relying on the diagnostic product ions produced by tandem
mass spectrometry (MS/MS) for high-confidence NPS identification.
The gold standard for identification of a putative NPS by MS/MS is
through comparison to reference MS/MS data collected from a certified
reference material (CRM), most commonly a synthetic reference standard.
However, the expense of maintaining (and constantly extending) large
collections of CRMs can be formidable.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref></sup> This financial burden is compounded by the rapid rate at which novel
compounds emerge from, and disappear from, the illicit market. By
the time a newly purchased CRM has been integrated into an NPS screening
workflow, the NPS itself may already have disappeared from circulation.
Moreover, for NPS that have just emerged on the illicit market, the
CRMs necessary to detect and identify these compounds may not yet
even be commercially available.</p>
    <p>The limitations of workflows
based on CRMs have led many forensic
laboratories to complement these approaches by performing MS/MS database
matching. This entails the use of in-house MS/MS databases that contain
product and precursor ion data of known or theoretical substances
for which the laboratory does not possess a CRM. This MS/MS information
can be acquired from the scientific literature, monographs by SWGDRUG<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref></sup> or NPS Discovery,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref></sup> and commercial MS/MS libraries (e.g., mzCloud<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref></sup>). MS/MS database matching allows forensic laboratories
to monitor a much larger number of NPS samples in a more cost-effective
way.</p>
    <p>Of particular interest for forensic laboratories is the
crowd-sourced
MS/MS database, HighResNPS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref></sup> HighResNPS represents,
to our knowledge, the largest publicly available database of MS/MS
data for NPS, which has been made available for direct implementation
in NPS screening.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref></sup> However, there are
often very limited MS/MS data on newly emerging NPS compounds. Approximately
one-third of the compounds in the HighResNPS database have missing
product ion information. Many of these compounds have recently been
reported by different drug monitoring agencies but do not yet have
published analytical data.</p>
    <p>The difficulty of acquiring analytical
data for emerging NPS has
led to efforts to predict MS/MS spectra from the chemical structures
of known or hypothesized NPS. Several studies have investigated the
collision-induced dissociation (CID) pathways for established classes
of NPS in order to enable manual prediction of MS/MS spectra for structurally
related compounds.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>−<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref></sup> Unfortunately, this manual prediction of MS/MS spectra is limited
in both throughput and accuracy. Recently, many are using a more viable
solution to overcome the current dearth of experimental MS/MS spectra,
which would be to use <italic>in silico</italic> MS spectral prediction
models capable of accurately predicting MS/MS spectra directly from
a given (known) structure. Programs such as MetFrag<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref></sup> and MAGMa<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref></sup> use heuristic or
combinatorial fragment modeling techniques to predict the position
and likelihood of bond breakages in molecules and the corresponding
MS/MS spectra. Among the most accurate approaches to MS/MS prediction
is an in-house previously described method, i.e., CFM-ID,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>−<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref></sup> which uses machine learning to predict CID pathways for small molecules.
This approach renders the MS/MS spectra predicted by CFM-ID highly
interpretable and explainable as each product ion in a predicted MS/MS
spectrum is assigned a hypothetical fragment structure by the model.
Beyond its interpretability, CFM-ID 4.0 is also a highly accurate
tool, outperforming other popular <italic>in silico</italic> mass
spectra tools when evaluated on the CASMI 2016 Cat3 data set.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref></sup></p>
    <p>The NPS community has already started
to explore the use of CFM-ID
and <italic>in silico</italic>-predicted MS/MS spectra for MS/MS database
matching. For instance, Polettini et al. applied CFM-ID 2.0 to predict
and compare spectra acquired from 99 synthetic cannabinoids (SCs).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref></sup> More recently, we used CFM-ID 4.0 to predict
MS/MS spectra for 8.9 million hypothetical NPS structures anticipated
by a chemical language model, DarkNPS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref></sup> Our findings indicated that the predicted MS/MS spectra could be
used to help identify a substantial number of recently discovered
NPSs. However, we also noted that the agreement between the observed
MS/MS spectra and the predicted CFM-ID MS/MS spectra was highly variable,
especially at higher collision energies.</p>
    <p>Because CFM-ID was
developed to be a very general MS/MS spectral
prediction tool, we investigated the possibility of developing a more
specialized version of CFM-ID that could perform substantially better
on the task of predicting MS/MS spectra specifically for NPS. Here,
we describe this new version of CFM-ID for NPS, which we have dubbed
NPS-MS. NPS-MS was trained exclusively on experimental QTOF MS/MS
spectra acquired from NPS using a technique called “transfer
learning.”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref></sup> We evaluate the accuracy
of NPS-MS for both MS/MS prediction and compound identification and
find that it is substantially more accurate than both earlier versions
of CFM-ID and other widely used tools such as MetFrag<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref></sup> and SIRIUS 4.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref></sup> In this manuscript,
we refer to the MS/MS prediction task as “compound-to-mass
spectrum” or “C2MS” and the compound identification
task as “mass spectrum-to-compound” or “MS2C.”
We anticipate that the performance of NPS-MS is sufficiently good
that it could be routinely and reliably used for the putative identification
of newly emerging NPS, as well as for the identification of never-before-seen
NPS.</p>

    <title>Methods</title>
    <sec id="sec2.1">
      <title>MS/MS Spectra Data Sets</title>
      <p>To train and evaluate NPS-MS,
we assembled a data set comprising 1872 MS/MS spectra for 624 NPS,
obtained from the Institute for Legal Medicine (Johannes Gutenberg
University, Mainz, Germany, <italic>n</italic> = 585 NPS) and ChemCentre
(Perth, Australia, <italic>n</italic> = 39 NPS). The MS/MS data were
acquired using two independent Agilent Technologies quadrupole time-of-flight
mass spectrometer (QTOF) systems. Both systems were operated in positive
electrospray ionization (ESI<sup>+</sup>) with collision energies
of 10, 20, and 40 eV applied for CID experiments of the protonated
precursor ion [M + H]<sup>+</sup>. For each MS/MS spectrum, we obtained
product ion mass-to-charge ratios (<italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic>) and percent relative intensities (% rel. int.) after removing <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> values (peaks) with a relative intensity
less than 3%. The instances were then randomly shuffled and split
into a training set of 494 compounds (1482 spectra) and a held-out
test set of 130 compounds (390 spectra) at approximately an 80:20
ratio.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec2.2">
      <title>NPS-MS Model Training</title>
      <p>The architecture of the NPS-MS
model is based on that previously described for CFM-ID 4.0.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref></sup> Conceptually, for the C2MS task, given an input
molecule, CFM-ID first employs a combinatorial bond cleavage approach
to enumerate all theoretically possible fragments. The output of this
procedure is a molecular fragmentation graph, in which each node represents
a theoretically possible fragment from the parent molecule with one
bond cleavage, and each edge (also known as transition) between nodes
encodes the chance that one fragment directly produces another fragment
through a fragmentation event. The probability of each transition
is estimated by parameters that CFM-ID learns from its training data
set of known molecules and their associated MS/MS spectra. Finally,
CFM-ID uses the fragmentation graph and associated transition probability
estimates to reconstruct the corresponding MS/MS spectrum for the
input molecule. The parameters of CFM-ID are learned from a training
data set of known molecule-MS/MS spectrum pairs, using expectation
maximization (EM) to attempt to optimize a negative-log-likelihood
loss function.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref></sup></p>
      <p>We trained NPS-MS using
a machine learning technique called transfer learning.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref></sup> Transfer learning entails the reuse of a pretrained
model to address a new task or problem. Here, we used the pretrained
model from CFM-ID 4.0, which was trained on a large and diverse data
set of generic MS/MS spectra. We then fine-tuned the learnable parameters
of CFM-ID 4.0 by then training it on a smaller data set of MS/MS spectra
obtained from authentic standards of NPS, as described above. We fine-tuned
NPS-MS by freezing all but the last layer of the neural network in
CFM-ID 4.0 during the retraining process. For comparison, we also
trained a model with an identical architecture to CFM-ID 4.0 from
scratch on the NPS-MS/MS spectra data set. We refer to this model

training was limited to 30 iterations of the EM algorithm, and within
each iteration, the neural network training was limited to 600 minibatches.</p>

      <title>Model Evaluation</title>
      <p>We evaluated the performance of NPS-MS
on two tasks. In the first task, we applied NPS-MS to predict the
MS/MS spectra of known NPS, and then we directly evaluated the accuracy
of the MS/MS spectrum predictions (C2MS Tasks). In the second task,
we used NPS-MS to identify known and unknown NPS from the experimentally
acquired MS/MS spectra. That is, we first applied NPS-MS to predict
MS/MS spectra for every molecule within a data set of known NPS chemical
structures and then searched experimentally acquired MS/MS spectra
against this data set of predicted spectra to match the experimentally
acquired spectra to chemical structures (MS2C Tasks).</p>
      <p>The primary
evaluation metric in the C2MS task was the Dice coefficient, which
quantifies the similarity between experimental and predicted MS/MS
spectra by measuring the ratio between the number of matched peaks
and the total number of peaks. We also used the dot product (also
known as the cosine similarity) as a secondary measure of MS/MS spectral
similarity. This method computes the cosine of the angle between the
unit vectors obtained from two MS/MS spectra and, therefore, considers
both the <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> values of each peak
as well as their relative intensities. In addition, we also measured
the precision and recall between the peaks in the experimental and
predicted MS/MS spectra to further understand the performance of NPS-MS
and the baseline models to which it was compared. Precision measures
the number of peaks in the predicted spectra that are also present
in the experimental spectra. Conversely, recall measures the percentage
of peaks in the experimental spectra that are correctly predicted.</p>
      <p>For the MS2C task, we evaluated the accuracy of compound identification
when searching in three different data sets of NPS chemical structures.
Data Set #1 comprised the dedicated NPS compound candidate database,
HighResNPS,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref></sup> consisting of 1922 compounds.
Data Set #2 constructed a more diverse library of candidate structures
by supplementing HighResNPS with the PubChem chemical structure database,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref></sup> comprising an additional 94.7 million compounds.
Data Set #3 consisted of both the known NPS structures from HighResNPS,
as well as a library of 8.9 million theoretical NPS compounds generated
by DarkNPS,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref></sup> a chemical language model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">32</xref>−<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref35">35</xref></sup> trained on known NPS, which we previously demonstrated to be capable
of anticipating the structures of novel NPS that subsequently emerge
on the illicit market.</p>
      <p>For each NPS data set, the experimentally
measured precursor ion <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> was used
to filter the data set to
generate a subset of potential candidates, using a window of ±10
ppm. The predicted MS/MS spectra of each candidate were then compared
with the experimental MS/MS spectra to identify the top-scoring spectral
matches. To avoid overestimating performance, we required that there
were at least three candidates from each precursor ion. Each of the
three NPS structural databases was preprocessed by removing all charged
and zwitterionic chemicals. Stereochemistry was removed, and the resulting
compounds merged into their base form. Spectral matches were scored
and ranked based on the average of the Dice coefficient and dot product.
The performance of each C2MS model was evaluated by using a cost score.
In this setting, a cost score was assigned to each compound identification
based on the rank relative to the correct answer, considering the
possibility of equally ranked candidates. This cost score reflects
the amount of expected MS/MS experiments required to reach the ground
truth compound, given a list of identification results for a single
task. Details of this score can be found in the Supporting Information
(SI): <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.analchem.3c02413/suppl_file/ac3c02413_si_001.pdf">Details for Cost Score</ext-link>.</p>
      <p>In
cases in which the top-ranked spectral match does not correspond
to the ground truth NPS, we also assessed the structural similarity
between the ground truth NPS and the top-ranked candidates. Structural
similarity was quantified using the Tanimoto coefficient between ECFP4
fingerprints<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref37">37</xref></sup> and the Euclidean distance between
Continuous and Data-Driven Descriptors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref38">38</xref></sup> (CDDD) representations. The CDDD is a 512-dimensional continuous
representation of a given compound generated by a deep learning model.
If the top-ranked compound is the correct compound, the CDDD distance
will be zero, whereas if multiple candidates are ranked equally, the
Tanimoto coefficient and CDDD distances are averaged over all equally
ranked candidates.</p>

trained without transfer learning (i.e., NPS-MS <italic>De Novo</italic>) to CFM-ID 2.0<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref></sup> and CFM-ID 4.0.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref></sup> (We did not consider CFM-ID 3.0,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref></sup> which was released in 2019, as it differed from
CFM-ID 2.0 primarily in the incorporation of hand-crafted fragmentation
rules to improve the handling of lipids.) For the MS2C task, we evaluated
the performance of all four methods used in the C2MS task, as well
as MetFrag<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref></sup> and SIRIUS 4.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref></sup> Interestingly, MetFrag could only be evaluated against
Data sets #1 and #2 since several structures in Data Set #3 cause
it to crash. Only results using the 20 eV spectra are reported here,
as MetFrag performed much better when using this collision energy
compared to others. SIRIUS 4 was only evaluated against a subset of

      <title>NPS-MS Enables Accurate MS/MS Spectrum Prediction</title>
      <p>We
initially assessed its ability to predict MS/MS spectra for molecules
in the test set (i.e., the C2MS task). We compared NPS-MS to an identical
model trained without transfer learning (NPS-MS <italic>De Novo</italic>), as well as two generic MS/MS prediction models (CFM-ID, versions
2.0 and 4.0). The performance of each model was quantified by using
the average Dice coefficient and dot product of predicted MS/MS spectra
against the held-out test set, as summarized in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref></xref>. In general, models designed specifically
to predict MS/MS spectra for NPS (NPS-MS and NP-MS <italic>De Novo</italic>) outperformed generic MS/MS prediction models (CFM-ID versions 2.0
and 4.0). Specifically, NPS-MS (Dice coefficient = 0.55; dot product
= 0.67) and NPS-MS <italic>De Novo</italic> (Dice coefficient = 0.62;
dot product = 0.69) outperformed CFM-ID 4.0 by margins of 44 and 59%,
respectively, as quantified by the Dice coefficient and by margins
of 72 and 77%, as quantified by the dot product. Notably, for 36 of
the 390 MS/MS spectra in the test data set (9.2%), NPS-MS predictions
achieved a perfect Dice coefficient of 1.0, as compared to just 10
(2.6%) for CFM-ID 4.0. Detailed discussion of individual predicted
MS/MS is provided in the <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.analchem.3c02413/suppl_file/ac3c02413_si_001.pdf">SI</ext-link> under Inspection

      <p>In addition, we observed that the mean recall values
of CFM-ID
and NPS-MS were essentially identical. Instead, the improved performance
of NPS-MS over CFM-ID can be attributed to a nearly 3-fold increase
in the precision of NPS-MS. In other words, although CFM-ID can correctly
predict true-positive peaks that appear in the experimentally acquired
MS/MS spectra of known NPS, it also predicts many false-positive peaks.</p>

      <title>NPS-MS Enables Accurate Compound Identification from Experimental
MS/MS Spectra</title>
      <p>Having shown that NPS-MS affords a substantial
increase in the accuracy of the MS/MS spectrum prediction, we next
asked whether these more accurate MS/MS spectra would, in turn, enable
more accurate compound identification. In this task, we first used
NPS-MS to predict MS/MS spectra for a data set of NPS chemical structures
and then searched the experimentally measured MS/MS spectra against
this database of predicted spectra.</p>
      <p>We evaluated the performance
of NPS-MS when using three different chemical structure databases
of varying sizes and diversity as input. Data Set #1 comprised the
1922 compounds in the HighResNPS database. Data Set #2 supplemented
HighResNPS with 94.7 million compounds from PubChem. Data Set #3 supplemented
HighResNPS with 8.9 million hypothetical NPS structures anticipated
by DarkNPS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref></sup> We compared the performance

to the four models evaluated on the C2MS task. The performance of
each method was quantified using the cost score, an extension of the
top-<italic>k</italic> accuracy that is robust to the presence of
ties (Methods). In addition, we quantified the structural similarity
between the top-ranked candidate nominated by each method and the

      <p>In Data Set #1, NPS-MS correctly identified the
ground truth
NPS
as the highest-ranked candidate in 69.8% (<italic>n</italic> = 37)
of cases. This represented an improvement of 12.0 and 15.4% over CFM-ID
versions 2.0 and 4.0, respectively, as well as an improvement of 270%
over MetFrag. The MS2C performance difference between each method
diminished rapidly with increasing cost scores. This can likely be
attributed to the small number of candidates per experimental MS/MS
spectrum in this data set, which renders compound identification far
less challenging than in more diverse databases such as Data sets
#2 and #3.</p>
      <p>In Data Set #2, NPS-MS achieved a 58.4% cost-1 score,
an improvement
of 165 and 136% over CFM-ID 3.0 and 4.0, respectively, and 250% better
than MetFrag. This performance improvement was observed consistently
for varying cost scores: for instance, NPS-MS achieved an 80% improvement
in the cost-5 score compared to CFM-ID 4.0. Moreover, in cases in
which NPS-MS failed to correctly identify the ground truth NPS, the
top-ranked candidate was generally structurally similar to the correct
compound. For example, the top-3 candidates predicted by NPS-MS from
Data Set #2 based on the MS/MS spectra of ocfentanil (i.e., 2-fluoromethoxyacetyl
fentanyl; 2-methoxy-<italic>N</italic>-(1-phenethylpiperidin-4-yl)-<italic>N</italic>-2-fluorophenylacetamide) were all clearly structurally
related to ocfentanil (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref></xref>a). In this example, the correct structure was the third-highest
scoring candidate, while the top-2 candidates were its 3-fluoro (<italic>T</italic><sub>c</sub> = 0.64) and 4-fluoro (<italic>T</italic><sub>c</sub> = 0.67) isomers. In contrast, the top-3 candidates given
by CFM-ID 4.0 hardly resembled the correct structure, with Tanimoto
coefficients of just 0.12, 0.09, and 0.23.</p>

      <p>We also evaluated the
performance of SIRIUS 4 within a subset of
Data Set #2 after removing compounds that were used to train SIRIUS
4. As seen in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>, SIRIUS 4 outperformed CFM-ID 4.0, but NPS-MS predictors performed
substantially better than SIRIUS 4. We also observed that despite
its generally good accuracy, SIRIUS 4 nominated structurally very
different compounds in several cases. This resulted in both the Tanimoto
coefficient and the CDDD distance of SIRIUS 4 compounds having a much
greater spread compared to NPS-MS.</p>
      <p>Finally, we evaluated the
performance of NPS-MS when searching
against a database of 8.9 million predicted NPS structures anticipated
by our previously described chemical language model, DarkNPS (Data
Set #3). This data set presents a unique challenge for compound identification,
since the DarkNPS compounds are far less chemically diverse than the
candidates in PubChem (Data Set #2), and thus more difficult to distinguish.
Consequently, the performance of both CFM-ID and NPS-MS was generally
lower than in Data sets #1 and #2, with NPS-MS achieving a cost-1
score of 25.8%. However, this nonetheless represented an improvement
of 416% compared with CFM-ID 4.0. NPS-MS was also 474% better than
CFM-ID 4.0 in terms of the cost-5 score. Notably, NPS-MS also achieved
a substantial improvement over NPS-MS <italic>De Novo</italic> in
this data set (cost-1 score, 20.3%). The improved identification performance
of NPS-MS over NPS-MS <italic>De Novo</italic> can be attributed to
the use of transfer learning, which allowed NPS-MS to inherit more
general knowledge about bond fragmentation captured by CFM-ID 4.0.</p>

      <title>NPS-MS Enables Identification of NPS without Reference Materials
in Forensic Samples</title>
      <p>In January 2022, the Danish Customs Agency
(Toldstyrelsen) seized an unknown powder that was then submitted to
the Section of Forensic Chemistry (Retskemisk Afdeling) at the University
of Copenhagen for analysis. Routine analysis using a Waters Corporation
LC-QTOF-MS revealed the main constituent of the powder to be the novel
arylcyclohexylamine 3-chloro-phencyclidine (3-Cl-PCP), which had first
emerged on the illicit market in December 2020. Although the identity
of the powder was determined without the use of NPS-MS, we believed
this would be a useful example to simulate the applicability of NPS-MS
in a forensic chemistry context, given that this NPS was unknown until
very recently and consequently could not have been identified using
a workflow that relied exclusively on CRMs.</p>
      <p>We first asked whether
NPS-MS was capable of accurately predicting the MS/MS spectra of 3-Cl-PCP,
which was not part of either the training or test data sets. We also
applied NPS-MS to predict the MS/MS spectra of 2-Cl-PCP and 4-Cl-PCP,
two other known chlorinated PCP derivatives (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.analchem.3c02413/suppl_file/ac3c02413_si_001.pdf">Figure S4a</ext-link>). Inspection of the resulting predicted spectra revealed
excellent correspondence between the predicted and experimentally
acquired 3-Cl-PCP spectra with an average Dice coefficient of 0.66
and an average dot product of 0.72. Moreover, for all three PCP derivatives,
the major <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> peaks at each collision
energy were correctly predicted, with the lone exception being <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> 125.0153 for 2-Cl-PCP. This corresponds
to the 2-chlorophenyl cation, [C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>4</sub>Cl]<sup>+</sup>. This application also underscores the interpretability of NPS-MS,
with each predicted <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> value assigned
a corresponding fragment ion structure (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.analchem.3c02413/suppl_file/ac3c02413_si_001.pdf">Figure S4b</ext-link>). While we are aware that the proposed structures for some
of the product ions are unlikely to exist, potentially undergoing
rearrangement or cyclization (e.g., structures 5, 8, 10, and 13),
the major product ions (i.e., 1, 2, and 3) that were proposed, are
close to what is likely to exist in the gas-phase based on the proposed
pathways for other phencyclidine-related compounds.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref41">41</xref></sup></p>
      <p>As a further test of NPS-MS, we asked whether searching
the experimentally
acquired spectra for 3-Cl-PCP against Data Set #3 would have led to
the identification of this unknown NPS, given that 3-Cl-PCP was among
the novel NPS structures anticipated by DarkNPS. To this end, we applied
NPS-MS to predict MS/MS spectra for a total of 1582 compounds in Data
Set #3 with a precursor mass within 10 ppm of 3-Cl-PCP. Strikingly,
among these 1582 candidates, 3-Cl-PCP correctly emerged as the top-ranked
candidate (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref></xref>b). Moreover, the second-ranked candidate was the structurally related
derivative 4-Cl-PCP. Interestingly, the third-ranked compound was
not 2-Cl-PCP but a structurally related isomer, wherein the cyclohexane
ring is replaced with a 2-methylcyclopentane ring (i.e., 1-[1-(3-chlorophenyl)-2-methylcyclopentyl]piperidine).
In contrast, the candidates suggested by CFM-ID 4.0, while structurally
related to 3-Cl-PCP, did not include the correct compound. Instead,
the top-ranked compound was the 2,2-dimethylcyclopropyl derivative
with the chlorine atom at position 4 (i.e., 1-[1-(4-chlorophenyl)-2,2-dimethylcyclopropyl]piperidine).
Collectively, these observations highlight the potential applications
of NPS-MS to identify previously unknown NPS within real forensic
samples.</p>

  <sec id="sec4">
    <title>Conclusions</title>
    <p>Here, we present NPS-MS,
and we demonstrate that it can accurately
predict MS/MS spectra for both known and predicted NPS chemical structures.
By leveraging transfer learning from a generic MS/MS prediction model,
we show that NPS-MS can generate remarkably accurate MS/MS spectra
in a variety of C2MS tests and substantially outperforms generic models
on this task. Moreover, we demonstrate that this highly accurate MS/MS
spectrum prediction, in turn, enables substantially more accurate
identification of known NPS on a variety of MS2C tasks, even when
searching in databases comprising millions of chemical structures.
NPS-MS can be also used in conjunction with DarkNPS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref></sup> to search experimentally acquired MS/MS spectra against
unknown NPS structures anticipated by a chemical language model, and
in a retrospective evaluation, we show that NPS-MS would have enabled
the identification of a previously unknown PCP derivative without
the use of any reference materials. Collectively, these results open
the possibility of using NPS-MS to identify emerging NPSs for which
reference MS/MS spectra are not yet available or even never-before-seen
NPS, within law enforcement seizures or biological samples. The improvement
in prediction accuracy for NPS-MS can be largely attributed to the
fact that it was optimized to work with NPS-like compounds. Future
research could explore the potential of transfer learning to enhance
CFM-ID for other specific subdomains, specifically, the relationship
between prediction performance and structure diversity for targeted
data sets.</p>
