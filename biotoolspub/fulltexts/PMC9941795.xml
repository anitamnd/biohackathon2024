    <title>Introduction</title>
    <p>In clinical trial development, it is critical to submit applications, amendments,
supplements, and reports on medicinal products to regulatory agencies. Electronic
Common Technical Document (eCTD) is the standard format to enable worldwide
regulatory submission. For example, the United States Food and Drug Administration
(US FDA) requires that new drug applications and biologics license applications be
submitted using the eCTD format.</p>
    <p>Within the eCTD submission, the regulatory agencies are increasingly interested in
requiring sponsors to submit software programs used to create analysis data sets and
analysis results. For example, the US FDA indicated in Section 4.1.2.10 of the study
data technical conformance guide that “sponsors should provide the software programs
used to create all ADaM datasets and generate tables and figures associated with
primary and secondary efficacy analyses.”<sup><xref rid="bibr1-17407745221123244" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup></p>
    <p>There is a growing trend of using R for clinical trial analysis and reporting that
can be part of the regulatory submission. For example, gsDesign<sup><xref rid="bibr2-17407745221123244" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> was used in
sample size calculation for Moderna’s COVID-19 vaccine trial.<sup><xref rid="bibr3-17407745221123244" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>
DoseFinding<sup><xref rid="bibr4-17407745221123244" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> was used to evaluate the multiple comparison procedure—modeling
(MCP-MOD) approach by the FDA reviewers.<sup><xref rid="bibr5-17407745221123244" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> However, to the best of our
knowledge, we have not observed any public examples of eCTD submission using R,
although the FDA has provided a statistical software clarifying statement in
2015:<sup><xref rid="bibr6-17407745221123244" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup><disp-quote><p>FDA does not require the use of any specific
software for statistical analyses, and statistical software is not
explicitly discussed in Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations [e.g.,
in 21CFR part 11]. However, the software package(s) used for statistical
analyses should be fully documented in the submission, including version and
build identification.</p></disp-quote></p>
    <p>One unmet and important gap in creating such submissions is the lack of tools,
guidance, and publicly available examples to prepare submission R programs following
the eCTD specification.<sup><xref rid="bibr7-17407745221123244" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> For example, the eCTD specification requires lower case
letters in all files and directory names of the submission package that is different
from the file name conventions of R packages.<sup><xref rid="bibr8-17407745221123244" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> This article introduces a
simple and sufficient R package, pkglite, to convert analysis scripts and associated
proprietary dependency R packages into a compact, text-based file, which makes the
submission document self-contained, easy to restore, transfer, review, and submit
following the eCTD specification and regulatory guidelines (e.g. the study data
technical conformance guide from FDA). The pkglite R package is published on
Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) and developed on GitHub. The contribution of
pkglite for clinical trial submission is to (1) enable sponsors to transfer
internally developed R packages within the eCTD package without using external code
repositories (e.g. CRAN, GitHub), and (2) simplify and standardize the workflow in
preparing and reviewing R program submissions between sponsors and reviewers with a
compliant and reproducible approach.</p>
  </sec>
  <sec sec-type="methods" id="section6-17407745221123244">
    <title>Methods</title>
    <p>We recommend organizing all analysis scripts of a clinical study following the R
package folder structure to enhance reproducibility and ensure
consistency.<sup><xref rid="bibr9-17407745221123244" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="bibr10-17407745221123244" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> A minimal R package includes (1) a DESCRIPTION file stating
important metadata such as authors, version, and dependencies of other R packages,
(2) a NAMESPACE file scoping the exported and imported R functions, (3) an R/
directory of .R files containing R functions, (4) a man/ folder containing
documentation files, (5) a vignette/ folder with analysis programs, and (6) a
test/folder containing formal automated testing scripts. While not required for use
with pkglite, it has significant advantages to use the R package folder structure.
First, it is a well-defined format that organizes a self-contained bundle of assets,
such as analysis programs, documentation, and tests, in a standard and consistent
structure. Second, it can detect many common issues and enhance reproducibility by
passing a collection of automated compliance checks using <monospace>R CMD
check</monospace>. Finally, it is the predominant folder structure to organize R
source code among the R community. Researchers and developers have contributed
around 17,778 R packages to the CRAN as of June 2021.<sup><xref rid="bibr11-17407745221123244" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> In addition to the public
packages on CRAN, it is also popular among organizations, where proprietary R
packages are developed to implement business logic or routines to streamline
internal workflows.<sup><xref rid="bibr12-17407745221123244" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup></p>
    <p>After a clinical study project has been developed and organized as an R package
folder structure, pkglite helps the sponsor prepare submission R programs.
Typically, the eCTD package can include R functions, analysis scripts, analysis
results, and all proprietary R package dependencies. For this entire scope of
assets, pkglite can convert them into a compact, text-based file, which makes it
easy to restore, transfer, review, and submit following the eCTD specification and
regulatory guidelines. Once reviewers receive the text file in the eCTD package,
they can unpack it by following the steps in the Analysis Data Reviewer’s Guide
(ADRG). We provide a concrete example of the pack and unpack flow in the Results
section.</p>
    <p>The complete workflow to apply pkglite in preparing R packages for eCTD submission is
shown in <xref rid="fig1-17407745221123244" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>. First,
organize the R-based analysis and reporting code following the R package folder
structure, which we refer to as the “project-specific R package” in the remainder of
the article. Next, pack the project-specific R package and other proprietary R
packages into a text file using pkglite. Then, this text file with submission
programs will be placed in module 5 (clinical study reports) of the eCTD submission
package. When reviewers receive the eCTD submission package, they can unpack and
install the project-specific R package and other proprietary R packages from the
text file to reproduce analyses performed using R. In comparison, the canonical
workflow to distribute R packages requires two steps that are not compatible with
the eCTD submission requirements: (1) using R CMD build to create a source tarball—a
binary file that cannot be included in the eCTD submission, and (2) submitting the
tarball to a public or access-controlled package repository (e.g. CRAN or GitHub)
for distribution, which could be difficult for confidential file transfer between
sponsors and reviewers due to security and compliance constraints and will not make
the eCTD submission self-contained.</p>

    <title>Results</title>
    <p>This section provides a real-world example to illustrate the procedure to submit a
project-specific R package using pkglite. We assume the project-specific R package
is esubdemo (available at <ext-link xlink:href="https://github.com/elong0527/esubdemo" ext-link-type="uri">https://github.com/elong0527/esubdemo</ext-link>). The goal is to pack and save
it under module 5 of an eCTD submission package. In this example, the eCTD package
is ectddemo, available at <ext-link xlink:href="https://github.com/elong0527/ectddemo" ext-link-type="uri">https://github.com/elong0527/ectddemo</ext-link>.</p>
    <p>To achieve the goal above, we first use <monospace>pkglite::pack()</monospace> and
<monospace>pkglite:: collate()</monospace> to pack esubdemo into a text
file.</p>
    <p>
      <disp-quote>
        <p>
          <monospace>library(pkglite)fc &lt;- collate("esubdemo/", file_ectd(),
file_auto("inst"))pack(fc, output = "r0pkgs.txt")</monospace>
        </p>
      </disp-quote>
    </p>
    <p>Here, “esubdemo/” is the assumed folder path for the project-specific R package
(unpacked). The <monospace>pkglite:: collate()</monospace> function evaluates the
packing scope specified by the file specification functions, that is,
<monospace>pkglite:: file_ectd() and pkglite:: file_auto()</monospace>, against
the source R package. It then generates a file collection R object containing the
essential metadata of the collated files. The file specification functions offer an
extensible approach to specify the scope of the R package contents to be packed. For
example, <monospace>pkglite:: file_ectd()</monospace> specifies a standard
combination of files for eCTD submissions; <monospace>pkglite::
file_auto()</monospace> specifies all files under a specific folder under the R
package. To create a new customized file specification, one can use
<monospace>pkglite:: file_spec()</monospace>. The detailed usage of all file
specification functions is available at <ext-link xlink:href="https://merck.github.io/pkglite/reference/" ext-link-type="uri">https://merck.github.io/pkglite/reference/</ext-link>. With various selections
of file specification functions and the capability to create new ones, users can
accurately define the scope of R packages to be packed for submission in a flexible
yet principled way. The last function <monospace>pkglite:: pack()</monospace> writes
the collated files into a plain text file. Furthermore, to pack multiple R packages,
for example, esubdemo and r2rtf, sponsors can feed multiple file collections as
follows:<disp-quote><p><monospace>fc1 &lt;- collate("esubdemo/",
file_ectd())</monospace></p><p><monospace>fc2 &lt;- collate("r2rtf/",
file_ectd())</monospace></p><p><monospace>pack(fc1, fc2, output =
"r0pkgs.txt")</monospace></p></disp-quote></p>
    <p>After packing the project-specific R package and other proprietary R packages into a
plain text file, we can save the packed text files in module 5 of the eCTD package,
specifically under “m5/datasets/ectddemo/analysis/adam/programs/” following the eCTD
specification. It is acknowledged that under the adam/ folder for analysis data,
there are two sub-folders: programs/ and datasets/. The datasets/ sub-folder
consists of clinical trial data following the ADaM implementation guide. The
programs/ sub-folder contains the submission program, including the packed
project-specific package, proprietary R packages, as well as the R scripts for each
analysis (tlf-*.txt files). It is worth noting that R Markdown files can be
transferred into R scripts by using <monospace>knitr:: purl()</monospace>. Examples
can be found at <ext-link xlink:href="https://r4csr.org/submission-package.html#prepare-analysis-programs-for-submission" ext-link-type="uri">https://r4csr.org/submission-package.html#prepare-analysis-programs-for-submission</ext-link>.</p>
    <p>Next, after verifying the correctness of the packed R packages, the sponsor should
update the Analysis Data Reviewer’s Guide (ADRG) to provide guidelines for the
reviewers to restore the packed assets. An ADRG template demonstrating the impacted
sections for the ectddemo example is available at <ext-link xlink:href="https://github.com/elong0527/ectddemo/blob/master/m5/datasets/ectddemo/analysis/adam/datasets/adrg.pdf" ext-link-type="uri">https://github.com/elong0527/ectddemo/blob/master/m5/datasets/ectddemo/analysis/adam/datasets/adrg.pdf</ext-link>.
Following the ADRG, reviewers can easily unpack and install the R packages after
receiving the submission package by using
<monospace>pkglite::unpack()</monospace>:<disp-quote><p><monospace>pkglite::unpack("r0pkgs.txt",
output = tempdir(), install = TRUE)</monospace></p></disp-quote></p>
    <p>After installing the packages, reviewers can reproduce the trial analysis results by
running the R scripts for each analysis (tlf-*.txt files), which often rely on the
functions from the proprietary packages.</p>

    <title>Conclusion</title>
    <p>In this article, we demonstrate the usage of pkglite, that is, allowing sponsors to
prepare R packages into compact text files. To provide hands-on experience to
readers, we present a mockup example, where we introduce the recommended workflow to
pack R packages into text files that can be incorporated into the regulatory
submission package following the eCTD specification. After regulatory agencies
receive the submission package, we provide methods to unpack R packages from the
text file that can be used to execute all analysis scripts.</p>
    <p>In addition to the usage of pkglite, we also demonstrate the advantages of using
pkglite in preparing R-based analysis and reporting programs for eCTD submissions.
First, by applying pkglite, project-specific R packages are packed and restored as
plain text files as required by the FDA submissions gateway, making it off-the-shelf
for both sides of the submission to store, transfer, and review. Second, the packed
project-specific R packages are presented in an unambiguous, human-friendly, and
machine-readable format. Third, pkglite is pipe-friendly (e.g. using the native pipe
operator|<monospace>&gt;</monospace> since R 4.1.0 or
%<monospace>&gt;</monospace>% from magrittr to chain function calls), which
enables a grammar to clearly express the sequence of packing operations and makes it
flexible to handle complicated tasks like packing multiple proprietary R packages.
Fourth, the packing scope can be explicitly traced, by utilizing abstractions such
as file specifications and file collections. It is also worth noting that pkglite
can also pack and unpack Shiny apps for interactive data analysis if the apps are
organized as R packages. Fifth, pkglite is available on CRAN as other repositories
are generally not available to the FDA.</p>
    <p>Following similar steps, the R Consortium R submission working group has prepared and
submitted an eCTD submission package to the FDA using pkglite. The FDA reviewer is
able to reproduce analysis results following instructions in the ADRG. The
submission package is publicly available at <ext-link xlink:href="https://github.com/RConsortium/submissions-pilot1-to-fda" ext-link-type="uri">https://github.com/RConsortium/submissions-pilot1-to-fda</ext-link>. The final
response letter from FDA is at <ext-link xlink:href="https://github.com/RConsortium/submissions-wg/blob/main/Documents/Summary_R_Pilot_Submission2.pdf" ext-link-type="uri">https://github.com/RConsortium/submissions-wg/blob/main/Documents/Summary_R_Pilot_Submission2.pdf</ext-link>.</p>
