      <title>Abstract</title>
      <p>Composition Vector Tree (CVTree) implements a systematic method of inferring evolutionary
relatedness of microbial organisms from the oligopeptide content of their complete
proteomes (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://cvtree.cbi.pku.edu.cn">http://cvtree.cbi.pku.edu.cn</ext-link>). Since the first bacterial
genomes were sequenced in 1995 there have been several attempts to infer prokaryote
phylogeny from complete genomes. Most of them depend on sequence alignment directly or
indirectly and, in some cases, need fine-tuning and adjustment. The composition vector
method circumvents the ambiguity of choosing the genes for phylogenetic reconstruction and
avoids the necessity of aligning sequences of essentially different length and gene
content. This new method does not contain ‘free’ parameter and ‘fine-tuning’. A bootstrap
test for a phylogenetic tree of 139 organisms has shown the stability of the branchings,
which support the small subunit ribosomal RNA (SSU rRNA) tree of life in its overall
structure and in many details. It may provide a quick reference in prokaryote
phylogenetics whenever the proteome of an organism is available, a situation that will
become commonplace in the near future.</p>

    <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
    <p>The systematics of bacteria has been a long-standing problem because very limited
morphological features are available. For a long time one had to be content with grouping
together similar bacteria for practical determinative needs (<xref rid="B1">1</xref>). It
was Carl Woese and collaborators who initiated molecular phylogeny of prokaryotes by making
use of the small subunit (SSU) ribosomal RNA (rRNA) sequences (<xref rid="B2">2</xref>). The
SSU rRNA trees (<xref rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4">4</xref>) have been considered as the
standard Tree of Life by many biologists and there has been expectation that the
availability of more and more genomic data would verify these trees and add new details to
them. However, it turns out that different genes may tell different stories and the
controversies have added fuel to the debate on whether there has been intensive lateral gene
transfer among prokaryotes [see e.g. (<xref rid="B5">5</xref>)]. There is an urgent need to
develop tree-construction methods that are based on whole genome data. People have used the
gene content (<xref rid="B6">6</xref>–<xref rid="B8">8</xref>), the presence or absence of
genes in clusters of orthologs (<xref rid="B9">9</xref>), the conserved gene pairs (<xref rid="B9">9</xref>), the information-based distance (<xref rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11">11</xref>), etc., but all of them depend on sequence alignment in some way.</p>
    <p>In order to avoid sequence alignment, as bacterial genomes differ significantly in size,
gene number and gene order, a composition vector (CV) method was proposed (<xref rid="B12">12</xref>). A meaningful and robust phylogenetic result is obtained when applying it to
139 prokaryotic genomes distributed in 15 phyla, 26 classes, 47 orders, 58 families and 76
genera. It is well consistent with the latest 2003 outline (<xref rid="B13">13</xref>) of
Bergey's Manuals of Systematic Bacteriology (<xref rid="B14">14</xref>).</p>
    <p>Recently we have applied the composition approach to chloroplast genomes (<xref rid="B15">15</xref>) and Coronavirus genomes including human SARS-CoV (<xref rid="B16">16</xref>).
In the former work the chloroplast branch was definitely placed close to the Cyanobacteria
as compared with other Eubacteria. Within the chloroplast branch the Glaucophyte,
Rhodophyte, Chlorophyte and Embryophyte were distinguished clearly in agreement with present
understanding of the origin of chloroplasts (<xref rid="B17">17</xref>). Within the
Embryophyte the monocotyledon and dicotyledon were also separated properly. In the
Coronavirus study the human SARS-CoV was shown to be closer to Group II Coronaviruses with
mammalian hosts by combining composition distance analysis with suitable choice of
outgroups.</p>
    <p>The use of complete genomes is both a merit and a demerit of the method, as the number of
complete genomes is always limited. However, a recent work (<xref rid="B18">18</xref>) shows
that the availability of protein families, the ribosomal proteins and the collection of all
aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (AARSs), but not necessarily the whole proteome, might be good
enough for reproducing the topology of the trees. Thus the new method has been applied
successfully to bacteria, organelles and a few viruses whose genome sizes vary from several
million to &lt;30 kb.</p>
    <p>In order to make this new method available to the public we have implemented the
Composition Vector Tree (CVTree) web server.</p>
  </sec>
  <sec>
    <title>ALGORITHMS USED IN CVTREE</title>
    <p>The CV method described elsewhere (<xref rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref rid="B15">15</xref>)
generates a distance matrix when complete proteomes of organisms or big enough collections
of protein sequences are given. The main steps are: first, collect all amino acid sequences
of a species. Second, calculate the frequency of appearance of overlapping oligopeptides of
length <italic>K</italic>. A random background was subtracted from these frequencies by
using a Markov model of order (<italic>K</italic> − 2) in order to diminish the influence of
random neutral mutations at the molecular level and to highlight the shaping role of
selective evolution. Some strings that contribute mostly to apomorphic characters become
more significant after the subtraction (<xref rid="B19">19</xref>). The subtraction
procedure is an essential step in our method. Third, by putting these ‘normalized’
frequencies in a fixed order a composition vector of dimension
20<sup><italic>K</italic></sup> was obtained for each species. Fourth, the correlation
<italic>C</italic>(<italic>A</italic>,<italic>B</italic>) between two species
<italic>A</italic> and <italic>B</italic> was determined by taking the projection of one
normalized vector on another, i.e. taking the cosine of the angle between them. Thus if the
two vectors were the same they would have the highest correlation <italic>C</italic> = 1; if
they had no components in common then <italic>C</italic> = 0, i.e. the two vectors would be
orthogonal to each other. Lastly, the normalized distance between the two species was
defined to be <italic>D</italic> = (1 − <italic>C</italic>)/2.</p>
    <p>Once a distance matrix has been calculated it is straightforward to construct phylogenetic
trees by following the standard procedures. We use the neighbor-joining (NJ) method (<xref rid="B20">20</xref>) in the PHYLIP package by Joe Felsenstein (available at: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://evolution.genetics.washington.edu/phylip.html">http://evolution.genetics.washington.edu/phylip.html</ext-link>) in
this server. The Fitch method is not feasible when the number of species is as large as 100
or more. We did not use an algorithm such as the maximal likelihood since it is not based on
distance matrices alone.</p>
    <p>We have checked the dependence of the trees on the string length <italic>K</italic>, which
may be taken as an indicator of the ‘resolution power’ of the method. The tree topology did
stabilize with <italic>K</italic> increasing and with respect to re-sampling of protein
sequences. We fixed <italic>K</italic> to 5 in this server, because there is little
difference between the <italic>K</italic> = 5 and <italic>K</italic> = 6 trees, but the
computation increases significantly for <italic>K</italic> = 6.</p>
  </sec>
  <sec>
    <title>IMPLEMENTATION</title>
    <p>The Composition Vector Tree method is implemented in C++. The program runs on a Linux PC
cluster and the web server is accessible on the Internet via a PHP- and CGI-based web
interface. The CVTree system is available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://cvtree.cbi.pku.edu.cn">http://cvtree.cbi.pku.edu.cn</ext-link>. Users may select organisms from a list or upload
their own protein sequences as input to CVTree. When there are too many files to be uploaded
through the Internet, one can download the source code of CVTree and run jobs on a local
computer.</p>
    <p>The CVTree interface is shown in <xref rid="FIG1">Figure 1</xref>. The left panel lists the
steps of using the system for users' convenience. It contains four sections: organism
selection, sequence uploading, outgroup assignment and feedback path selection. </p>

      <graphic xlink:href="gkh362f1"/>
    </fig>
    <p>The organism selection section allows the selection of organisms whose genome sequences are
available on the web server. In this server, we have included all prokaryote complete
genomes that were publicly available by the end of December 2003. In fact, there are two
available sets of prokaryote complete genomes. Those in GenBank (<xref rid="B21">21</xref>)
are the original data submitted by their authors. Those at the National Center for
Biotechnological Information (NCBI) (<xref rid="B22">22</xref>) are reference genomes
curated by NCBI staff. Since the latter represents the approach of one and the same group
using the same set of tools, it may provide a more consistent background for comparison.
Therefore, we used all the translated amino acid sequences (the .faa files with NC_
accession numbers) from NCBI. If a genome consists of more than one chromosome, we collected
all the translated sequences. Altogether 139 organisms distributed in 15 phyla, 26 classes,
47 orders, 58 families and 76 genera are available at present and will be constantly
updated.</p>
    <p>The sequence uploading section allows users to upload their own sequence. All the sequences
of the same organism should be included in one file in FASTA format. Each protein sequence
in this file should start with an annotation line whose first character is ‘&gt;’, followed
by the protein sequence. This file should be named with a short abbreviation, which will
label the species on the result tree. Once the Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) have been
defined from the input, CVTree will prepare a distance matrix for the NJ program in PHYLIP.
Before running the main program, one should appoint an OTU as outgroup of the whole tree;
this procedure will affect the layout of output. The distance matrix and tree file may be
obtained through the web page or by Email.</p>
    <p>CVTree generates three files for each job: a distance matrix and two tree files. The format
of the first file is the same as the input file for the distance matrix cluster methods in
PHYLIP. The first line of the input file contains the number of species. There follows
species data starting with a species name which is ten characters long and will be filled
with blanks if the name is shorter than 10. In each line, after the species name, there
follows a set of distances to all the other species. The last two files are generated by the
NJ program based on the previous distance matrix.</p>
    <p>Since it is a time-consuming job to calculate the composition distances, a distance matrix
for 139 prokaryote organisms has been stored in this server. The corresponding result may be
obtained in a span of several minutes to half an hour after each submission. If a user
selects <italic>N</italic> organisms from the list and uploads <italic>M</italic> organisms
of their own, the total amount of calculation time may be estimated as (<italic>N</italic> ×
<italic>M</italic> + [<italic>M</italic> × (<italic>M</italic> − 1)]//2] × 0.1 minutes on
a Linux PC cluster of two CPUs.</p>
