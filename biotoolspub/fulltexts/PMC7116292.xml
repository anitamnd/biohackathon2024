      <p id="P1">NLRP3 is an innate immune sensor contributing to the development of different
diseases including monogenic autoinflammatory syndromes, gout, atherosclerosis, and
Alzheimer’s disease. The molecule sulfonylurea MCC950 is a NLRP3 inflammasome
inhibitor with potential clinical utility. However, the mechanism of action of MCC950
remains unknown. Here, we characterize the mechanism of action of MCC950 in both wild-type
and autoinflammatory-related NLRP3 mutants, demonstrating that MCC950 closes the
‘open’ conformation of active NLRP3.</p>

  <p id="P2">The activation of the NOD-like receptor pyrin domain-containing protein 3 (NLRP3)
inflammasome is involved in the pathophysiology of numerous non-communicable diseases through
the development of sterile inflammation<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>–<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>. NLRP3 senses different host-derived sterile signals and
oligomerizes with the apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase recruitment
domain (ASC), forming intracellular signaling hubs that activate caspase-1<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>–<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>. Caspase-1
proteolytically generates the active forms of a number of pro-inflammatory cytokines from the
IL-1 family, and induces pyroptotic cell death by gasdermin D cleavage, resulting in the
release of sterile intracellular content, which amplifies host-derived danger signaling<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>–<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>. The
development of compounds inhibiting IL-1 release started with the identification of the
sulfonylurea CP-456,773/CRID3, recently renamed as MCC950, a compound with proven specificity
in inhibiting the NLRP3 inflammasome<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>. Different compounds targeting NLRP3 have demonstrated
beneficial effects in several murine models of disease, with MCC950 showing a strong
inhibitory effect with good pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>–<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>.
Despite the selectivity of MCC950 for inhibiting NLRP3 activation, its mechanism of action has
not been yet elucidated. In this study, we found that MCC950 is able to modify the active
conformation of NLRP3, and that it blocks NLRP3 oligomerization in response to external
stimulation or when NLRP3 contains gain-of-function mutations.</p>
  <p id="P3">We developed a method to study the molecular conformation of NLRP3 by using
bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET)<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>. We found that compared to wild-type
NLRP3, the disease-associated mutant p.D305N NLRP3 expressed in HEK293T cells appears to have
a distinct conformation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig.
1a,b</xref>), suggesting that the N- and C-terminus of the mutant NLRP3 are separated
compared to the wild-type NLRP3, and therefore pathological mutant NLRP3 could be in an
‘open’ conformation. This difference in BRET signal was not due to variations in
protein expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig.
1c,d</xref>) and was also observed in other pathological mutants of NLRP3 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1c</xref>). NLRP3 BRET signal
was intramolecular, since a stable signal was found when increased concentration of the sensor
was expressed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig.
1b</xref>). The incubation of cells expressing the NLRP3 p.D305N BRET sensor with MCC950 at
different doses or over increasing times, resulted in an increase of the BRET signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a,b</xref>). These suggest that MCC950 induced closure of the
active NLRP3 p.D305N conformation without changing YFP signals (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1e</xref>). MCC950 increased
BRET signal from different NLRP3 pathological mutants, and slightly modified the wild-type
NLRP3 structure (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig.
1f</xref>), suggesting that MCC950 can binds the resting NLRP3. MCC950 effect on NLRP3
structure was reversible (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig.
1g</xref>). The MCC950-driven increase in BRET signal from mutant NLRP3 is not necessarily
indicative of a structural conformation identical to inactive wild-type NLRP3. To demonstrate
that the increase in BRET and the ‘closure’ of the structure are indicative of
NLRP3 inhibition, we expressed NLRP3 mutants in immortalized
<italic>Nlrp3</italic>
<sup>-/-</sup> macrophages, and recorded BRET whilst evaluating NLRP3
function. We found that BRET signal of ectopic mutant NLRP3 in macrophages was similar to that
of HEK293T cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig.
1h</xref>). MCC950 was able to increase NLRP3 BRET signal and in parallel blocked the
processing of caspase-1 substrates IL-1β and GSDMD in macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>). We then expressed N-terminal YFP-tagged NLRP3 in HEK293T, and
found that gain-of-function NLRP3 mutations resulted in oligomerization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary
Fig. 2a</xref>). NLRP3 oligomers were able to recruit ASC (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2b</xref>), suggesting they
present a functional structure. The number of oligomers per cell varied for the three
different gain-of-function mutations, with the p.D305N and p.T350M being the mutations showing
higher numbers of oligomers per cell when compared to p.R262W (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig.
2a</xref>). The p.D305N mutation was the strongest inducer of oligomers, correlating with
clinical observations that the p.D305N mutation is associated with the most severe form of
NLRP3-associated autoinflammatory syndromes<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>. While
MCC950 almost completely disaggregated all p.D305N oligomers, it left &gt;50% of the cells
containing at least one p.T350M oligomer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>).
Monocytes from individuals carrying the p.D305N NLRP3 mutation released a higher concentration
of IL-1β and contained a higher percentage of ASC specks compared to those from healthy
donors in response to LPS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e</xref>). LPS treatment
resulted in an increase of NLRP3 expression in human monocytes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3a</xref>), which is required
to induce ASC-specks and the release of IL-1β from cryopyrin-associated periodic
syndrome (CAPS) monocytes<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>. Higher concentration of
MCC950 was required to block mutant p.D305N NLRP3 in monocytes from CAPS than to block NLRP3
activation from healthy individuals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1f,g</xref>). This
effect was not due to interference with LPS priming<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>
(<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3b</xref>), nor with
high expression of NLRP3 or ASC specks in CAPS samples (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3c,d</xref>). These suggest
that the residue at position 305 could be important for the action of MCC950, which is indeed
within the Walker B ATP-hydrolysis motif of NLRP3, an essential motif for NLRP3 activity<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>. We then performed NLRP3 NACHT homology modeling,
followed by blind docking (BD) and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Our model systems
disclosed the residues within the Walker B motif in both clusters formed an hydrophobic pocket
for MCC950 that was stabilized by hydrogen bonds with residues upstream and downstream of this
motif (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 4a,b</xref>), this
is compatible with the reversible inhibitory effect of MCC950 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1g</xref>). BD calculations
using ADP found the binding amino acids within the Walker A motif and also the distal H522
(<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 4a</xref>). The
consensus clusters could represent two potential MCC950 binding spots, that could be further
stabilized and alter NLRP3 conformation. 100 ns MD simulations starting from the two clusters
found that the binding of MCC950 to both clusters remains stable (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 4a-c</xref>) and that NLRP3
structure was predicted to be affected by MCC950 binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig.
2a</xref>). After 100 ns of MD simulations, cluster 2 residues within Walker B presented a
more favorable binding energy to MCC950 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 4d</xref>), with F304 establishing stacking interactions with F257 and
the aromatic ring of MCC950 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary
Fig. 4b,e</xref>). When key amino acids required for Walker B function (D302 and E306 in
human, corresponding to D298 and E302 in mouse) were alanine-substituted in the NLRP3 p.D305N
background, MCC950 lost its ability to increase the BRET signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>).</p>
  <p id="P4">We then stimulated HEK293T cells expressing the wild-type NLRP3 BRET sensor with
either nigericin or ATP (the latter in a HEK293T stably expressing P2X7 receptor) and both
stimuli decreased NLRP3 BRET signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>). After
stimulation, NLRP3 BRET signal was still intramolecular (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5a</xref>). NLRP3-activating
stimuli ‘open’ NLRP3 conformation with a separation of the N- and C-terminus
that may represent the active NLRP3 conformation, this was confirmed since nigericin induced
NLRP3 oligomerization coincided with the stabilization of the ‘open’ structure
(<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5b</xref>). This
oligomerization was not due to non-specific aggregation induced by the YFP fluorescent tag, as
GFP alone was unable to form oligomers in the cell after nigericin stimulation and NLRP3
without YFP tag was also able to form oligomers after nigericin treatment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5c</xref>). Addition of
MCC950 to the wild type NLRP3 during an ‘open’ stable conformation after
nigericin stimulation resulted in a higher BRET signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig.
3b</xref>). We next incubated HEK293T cells with MCC950 before and during nigericin or ATP
(the latter in a HEK293T expressing P2X7 receptor) and MCC950 was able to increase BRET signal
after NLRP3 ‘opening’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5d</xref>). MCC950 was also
able to block the formation of NLRP3 oligomers in response to nigericin treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5e</xref>), suggesting that MCC950 forced the ‘open’
active NLRP3 structure into a ‘closed’ conformation that may be unable to
self-associate. The inactive NLRP3 structure induced after MCC950 and nigericin treatment is
significantly different to the resting NLRP3 structure (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5f</xref>). Although both
BRET signals indicate a ‘closed’ structure, this does not necessary mean that
they have the same conformation. To support this idea, we studied the response of NLRP3 to
stimulation subsequent to it being inactivated after nigericin and MCC950 treatment. If this
inhibited structure is similar to the resting NLRP3 it should ‘open’ again in
response to a second stimulation. The MCC950-nigericin ‘closed’ NLRP3 fails to
change its structure in response to a second stimulation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5g</xref>), suggesting that
MCC950 could be present in the NLRP3 inactive complex, in a different structure from the
resting NLRP3 conformation. The effect of MCC950 on NLRP3 conformation was independent of the
PYD domain (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5d</xref>)
and it was also blocking the activation of a NLRP3 that lacks the LRR domain<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, supporting that MCC950 could targets the NACHT domain.
As this domain is important for the oligomerization of NLRP3 upon ATP binding and
hydrolysis<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> and NEK7 is a protein required for the
final activation of NLRP3<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, we then performed NEK7 knock-down (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 6a</xref>). We observed that
NEK7 silencing resulted in a potentiation of the MCC950 induced ‘closed’
structure of NLRP3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3e</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 6b</xref>). While activation
of NLRP3 induced the co-localization of NEK7 in NLRP3 oligomers and the co-immunoprecipitation
of NEK7 with NLRP3, MCC950 impaired the association of NLRP3 with NEK7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3f</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary
Fig. 6c</xref>). These data suggest that after decreasing NEK7 expression, MCC950 is able to
more efficiently ‘close’ NLRP3 active conformation and that the change induced
by MCC950 over the active ‘open’ structure of NLRP3 could disrupt the
interaction with NEK7. The accompanying study by Coll <italic>et al</italic>. shows that
MCC950 do not binds NEK7, but directly targets NLRP3 at a site within or close to the Walker B
motif and blocks ATP hydrolysis, blocking NLRP3 activation<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>. Together, these complementary studies demonstrate that MCC950 prevents NLRP3
activation by directly interacting with NLRP3 and affecting Walker B function leading to an
inactive NLRP3 conformation.</p>
  <p id="P5">In conclusion, our study demonstrates that MCC950 closes the NLRP3 active
conformation in pathological gain-of-function NLRP3 mutants or during stimulation of wild-type
NLRP3. MCC950 showed different inhibitory effects over distinct pathological NLRP3 mutations,
raising the possibility of developing a personalized therapy for individuals with monogenic
autoinflammatory syndromes carrying specific mutations where the compound is more
effective.</p>

BRET sensors (wild-type and mutants) were plated on a poly-L-lysine–coated white
opaque 96-well plate; after adhesion, cells were incubated with different doses of MCC950
(as stated in the figure legends) or vehicle, washed with PBS with calcium and magnesium,
and BRET readings were performed 5 min after the addition of 5 μM coelenterazine-H
substrate. BRET signals were detected with two filter settings
(<italic>Renilla</italic>-luciferase (Luc) filter [485 ± 20 nm] and YFP filter [530
± 25 nm]) at 37ºC using the Synergy Mx plate reader (BioTek) as described
before<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>. In some experiments, BRET signal
was recorded every 35 seconds before and after nigericin or ATP automatic injection for a
total of 15 min. For experiments measuring basal BRET signal, a stable signal for 5 min
kinetic was recorded and averaged. BRET signal was similar when comparing HEK293T clones
stably expressing the different NLRP3 BRET sensor with transient transfections for the
same construct. Titration was performed by transfection of different amounts of plasmids
encoding YFP-NLRP3-Luc or YFP-NLRP3 p.D305N-Luc (pcDNA empty plasmid was used to have
equal amounts of total DNA in all the transfections). Expression of the different sensors
was monitored by reading YFP fluorescence in the plate reader or by assessing individual
cell relative fluorescence by fluorescence microcopy. Titration of the sensor determines
whether the recorded BRET is intra- or inter-molecular. For intramolecular BRET the
increase in the BRET sensor expression results in a stable BRET signal while for
intermolecular BRET the increase in the BRET sensor expression results in a proportional
increase of the BRET signal. The BRET ratio was defined as the difference of the emission
ratio 530 nm/485 nm of the BRET sensor minus this ratio of the Luc only tagged NLRP3.
Results were expressed in milliBRET units (mBU). The area under curve of the BRET kinetic
was measured taking all the points after stimulation (from 315 s), and the data from the
MCC950 treatment was normalized to its respective vehicle treated cells in resting,
nigericin or ATP treatments independently.</p>
