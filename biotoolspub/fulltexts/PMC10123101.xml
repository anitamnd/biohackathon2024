      <title>Abstract</title>
      <p>Multiplex amplicon sequencing is a versatile method to identify genetic variation in natural or mutagenized populations through eco-tilling or multiplex CRISPR screens. Such genotyping screens require reliable and specific primer designs, combined with simultaneous gRNA design for CRISPR screens. Unfortunately, current tools are unable to combine multiplex gRNA and primer design in a high-throughput and easy-to-use manner with high design flexibility. Here, we report the development of a bioinformatics tool called <italic toggle="yes">SMAP design</italic> to overcome these limitations. We tested <italic toggle="yes">SMAP design</italic> on several plant and non-plant genomes and obtained designs for more than 80–90% of the target genes, depending on the genome and gene family. We validated the designs with Illumina multiplex amplicon sequencing and Sanger sequencing in Arabidopsis, soybean, and maize. We also used <italic toggle="yes">SMAP design</italic> to perform eco-tilling by tilling PCR amplicons across nine candidate genes putatively associated with haploid induction in <italic toggle="yes">Cichorium intybus</italic>. We screened 60 accessions of chicory and witloof and identified thirteen knockout haplotypes and their carriers. <italic toggle="yes">SMAP design</italic> is an easy-to-use command-line tool that generates highly specific gRNA and/or primer designs for any number of loci for CRISPR or natural variation screens and is compatible with other SMAP modules for seamless downstream analysis.</p>

    <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
    <p>The detection of genetic variation is of great value to medicine and agriculture as it allows researchers to uncover molecular mechanisms, study genetic pathways, and assign gene function. In the frame of breeding, genetic variation can be discovered by screening for beneficial alleles in natural accessions or gene pools. Sequence-based allele mining, also called eco-tilling (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>), is a method to screen for naturally occurring mutations in a set of genomic regions (i.e. candidate genes) across a broad collection of genotypes. A versatile and cost-efficient method for such targeted sequencing is highly multiplex (HiPlex) amplicon sequencing, in which multiple target regions (tens to thousands) are amplified in a single PCR reaction and all amplicons are sequenced via Illumina sequencing. Adding sample-specific indices during library preparation allows the pooling of up to hundreds or thousands of samples in a single sequencing run. There are ample examples of studies using this technique in several crops including barley, rice, soy, and wheat (reviewed in (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>)).</p>
    <p>Carriers of rare, defective alleles often display useful phenotypes (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>) making their identification important for crop breeding and fundamental research. However, population genetics theory predicts that defective alleles may be maintained at a low frequency in natural populations as they negatively affect plant fitness and are subject to negative selection (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). When such carriers are difficult to find in natural populations, genetic variation can be induced with random mutagens like ethyl methanesulfonate or in a targeted fashion with genome editing technologies like CRISPR. CRISPR has become the staple genome editing tool due to its efficacy and simple design. In its most basic form, a CRISPR-associated endonuclease (Cas) is directed to a target site via a guide RNA (gRNA), where it creates a double-stranded DNA break (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). In most eukaryotes, imperfect repair typically results in insertions and/or deletions (indels), or infrequently substitutions, around the breakpoint (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). In principle, CRISPR can be used to knock out any protein-coding gene by disrupting the reading frame or regulatory regions. Multiplex CRISPR screens go a step further by simultaneously targeting multiple genomic loci with arrays of gRNAs to produce large collections of individuals with unique combinations of induced DNA modifications (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Therefore, eco-tilling and CRISPR are highly complementary mutation screening approaches.</p>
    <p>An essential component of any mutant screen is the genotyping assay to identify the underlying sequence variant. Specific design parameters need to be considered for each assay's respective purpose and constraints. For eco-tilling, complete coverage of the regulatory and coding regions is preferred as it allows one to identify all existing mutations in the set of candidate loci across the gene pool and thereby identify conserved and variable genic regions and carriers of defective alleles. While primer design is typically based on a single representative reference genome sequence, eco-tilling may be subject to amplicon dropout in highly divergent regions due to primer-template mismatches. In addition, HiPlex amplicons cannot overlap within a single multiplex reaction as the smaller amplicons, formed through cross-amplification (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S1</xref>), would dominate the PCR and reduce coverage. Therefore, in multiplex PCR applications, multiple primer mixtures need to be designed to specifically amplify complementary (partially overlapping) regions across the candidate loci in separate reactions.</p>
    <p>In contrast, most CRISPR screens do not require complete coverage of the candidate gene sequence. Instead, the design focuses on specific and efficient gRNAs, using prior knowledge of essential regions of the CDS and/or regulatory sequences, and covers those target regions with few amplicons with high primer-binding specificity so that mutations can be evaluated. Furthermore, many CRISPR screens only sequence the gRNA(s) present in the population as a proxy for the mutant genotype and do not reveal the true underlying genotype at the target loci. Therefore, high-throughput genotyping assays that can specifically cover the large number of target loci in a CRISPR screen are desirable. Genotyping assays are relatively simple to design manually for a handful of targets, but it can take months for a combinatorial, multiplex CRISPR screen with hundreds of targets. Designing amplicons for gene families is particularly challenging due to sequence similarity between paralogous genes and the chance of cross-amplification or off-target amplification (here collectively called mispriming; <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S1</xref>). In addition, specific design parameters such as amplicon size range need to be adjusted depending on the downstream library preparation and sequencing technology (e.g. paired-end Illumina short reads or Sanger sequencing). While there are several online and command-line tools available for gRNA design (CRISPOR, CHOPCHOP, FlashFry, CRISPRscan, CCTop) and primer design (PrimerMapper, PrimerView, Primer3), none are integrated with genotyping assay design in a high-throughput manner with the flexibility and specificity required for large-scale multiplex experiments (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11–18</xref>). Thus, combined gRNA and amplicon design is currently one of the limiting factors to perform medium to high-throughput multiplex CRISPR screens on tens to thousands of genes.</p>
    <p>Here, we report the development of a bioinformatics tool called <italic toggle="yes">SMAP design</italic> that addresses these limitations and seamlessly fits into the larger SMAP (Stack Mapping Anchor Points) package that analyzes naturally occurring and CRISPR-induced sequence variants (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). <italic toggle="yes">SMAP design</italic> uses Primer3 (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>) to create sets of amplicons with localized or global coverage across reference sequences. For CRISPR experiments, amplicon coordinates are intersected with gRNA target sites from algorithms such as CRISPOR (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>) or FlashFry (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>), based on user-defined positional boundaries. Sets of amplicons/gRNAs can be created within minutes for tens of loci, or up to a few hours for more complex designs with a few hundred genes. We performed <italic toggle="yes">in silico</italic> designs on 80–95 gene families of varying sizes and in different species and implemented several options to increase coverage. We further empirically validated the designs by PCR amplification and Sanger sequencing or HiPlex sequencing on reference or CRISPR materials (Arabidopsis, soybean and maize). We performed eco-tilling in natural accessions of chicory and witloof (<italic toggle="yes">Cichorium intybus</italic> var<italic toggle="yes">. sativum</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">C. intybus</italic> var<italic toggle="yes">. foliosum</italic>) using primer sets made by <italic toggle="yes">SMAP design</italic> targeting nine candidate genes putatively involved in haploid induction and demonstrate strategies to enhance the mutation screening capacity by combining multiplexing and sample pooling.</p>

      <p><italic toggle="yes">SMAP design</italic> is a command-line tool written in Python3 and is an addition to the SMAP package (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). The program uses the Primer3-py (<ext-link xlink:href="https://pypi.org/project/primer3-py" ext-link-type="uri">https://pypi.org/project/primer3-py</ext-link>, version 0.6.1 or newer), Biopython (<ext-link xlink:href="https://biopython.org" ext-link-type="uri">https://biopython.org</ext-link>, version 1.77 or newer), Pandas (<ext-link xlink:href="https://pandas.pydata.org" ext-link-type="uri">https://pandas.pydata.org</ext-link>, version 1.1.5 or newer), Numpy (<ext-link xlink:href="https://numpy.org" ext-link-type="uri">https://numpy.org</ext-link>, version 1.18.5 or newer), and Matplotlib (<ext-link xlink:href="https://matplotlib.org" ext-link-type="uri">https://matplotlib.org</ext-link>, version 3.3.3 or newer) packages. All <italic toggle="yes">SMAP design</italic> runs were performed on a computing cluster with Intel Xeon CPUs on one core. <italic toggle="yes">SMAP design</italic> and its source code are available at <ext-link xlink:href="https://gitlab.com/ilvo/smap-design" ext-link-type="uri">https://gitlab.com/ilvo/smap-design</ext-link>, and a detailed user manual and guidelines are available at <ext-link xlink:href="https://ngs-smap.readthedocs.io/en/latest/design/" ext-link-type="uri">https://ngs-smap.readthedocs.io/en/latest/design/</ext-link>, under the GNU Affero General Public License v3.0. <italic toggle="yes">SMAP design</italic> is also available online as a graphical user interface at usegalaxy.be.</p>
      <sec id="SEC2-1-1">
        <title>Genome source and extraction of candidate genes</title>
        <p>All genome and annotation files were retrieved from PLAZA dicot 4.5, PLAZA monocot 4.5, or PLAZA pico 3.0 (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table S1</xref>; (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>)). A novel, in-house assembled and annotated reference genome sequence of <italic toggle="yes">C. intybus</italic> var<italic toggle="yes">. sativum</italic> (unpublished) was used for genome-wide identification of gene family members from the selected gene families. Input files for <italic toggle="yes">SMAP design</italic> were generated with <italic toggle="yes">SMAP target-selection. SMAP target-selection</italic> is a command-line tool written in Python3 that extracts the genomic sequence of candidate genes from the reference genome (optionally with extra upstream or downstream flanking regions), based on a user-provided list of gene IDs (optionally combined with grouping based on gene family, genetic network, or genetic pathway membership; here, PLAZA homology groups were used), and orients the sequences in the reference sequence FASTA file so that the CDS is encoded on the positive strand. A GFF file that contains the relative coordinates of the annotated features (gene, CDS, exon, optionally critical domains) of the extracted genes is also generated for further downstream analysis with <italic toggle="yes">SMAP design</italic> and the other modules in the SMAP package (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>).</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="SEC2-1-2">
        <title>gRNA design with FlashFry and CRISPOR</title>
        <p>FlashFry (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>) was used to design gRNAs for all the analyses except for the genome-wide design of <italic toggle="yes">Physcomitrium patens</italic>, for which gRNAs were designed by CRISPOR (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Both programs were run with the default settings except for the mismatch parameter of CRISPOR, which was set to 3 (<italic toggle="yes">–mm</italic>). SpCas9 with NGG PAM sequence was used for all designs.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="SEC2-1-3">
        <title>SMAP design parameter settings</title>
        <p>Primer3 default settings (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>) were used with the exception of the user-defined settings in <italic toggle="yes">SMAP design</italic> (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table S2</xref>) and the minimum distance between adjacent forward and reverse primers (set to 5 bp). Four general designs were performed for this report: (i) Design<sub>HiPlex</sub>, the amplicon size was set to 120–150 bp and a distance of 15 bp between the gRNAs and primers to be compatible with the HiPlex sequencing service of Floodlight Genomics LLC. (ii) Design<sub>PE</sub>, the amplicon size was set to 220–250 bp and a 15 bp distance between the gRNAs and primers to be compatible with paired-end 150 bp Illumina sequencing. (iii) Design<sub>Sanger</sub>, the amplicon size was set to 400–800 bp and a 150 bp distance between the gRNAs and primers as these are the preferred settings for ICE (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>) or TIDE (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>) analysis of Sanger sequences. (iv) Design<sub>NatVar</sub>, the amplicon size was set to 120–150 bp and the maximum number of amplicons for each of the candidate genes was requested. After one design round with Design<sub>NatVar</sub>, the selected primer binding sites were encoded as ‘N’ sequences in the reference sequence input file to exclude those regions from Primer3 design in a second iteration with the same settings. This provides a strategy to iteratively create two or more complementary HiPlex assays with partially overlapping (i.e. tiled) amplicons that together increase coverage of the reference sequence when performed in parallel.</p>

        <p>We used <italic toggle="yes">SMAP design</italic> to create 117 gRNA and amplicon designs on 67 growth-related maize genes (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). The amplicons were first validated on 20 wild-type maize (B104) leaf samples using HiPlex sequencing. The top 50 amplicons, i.e. amplicons with reads perfectly matching the reference and highest read depth, were selected as Cas9 targets (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplemental Figure S2</xref>). The 50 Golden Gate gRNA entry vectors and 10 expression vectors were constructed as previously described (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). Briefly, oligos were annealed in 48 μl of Milli-Q water followed by an incubation in the thermal cycler with the following program: 5 min at 95°C; 95°C to 85°C at –2°C/s; 85°C to 25°C at –0.1°C/s. The annealed oligos were inserted into gRNA entry vectors with a Golden Gate reaction ((37°C, 5 min; 16°C, 5 min) × 30; 50°C, 5 min; 80°C, 5 min) using the BbsI-HF restriction enzyme (New England Biolabs) and T4 DNA ligase (New England Biolabs) (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). Each gRNA entry vector contains the scaffold and a TaU3 promoter to express the gRNA. The Golden Gate reactions were transformed via heat shock into <italic toggle="yes">ccd</italic>B-sensitive DH5α <italic toggle="yes">Escherichia coli</italic> cells and plated on lysogeny broth + carbenicillin (100 μg/ml.). The entry vectors were isolated (GeneJET Plasmid Miniprep kit, Thermo Fisher Scientific) and validated with Sanger sequencing (Mix2Seq, Eurofins Scientific). Expression vectors were made by combining five gRNA entry vectors and a linker vector pGG-F-linkerII-G (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>) into the destination vector pGG-AG-KmR (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>) using a Golden Gate reaction with the same parameters as described above, except with BsaI-HFv2 (New England Biolabs) instead of BbsI-HF. Expression vectors were validated using a restriction digest with NheI and SacI (Promega) and whole-plasmid sequencing (Plasmidsaurus). Expression vectors were purified using the plasmid Midiprep kit (Zymo Research) for protoplast transfection.

Prior to running <italic toggle="yes">SMAP design</italic>, a FASTA file with sets of candidate gene reference sequences (e.g. entire gene families, gene networks, genetic pathways, or any other customized grouping) can be extracted from the reference genome using <italic toggle="yes">SMAP target-selection</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">SMAP target-selection</italic> orients all genes with the CDS on the positive strand for a consistent coordinate system and automatically generates a corresponding GFF file with the relative location of gene features (e.g. CDS or critical domains). The FASTA and GFF files are used as input for <italic toggle="yes">SMAP design</italic> and downstream analyses with other modules of the SMAP package (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). If the user wants amplicons to specifically cover one or more gRNAs, a list of gRNAs is provided as a tab-delimited file in the format as described in the online user manual (output gRNA files from CRISPOR and FlashFry can be directly fed to <italic toggle="yes">SMAP design</italic>).</p>

Based on the ranking, a maximum (user-defined) number of non-overlapping amplicons per gene are selected. Two or three output files are created by default: a primer and gRNA file with the respective sequences per gene, and a GFF file specifying the location of the primers and gRNAs.

By default, the specificity of each primer is tested against the entire reference FASTA file to avoid mispriming (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S1</xref>). Primer specificity thresholds can be adjusted or switched off. Alternatively, the user can provide a list of gene IDs to limit amplicon design to only that subset, while still using all reference sequences in the FASTA file for primer specificity testing. As Primer3 automatically avoids primer design at ambiguous nucleotides, known polymorphic positions such as SNPs can <italic toggle="yes">a priori</italic> be substituted by N-encoded nucleotides in the reference sequence FASTA to circumvent inefficient primer binding. Primers are spaced by a minimum of 5 bp to spread the amplicons across the target sequences. By default, amplicons with homopolymers (≥ 10 repeated nucleotides) are filtered out because downstream sequencing will likely yield low-quality reads. If no gRNAs are provided by the user (e.g. in case of screening for natural variation), <italic toggle="yes">SMAP design</italic> selects sets of non-overlapping amplicons to maximize reference sequence coverage.</p>

By default, gRNAs with a poly-T stretch (≥ 4T, a Pol III termination signal) are removed. Short vector sequences directly flanking the gRNA sequence (i.e. promotor and scaffold) can be provided to simulate vector construction steps and exclude gRNAs with restriction sites (e.g. BsaI or BbsI) that interfere with cloning. To increase the likelihood of making knockout mutations, gRNA selection can be focused on selected domains defined via a particular feature type in the annotation GFF (e.g. kinase domain). The user can also exclude a segment of the 5’ and 3’ of the CDS to steer gRNA target sites to a part of the CDS. An optional minimum gRNA specificity score (e.g. MIT score (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>)) threshold can also be applied.</p>

        <title>Ranking and filtering amplicons and gRNAs</title>
        <p>Filtered gRNAs are grouped to amplicons by positional overlap. By default, a gRNA is only grouped to an amplicon if the distance between the end of the primer and the gRNA binding site is at least 15 bp. Amplicons are ranked based on the gRNAs they cover according to the following criteria and order: (i) the number of gRNAs (an amplicon with multiple gRNAs will rank higher than an amplicon with a single gRNA); (ii) the positional overlap between gRNAs (amplicons with non-overlapping gRNAs will rank highest); (iii) the average gRNA specificity scores (e.g. MIT score (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>)) and (iv) the average gRNA efficiency scores (such as the Doench (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>) and out-of-frame scores (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>)). If no specificity or efficiency scores are provided in the gRNA file, amplicons are only ranked by the first two criteria. Ultimately, <italic toggle="yes">SMAP design</italic> selects a (user-defined) maximum number of top-ranking, non-overlapping amplicons per gene, each covering a (user-defined) maximum number of gRNAs (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table S2</xref>).</p>

        <p><italic toggle="yes">SMAP design</italic> generates two files by default: a tab-separated values (TSV) file with the primer sequences sequentially numbered per gene and a GFF file with the primer locations on the target gene reference sequences (and other annotation features that were included in the GFF input file). If a gRNA list is provided, <italic toggle="yes">SMAP design</italic> also generates a TSV file with the selected gRNA sequences per gene (Figure <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). If no design was possible, the underlying reasons are included per gene at the end of the TSV files. Optionally, summary tables and graphs are generated for a quick evaluation of the set of amplicons and gRNAs (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S3</xref>). These graphs show the distributions of the number of gRNAs and non-overlapping amplicons per gene that <italic toggle="yes">SMAP design</italic> generated and indicate the reasons for dropout per gene. For instance, the design may fail because no gRNAs were designed for that gene, none of the gRNAs passed all filters, Primer3 was not capable of designing specific amplicons for the gene, or there was no overlap between the gRNAs and the amplicons. Optionally, a GFF file is created with positions of border sequences required for downstream amplicon analysis by <italic toggle="yes">SMAP haplotype-window</italic> and a BED file required for <italic toggle="yes">SMAP haplotype-sites</italic> (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). In debug mode, an extra GFF output file containing all amplicons and gRNAs prior to filtering is given as a way to visualize the relative positions of all amplicons.

We considered at least one amplicon covering at least two gRNAs per gene as the minimum required for a knockout experiment and determined the fraction of genes per family that were ‘retained’ with these criteria for each design setting (here called ‘retention rate’).</p>

The same gene families were tested between settings and between the multicellular plant species and between the non-plant species, respectively. Retention rate is defined as the percentage of genes per gene family that contain at least one amplicon covering a minimum of two gRNAs.

      </fig>
      <p>Overall, the average retention rate per gene family for most tested species is ≥ 80% and there is a clear increase in retention rate with increasing amplicon size (Figure <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). The unicellular species Chlamydomonas and yeast had the highest average retention rates of ≥ 96%. Plant genomes with a lower fraction of recently-duplicated regions such as Arabidopsis, <italic toggle="yes">P. patens</italic>, and rice displayed average retention rates of 90% or higher for all three designs. The average retention rates for tomato, potato and maize ranged from 80% to 90%, with the exception of maize for Design<sub>HiPlex</sub> (65%). Soybean had the lowest average retention rate per gene family with 27%, 44%, 79% for Design<sub>HiPlex</sub>, Design<sub>PE</sub> and Design<sub>Sanger</sub>, respectively, likely due to the highly duplicated nature of its genome (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). These data indicate that genome constitution (e.g. recent genome duplication) affects the retention rate and that increasing the amplicon size can reduce design dropout.</p>
      <p>During the analysis of Design<sub>Sanger</sub>, we also observed that small genes preferentially dropped out since the gene size was less than the required amplicon length of 400–800 bp. To overcome this limitation, <italic toggle="yes">SMAP target-selection</italic> was set to extract flanking regions 500 bp upstream and downstream of the target genes, resulting in Design<sub>Sanger,Ext</sub>. This increased the number of retained genes from 1399 to 1406 (out of 1446) genes for Arabidopsis (1% improvement), and from 1214 to 1338 (out of 1595) genes for potato (8% improvement; Figure <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). This further shows that primer and gRNA design optimization relies on both accurate selection of target reference sequences with <italic toggle="yes">SMAP target-selection</italic> as well as parameter settings of <italic toggle="yes">SMAP design</italic>.</p>
      <p>The average retention rates were much lower for the mouse and human genomes (ranging from 45% to 68%; Figure <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). As Primer3 designs amplicons across the entire sequence (exons and introns) and mammalian genes contain relatively large introns, we reasoned that many of the 150 designed amplicons possibly fell into the introns and were thus filtered out at the merging step. To overcome this, the option –<italic toggle="yes">restrictedPrimerDesign</italic> (<italic toggle="yes">-rpd</italic>) was added to restrict Primer3 to design amplicons near exons (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table S2</xref>). Running <italic toggle="yes">SMAP design</italic> with <italic toggle="yes">-rpd</italic> increased the average retention rate for Design<sub>PE</sub> by 10% for both species and the runtime was two to three times faster (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S4</xref>). While ignoring intronic regions results in a clear improvement in retention rate, this result indicates there are additional sequence constraints limiting designs in these genomes and that parameter settings may need to be fine-tuned accordingly.</p>

      <title>Empirical testing of <italic toggle="yes">SMAP design</italic> in various species</title>
      <p>To validate the specificity and amplification efficiency of Design<sub>HiPlex</sub>, we designed 40 amplicons on the <italic toggle="yes">MAP3K</italic> gene family in both Arabidopsis and soybean and performed HiPlex sequencing on 24 replicates of the reference genotypes for both species. For both Arabidopsis and soybean, all amplicons were sequenced in all replicates. Read depth was uniform across all amplicons with an average range &lt; 13-fold for 39 of the 40 amplicons for both species (Figure <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Three amplicons for Arabidopsis and one amplicon for soybean fell below an arbitrary threshold of 1,000 reads across all samples and would likely be removed when establishing the genotyping assay to ensure reliable coverage of all amplicons in a screen. In Arabidopsis, a non-reference haplotype with a 1-bp deletion was found at the AT2G35050 locus with an average relative read depth of 3.8% across all samples. This deletion occurred in a homopolymer of ten adenosines and is therefore likely a sequencing error. Only the reference haplotypes were found for all other loci. The AT3G50730 amplicon displayed the lowest average read depth and failed for the five samples with the lowest overall total reads per library. In soybean, three loci displayed non-reference haplotypes. Two haplotypes contained two mismatches (SNPs) compared to the reference and the third haplotype had a 3-bp deletion compared to the reference in a ‘TCC’ short sequence repeat. The average relative read depths of the non-reference haplotypes were consistently at or &lt; 5% across all samples and can likely be attributed to low abundance PCR artifacts and/or sequencing errors. Such systematic errors can be removed with the haplotype frequency filters in <italic toggle="yes">SMAP haplotype-window</italic>, by the inclusion of the non-reference haplotypes in the FASTA reference sequence used for read mapping, or by filtering for indels around the expected cut site in <italic toggle="yes">SMAP effect-prediction</italic>.</p>

      <p>After demonstrating that <italic toggle="yes">SMAP design</italic> could design highly reliable amplicons on wild-type materials, we evaluated the entire pipeline from gRNA and amplicon design to the evaluation and quantification of CRISPR-induced mutations. A total of 117 gRNA and amplicon designs were generated for 67 growth-related maize (B104) genes (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>) with the Design<sub>HiPlex</sub> setting and HiPlex sequencing was performed on 20 wild-type leaf samples to validate the amplicons. The top 50 performing amplicons (high read depth and only reads exactly matching the reference sequence) were selected for a CRISPR screen in maize protoplasts (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table S3</xref>; <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S2</xref>). Ten multiplex gRNA arrays were constructed, each containing five gRNAs. gRNAs targeting the same gene were placed on different gRNA arrays to avoid the generation of large deletions that can make the analysis more complex. Each gRNA array was co-transfected in triplicate with a Cas9 plasmid and six transfections with only the Cas9-carrying plasmid were included as negative controls. Two days after transfection, DNA was extracted from the protoplasts and analyzed by HiPlex sequencing using the validated primer mix.</p>
      <p>Using this approach, we aimed to sequence all 50 amplicons in all 36 samples. For 46 out of the 50 amplicons a consistent read depth with at least 30 reads per amplicon for &gt; 90% of the samples was observed, while the remaining four amplicons failed to produce any reads (Figure <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). We used <italic toggle="yes">SMAP haplotype-window</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">SMAP effect-prediction</italic> to quantify indels and primarily detected indels at the expected target sites, with frequencies as high as 60% (calculated as the percentage of reads with a non-reference haplotype in the region around the expected cut-site). However, we also detected indels at untargeted sites, though these values were typically &lt; 2% and can be considered background noise. Amplicon 48 was particularly noisy, showing a consistent, but low level of indels for all samples (Figure <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Overall, 45 of the 46 sequenced gRNA target sites show evidence of indels in at least two replicates with efficiencies &gt; 2%. Approximately 50% of the non-reference haplotypes contain a 1-bp insertion or deletion (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table S6</xref>). Altogether these data show that <italic toggle="yes">SMAP design</italic> can be used to create reliable amplicon and gRNA designs for CRISPR-based screens.</p>

      <title>Genome-wide <italic toggle="yes">SMAP design</italic></title>
      <p>As the initial <italic toggle="yes">in silico</italic> designs already generated amplicon and gRNA sets for thousands of genes, we decided to pre-compute amplicons and gRNAs across the entire Arabidopsis genome as a resource for the research community. The Arabidopsis Col-0 reference genome contains 27 655 annotated genes assigned to 9929 gene families containing between 1 and 208 genes (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). As we expected the potential for mispriming to be highest between genes from the same gene family, gene families were kept intact and divided into 28 groups of ±1000 genes to reduce the runtime via parallelization. <italic toggle="yes">SMAP design</italic> was run on each group to generate amplicons with Design<sub>HiPlex</sub>, Design<sub>PE</sub> and Design<sub>Sanger,Ext</sub>. A maximum of three non-overlapping amplicons covering a maximum of two gRNAs per amplicon were designed per gene. The CPU runtime per group of ±1000 genes ranged from 16 to 78 h (average 47 h) on a server with Intel Xeon CPUs using one core per group. The retention rate (defined here as the fraction of genes within the gene family with at least one amplicon with at least one gRNA per gene) was ∼62% (17 186), ∼68% (18 886), and ∼85% (23 384) of all 27 655 Arabidopsis genes with Design<sub>HiPlex</sub>, Design<sub>PE</sub> and Design<sub>Sanger,Ext</sub>, respectively.</p>
      <p>In an effort to capture a greater fraction of the genes from the genome-wide designs, we checked if there were certain features that led to the dropout of amplicons and/or gRNAs. In particular, we wondered if genes from large gene families were preferentially filtered out in the gRNA/amplicon filtering steps, with the expectation that larger gene families would be overrepresented in the dropout gene set. We compared the relative distribution of the gene family size of the dropout genes to the genome-wide gene family size distribution and found an equal proportion of dropout genes across different gene family sizes (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S5</xref>; two-sided Kolmogorov–Smirnov test <italic toggle="yes">P</italic>-value = 0,87), suggesting that the retention rate is not biased towards a particular gene family size. We therefore questioned if the dropout was due to random matches of primers to non-gene-family members instead of sequence similarity to gene family members. To test this and increase the coverage of the genome-wide designs, a second run (here termed the dropout-only run) was performed where the dropout genes were run again but grouped only with other members of their gene family to still avoid potential mispriming between gene family members. Adding the designs from the dropout-only run increased the total coverage for Design<sub>HiPlex</sub>, Design<sub>PE</sub> and Design<sub>Sanger,Ext</sub> to ∼92%, ∼94% and ∼96%, respectively. Thus, the dropout genes were likely lost due to Primer3-predicted non-specific primer binding onto reference sequences outside of their gene families.</p>
      <p>A similar two-step approach was followed for the <italic toggle="yes">P. patens</italic> genome where the 32 926 genes were divided into 33 groups of ±1000 genes, keeping gene family members together (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). The genome consists of 15 604 gene families with 1–273 members. The Design<sub>Sanger,Ext</sub> run yielded amplicons and gRNAs for ∼77% of the genome and was increased to ∼86% by including the designs from the additional dropout-only run. The CPU runtime for a group of ±1000 genes ranged from 26 to 146 h (average 113 h).</p>
      <p>To validate the Arabidopsis genome-wide Design<sub>Sanger</sub>,<sub>Ext</sub> and check for off-target amplification, 48 primer pairs were selected from each of the first and dropout-only runs of the genome-wide design. PCR followed by gel electrophoresis showed that 94 out of 96 amplicons had a single visible band (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S6</xref>) and the two other amplicons (one from the first run and one from the dropout-only run) showed a single, yet less intense band. High-quality Sanger sequencing reads were obtained for 85 out of the 96 PCR products and confirmed all amplicons specifically amplified one single locus. Overall, since no discrepancy was found between the first and dropout-only runs, either through gel electrophoresis or through Sanger sequencing, we conclude that the primers are efficient and specific for Sanger sequencing and our observations suggest that the Primer3 default settings for eliminating non-specific primers were too conservative for Sanger sequencing. We therefore added an option for users to adjust the specificity settings of Primer3 when running <italic toggle="yes">SMAP design</italic>.</p>
      <p>The eleven low-quality reads contained stretches with ≥ 10 thymidines or adenosines (homopolymers) resulting in overlapping sequencing peaks which are problematic for Sanger and Illumina-based genotyping. Interestingly, homopolymers with &lt; 10 repeated nucleotides were observed in the sequenced amplicons but did not lead to overlapping sequencing peaks. At least under our Sanger sequencing conditions, there appears to be a threshold of 10 repeated nucleotides. We therefore calculated how many potentially problematic homopolymers were present in the amplicons of the genome-wide design of Design<sub>Sanger,Ext</sub> for Arabidopsis. Out of the 45 189 amplicons, 2889 (6.4%) had at least one homopolymer (≥ 10 nucleotides) with the majority of the homopolymers consisting of poly-A or poly-T (&gt; 99%) (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S7</xref>). A filter was therefore implemented in <italic toggle="yes">SMAP design</italic> to remove amplicons containing homopolymers of a user-defined size (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table S2</xref>). Running <italic toggle="yes">SMAP design</italic> on Design<sub>Sanger,Ext</sub> with the homopolymer filter (-<italic toggle="yes">hp</italic>) set to 10 nucleotides for the genome of Arabidopsis and <italic toggle="yes">P. patens</italic> yielded a retention rate of ∼95% and ∼85% respectively (including the dropout-only runs). These final genome-wide designs are available in Supplementary data.</p>

        <title>Amplicon design and detection rates</title>
        <p>To evaluate the use of <italic toggle="yes">SMAP design</italic> to screen for natural variation in a non-model organism (chicory), HiPlex amplicons were designed to sequence nine candidate genes putatively involved in haploid induction (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37–39</xref>). We aimed to create a catalogue of naturally-occurring sequence variants and ideally find haplotypes affecting the protein sequences as these could be used to generate haploid-inducer lines. We created two complementary HiPlex primer sets with <italic toggle="yes">SMAP design</italic> using Design<sub>NatVar</sub> settings that contain partially overlapping (tiled) amplicons for each of the nine genes for a total of 94 amplicons (Figure <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). We screened 35 chicory (<italic toggle="yes">C. intybus</italic> var<italic toggle="yes">. sativum</italic>) and 25 witloof accessions (<italic toggle="yes">C. intybus</italic> var<italic toggle="yes">. foliosum</italic>) by applying a 1D pooling strategy (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S8A</xref>) in which an equal amount of leaf material from ∼10 individuals was pooled for a single DNA extraction and three independent pools per accession were created (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> ∼ 30 plants). In total, using the two HiPlex assays, 1554 chicory plants were screened in 163 pools, and pools with interesting sequence variants were identified. Individual plants from selected pools were then sequenced to identify carriers of knockout alleles.</p>

        <p>We evaluated primer design performance by assessing the absolute read counts per amplicon. We set a ‘detection’ threshold at a minimum of 30 reads per amplicon per sample and defined the ‘detection rate’ per amplicon as the percentage of samples with read depth greater than 30 for that amplicon. Six amplicons were removed from further analysis because they either yielded no sequencing reads (CiDMP2_02, CiPLP6_16, and KNL2_03) or had a read depth below 100 reads across all samples (CiCENH3.2_01, CiDMP1_04 and CiDMP2_07). In the pooled sequencing run, 87 of the 88 remaining amplicons were detected in at least 90% of the reference samples (Table <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). The number of amplicons detected in at least 90% of the samples dropped in the individual sequencing run compared to the pooled sequencing run for both chicory and witloof, with chicory having a higher detection rate compared to witloof. For chicory, the detection rate dropped from 97% to 82%, and for witloof from 77% to 73% for pools and individuals, respectively (Table <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">2</xref>), confirming the expectation that amplification becomes less efficient with increasing genetic distance from the chicory reference genome sequence. Overall, we were able to cover 36% to 92% of the CDS per gene, after considering the design and amplification dropouts (Figure <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>, Table <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">2</xref>).</p>

        <title>Identification of conserved and variable gene regions in a breeding gene pool</title>
        <p>We used <italic toggle="yes">SMAP haplotype-window</italic> to list the number of different haplotypes per amplicon per sample and estimated the relative haplotype frequencies in the pooled dataset (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table S7</xref>). We compared the overall number of haplotypes and haplotypes leading to protein changes between chicory and witloof accessions in the pooled dataset using <italic toggle="yes">SMAP effect-prediction</italic>. In the chicory accessions, 257 different haplotypes were found across the 88 amplified loci, while for the witloof accessions 519 different haplotypes were found across all 88 loci, of which 242 haplotypes are found in both chicory and witloof, illustrating a higher level of sequence variation within these genes in the witloof accessions. In the chicory and witloof accessions, 93 (36%) and 247 (48%) of the haplotypes led to a different protein sequence, respectively. Of the 267 unique haplotypes found leading to protein changes across both chicory and witloof accessions, 253 (95%) were SNPs or in-frame mutations, while only 14 haplotypes (5%) were frameshift mutations. A total of 21 amplicons located in exonic regions did not have any haplotypes leading to protein changes and could thus be considered as conserved genic regions. The number of haplotypes per amplicon varied between genes, and across the length of the gene sequences (Figure <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). For instance, in <italic toggle="yes">CiCENH3.1</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">CiCENH3.2</italic>, more haplotypes and haplotypes leading to protein changes were found in the N-terminal region of the genes. The average number of all haplotypes per amplicon per gene ranged from 4.2 (<italic toggle="yes">CiPLP4</italic>) to 7.6 (<italic toggle="yes">CiCENH3.1</italic>), and the average number of haplotypes per amplicon per gene with protein sequence changes ranged from 1.2 (<italic toggle="yes">CiCENH3.2</italic>) to 4.4 (<italic toggle="yes">CiKNL2</italic>).</p>

        <p>We focused on haplotypes with changes in the predicted protein sequences to identify individuals with potential knockout alleles, defined here as a protein sequence similarity of &lt; 50% compared to the reference protein sequence. Using <italic toggle="yes">SMAP effect-prediction</italic>, we predicted the effect of haplotypes on the protein function as ‘mild effect’ if &gt; 50% of the resulting amino acid sequence was identical to the reference protein and as ‘strong effect’ if at most 50% of the amino acid sequence was identical to the encoded reference protein. Out of 267 haplotypes, 255 were classified as a mild effect on protein function (48% of all haplotypes) and 12 haplotypes were classified as strong effect (2% of all haplotypes; Table <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">3</xref>, <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table S7</xref>). In total, 320 plants (from 36 initial pools, 15 from chicory, 21 from witloof) with strong-effect haplotypes were sequenced individually. Due to the loss of plants between sampling of the pools and individuals, data were obtained for 294 individuals (91%). We recovered a total of 13 strong-effect haplotypes in <italic toggle="yes">CiPLP6, CiPLP5, CiDMP1</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">CiDMP2</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">CiPLP6</italic> was the most variable, with 10 strong-effect haplotypes, which were found 84 times in a heterozygous state and eight times in a homozygous state across 46 individuals and were often combined in a single individual (Table <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">3</xref>).

        <title>Accuracy and sensitivity of haplotype detection in pool-seq</title>
        <p>With the pooled and individual sequencing data, we assessed the sensitivity of pooled sequencing combined with HiPlex sequencing to identify haplotypes across a range of candidate genes in parallel. We analyzed the data from 13 pools of 10 individuals with complete sequencing data in all 130 individuals (ground truth) and calculated the ‘expected’ pooled haplotype frequency based on the discrete genotype calls of the 10 constituent diploid individuals. For instance, a single heterozygous individual in a pool of 10 diploid plants (i.e. 20 alleles) corresponds to a 5% relative haplotype frequency in HiPlex pooled sequencing data. A strong correlation (<italic toggle="yes">R</italic>² value: 0.8487, <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &lt; 0.001) was found between the observed haplotype frequencies in pools and the haplotype frequencies in individuals (Figure <xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">7A</xref>). Additionally, 1826 of all 1933 (94.5%) haplotypes detected in individuals were also detected in their respective pools (true positives in pools), and 107 haplotypes (5.5%) were only detected in the respective individuals (false negatives in pools). About half (59/107) of the false-negative haplotypes displayed an ‘expected’ haplotype frequency of 5% or 10% in the individual sequencing data of the respective pool, indicating that pooled sampling effectively detects almost all haplotype diversity, with a weak bias against very low-frequency haplotypes (Figure <xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">7B</xref>). Conversely, 106 of 1932 (5.5%) haplotypes detected across all pools were not detected in their respective constituent individuals (false positive in pools). The observed haplotype frequencies of 89 of 106 (84.0%) of the false positives were in the range of 1–5%, characteristic of low-frequency read errors (Figure <xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">7B</xref>). Taken together, these data show that HiPlex pooled sequencing (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 10) accurately quantifies the relative frequency of haplotypes within a pool and is sensitive enough to detect nearly all low-frequency haplotypes, including rare defective alleles.</p>

    <title>DISCUSSION</title>
    <p>There is an increasing need for scalable PCR amplicon design for genotyping as the scale of eco-tilling and multiplex CRISPR experiments continues to increase. This is particularly the case when conducting CRISPR screens with at least ∼50 genes as manual designs can take several weeks, if not months, to perform. The currently available CRISPR design tools can generate lists of genome-wide gRNAs, but they lack the ability to combine this with genotyping primer design in a flexible and customizable manner. Tools such as CHOPCHOP (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>), CRISPOR (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>) or CROPSR (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>) allow gRNA and associated primer design, but the user is very limited in the ability to customize it (e.g. number of gRNAs per amplicon, number of amplicons per gene, relative position of gRNAs along the gene, etc.). In addition, these tools provide the user with tens to hundreds of designs per gene, leaving them to sort through the designs that are compatible with each other in a multiplex format. <italic toggle="yes">SMAP design</italic> overcomes these limitations by designing highly specific amplicons at gRNA target sites for any number of user-selected genes and presents the user with compatible, ready-to-order designs. <italic toggle="yes">SMAP design</italic> greatly simplifies larger CRISPR experiments (e.g. multiplex and combinatorial CRISPR screens (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>)) by reducing the design step from weeks or months to just hours of CPU time. The pre-designed genome-wide amplicons presented here effectively eliminate the design step altogether as users just need to select their gene identifier in the list and order the associated primers and/or gRNAs. Based on our empirical tests using HiPlex and Sanger sequencing of wild-type and mutant materials, these pre-computed gRNA and amplicon designs are reliable and amplify the target loci with high specificity. The resulting Sanger or NGS data can then be seamlessly analyzed with ICE (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>), TIDE (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>), or other tools from the SMAP package (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>) using the output files from <italic toggle="yes">SMAP target-selection</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">SMAP design</italic> as input (Figure <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).</p>
    <p>Similarly, <italic toggle="yes">SMAP design</italic> can be used to screen for naturally-occurring sequence variants with high specificity and sensitivity. For eco-tilling applications, amplicon design relies on gene-specific primers, limited off-target amplification, and covering as much of the gene sequence as possible. Current amplicon design methods consist of primer design by Primer3, followed by a BLAST and/or a preliminary PCR to check for mispriming (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>). This can become laborious and time-consuming for large numbers of target genes. <italic toggle="yes">SMAP design</italic> automates this amplicon design and avoids mispriming. Amplicon design for the nine candidate genes in chicory proved to be reliable and gene-specific and amplification was robust in different genotypes and accessions, thus capturing a broad range of sequence variation across the breeding gene pool.</p>
    <p>While the number of genes that <italic toggle="yes">SMAP design</italic> can handle is theoretically unlimited, it is not always possible to design gene-specific amplicons or gRNAs for all genes. As shown here, genomes with relatively recent whole genome duplications or polyploid genomes suffer from lower retention rates, most likely due to the primer specificity checks implemented in Primer3. The retention rate depends on the genome and gene family but is generally higher than 80% for most of the tested species. Generating designs in species with highly duplicated genomes, such as soybean, can be more challenging. We show that increasing amplicon size, restricting primer design to exons, and splitting up gene families or groups can increase the retention rate. Furthermore, relaxing the default primer specificity settings in Primer3 would likely increase the retention rate as well. The settings that can be changed are of course dependent on the type of screen that will be performed; if simplex PCR will be used (e.g. for Sanger sequencing), cross-amplification is of no concern so relaxing the primer-specificity filters can be tolerated, but cross-amplification would be problematic for highly multiplex PCR where mixtures of primer pairs are used. As there are a wide range of settings, options and variables (genotyping assay, genome, and target genes), we suggest the practical approach is to first empirically validate all genotyping assays by sequencing reference genotypes and eliminate any primers or amplicons that do not amplify efficiently or are non-specific as we demonstrate in the maize CRISPR screen (Figure <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). This will ensure a smooth genotyping workflow once the mutant materials are generated and need to be characterized. This also ensures that there are no sequence variants in the gRNA targets between the reference sequence used for the design and experimental genotypes, and if there are, corrections can be made before cloning is initiated. Since the composition of the reference sequence influences the specificity of primer and gRNA designs (and thus the overall design retention rate), <italic toggle="yes">SMAP target-selection</italic> is an important utility tool to streamline the construction of alternative reference gene sets and customize input parameter settings for optimal retention rate and reference sequence coverage, while maintaining target specificity.</p>
    <p>Some limitations to designing gRNAs and amplicons in a high-throughput fashion remain. For instance, it is not yet possible to design a single gRNA that simultaneously targets multiple genes together with the corresponding gene-specific amplicons. Programs such as CRISPys (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>) or MultiTargeter (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>) can design gRNAs that allow the targeting of multiple loci by exploiting the capability of gRNAs with mismatches to the target sequences to still be functional. A gRNA list from such a program could be fed to <italic toggle="yes">SMAP design</italic>, however, amplicons will only be designed for the targets with an identical gRNA sequence and primers binding multiple regions will be filtered out. Furthermore, the on-target efficiency scores such as Doench (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>) and Out-of-Frame (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>) have not translated well to plants (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>). Therefore, it is not guaranteed that a gRNA in the output of <italic toggle="yes">SMAP design</italic> will result in a knockout even though it might have a predicted high efficiency. Efficiency scores trained on plant data are thus highly desirable.</p>
    <p>We also illustrated the capacity for HiPlex amplicon sequencing to perform eco-tilling by detecting low-frequency alleles (5%) in a pool of 10 individuals. Indeed, to sequence very large numbers of individuals, 1D pooling of 10 plants per pool substantially reduces the time, effort, and cost for DNA extraction, library preparation and sequencing, while retaining detection accuracy and sensitivity for low-frequency haplotypes (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S8A</xref>). Screening efficiency can be further increased with 2D or 3D pool sequencing approaches, routinely used in tilling by sequencing applications (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>). For example, a 2D pooling scheme based on a pool size of 10 plants divides 100 plants into 2 × 10 = 20 pools, each containing 10 plants in which each plant becomes part of 2 pools (with X<sub>1-10</sub> and Y<sub>1-10</sub> coordinates; <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S8B</xref>). This leads to a 5-fold reduction in the number of PCRs (20 PCRs on pools instead of 100 PCRs on individuals). Given that we observe a minimum detection threshold of ∼5% allele frequency per pool, this allows us to detect a single heterozygous mutation in a pool of 10 plants. If a particular mutation occurs only once in the set of 100 (diploid) plants, the plant carrying the mutation can be identified in the corresponding X- and Y-pools. If the same mutation occurs more than once in the set of 100 plants (&gt; 1% population frequency), a second round of screening at the individual plant level is required at each of the intersecting X- and Y-pool coordinates. As knockout alleles are quite rare, such a 2D or even 3D pooling approach can be used to quickly identify such alleles and their carriers in a cost-effective manner. Combined with HiPlex amplicon sequencing, which can screen multiple loci and genes at once, this allows for rapid screening of many genes in large populations. While we demonstrated the versatility of pooled sequencing to screen for natural variation, it is clearly a useful strategy for screening large collections of CRISPR mutants, as each unique type of mutation (defined by the haplotype sequence) is identified independently.</p>
    <p>Ultimately, we envision a reverse-genetics approach where a researcher would use <italic toggle="yes">SMAP design</italic> to first screen their gene pool material for natural knockout alleles, as demonstrated for <italic toggle="yes">CiDMP1</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">CiDMP2</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">CiPLP5</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">CiPLP6</italic>. The identified carriers of the alleles could then be utilized for functional analysis and/or breeding. Alternatively, if no genetic variation is found, the researcher then resorts to induced genetic mutations where CRISPR is a highly tractable option for transformable species. For example, we did not observe any strong-effect haplotypes in <italic toggle="yes">CiCENH3.1</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">CiCENH3.2</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">CiKNL2</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">CiDMP3</italic> or <italic toggle="yes">CiPLP4</italic>. Therefore, the straightforward way to continue investigating these genes for haploid induction is to utilize CRISPR mutagenesis of chicory (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>). The target sequences have been confirmed in our gene pool material via HiPlex sequencing and the overlapping gRNAs can directly be cloned into Cas9/gRNA expression vectors. Overall, <italic toggle="yes">SMAP design</italic> will be a useful tool to perform high-throughput genetic screens using both natural and induced variation.</p>
