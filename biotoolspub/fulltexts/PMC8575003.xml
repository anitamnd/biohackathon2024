      <title>Abstract</title>
      <p>Genetic and epigenetic contributions to various diseases and biological processes have been well-recognized. However, simultaneous identification of single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) and DNA methylation levels from traditional bisulfite sequencing data is still challenging. Here, we develop double strand bisulfite sequencing (DSBS) for genome-wide accurate identification of SNVs and DNA methylation simultaneously at a single-base resolution by using one dataset. Locking Watson and Crick strand together by hairpin adapter followed by bisulfite treatment and massive parallel sequencing, DSBS simultaneously sequences the bisulfite-converted Watson and Crick strand in one paired-end read, eliminating the strand bias of bisulfite sequencing data. Mutual correction of read1 and read2 can estimate the amplification and sequencing errors, and enables our developed computational pipeline, <italic toggle="yes">DSBS Analyzer</italic> (<ext-link xlink:href="https://github.com/tianguolangzi/DSBS" ext-link-type="uri">https://github.com/tianguolangzi/DSBS</ext-link>), to accurately identify SNV and DNA methylation. Additionally, using DSBS, we provide a genome-wide hemimethylation landscape in the human cells, and reveal that the density of DNA hemimethylation sites in promoter region and CpG island is lower than that in other genomic regions. The cost-effective new approach, which decodes DNA methylome and genomic variants simultaneously, will facilitate more comprehensive studies on numerous diseases and biological processes driven by both genetic and epigenetic variations.</p>

    <title>Introduction</title>
    <p>Cytosine methylation of DNA is one of the extensively studied epigenetic modifications involved in the regulation of various diseases and biological processes, including the initiation and progression of cancers, embryonic development, X chromosome inactivation, genomic imprinting and silencing of transposable elements [<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1â6</xref>]. Alteration of DNA methylation was also unequivocally associated with population genetic variation [<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], subclonal evolution of tumor tissues [<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9â11</xref>], evolutionary divergence of duplicate genes, exon usage and local adaptation or rapid phenotypic changes of specific populations [<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12â16</xref>]. Simultaneous identification of genetic variation and DNA methylation was crucial for exploring the genetic and epigenetic contributions to disease and various evolutionary processes [<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17â19</xref>]. In addition, the identification of single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) is critical for identification of allele-specific epigenetic events [<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], which is a driving force that led to genomic imprinting [<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p>
    <p>Genome-wide base resolution analysis of DNA methylation is enabled by bisulfite treatment and subsequent massive parallel sequencing [<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. During bisulfite treatment, unmethylated cytosine is converted to uracil, whereas methylated cytosine and the guanine on the opposite strand is not affected. Based on this principle, several softwares, such as MethylExtract [<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], Bis-SNP [<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], BS-SNPer [<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] and CGmapTools [<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], have been developed to calling SNVs in bisulfite sequencing data. However, the sensitivity and accuracy of these tools in calling SNVs were limited by the inevitable defects of traditional bisulfite sequencing methods. Since bisulfite treatment could lead to separation of the two DNA strands, DNA degradation and reduced genome sequence complexity, which subsequently resulted in the high strand bias and alignment errors of sequencing data [<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28â31</xref>]. Additionally, Câ&gt;âT is the most frequent substitution in the population (for example it accounts for 35% of all SNPs in human dbSNP database), it is difficult to distinguish the real Câ&gt;âT mutations from the bisulfite induced Câ&gt;âT conversions. Thus, an experimental innovation and improvement on calling SNVs and methylation level from bisulfite sequencing is urgently required.</p>
    <p>Here, we developed double strand bisulfite sequencing (DSBS) through locking Watson and Crick strand together followed by bisulfite treatment, massive parallel sequencing and computational calling for simultaneous and precise identification of DNA methylation, hemimethylation and SNVs, which offers a cost-effective and useful approach for exploring the contributions of genetic and epigenetic variations to numerous diseases and biological processes.</p>

      <title>Processing of DSBS sequencing data</title>
      <p>The high-quality clean reads were generated by filtering out low-quality reads and removing adapter sequences using CutadaptV1.11 (<ext-link xlink:href="https://github.com/marcelm/cutadapt" ext-link-type="uri">https://github.com/marcelm/cutadapt</ext-link>). The clean reads were aligned to the GRCH37 human reference genome by using BSMAP [<xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. The local sequence realignment and recalibration was performed by using Bis-SNP as previously described [<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. SNV calling was performed by using an inhouse python program <italic toggle="yes">DSBS analyzer</italic>, which was developed based on python3, and depends on the package of pysam, pyfasta and tabix. The output files contained the genome location of SNVs, DNA methylation levels and DNA hemimethylation levels. The source code of <italic toggle="yes">DSBS analyzer</italic> was uploaded to the website: <ext-link xlink:href="https://github.com/tianguolangzi/DSBS" ext-link-type="uri">https://github.com/tianguolangzi/DSBS</ext-link>.</p>
      <p>In details, due to the low sequence complexity and high repetitive rates of bisulfite-converted genome, the alignment accuracy of bisulfite-converted sequence data was relatively lower compared with genome sequence data. To realize the high accuracy of SNV calling, a series of parameters were set to filter the invalidly aligned bisulfite-sequencing reads before the identification of SNVs and DNA methylation levels using <italic toggle="yes">DSBS analyzer</italic>. The detailed parameters include: (i) considering that the read 1 and read 2 of paired-reads were derived from one DNA fragment, the paired-end reads mapped to different locations in the reference genome were filtered, and paired-reads with overlap size shorter than 50Â bp were discarded; (ii) considering that the alignment accuracy of short reads was lower, reads with length shorter than 50Â bp were discarded; (iii) sequencing reads with the N bases exceeding 5 would be discarded, and sequencing reads with the ratio of bases exceeding 0.6 with sequencing quality score &lt;20 would be discarded; (iv) sequencing reads with the amount of small insertion and deletion exceeding 1 would be discarded; (v) the paired-reads in which the number of mismatches is greater than 5 would be discarded. In addition, when identifying the SNVs and DNA methylation levels, (i) the sequencing quality score of the bases should exceed 20 in both paired-reads; (ii) there should less than two mismatches in the continuous 10Â bp; (iii) the SNVs within 5Â bp range of an indel would be discarded; (iv) the allele frequency of SNVs should be higher than 0.15. According to the paired bisulfite-converted sequencing reads, <italic toggle="yes">DSBS analyzer</italic> could determine the original sequence and DNA methylation status of the double-strand DNA according to <xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>.</p>

Two strands of a DNA fragment were separately sequenced, or only one strand of a DNA fragment was sequenced due to the sequencing bias. (B) Bisulfite-converted Watson strand and reverse complement of bisulfite-converted Crick strand derived from the same double-strand DNA fragment were sequenced in read 1 and read 2, and aligned to the same position on reference genome.

      <p>To facilitate the use of DSBS <italic toggle="yes">analyzer</italic>, we have developed a pipeline based on python3, which included six steps: quality control, cleaning, genome alignment, realignment, SNV calling and evaluation of the DNA methylation and hemimethylation levels, and annotation. FastQCV0.11.5 (<ext-link xlink:href="http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/FastQC" ext-link-type="uri">http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/FastQC</ext-link>) and BAMQC (<ext-link xlink:href="https://github.com/s-andrews/BamQC" ext-link-type="uri">https://github.com/s-andrews/BamQC</ext-link>) were used in the quality control step. Cutadapt was used to cut the hairpin adapter and PE adapter sequence. The alignment of sequencing reads to the reference genome sequence was performed by using BSMAP [<xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Bis-SNP [<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], which based on GATK, was used to realign the sorted BAM file. As the duplication of sequencing data dramatically influence the SNV calling, Fastuniq (<ext-link xlink:href="https://github.com/dcjones/fastq-tools" ext-link-type="uri">https://github.com/dcjones/fastq-tools</ext-link>) was used to remove the duplicates before cutting the adapters, and the function of removing duplication in Samtools [<xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] and PicardV2.9 (<ext-link xlink:href="http://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/" ext-link-type="uri">http://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/</ext-link>) were used after the realignment of sorted BAM files. Finally, <italic toggle="yes">DSBS analyzer</italic> was used to call SNVs and assess the DNA methylation and hemimethylation levels. As for the computational resources and cost of <italic toggle="yes">DSBS analyzer</italic>, in this study performed on a single computing node with the CPU of 32 cores, memory of 48G and 64 threads, the total time for data cleaning, mapping, local sequence realignment and recalibration of 150 Gb raw DSBS data is about 116.76Â h using 40 threads, and the time for calling SNVs, the DNA methylation and hemimethylation levels is about 4.09Â h using 40 threads.</p>

      <title>Experimental and SNV calling strategy for DSBS</title>
      <p>Fragmented genomic DNA was ligated with the hairpin adaptor and methylated Illumina adaptor simultaneously, and then treated with bisulfite and amplified by ligation-mediated polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The amplified library was size-selected to enrich library linked with hairpin adaptor for high throughput paired-end sequencing (<xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). Although both sequencing reads of DSBS and whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (MethylC-seq) are directional, only the sequence information of one bisulfite-converted strand of double-strand DNA was generated from one pair of paired-end reads in the MethylC-seq, whereas in the DSBS, bisulfite-converted Watson and reverse complement of bisulfite-converted Crick or bisulfite-converted Crick and reverse complement of bisulfite-converted Watson strand derived from the same DNA fragment were simultaneously sequenced in reads 1 and reads 2, respectively. Thus, the sequence of two bisulfite-converted strands derived from one double-strand DNA fragment could be obtained from one paired-end reads of DSBS.</p>
      <p>During the bisulfite treatment, unmethylated cytosine is converted to uracil, whereas the guanine on the opposite strand is not affected. This property was exploited to distinguish between bisulfite conversion of Câ&gt;âT and single nucleotide variation from C to T. Because in the MethylC-seq, bisulfite-converted Watson and Crick strands were separated during the bisulfite treatment, and only one strand was sequenced in large fraction of genomic regions. Therefore, Câ&gt;âT SNVs were difficult to be distinguished from Câ&gt;âT conversion induced by bisulfite treatment in MethylC-seq data. In the DSBS, bisulfite-converted Watson and Crick strand were locked together by hairpin adaptor, and simultaneously sequenced in the paired-end reads, the original sequence and modification status could be accurately deduced from the paired-end sequencing reads.</p>
      <p>Bisulfite conversion only occurs on unmethylated Cs, and have no effect on Gs on the complementary strand, therefore, bisulfite-converted Watson and Crick strand are not fully reverse complementary to each other. In the paired-end sequencing of DSBS, bisulfite-converted Watson and reverse complement of bisulfite-converted Crick; or bisulfite-converted Crick and reverse complement of bisulfite-converted Watson derived from one double-strand DNA fragment, reflected by read 1 and read 2, should be aligned to the same position of the reference genome. These paired-end reads aligned to different positions were considered as alignment error, and not used for the calling of SNVs. Therefore, the false positive SNVs caused by alignment errors could be eliminated. In the paired-end reads of DSBS, read 1 and read 2 were different in Cs and Gs, whereas same in As and Ts (<xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). Due to the sequencing and amplification errors, positions which were not in accordance with this principle, were excluded for SNV calling. Therefore, when calling SNVs in DSBS sequencing data, the mutual correction of read1 and read2 could eliminate the effect of sequencing, amplification and alignment errors. We provided the bioinformatic pipeline, <italic toggle="yes">DSBS Analyzer</italic>, for SNV calling, evaluation of DNA methylation and hemimethylation level in DSBS sequencing data, which is freely available at <ext-link xlink:href="https://github.com/tianguolangzi/DSBS" ext-link-type="uri">https://github.com/tianguolangzi/DSBS</ext-link>.</p>

      <title>Evaluation of SNV calling by DSBS</title>
      <p>To evaluate the minimum sequencing data required by DSBS, we plotted the saturation curve of sequencing data. The 10Ã genome-wide coverage was saturated in about 150 Gb sequencing data. We then compared the coverage of genome fraction of DSBS and WGS and observed DSBS and WGS covered 91.2% and 91.3% of genome fractions in depthââ¥â1, and covered 88.7% and 90.2% of genome fractions in depthââ¥â10, respectively (<xref rid="f3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). By analyzing the coverage of DSBS and WGS in different genomic elements, we revealed that the coverage of DSBS had no bias in different genomic elements.</p>

      <p>To further evaluate the sensitivity and accuracy of DSBS in SNV calling, we compared the performance of SNV calling of DSBS with two published high-performance computational pipelines in calling SNVs from methylation sequencing data, Bis-SNP [<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] and BS-SNPer [<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], and WGS. With the average sequencing depth of 30Ã, we identified SNVs in WGS data of human ovarian epithelial cell line, T29, by using four SNV calling softwares, GATK, VarScan, Bcftools, Freebayes, respectively. Of 3Â 071Â 837 SNVs simultaneously identified by these four softwares, 2Â 839Â 016 (92.42%) SNVs could be identified by DSBS, while only 1Â 758Â 715 (57.25%) and 2Â 308Â 667 (75.16%) SNVs could be identified by Bis-SNP and BS-SNPer, respectively (<xref rid="f3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). Regarding a total of 3Â 398Â 625 SNVs identified by DSBS, 3Â 148Â 862 (92.65%) SNVs could be validated by WGS, which revealed a low false positive rate (7.35%) of SNV calling by DSBS. As for 3Â 579Â 175 SNVs called by Bis-SNP, only 2Â 069Â 360 (57.82%) could be validated by WGS, and 3Â 317Â 957 SNVs called by BS-SNPer, only 2Â 577Â 798 (77.69%) could be validated by WGS (<xref rid="f3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). As the vast majority of adaptation or disease-related SNVs were located at nonrepeat regions, we further evaluated the accuracy of SNV calling by DSBS in nonrepeat regions, and observed the accuracy of SNV calling by DSBS in nonrepeat regions was 95.4%, which was higher than that in the whole-genome regions. Considering a proportion of these so called false positive SNVs in DSBS could be the truly occurred SNVs with lower allelic frequency, we then evaluated the SNVs called by DSBS but not identified by any of the four SNV calling softwares based on WGS data. Of the 1 984 exonic SNVs called by DSBS but not by WGS, we observed that 526 (26.51%) exonic SNVs could be validated by deep sequencing (with average depth of 389Ã) of whole exome regions. Thus, we inferred the actual false positive rate of DSBS was lower than that mentioned previously.</p>

      <title>Evaluation of the DNA methylation levels at CpG sites by DSBS</title>
      <p>To evaluate the performance of the DNA methylation level identified by DSBS, we compared the coverage of DSBS sequencing data with the data of MethylC-seq, the golden standard of DNA methylation analysis. Analyzing 150Â GB clean data generated by DSBS and MethylC-seq, respectively, we observed DSBS covered 92% whereas MethylC-seq covered 90% of the total CpGs in the human genome with sequencing depthââ¥â2, and DSBS and MethylC-seq both covered 89% of the total CpGs in the human genome with sequencing depthââ¥â10 (<xref rid="f4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>).

      <p>To evaluate the reproducibility of DSBS in evaluating the DNA methylation levels, we count the DNA methylation levels of CpGs with at least 10-fold sequencing depth, and determined the Pearson correlation coefficient value between two DSBS experimental replicates. The Pearson correlation coefficient value between two DSBS replicates was 0.939, indicating an excellent reproducibility of DSBS in evaluating the DNA methylation levels (<xref rid="f4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>). We then compared the DNA methylation levels of DSBS with the one from MethylC-seq by evaluating all CpGs identified by DSBS from MethylC-seq with sequencing depthââ¥â10 in T29 cell line. Our result demonstrated that the DNA methylation level for DSBS versus MethylC-seq were correlated at Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.947 (<xref rid="f4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>).</p>

      <title>Signature of DNA hemimethylation across genomic regions</title>
      <p>DNA hemimethylation, with only one of the two complementary DNA strands methylated, was intermediate product in DNA methylation maintenance during DNA replication, and it was regarded to regulate DNA methylation inheritance [<xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">37â39</xref>]. It was reported that the majority of intermediately (40â60%) methylated CpG dinucleotides were hemimethylated [<xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], and 10% of CpGs in embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and trophoblast stem cells remain hemimethylated, which could regulate chromatin interaction and transcription [<xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>, <xref rid="ref41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. DSBS simultaneously sequenced bisulfite-converted Watson and Crick strand of bisulfite-treated DNA, which enables it to precisely identify hemimethylation sites. Although previous study has performed to investigate the DNA methylation fidelity during mouse ESC self-renewal and differentiation [<xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>, <xref rid="ref41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], it only analyzed the CpG-rich regions, and the distribution of DNA hemimethylation in the whole genome and different genomic regions have not been evaluated. Here, we depicted the genome-wide hemimethylation signature of T29 cell line by using DSBS, and observed the average hemimethylation level of CpGs (depthââ¥â10) was 0.1304. We identified 14Â 547Â 891 hemimethylated CpGs (depthââ¥â10), including 6Â 812Â 824 sites with hemimethylation levelââ¥â0.2 in the whole genome. To evaluate the distribution of DNA hemimethylation sites and the levels across the human genome, we analyzed the density and the average level of DNA hemimethylation in different genomic element regions. The results revealed that the density and the average level of DNA hemimethylation varied across different genomic elements (<xref rid="f5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>), and the density of DNA hemimethylation sites in promoter region and CpG island were lower than that in other genomic regions.</p>
      <p>To further investigate the relationship between DNA hemimethylation and methylation levels, we evaluated the hemimethylation levels and DNA methylation levels on each identified CpG (<xref rid="f5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>). As for CpGs with the low DNA methylation levels (&lt;0.5), the DNA hemimethylation level was positively associated with DNA methylation level (PCCâ=â0.277). While regarding the CpGs with high DNA methylation level (â¥0.5), the DNA hemimethylation level was negatively associated with DNA methylation level (PCCâ=ââ0.392). We further evaluated the relationship between the hemimethylation levels and the DNA methylation levels on CpGs in different genomic element regions, and unveiled that both the DNA hemimethylation and DNA methylation levels were lower near the transcriptional start site than other genomic regions.</p>

      <title>Genetic background should be considered in population epigenetic studies</title>
      <p>Câ&gt;âT is the most frequent substitution in the population, for example it accounts for 35% of all SNPs in human dbSNP database. Through our DSBS pipeline, we identified 1Â 129Â 492 Câ&gt;âT/Gâ&gt;âA substitution in the human ovarian epithelial cell line, and 1Â 072Â 678 (94.97%) of them could be identified by WGS (<xref rid="f6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>). In addition, 8 049 (94.90%) of 8 482 exonic Câ&gt;âT/Gâ&gt;âA substitution could be validated by deep sequencing of whole exome regions, suggesting the high reliability of our pipeline in identifying Câ&gt;âT mutations from the bisulfite-treated sequencing data. The substitution of Câ&gt;âT usually occurs in the CpG context, which are frequently methylated in vertebrate genomes [<xref rid="ref42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Thus, the identification of SNVs in bisulfite sequencing data is essential for accurate quantification of the methylation levels. Here, in the human ovarian epithelial cell line, we identified 466Â 714 SNVs which disrupted the existed CpGs in the reference genome, and 482Â 461 SNVs which created new CpGs relative to the reference genome (<xref rid="f6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>). We further validated the accuracy of these disrupted and created CpGs using deep sequencing of target regions, and 4 182 of 4 239 (98.66%) disrupted CpGs and 3 999 of 4 111 (97.28%) created CpGs residing in the exon regions were validated by whole exome deep sequencing, respectively (<xref rid="f6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>). These SNVs could have impact on the evaluation of the DNA methylation level of CpG, while not considered in the evaluation of the DNA methylation levels in the traditional MethylC-seq method. To accurately evaluate the DNA methylation levels, we further recalculated the DNA methylation levels of these CpGs in consideration of SNVs. Compared with DNA methylation levels evaluated by MethylC-seq, the DNA methylation levels recalculated by DSBS in consideration of SNVs has dramatic differences.</p>

    <title>Discussion</title>
    <p>Genetic and epigenetic variations may affect each other, and alteration of DNA methylation has been reported to be involved in various evolutionary and biological processes [<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7â16</xref>]. However, in the previous epigenetic variation studies, genetic background was frequently ignored [<xref rid="ref43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>, <xref rid="ref44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], and the sensitivities and accuracies of several published computational pipelines in calling SNVs from the methylation sequencing data were limited by the inevitable defects of traditional bisulfite sequencing methods [<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25â27</xref>]. To deal with the challenge, here, we developed DSBS by locking Watson and Crick strand together followed by bisulfite treatment, massive parallel sequencing and computational calling. Although the strategy of hairpin bisulfite sequencing has been described to improve the mapping efficiency and accuracy in quantitative detection of 5-methylcytosine [<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="ref45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>, <xref rid="ref46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>], an integrated experimental and computational pipeline that simultaneously assesses DNA methylation, hemimethylation and genomic variants is an advantage of our work. Using the approach, we unveiled approximately 0.95 million SNVs which could break the existed CpGs or create new CpGs relative to the reference genome. Many SNVs located at regulatory elements may shape patterns of population epigenomic variation [<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="ref47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>, <xref rid="ref48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Recently, interaction between genetic and epigenetic variations has begun to be dissected during the evolution of populations or tumors, such as population divergence of recent human evolution [<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], tumorsâ clonal evolution [<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], local adaptation or rapid phenotypic changes of specific populations [<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13â15</xref>]. Thus, the cost-effective new approach we provided here, which can be used for simultaneous decoding DNA methylome and genomic variants in numerous vertebrate species with reference genome, will facilitate more comprehensive studies on various kind of disease and biological processes driven by both genetic and epigenetic variations.</p>
    <p>We acknowledge that our approach has some limitations. The bisulfite treatment we used could not distinguish DNA methylation and DNA hydroxymethylation [<xref rid="ref46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>, <xref rid="ref49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Thus, the existence of DNA hydroxymethylation in specific loci may influence the detection of DNA methylation [<xref rid="ref50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. In addition, bisulfite conversion of cytosine to thymine may lead to selective and context-specific DNA degradation [<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="ref51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Displacement of bisulfite conversion by using enzymatically conversion methods including TAPS [<xref rid="ref51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>] and EM-seq [<xref rid="ref52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>], which have mild damage to DNA, may facilitate the application of DSBS method. Furthermore, we enriched the library with hairpin adapter by using size selection in DSBS, which might lead to a small fraction of library without hairpin adapter. Modification of hairpin adapter with biotin, and binding with streptavidin beads after ligation is an alternative fragment enrichment choice. To deal with the challenge of calling somatic mutations from methylation sequencing data, we will update the computational pipeline in identifying somatic mutations from the double strand bisulfite sequencing data in the future.</p>
