      <title>Abstract</title>
      <p>The majority of biopsies in both basic research and translational cancer studies are preserved in the format of archived formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples. Profiling histone modifications in archived FFPE tissues is critically important to understand gene regulation in human disease. The required input for current genome-wide histone modification profiling studies from FFPE samples is either 10–20 tissue sections or whole tissue blocks, which prevents better resolved analyses. But it is desirable to consume a minimal amount of FFPE tissue sections in the analysis as clinical tissues of interest are limited. Here, we present <underline>F</underline>FPE tissue with <underline>a</underline>ntibody-guided <underline>c</underline>hromatin <underline>t</underline>agmentation with sequencing (FACT-seq), the first highly sensitive method to efficiently profile histone modifications in FFPE tissues by combining a novel fusion protein of hyperactive Tn5 transposase and protein A (T7−pA−Tn5) transposition and T7 <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> transcription. FACT-seq generates high-quality chromatin profiles from different histone modifications with low number of FFPE nuclei. We proved a very small piece of FFPE tissue section containing ∼4000 nuclei is sufficient to decode H3K27ac modifications with FACT-seq. H3K27ac FACT-seq revealed disease-specific super enhancers in the archived FFPE human colorectal and human glioblastoma cancer tissue. In summary, FACT-seq allows decoding the histone modifications in archival FFPE tissues with high sensitivity and help researchers to better understand epigenetic regulation in cancer and human disease.</p>

    <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
    <p>Epigenetic profiling is critically important for improving our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of human disease and cancer (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1–5</xref>). In recent decades, the technologies of chromatin immunoprecipitation with sequencing (ChIP-seq) and its variations have helped us to generate large-scale epigenetic profiles in both basic research, epigenetic cancer biomarker discovery and preclinical studies (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6–8</xref>). The majority of biopsies in both basic research and translational cancer studies are preserved in the format of archived formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9–11</xref>); it was reported that large amounts of FFPE specimens are newly archived every year worldwide (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Accordingly, profiling epigenetic regulation in archived FFPE tissue can be invaluable for translational cancer research and potential epigenetic cancer biomarker discovery. The successful application of ChIP-seq to FFPE tissues, pathology tissue chromatin immunoprecipitation (PAT-ChIP) (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>), fixed-tissue chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (FiT-seq) (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>), fixed-tissue ChIP-seq for H3K27 acetylation (H3K27ac) profiling (FiTAc-seq) (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>) and similar technologies (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>), makes it possible to map histone modifications in clinically archived FFPE tissue; however, the required input for these technologies from FFPE samples is either 10–20 tissue sections or whole tissue blocks (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14–16</xref>,<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>), which prevents better resolved analyses and their applications. However, it is desirable to consume a minimal amount of clinical FFPE tissue samples in the analysis, as clinical materials are very limited and difficult to collect. In addition, sonication is applied in these available technologies and can potentially introduce sequence bias (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). To overcome the sensitivity limitation of ChIP-seq technology, a series of high-sensitivity technologies (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20–40</xref>), including ULI-NChIP (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>), STAR-ChIP (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>), MOWChIP (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>), Drop-ChIP (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>), ChIL-seq (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>), CUT&amp;RUN (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>), scChIC-seq (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>) and many others, have been developed and widely used to map the epigenetic profiles and transcription factor binding sites. Among these highly sensitive technologies, strategies based on the fusion of hyperactive-Tn5 transposase and protein A (pA–Tn5), Cleavage Under Targets and Tagmentation (CUT&amp;Tag) (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>), combinatorial barcoding and targeted chromatin release (CoBATCH) (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>), and the other technologies (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21–26</xref>,<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>), have been well adopted for different fresh or mild fixed cells, and fresh or frozen tissues due to its high efficiency (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34–37</xref>). Because of the extensive fixation and paraffin embedding in the FFPE tissues, the DNA breaks and nicks are dominant in the extracted DNA from the FFPE tissue (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>), which makes it impossible to directly apply currently available, highly sensitive epigenetic profiling technologies in the FFPE tissue blocks. To this end, we developed <underline>F</underline>FPE tissue with <underline>a</underline>ntibody-guided <underline>c</underline>hromatin <underline>t</underline>agmentation with sequencing (FACT-seq), the first highly sensitive method to efficiently profile the histone modifications of FFPE samples with low cell numbers by combining a novel fusion protein of hyperactive Tn5 transposase and protein A (T7−pA−Tn5) transposition and T7 <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> transcription.</p>

      <p>The single nuclei were isolated from the frozen 8 weeks’ mouse kidney with dounce homogenization by following the standard isolation protocol from Omni-ATAC (<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>). Frozen tissue was taken in the ice-cold 1 ml of 1× unstable Homogenization Buffer (5 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub> (Alfa Aesar, J63122), 3 mM Mg(Ac)<sub>2</sub> (Sigma-Aldrich, M5661), 10 mM Tris pH 7.8 (Invitrogen, 15568-025), 0.01667 mM PMSF (Sigma-Aldrich, P7626), 0.1667 mM β-mercaptoethanol (Sigma-Aldrich, M-6250), 320 mM Sucrose (Sigma-Aldrich, 84097-250), 0.1 mM EDTA (Invitrogen, AM9290G), 0.1% IGEPAL<sup>®</sup> CA-630 (Sigma-Aldrich, 13021-50)) and incubated for 5 min on ice. The tissue was homogenized 10 times with loose pestle and 20 times with tight pestle. Then, the homogenized tissue was split and transferred to two new 1.5 ml Lo-Bind tube (Sarstedt, 72.706.600). The homogenized tissue was centrifuged for 1 min at 100 × g at 4°C. Then 400 μl of the homogenized sample was transferred and mixed with 400 μl of 50% OptiPrep Density Gradient Solution (5 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub> (Alfa Aesar, J63122), 3 mM Mg(Ac)<sub>2</sub> (Sigma-Aldrich, M5661), 10 mM Tris pH 7.8 (Invitrogen, 15568-025), 0.01667 mM PMSF (Sigma-Aldrich, P7626), 0.1667 mM β-mercaptoethanol (Sigma-Aldrich, M-6250), 50% OptiPrep Density Gradient Medium (Sigma-Aldrich, D1556-250)), to make a final concentration of 25% of OptiPrep Density Gradient Solution with homogenized tissue. After preparation of tissue mixture, a fresh 2 ml Lo-Bind vial (Sarstedt, 72.695.400) was taken and 25% of OptiPrep Density Gradient Solution mixed with the tissue, 29% of OptiPrep Density Gradient Solution (5 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub> (Alfa Aesar, J63122), 3 mM Mg(Ac)<sub>2</sub> (Sigma-Aldrich, M5661), 10 mM Tris pH 7.8 (Invitrogen, 15568-025), 0.01667 mM PMSF (SIGMA-ALDRICH, P7626), 0.1667 mM β-mercaptoethanol (Sigma-Aldrich, M-6250), 160 mM sucrose (Sigma-Aldrich, 84097-250), 29% OptiPrep Density Gradient Medium (Sigma-Aldrich, D1556-250)) and 35% of OptiPrep Density Gradient Solution (5 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub> (Alfa Aesar, J63122), 3 mM Mg(Ac)<sub>2</sub> (Sigma-Aldrich, M5661), 10 mM Tris pH 7.8 (Invitrogen, 15568-025), 0.01667 mM PMSF (Sigma-Aldrich, P7626), 0.1667 mM β-mercaptoethanol (Sigma-Aldrich, M-6250), 160mM sucrose (Sigma-Aldrich, 84097-250), 35% OptiPrep Density Gradient Medium (Sigma-Aldrich, D1556-250)) were layered on the top of each other. The layered vial was centrifuged at 3000 × g for 20 min at 4°C. After gradient centrifugation, the top 1000 μl was discarded and the 200 μl of the nuclei region was carefully collected to a fresh 1.5 ml Lo-Bind tube (Sarstedt, 72.706.600). Then 1 ml of CUT&amp;Tag washing buffer (20 mM HEPES(K+) PH 7.5 (HEPES: Sigma-Aldrich, H3375; KOH: Sigma-Aldrich, 484016) pH 7.5; 150 mM NaCl (Invitrogen, AM9759); 0.5 mM Spermidine (Sigma-Aldrich, S2626); 1× protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma-Aldrich, 11873580001)) was added to each tube, mixed well and centrifuged at 4°C 600 × g for 10 min. After discarding the supernatant, the nuclei pellets were resuspended with 500 μl of washing buffer and counted by the cell counter. Aliquots of nuclei (100 000 nuclei/1.5 ml Lo-Bind tube (Sarstedt, 72.706.600)) were washed once in washing buffer and finally resuspended with 50 μl of washing buffer and kept on ice.

      <title>Human CRC, GBM sample collections and FFPE block preparation</title>
      <p>The regional ethical research committee at the Uppsala University approved the study of human CRC (Dnr 2015/419 and 2018/490) and human GBM (2007/353). The FFPE tissue blocks of human colorectal cancer (CRC) and glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) were prepared at the Department of Clinical Pathology, Uppsala University Hospital, Uppsala, Sweden, according to standard procedures. Briefly, tissue from surgical specimens of samples were fixed in buffered formalin for 24–72 hs. The pieces were then examined by a pathologist, excised and placed in plastic cassettes. The fixed tissue was then dehydrated in an automated system (Tissue-Tek® VIP®) where the tissue was immersed in ethanol of varying concentrations (70%, 95%, 99.5%) followed by xylene and finally paraffin (Histowax<sup>®</sup>, Histolab) over a period of ∼12 h. Finally, the paraffin embedded tissue piece was oriented in a cassette, liquid paraffin was poured over it and allowed to set, forming the FFPE block. The FFPE block was then sectioned on a microtome at a thickness of 10 μm for CRC and 20 μm for GBM.</p>

      <p>After nuclei isolation, a proper amount of FFPE nuclei (100 000–1 500 000) were transferred to a new 1.5 ml Lo-Bind tube (Sarstedt, 72.706.600). The nuclei were centrifuged at 3000 × g for 5 min at RT and the supernatant was discarded. To profile histone modification H3K27ac, the FFPE nuclei (either from mouse FFPE tissue blocks or from human clinical samples) were resuspended with 50 μl of Epitope Retrieval Buffer-1 (10 mM EDTA (Invitrogen, AM9260G) pH 8, 50 mM Tris–HCl pH 8, 0.1% SDS (Invitrogen, 1553-035)) and transferred to a PCR tube. The nuclei suspension was incubated on a PCR machine at 50°C for 1 h.

After the IVT, 5 μl DNase 1 (from Zymo, R1013) and 5 μl of DNA digestion buffer (from Zymo, R1013) were added to the tubes and the tubes were incubated at RT for 15 min to digest the remaining DNA. Then the reactions were purified using ZYMO RNA Clean &amp; Concentration kit (Zymo, R1013) and eluted in 15 μl of nuclease-free water (Invitrogen, AM9932). 100 ng IVT RNA was used for each library preparation. The IVT RNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA with random primers (Thermo Fisher scientific, SO142) and SMART MMLV kit by following the manufactory protocol (TaKaRa, 639524). In brief, the mixture was incubated at 42°C for 60 min and 70°C for 15 min, then 2 μl of RNase H buffer and 0.2 μl RNase H enzyme (Thermo Fisher scientific, EN0201) were added and incubated at 37°C for 20 min. The cDNA was purified using RNA XP beads purification with 1:1.8 ratio of sample to beads (Beckman Coulter, A63987) and eluted in 24.2 μl water. Next, the single-stranded cDNA was converted to double-stranded cDNA through pre-PCR (98°C for 10 s, 63°C for 30 s, 72°C for 1 min, 10°C hold in one cycle) which was performed by adding 25 μl of 2× PCR master mix (New England Biolabs, M0541S) and 0.8 μl of reverse primer. Then samples were purified using MiniElute PCR Purification kit (Qiagen, 28004) and eluted in 20 μl water.</p>
      <p>The sequencing library was prepared with Tn5 tagmentation. In short, the double strand DNA samples were subjected to the tagmentation by adding 25 μl of 2× TD-Buffer (20 mM Tris–HCl pH 7.6 (Invitrogen, 15567-027), 10mM MgCl2 (Invitrogen, AM9530G), 20% Dimethyl Formamide (Sigma-Aldrich, D4551)), 0.5 μl 2 μM normal Tn5, 4.5 μl nuclease-free water (Invitrogen, AM9932) and incubated at 55°C for 7 min, then samples were purified using Qiagen MiniElute PCR Purification kit (Qiagen, 28004) and eluted in 20 μl of elution buffer. The library amplification PCR was performed by adding 25 μl of 2× PCR master mix (New England Biolabs, M0541S), 0.4 ul of barcodes forward primer i5 (25 μM), 0.4 μl of barcodes i7 reverse primer (25 μM), 4.2 μl of nuclease-free water (Invitrogen, AM9932) to the samples, with the following PCR protocol (72°C 5 min first, 20 cycles of 98°C for 10 s, 63°C for 30 s, 72°C for 1 min), then samples were purified using Qiagen MiniElute kit (Qiagen, 28004) and eluted in 20 μl of water. The DNA library was purified with 8% PAGE gel (40% Acrylamide:bis-acrylamide (Invitrogen, HC2040), 10× TBE buffer, 10% Ammonium persulfate (Invitrogen, HC2005), TEMED (Invitrogen, HC2006)) purification and the DNA from 220–1000 bp was selected by gel cutting. The concentration of the library was measured by high sensitivity DNA Bioanalyzer (Agilent, 5067-4626). At last, the FACT-seq libraries were sequenced on the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 sequencer.</p>

      <p>The mouse kidney sections was stained with DAPI (Invitrogen, H3570) and scanned by the Zeiss Axio Imager Z2. The nuclei number was counted by the Fiji plugin (<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>): the Trainable Weka Segmentation (<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>). After scanning, the tissue section was proceeded with FFPE nuclei isolation. After the nuclei isolation, the total nuclei number was calculated accordingly. If it's the case that single nuclei suspension was originated from a small area of the tissue section, then the nuclei were transferred to the glass slides using Cytospin (Double Cellfunnel (THARMAC, 306-12), stained with DAPI (Invitrogen, H3570), imaged by the Zeiss Axio Imager Z2 and finally counted manually by the Fiji software. In summary, the recovery rates of FFPE nuclei isolation were 42.04% (from small-cropped mouse kidney region) and 53.49% (from a whole mouse kidney section). During epitope retrieval, a proper number of nuclei (100 000–1 500 000) were transferred out and resuspended with the epitope retrieval buffer. After the epitope retrieval, quenching and washing, the nuclei number was counted again by the cell counter. The recovery rates of epitope retrieval were calculated.</p>

Concanavalin A coated magnetic beads (Bangs Laboratories, BP531) were prepared as described (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>) and 10 μl of prepared beads were added per tube. 50 μl of nuclei suspension with 10 μl activated beads were mixed thoroughly but gently, and the mixture was left on the bench at RT for 10 min to allow binding of nuclei to the Concanavalin A beads. The tubes were put on a magnetic stand for 5 min to allow the mixtures to clear and the liquid was discarded. Appropriate primary antibody (anti-H3K27me3 antibody (Cell Signaling Technology, 9733S)) or anti-H3K27ac antibody (abcam, ab4729)) was diluted 1:100 in Antibody buffer (20 mM HEPES(K+) pH 7.5 (HEPES: Sigma-Aldrich, H3375; KOH: Sigma-Aldrich, 484016); 150 mM NaCl (Invitrogen, AM9759); 0.5 mM Spermidine (Sigma-Aldrich, S2626); 1 × Protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma-Aldrich, 11873580001); 0.05% Digitonin (Millipore, 300410); 2 mM EDTA (Invitrogen, AM9260G), 0.1% BSA (Miltenyi Biotech MACS, 130-091-376)). Bead-bound nuclei were resuspended in 50 μl Antibody buffer pre-mixed with primary antibody (1:100) with gentle pipetting. Then the tubes were placed on a nutator and incubated at 4°C overnight. The primary antibody was removed by placing the tube on the magnet stand to clear and discard all the liquid. An appropriate secondary antibody (Guinea Pig anti-Rabbit IgG antibody (Antibodies-online, ABIN101961)) was diluted 1:100 in 100 μlof CUT&amp;Tag Dig-washing buffer (20 mM HEPES(K+) pH 7.5 (HEPES: Sigma-Aldrich, H3375; KOH: Sigma-Aldrich, 484016); 150 mM NaCl (Invitrogen, AM9759); 0.5 mM spermidine (Sigma-Aldrich, S2626); 1× protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma-Aldrich, 11873580001); 0.05% digitonin (Millipore, 300410)) and bead-bound nuclei were resuspended in 100 μl Dig-washing buffer pre-mixed with secondary antibody (1:100) and incubated at RT on the nutator for 1 h.

After removing the liquid on the magnet stand, 100 μlof diluted pA–Tn5 adapter complex was added to the bead-bound nuclei with gentle mixing. The tubes were incubated at RT for 1 h on the nutator. Bead-bound nuclei were washed 3 times in 0.8–1 ml Dig-300 buffer to remove unbound pA–Tn5 protein. After washing, the liquid was removed on the magnetic stand, bead-bound nuclei were resuspended in 100 μltagmentation buffer (20 mM HEPES(K+) pH 7.5 (HEPES: Sigma-Aldrich, H3375; KOH: Sigma-Aldrich, 484016); 300 mM NaCl (Invitrogen, AM9759); 0.5 mM Spermidine (Sigma-Aldrich, S2626); 1× protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma-Aldrich, 11873580001); 0.01% digitonin (Millipore, 300410); 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> (Invitrogen, AM9530G)).

      <title>Sequencing data analysis</title>
      <p>Only reads one (R1) was involved in our analysis. We first adopted levenshtein distance algorithm to map T7 promoter sequence to each read in the adaptor trimming procedure, then T7 promoter sequences were trimmed from each read in the fastq file with in-house script custom script (<ext-link xlink:href="https://github.com/pengweixing/FACT" ext-link-type="uri">https://github.com/pengweixing/FACT</ext-link>). The trimmed fastq file of human samples and mouse samples were mapped to the hg38 reference genome or mm10 reference genome respectively using bowtie2 v.2.3.5 (<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>) with the parameters –end-to-end –very-sensitive -I 10 -X 700. The aligned BAM files were sorted by samtools v.1.9 (<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>) and were filtered with alignment quality of &gt;q2. The bigwig files were generated from BAM file using deeptools (<xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>) with the parameters bamCoverage –normalizeUsing CPM. Transcription start sites (TSS) enrichments of sequencing libraries were calculated using deeptools (<xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>) with the option computeMatrix, and heatmaps were plotted by deeptools (<xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>) with the options plotHeatmap and plotProfile. The reads count within peaks were calculated by bedtools (<xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>) with the option multicov. The peaks of sequencing libraries were visualized by IGV software (<xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>). The VennDigram was plotted with R pacakge venn. Genomic annotation of peaks was performed using the ChIPseeker R package (<xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>). For the peak calling, H3K27me3, H3K36me3 and H3K4me1 peaks were called using SICER (<xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>) with following parameters gap size  =  600 bp and window size  =  200 bp. H3K27ac peaks were called using SICER with following parameters gap size  =  400 bp and window size  =  200 bp. The GM12878 ATAC-seq data set was downloaded from GEO under accession number, GSE76006 (<xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>). The ENCODE ChIP-seq data sets (<xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>) used for comparison were downloaded from GEO under accession numbers GSM733771 (GM12878, H3K27ac), GSM945196 (GM12878, H3K27me3), GSM1000092 (adult 8 weeks Mouse kidney, H3K27ac), GSM1000077 (adult 8 weeks Mouse kidney, H3K27me3), GSM1000063 (adult 8 week mouse kidney, H3K36me3), GSM769023 (adult 8 week mouse kidney, H3K4me1), GSM1000140 (adult 8 week mouse liver, H3K27ac). H3K27ac FiTAc-seq data used for comparison was downloaded from GEO under accession numbers GSM4186366 (H3K27ac FiTAc-seq_65°C_5 mins_rep1), GSM4186368 (H3K27ac FiTAc-seq_65°C_5mins_rep2). The RNA-seq data of human CRC and human GBM were downloaded from GEO with the accession numbers GSE158559 (CRC tissue), GSE119834 (GBM tissue). Super enhancer (SE) elements were mapped and quantified by MACS version 2 (<xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>) and ROSE (<xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>,<xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>) software based on H2K27ac. A p-value threshold of enrichment of 1 × 10<sup>−5</sup> was used during the peak calling with MACS. Genes were assigned to SEs by proximity. Clustering analysis of human GBM H3K27ac FACT-seq and human CRC H3K27ac FACT-seq was performed with an unsupervised non-negative matrix factorization algorithm which implemented on NMF software package (<xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>). Library complexity for each sample was estimated with Preseq v3.1.2 (<xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>). Ontological enrichment of SE-associated genes was analiyzed by following the protocle as described (<xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>). GO analysis of SE target genes was calculated by g:Profiler (<xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>) with significance threshold set to Benjamini–Hochberg false discovery rate (FDR) (0.05) and the pathway enrichment was annotated and visualized in Cytoscape (<xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>) with Enrichment Map (<xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>) and AutoAnnotate (<xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>) by taking GO analysis results as input. Transcriptor factor enrichment for histone modifications peaks was performed with Homer v.4.11 software (<xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>). The correlation matrix for each data set was clustered using the R package pheatmap.

      <title>DNA damage in FFPE samples hampers the application of CUT&amp;Tag in FFPE samples</title>
      <p>To profile chromatin structure in the FFPE samples, we established a protocol to isolate high-quality intact single nuclei from 20-μm-thick mouse FFPE kidney tissue sections (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S1A</xref>, see Materials and Methods). When we performed H3K27me3 CUT&amp;Tag and H3K27ac CUT&amp;Tag with 100 000 isolated FFPE nuclei following the standard CUT&amp;Tag protocol for fixed cells (see Methods), we did not obtain PCR amplicons (Figure <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">1A</xref> and <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">B</xref>) potentially because (i) extensive fixation during FFPE sample preparation changes the conformation of glycosylated proteins in the nucleus membranes and further interferes with the binding of lectin concanavalin A (ConA) magnetic beads and isolated FFPE nuclei in the CUT&amp;Tag (ii) the epitope of H3K27me3 and H3K27ac in the isolated FFPE nuclei is masked during FFPE tissue preparation and (iii) there is a high degree of DNA damage to the extracted DNA from the FFPE isolated nuclei. To solve these potential issues, we first used a centrifugation strategy instead of ConA beads to enrich isolated FFPE nuclei and performed H3K27ac and H3K27me3 CUT&amp;Tag with FFPE nuclei; however, we still did not obtain PCR amplicons (Figure <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">1C</xref> and <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">D</xref>). Next, we established an epitope retrieval protocol for the isolated FFPE nuclei (see Materials and Methods). Even though the signal intensity of H3K27ac and H3K27me3 immunostaining from these nuclei was significantly improved with epitope retrieval (Figure <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">1E</xref> and <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">F</xref>), no PCR product was generated from H3K27ac and H3K27me3 CUT&amp;Tag with centrifugation and epitope retrieval steps (Figure <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">1C</xref> and <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">D</xref>). During FFPE tissue preparation, the formaldehyde in formalin reacts with primary amines in chromatin to form Schiff bases, and with amides to form hydroxymethyl compounds, resulting in large chromatin complexes (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). To decode histone modifications in FFPE samples, it is essential to break such chromatin complexes with reverse cross-linking (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>), which is also applied to the CUT&amp;Tag protocol for fixed cells that we used. However, DNA damage can be introduced during reverse cross-linking in FFPE samples. Indeed, we observed that many DNA breaks were generated during reverse crosslinking in the extracted DNA from the isolated FFPE nuclei (Figure <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">1G</xref>). In antibody-guided hyperactive Tn5 transposase-protein A (pA–Tn5) tagmentation based technologies (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20–23</xref>,<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25–26</xref>,<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>), including CUT&amp;Tag, the amplification of transposase insertion sites from target regions with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is the key step (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). However, PCR amplification does not work efficiently for FFPE samples if there is the high degree of DNA damage present in these samples (Figure <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">1H</xref>). Thus, we conclude that standard CUT&amp;Tag does not work well in the FFPE samples probably because of the high degree of DNA damage present in the FFPE sample after reverse crosslinking (Figure <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">1H</xref>).</p>

      <title>Design of FACT-seq</title>
      <p>The strategy in transposed-based chromatin profiling technologies is to use the inserted antibody-guided pA–Tn5 adaptors to mark the location of the histone modifications or transcription factors (TFs) binding (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). Since the adaptors of pA–Tn5 transposase are inserted into the genome after formalin fixation in CUT&amp;Tag, breakpoints generated during reverse crosslinking are unlikely to occur at the adaptors of pA–Tn5 transposase. Thus, we assumed that the adaptors of pA–Tn5 transposase are still at the end of broken targeting chromatin sites after reverse crosslinking. We reasoned that if the T7 promoter sequence is added to the adaptors of pA-T5 transposase, even if there are DNA breaks in the middle of DNA fragment we could still decode the insertion sites of pA–Tn5 transposase by transferring broken DNA fragments into RNA molecules with <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> transcription (IVT) and making DNA sequencing libraries from the IVT RNA molecules (Figure <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2A</xref>). Recently, we had used such a strategy to successfully profile the chromatin accessibility in FFPE samples with high sensitivity (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>), and we assumed the same principle could be applied in profiling histone modifications in FFPE samples. The activity of the Tn5 transposase is very robust with different sequence modifications on the adaptors (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,<xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>,<xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr">72–73</xref>), and the combination of linear amplification with the T7 promoter and Tn5 tagmentation for enriching target sequences is widely used in a series of high sensitivity technologies, including chromatin integration labelling with sequencing (ChIL-seq) (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>), Linear Amplification via Transposon Insertion (LIANTI) (<xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>), transposome hypersensitive sites sequencing (THS-seq) (<xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>,<xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>), multiplexed, indexed T7 ChIP-seq (Mint-ChIP) (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>) and many others. Thus, we hypothesized that modifications to the adaptors of pA–Tn5 transposase with the T7 promoter would also be feasible. Therefore, we designed, produced and optimized a novel pA–Tn5 transposase with the T7 promoter sequence on the adaptor, termed T7−pA−Tn5 (Figure <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2B</xref>, see Materials and Methods). T7−pA−Tn5 retains the activity of the standard pA–Tn5 (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S1B</xref>, see Materials and Methods). While our work is ongoing, a new high-throughput and highly sensitive protein:DNA binding site mapping technology, Targeted Insertion of Promoters (TIP-seq) (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>), was established, where a similar strategy of adding the T7 promoter sequence into the pA–Tn5 adaptor was also used and proved that the activity of pA–Tn5 is not affected by adding the T7 promoter sequence (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>). To test that T7−pA−Tn5 adaptors are still at the end of broken DNA fragments after reverse crosslinking from the isolated FFPE nuclei, we performed IVT on the DNA extracted from mouse kidney FFPE nuclei after H3K27ac-guided T7−pA−Tn5 tagmentation, and we found that RNA molecules from the IVT contain both short- and long- range fragments (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S1C</xref>). These results convinced us that T7−pA−Tn5 adaptors were still at the ends of broken DNA fragments, and those inserted sites of the T7−pA−Tn5 adaptor in histone modification sites could be read out by making a DNA sequencing library from IVT RNA molecules (Figure <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2C</xref>). In the CUT&amp;Tag or similar technologies (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>), one insertion event or unpaired pA–Tn5 adaptor insertions from pA–Tn5 transposition could not be amplified with PCR (<xref rid="B75" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>). Since the IVT depends on only one insertion of the T7 promoter, one insertion event and unpaired adaptor insertions on targeting sites from T7−pA−Tn5 can be detected with FACT-seq during IVT (Figure <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2A</xref>). Thus, we expect the library complexity of FACT-seq to be is higher than that of CUT&amp;Tag or similar technologies.</p>

      <title>FACT-seq accurately decodes both repressive and active histone modifications with low cell numbers</title>
      <p>To prove the combination of T7−pA−Tn5 transposition and T7 IVT is feasible to decode histone modifications, we first performed H3K27me3 FACT-seq with human B-cell (GM12878 cells) and sequenced the H3K27me3 FACT-seq sequencing library with ∼50 million sequencing reads for each technical replicate (see Materials and Methods). The two technical replicates of H3K27me3 FACT-seq had high similarity (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S2A and B</xref>, <italic toggle="yes">R</italic> = 0.99). We found that 20 million sequencing reads were needed for H3K27me3 FACT-seq to obtain peak number saturation by downsampling the total reads with different ranges (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S2C</xref>), and H3K27me3 FACT-seq peaks with 20 million sequencing reads could reach over 63.17% overlap with peaks from Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) GM12878 H3K27me3 ChIP-seq (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S2D</xref>). In the following steps, we used H3K27me3 FACT-seq with a 20 million-read sequencing depth to perform a detailed comparison with ENCODE H3K27me3 ChIP-seq and standard H3K27me3 CUT&amp;Tag (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S2E–J</xref>, see Materials and MethodsMethods). FACT-seq clearly revealed that sequencing read coverage of H3K27me3 is highly correlated with standard H3K27me3 CUT&amp;Tag (Figure <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3A</xref>–<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">C</xref>, <italic toggle="yes">R</italic>= 0.85). The genome-wide correlation of H3K27me3 FACT-seq and ENCODE H3K27me3 ChIP-seq (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S2G</xref>, <italic toggle="yes">R</italic>= 0.83) and the correlation of H3K27me3 CUT&amp;Tag and ENCODE H3K27me3 ChIP-seq (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S2H</xref>, <italic toggle="yes">R</italic>= 0.82) were in the similar ranges. The distributions of peak sizes from H3K27me3 FACT-seq, H3K27me3 CUT&amp;Tag, and ENCODE H3K27me3 ChIP-seq were also within similar ranges (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S2I</xref>). Moreover, we used the peak centers of ENCODE H3K27me3 ChIP-seq for GM12878 cells as the reference points to calculate the sequencing signal enrichments from H3K27me3 FACT-seq and H3K27me3 CUT&amp;Tag, and we observed clear enrichment of the H3K27me3 FACT-seq signal at ENCODE H3K27me3 ChIP-seq sites, which was very similar to the enrichment of H3K27me3 CUT&amp;Tag at ENCODE H3K27me3 ChIP-seq sites (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S2J</xref>). We also found that 71% of peaks from standard H3K27me3 CUT&amp;Tag overlapped with H3K27me3 FACT-seq peaks (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S3A</xref>), and the fractions of overlapping peaks between H3K27me3 FACT-seq and ENCODE H3K27me3 ChIP-seq were similar to those of overlapping peaks between H3K27me3 CUT&amp;Tag and ENCODE H3K27me3 ChIP-seq (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S3B and C</xref>). The genomic annotation of the overlapping peaks and unique peaks from H3K27me3 FACT-seq, H3K27me3 CUT&amp;Tag and ENCODE H3K27me3 ChIP-seq showed that both overlapping peaks and exclusive peaks from different types of libraries were distributed in a similar pattern relative to the transcription start sites (TSS) (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S3A–C</xref>). At the same time, we found that different transcription factors (TFs) were enriched at exclusive peaks (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S3A–C</xref>), e.g., FOXP and FOXA TFs were enriched at unique peaks from CUT&amp;Tag sequencing libraries, MEF2 and STAT TFs were found at unique peaks of FACT-seq sequencing libraries, TEAD family TFs were identified in unique peaks of ENCODE ChIP-seq sequencing libraries. Since the same antibodies were used for H3K27me3 CUT&amp;Tag and H3K27me3 FACT-seq, the enrichments of different TFs in the unique peaks of H3K27me3 CUT&amp;Tag and H3K27me3 FACT-seq indicate that there is potential technical bias between CUT&amp;Tag and FACT-seq. The different TFs enrichments in the unique peaks of ENCODE H3K27me3 ChIP-seq may be because of the different antibodies used and the technical bias between the ChIP-seq and transposase-based methods.</p>

      <p>In addition, we also compared the signal distribution from H3K27me3 FACT-seq, H3K27me3 CUT&amp;Tag and H3K27me3 ENCODE ChIP-seq in the genome by using TSS as reference points (see Materials and Methods, Figure <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3D</xref>, <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S4A</xref>). Strikingly, we found that the signal distribution of H3K27me3 FACT-seq near the TSSs was more similar to that of ENCODE H3K27me3 ChIP-seq than that of H3K27me3 CUT&amp;Tag (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S4A</xref>). There was strong enrichment at TSSs sites from H3K27me3 CUT&amp;Tag but not from H3K27me3 FACT-seq or H3K27me3 ENCODE ChIP-seq (Figure <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3D</xref>, <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S4A</xref>). It has been reported that ATAC-seq signal contamination from standard CUT&amp;Tag was observed (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). Thus, we assumed that the signal enrichment at TSSs sites from H3K27me3 CUT&amp;Tag is potentially from ATAC-seq signals. H3K27me3 is a repressive chromatin marker that is usually located at distal regulatory elements in the genome but is also found at silenced promoters and bivalent promoters (<xref rid="B76" ref-type="bibr">76–78</xref>). To test our hypothesis, we first broke GM12878 cell ATAC-seq peaks (<xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>) into promoter (±1 kb from TSSs) and nonpromoter regions, then calculated sequencing signal enrichments from H3K27me3 FACT-seq, H3K27me3 CUT&amp;Tag and ENCODE H3K27me3 ChIP-seq in promoter and nonpromoter regions of the GM12878 ATAC-seq peaks (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S4B–E</xref>). We found that there was much stronger signal enrichment around the ATAC-seq peaks from H3K27me3 CUT&amp;Tag than H3K27me3 FACT-seq, and ENCODE H3K27me3 ChIP-seq at both the promoter and non-promoter regions of the ATAC peaks (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S4B</xref>). The quantification of the fraction of reads within the ATAC-seq peaks from H3K27me3 CUT&amp;Tag, H3K27me3 FACT-seq, and ENCODE H3K27me3 ChIP-seq showed that 20% of reads from H3K27me3 CUT&amp;Tag were from the promoter regions of the ATAC-seq peaks, while only 13% of reads from H3K27me3 FACT-seq were located in the promoter regions of the ATAC-seq peaks, which was in the same range as ENCODE H3K27me3 ChIP-seq (9%) (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S4C</xref>). A similar tendency was also observed in nonpromoter regions of the ATAC-seq peaks (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S4D and E</xref>), where 18% of sequencing reads from H3K27me3 CUT&amp;Tag were in nonpromoter regions of the ATAC-seq peaks, and 14% of sequencing reads from H3K27me3 FACT-seq are located in the non-promter regions of the ATAC-seq peaks. The contamination of the ATAC-seq signals in H3K27me3 FACT-seq and H3K27me3 CUT&amp;Tag was potentially due to the nonspecific binding and insertion of pA–Tn5 and T7−pA−Tn5. Since insertion events in H3K27me3 FACT-seq and H3K27me3 CUT&amp;Tag are controlled by antibody guidance and the presence of Mg2+ (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>), the proportions of insertion events from pA–Tn5 and T7−pA−Tn5 nonspecific binding and insertion should be similar in FACT-seq and CUT&amp;Tag. We suspected that the exponential amplification PCR amplification (<xref rid="B79" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>) in CUT&amp;Tag could enlarge the proportion of DNA fragments from the nonspecific binding of pA–Tn5, which does not occur in FACT-seq because of the linear amplification that occurs in T7 IVT (<xref rid="B80" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>). In the CUT&amp;Tag protocol, one insertion event or unpaired adaptor insertions from pA–Tn5 could not be amplified, and long fragments could not be sequenced with short read sequencing (<xref rid="B75" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>). However, one insertion event and unpaired adaptor insertions from targeting sites could be captured with FACT-seq during IVT (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). At the same time, long DNA fragments from histone modification sites become shorter when transferring target DNA fragments to RNA molecules with IVT and could be sequenced from IVT RNA sequencing libraries. Consequently, the proportion of DNA fragments in the sequencing library from nonspecific binding and insertion was lower in FACT-seq than in CUT&amp;Tag. Thus, the proportion of contamination of ATAC-seq in H3K27me3 FACT-seq was lower. We also compared the fraction of reads in peaks (FRiP) from the sequencing libraries of H3K27me3 CUT&amp;Tag, H3K27me3 FACT-seq and ENCODE H3K27me3 ChIP-seq, and found that the FRiP was in similar ranges for CUT&amp;Tag (65.5% +/− 0.43%) and FACT-seq (58.41% ± 1.23%), but was much lower for ENCODE ChIP-seq (25.25% ± 4.26%) (Figure <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3E</xref>). As we expected, the library complexity of H3K27me3 FACT-seq was much higher than that of CUT&amp;Tag (Figure <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3F</xref>), and the same conclusion was also proposed for TIP-seq (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>). In summary, we conclude that FACT-seq can efficiently map H3K27me3 modifications with low cell numbers, and that the H3K27me3 FACT-seq library has a lower proportion of ATAC-seq signal contamination in both promoter and nonpromoter regions than CUT&amp;Tag.</p>
      <p>Next, we performed FACT-seq by targeting active histone modification H3K27ac from GM12878 (see Materials and Methods). Technical replicates of H3K27ac FACT-seq also had good reproducibility (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S5A and B</xref>, <italic toggle="yes">R</italic> = 0.97). H3K27ac FACT-seq had the high similarity to standard H3K27ac CUT&amp;Tag (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S5C and D</xref>) in terms of the correlation of sequencing read coverage (Figure <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3G</xref>–<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">I</xref>, <italic toggle="yes">R</italic>= 0.79). In addition, the correlation between H3K27ac FACT-seq and ENCODE H3K27ac ChIP-seq was 0.61 (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S5E</xref>), and the correlation between H3K27ac CUT&amp;Tag and ENCODE H3K27ac (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S5F</xref>) was 0.75. There was a large proportion of overlapping peaks among H3K27ac FACT-seq, H3K27ac CUT&amp;Tag and ENCODE H3K27ac ChIP-seq (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S5G–I</xref>). The genomic annotation of unique peaks from H3K27ac FACT-seq, H3K27ac CUT&amp;Tag and ENCODE H3K27ac ChIP-seq showed that exclusive peaks from the different types of libraries were distributed in a similar pattern relative to the TSSs (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S5G–I</xref>). We also found that there are similar TFs, e.g. FRA1, FRA2, AP-1 and JUNB, were enriched in the unique peaks of H3K27ac FACT-seq and H3K27ac CUT&amp;Tag, but different TFs, e.g., IRF family and ETV family TFs, were enriched at unique in the unique peaks of ENCODE H3K27ac ChIP-seq. Different TFs were identified in the unique peaks of ENCODE H3K27ac ChIP-seq are most likely because of technical bias or different antibodies used in the ENCODE H3K27ac ChIP-seq. Additionally, the peak sizes from H3K27ac FACT-seq, H3K27ac CUT&amp;Tag, and ENCODE H3K27ac ChIP-seq had similar distributions (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S6A</xref>). The sequencing reads from H3K27ac FACT-seq, H3K27ac CUT&amp;Tag and ENCODE H3K27ac ChIP-seq all had strong enrichments at the TSSs(Figure <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3J</xref>, <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S6B</xref>). The distribution of peaks from these three types of libraries using TSSs as reference points was also similar (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S6C</xref>), and genomic annotation of peaks showed that the peaks from these three types of libraries had similar features (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S6D</xref>). We noticed that the FACT-seq had lower signal enrichment for H3K27ac relative to CUT&amp;Tag or ENCODE ChIP-seq at the TSSs (Figure <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3J</xref>), and we assumed that the relatively lower signal recovery of H3K27ac from FACT-seq could be another reason that H3K27me3 FACT-seq resultied in a lower proportion of ATAC-seq signals at promoter and nonpromoter regions (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S4B–E</xref>). Comparison of the FRiPs from the three different types of libraries showed that the proportion of signals within the peaks from H3K27ac FACT-seq (44.03% ± 4.94%) was lower than that from H3K27ac CUT&amp;Tag (62.99% ± 1.12%) and ENCODE H3K27ac ChIP-seq (60.91% ± 1.06%) (Figure <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3K</xref>). The sequencing library complexity of H3K27ac FACT-seq was within a similar range of as that of ChIP-seq and was much higher than that of CUT&amp;Tag (Figure <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3L</xref>).</p>
      <p>In summary, we conclude that design of FACT-seq by combining the novel T7−pA−Tn5 transposition and T7 IVT, FACT-seq can feasibly map both active and silent histone modifications with low cell numbers, and the sequencing library complexity from FACT-seq is higher than that from CUT&amp;Tag. Our results are also in agreement with the recently developed TIP-seq (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>), showing that linear amplification from IVT with T7 promoter modified pA–Tn5 helps to obtain more unique reads in sequencing libraries.</p>

      <title>Proof-of-concept of FACT-seq in FFPE samples</title>
      <p>Harsh chemical treatments during the preparation of FFPE samples could mask protein epitopes in the tissue, and it is essential to retrieve these protein epitopes for binding of the antibody to their targets (<xref rid="B81" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>). We optimized a condition for epitope retrieval in the isolated FFPE nuclei (see Materials and Methods), where the H3K27ac signal intensity from the epitope retrieval condition was stronger than that without epitope retrieval (Figure <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">1E</xref>). We cut the mouse kidney into two parts, where one part was frozen down and the other part was prepared as an FFPE block (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S7</xref>, see Materials and Methods). We performed H3K27ac CUT&amp;Tag with 100 000 nuclei isolated from frozen mouse kidneys, and H3K27ac FACT-Seq with 100 000 nuclei (under the conditions of ± epitope retrieval) isolated from 20-μm thick FFPE mouse kidney tissue sections (see Materials and Methods). Both H3K27ac CUT&amp;Tag and FACT-seq showed good reproducibility (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S8A–C</xref>). The patterns of the H3K27ac signals were similar among H3K27ac CUT&amp;Tag, H3K27ac FACT-seq (+ epitope retrieval), H3K27ac FACT-seq (- epitope retrieval) and ENCODE mouse kidney H3K27ac ChIP-seq (Figure <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">4A</xref>). The genome-wide correlation of H3K27ac CUT&amp;Tag, H3K27ac FACT-seq (+ epitope retrieval), H3K27ac FACT-seq (- epitope retrieval) and ENCODE mouse kidney H3K27ac ChIP-seq clearly shows that H3K27ac FACT-Seq (+ epitope retrieval) had a higher correlation with ENCODE mouse kidney H3K27ac ChIP-seq (Figure <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">4A</xref>–<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">C</xref>, <italic toggle="yes">R</italic>= 0.81) than with H3K27ac FACT-seq (- epitope retrieval) (Figure <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">4C</xref>, <italic toggle="yes">R</italic>= 0.67), and a similar tendency was observed for the pair comparison of H3K27ac FACT-seq (+ epitope retrieval) vs. H3K27ac CUT&amp;Tag (Figure <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">4C</xref>, <italic toggle="yes">R</italic>= 0.82) and H3K27ac FACT-seq (− epitope retrieval) vs. H3K27ac CUT&amp;Tag (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S8D</xref>, <italic toggle="yes">R</italic>= 0.72). The quantification of the FRiP from different types of sequencing libraries clearly demonstrated that the FRiP of H3K27ac FACT-seq under epitope retrieval conditions (45.18% ± 0.88%)) was much higher FRiP than that of without epitope retrieval (17.56% ± 3.38%), but was in a similar range as that of H3K27ac CUT&amp;Tag (51.68% ± 2.09%) (Figure <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">4D</xref>). As we expected, the library complexity from FACT-seq was also higher than that from CUT&amp;Tag (Figure <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">4E</xref>). We further compared the genomic features from H3K27ac FACT-seq (+ epitope retrieval) of the FFPE sample, H3K27ac CUT&amp;Tag of the frozen sample and ENCODE mouse kidney H3K27ac ChIP-seq and found sequencing read enrichments at the TSSs (Figure <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">4F</xref>, <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S8E</xref>), sequencing read enrichments at the ENCODE mouse kidney H3K27ac ChIP-seq peak site (Figure <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">4G</xref>) and genomic annotation of peaks with similar patterns from the three different libraries (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S8F</xref>). At the peak level, we also found a large proportion of overlap in the paired comparison of FACT-seq (+ epitope retrieval) vs. H3K27ac CUT&amp;Tag, and FACT-seq (+ epitope retrieval) versus ENCODE mouse kidney H3K27ac ChIP-seq (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S9A–C</xref>). Further genomic annotation and TF enrichment analysis of the overlapping peaks and unique peaks showed that the exclusive peaks from different types of libraries were distributed in a similar pattern relative to TSSs (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S9A–C</xref>). However, the different TF enrichments were found at those exclusive peaks (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S9A–C</xref>). All of observations suggested that FACT-seq could decode H3K27ac profiles in FFPE samples with high sensitivity, but the epitope retrieval is essential there.</p>

      <p>To further confirm that our FACT-seq worked effectively in FFPE samples, we had performed H3K27ac FACT-seq in mouse FFPE livers with 100 000 FFPE nuclei under the same epitope retrieval conditions in mouse FFPE kidneys and compared it with H3K27ac FiTAc-seq data from mouse FFPE liver sections and frozen mouse liver ENCODE H3K27ac ChIP-seq data (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S10</xref>). Our comprehensive comparisons, including genome-wide correlations in peak enrichment of sequencing reads (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S10A–C</xref>), FRiP (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S10D</xref>), library complexity (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S10E</xref>), genomic annotation (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S10F and G</xref>) and proportion of overlapping peaks (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S10H</xref>) among the sequencing libraries of FACT-seq, FiTAc-seq and ENCODE ChIP-seq further demonstrated that FACT-seq could profile H3K27ac in FFPE samples with high sensitivity.</p>
      <p>Next, we checked the sensitivity of H3K27ac FACT-Seq by using different numbers (ranging from 1000 to 10 000) of purified mouse FFPE kidney nuclei after the step of epitope retrieval (see Materials and Methods, Figure <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">5A</xref>–<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">F</xref>, <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S11</xref>). Our multiangle comparison proved that FACT-seq resulted in similar H3K27ac profiles using as few as 1000 purified mouse FFPE kidney nuclei (Figure <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>A−F, <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S11</xref>). However, we learned that a proportion of nuclei were lost during the nuclei isolation step and epitope retrieval. Then, we aimed to assess the lowest amounts of nuclei on the FFPE tissue section needed for FACT-seq. To do so, we first calculated the nucleus recovery rate during the nuclei isolation from FFPE tissue sections and epitope retrieval steps by using both one whole mouse FFPE kidney section (Figure <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">5G</xref>) and a small piece of FFPE tissue (Figure <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">5H</xref>). We concluded the nucleus recovery rate was ∼50% at the step of nuclei isolation (53.49% for the big FFPE tissue section, and 42.04% for the small FFPE tissue section) (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S11C</xref>). The average of nucleus recovery rate after epitope retrieval was 55.95% (ranging from 34% to 98%) (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S11D</xref>). Thus, the nucleus recovery rate from tissue sectioning to epitope retrieval was ∼25–30%. Taken together, we assumed that ∼4000 nuclei on the FFPE tissue section were needed for FACT-seq. To confirm our hypothesis, we counted 4000 nuclei under the microscope, dissected such small piece of FFPE tissue (Figure <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">5H</xref>), isolated nuclei and performed H3K27ac FACT-seq with all nuclei from this small piece of FFPE tissue. The comprehensive comparison (Figure <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">5A</xref>–<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">F</xref>, <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S11E–G</xref>) of the H3K27ac FACT-seq data generated from different amounts of FFPE nuclei clearly demonstrated that we could accurately profile H3K27ac modifications in FFPE samples from a very small FFPE tissue section containing ∼4000 nuclei. We also performed H3K27ac FACT-seq on mouse FFPE kidney tissue sections of different thickness (5-, 7-, 10-μm) with an area of ∼3 × 5 mm<sup>2</sup>. Our results showed that FACT-seq could be applied to a 10-μm-thick tissue section (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S12</xref>) but was not optimal for 5- and 7-μm-thick FFPE tissue sections. We found that the majority of sequencing reads (80.57–94.39%) from 5- and 7-μm thick FFPE tissue sections could not be mapped to the reference genome, where a large proportion of unmapped reads (&gt;50%) were from primer dimers (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table S1</xref>). It has been reported that the diameter of the mammalian nucleus is 6–10 μm (<xref rid="B82" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>), and we suspected that there are potentially plenty of nonintact nuclei in 5- to 7- μm-thick FFPE tissue sections. The chromatin structure in those nonintact nuclei could be destroyed during the nuclei isolation, epitope retrieval and long FACT-seq procedures, resulting in low-quality histone modification profiles. Thus, we proposed that FFPE tissue sections with thicknesses greater than the diameter of nucleus should be used in FACT-seq. This observation is also in agreement with the finding in our recently established FFPE-ATAC technology (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>), where 5- and 7- μm-thick FFPE tissue sections were not optimal for chromatin accessibility profiling in FFPE samples.</p>

      <p>Furthermore, we performed FACT-seq by targeting the repressive histone modification H3K27me3 in FFPE samples (Figure <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). We used the same epitope retrieval conditions for active histone modification H3K27ac to perform epitope retrieval of the repressive histone modification H3K27me3 and found that the signal intensity of H3K27me3 also significantly increased with immunostaining (Figure <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">1F</xref>). However, the genome-wide correlation of mouse FFPE kidney H3K27me3 FACT-seq under this epitope retrieval condition and frozen mouse kidney H3K27me3 CUT&amp;Tag was very low (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S13A</xref>, <italic toggle="yes">R</italic> = 0.65). In addition, the sequencing signal enrichment of mouse FFPE kidney H3K27me3 FACT-seq with this epitope retrieval condition at TSSs was completely different from frozen mouse kidney H3K27me3 CUT&amp;Tag and ENCODE frozen mouse kidney H3K27me3 ChIP-seq (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S13B</xref>). Thus, we assumed that the epitope retrieval condition for active histone markers was not optimal for repressive histone markers. One possibility is that the solubility of heterochromatin and euchromatin is quite different in FFPE samples (<xref rid="B83" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>), and harsher chemical treatment conditions for epitope retrieval are needed for repressive histone modifications. Thus, we optimized the epitope retrieval conditions for H3K27me3 with purified FFPE nuclei by increasing the detergent concentration in the epitope retrieval solution and using higher temperatures during epitope retrieval (see Materials and Methods). We first chose conditions of epitope retrieval to check the nuclei integrity by using microscopy imaging of nuclei staining (see Materials and Methods), and then prepared mouse FFPE kidney H3K27me3 FACT-seq libraries in conditions where the nuclei were still intact. The sequencing libraries of mouse FFPE kidney H3K27me3 FACT-seq from different epitope retrieval conditions were compared to ENCODE frozen mouse kidney H3K27me3 ChIP-seq and frozen mouse kidney H3K27me3 CUT&amp;Tag (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S13A</xref>, Figure <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). With a series of optimizations, we found that the Pearson correlation between mouse FFPE kidney H3K27me3 FACT-seq and frozen mouse kidney H3K27me3 CUT&amp;Tag increased to 0.76 (Figure <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">6A</xref>–<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">C</xref>), while the correlation between mouse FFPE kidney H3K27me3 FACT-seq and ENCODE frozen mouse kidney H3K27me3 ChIP-seq reached 0.82 (Figure <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">6C</xref>) under the epitope retrieval condition of 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) plus 0.1% sodium deoxycholate with a 1-hour incubation at 65°C. With such a harsher condition of epitope retrieval, mouse FFPE kidney H3K27me3 FACT-seq sequencing libraries have good reproducibility (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S13D</xref>), and the signal enrichment at TSSs (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S13B</xref>) and the genomic features of the mouse FFPE kidney H3K27me3 FACT-seq sequencing library (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S13E, F</xref>) had high similarity to the ENCODE frozen mouse kidney H3K27me3 ChIP-seq and the frozen mouse kidney H3K27me3 CUT&amp;Tag sequencing libraries. The FRiP from H3K27me3 FACT-seq under harsh epitope conditions was 18.29 ± 1.84% (Figure <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">6D</xref>), which was similar to that of ENCODE H3K27me3 ChIP-seq (15.32% ± 0.70%), but 2-3-fold lower than that of H3K27me3 CUT&amp;Tag in frozen samples (45.45% ± 2.26%). The library complexity of FACT-seq for different epitope retrieval conditions was similar (Figure <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">6E</xref>), and much higher than that of the CUT&amp;Tag sequencing libraires. There was also a large proportion of overlapping peaks between mouse FFPE kidney H3K27me3 FACT-seq and ENCODE frozen mouse kidney H3K27me3 ChIP-seq and frozen mouse kidney H3K27me3 CUT&amp;Tag (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S14A–C</xref>). Thus, we concluded that FACT-seq could be used to profile the repressive histone marker H3K27me3 in FFPE samples but harsh epitope retrieval conditions are needed.</p>

      <p>Finally, we tested whether we could use the same epitope retrieval conditions for different histone modifications. We used harsh epitope retrieval condition (optimal epitope retrieval condition for H3K27me3) for H3K27ac FACT-seq in mouse FFPE kidneys, and we found that signal enrichment around TSSs from H3K27ac FACT-seq with harsh epitope retrieval conditions completely disappeared (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S15A</xref>). We also profiled the other two histone modifications in mouse FFPE kidney samples, H3K36me3 and H3K4me1, with both mild (optimal epitope retrieval condition for H3K27ac) and harsh (optimal epitope retrieval condition for H3K27me3) epitope retrieval conditions. Our comprehensive characterization of H3K36me3 FACT-seq and H3K4me1 FACT-seq (Figure <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">6F</xref>–<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">J</xref>, <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S15B–J</xref>) by comparison with the sequencing libraries of CUT&amp;Tag and ENCODE ChIP-seq, clearly indicated that harsh epitope retrieval conditions are needed for H3K36me3, and mild epitope retrieval conditions are optimal for H3K4me1. Thus, we proposed that epitope retrieval conditions for FACT-seq in FFPE samples may be histone modification dependent but could be optimized based on these mild and harsh conditions and judged with sequencing results.</p>
      <p>Taken together, accurate mapping of different histone modifications, H3K27ac, H3K27me3, H3K36me3 and H3K4me1, with low numbers of isolated FFPE nuclei from FFPE tissue sections demonstrates that FACT-seq can serve to profile histone modifications from FFPE samples with high sensitivity.</p>

      <title>FACT-seq reveals the disease-specific super enhancers in archived FFPE human colorectal and human glioblastoma cancer tissue</title>
      <p>Finally, we applied the FACT-seq method to archived FFPE human colorectal (CRC) and human glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) cancer tissue, where we performed H3K27ac FACT-seq on one CRC and four GBM FFPE samples. The sequencing libraries of H3K27ac FACT-seq from both the CRC and GBM samples showed good technical reproducibility in terms of the genome wide sequencing read correlation (<italic toggle="yes">R</italic> values ranging from 0.89 to 0.94, <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S16A</xref>) and in the proportion of overlapping peaks (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S16B</xref>). In addition, sequencing reads from all H3K27ac FACT-seq libraries were strongly enriched at the TSS (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S16C</xref>). Furthermore, we downloaded published RNA-seq data of CRC (<xref rid="B84" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>) and GBM (<xref rid="B85" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>), and correlated gene expression levels with the H3K27ac signal intensity for CRC and GBM (Figure <xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">7A</xref>, <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S16D, E</xref>). In brief, genes were first categorized into four ranks (from high gene expression to low gene expression: top 25%, 25–50%, 50–75% and 75–100%) (<xref rid="B86" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>) using the RNA-seq data of both human CRC (<xref rid="B84" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>) and human GBM (<xref rid="B85" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>), and the signal intensity of H3K27ac at the TSSs (±3 kb) was compared among these four categories (Figure <xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">7A</xref>, <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S16D, E</xref>). The results clearly showed that there was higher H3K27ac signal enrichment at high ranks of gene expression in both human CRC and human GBM, which further suggests that our H3K27ac FACT-seq data from human CRC and human GBM are reliable. In addition, the genomic annotation of H3K27ac peaks (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S16F and G</xref>), FRiP (from 15.45% to 31.88%) (Figure <xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">7B</xref>) and library complexity (Figure <xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">7C</xref>) from those clinical archived FFPE samples were all in reasonable ranges. When we clustered all H3K27ac FACT-seq peaks from the one CRC and four GBM samples with the non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) method, we found that two clusters were the best to characterize all H3K27ac FACT-seq peaks (Figure <xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">7D</xref>, <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S16H</xref>), where samples from CRC were in one cluster, and samples from GBM were in the other (Figure <xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">7D</xref>). Because H3K27ac has been used for super enhancer identification (<xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>), we used H3K27ac FACT-seq to identify super enhancers using the published algorithm (<xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>,<xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>). With this approach, we identified 1206 super enhancers in the CRC samples (Figure <xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">7E</xref>, <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table S2</xref>), and 492 super enhancers in the GBM samples (Figure <xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">7F</xref>, <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table S3</xref>). We also compared the list of super enhancers in our study with the reported list of super enhancers from other GBM clinical samples (<xref rid="B87" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>), and we found that 310 of 482 super enhancers identified in our samples overlapped with the reported super enhancers in GBM clinical samples (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S16I</xref>, <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table S4</xref>), which further proved the accuracy of FACT-seq in profiling H3K27ac histone modifications from FFPE samples. Among the list of super enhance genes, Tumor suppressor genes and oncogenes (<xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>) were identified in GBM and CRC (Figure <xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">7E</xref>, <xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">F</xref>, <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table S2, S3</xref>). The tumor suppressor gene, <italic toggle="yes">ERBB</italic> receptor feedback inhibitor (<italic toggle="yes">ERRFI1</italic>), ranked in the top 10 for CRC (Figure <xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">7E</xref> and <xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">G</xref>), but was not found in the super enhancer list of GBM. <italic toggle="yes">ERRFI1</italic> is reported to be a negative regulator of epidermal growth factor receptor (<italic toggle="yes">EGFR</italic>) (<xref rid="B88" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>), and has been investigated with regard to drug resistance in CRC (<xref rid="B89" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>). Interestingly, <italic toggle="yes">EGFR</italic> was ranked in the top 4 for GBM (Figure <xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">7F</xref> and <xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">H</xref>), and was also listed as a super enhancer of CRC (Figure <xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">7E</xref>), but with a rank of 120. The high rank of <italic toggle="yes">EGFR</italic> in the super enhancer list of GBM properly reflects the important function of <italic toggle="yes">EGFR</italic> in GBM progression (<xref rid="B90" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>,<xref rid="B91" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>). In addition, we also found that another CRC-relevant oncogene, MET (<xref rid="B92" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>), is listed in the top 10 CRC super enhancer list (Figure <xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">7E</xref>, <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S16J</xref>, <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table S2</xref>). Furthermore, we performed the ontological enrichment (<xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>) of super enhancer associated genes in GBM and CRC (Figure <xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">7I</xref> and <xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">J</xref>). Interestingly, tissue migration epithelial, regulation intracellular stimulus and other ontological pathways (Figure <xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">7I</xref>) were identified in the list of CRC super enhancers, but ontological pathways from nervous system development (Figure <xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">7J</xref>) are enriched in the super enhancer list of GBM. Thus, we concluded that FACT-seq serves to identify disease-specific super enhancers using low numbers of nuclei prepared from a single clinically archived FFPE tissue section.</p>

    <title>DISCUSSION</title>
    <p>FFPE tissue samples represent a large source of material for epigenetic analysis in both basic research and clinical translational studies (<xref rid="B93" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>). The successful application of ChIP-seq in FFPE tissues, PAT-ChIP (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>), (FiT-seq) (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>), FiTAc-seq) (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>) and other similar technologies (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>), makes it possible to map histone modifications in clinically archived FFPE tissue; however, a large amount of input materials from clinical samples are required for these technologies (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Thus far, the material has not been widely used in epigenetic studies because of the lack of sufficiently sensitive detection technologies (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Combining a novel fusion protein of hyperactive Tn5 transposase and protein A (T7−pA−Tn5) transposition and T7 <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> transcription, we developed the first highly sensitive technology for profiling histone modifications in clinically archived FFPE samples. We demonstrated that FACT-seq is a robust tool to decode genome-wide histone modifications using a tiny FFPE tissue containing ∼4000 nuclei. FACT-seq is a sonication-free method, and could thus minimize potential sequence bias introduced by sonication procedures. In CUT&amp;Tag and similar technologies, one insertion event or unpaired pA–Tn5 adaptor insertions from pA–Tn5 transposition could not be amplified with PCR (<xref rid="B75" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>). Since the IVT depends on only one insertion of the T7 promoter, one insertion event and unpaired adaptor insertions at the targeting sites from T7−pA−Tn5 could be detected with FACT-seq during IVT. Thus, the library complexity of FACT-seq is higher than that of CUT&amp;Tag or similar technologies. Recently, a similar technology TIP-seq (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>), was established by an independent group, who also proved that the linear amplification feature of T7 <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> transcription on pA–Tn5 could increase the sequencing library complexity of targeting protein:DNA binding sites.</p>
    <p>In our currently established FACT-seq protocol, 5 working days are needed from cutting the FFPE tissue section to sequencing library readiness, which is in the same time scale of other histone modification profiling technologies for FFPE samples (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>), but is much longer than that of high sensitivity technologies working with non-FFPE samples (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20–39</xref>,<xref rid="B75" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>). There is a great need to reduce the timing in the future by further optimizing the protocol. We also learned that epitope retrieval is essential in FACT-seq but histone marker dependent, thus, it will be very helpful to further optimize a generic epitope retrieval condition for all histone modifications. Furthermore, we noticed that some proportion of nuclei was lost during nuclei isolation and epitope retrieval, and a better nuclei isolation protocol for FACT-seq is needed in the future.</p>
    <p>The high sensitivity of FACT-seq, consuming minimal amounts of clinical materials, makes it possible to combine epigenetic profiling with other clinical-pathological parameters for clinical diagnosis. The successful profiling of the disease specific super enhancer from the clinically archived CRC and GBM FFPE samples makes FACT-seq a powerful tool in preclinical studies and for precision medicine. In addition, FACT-seq has the potential to extend our current understanding of the cancer epigenome by combining it with other omics data from the same FFPE materials. FACT-seq can have broad applications both in basic research and clinical settings. Most of available high sensitivity technologies for profiling histone modifications involving non-FFPE biological materials are already at the single-cell level (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20–39</xref>), thus, it would be of great interest to push the resolution of FACT-seq to the single cell level and to investigate epigenetic heterogeneity in clinical samples in the near future.</p>
