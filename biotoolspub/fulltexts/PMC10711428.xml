      <title>Abstract</title>
      <p>Linked-read sequencing promises a one-method approach for genome-wide insights including single nucleotide variants (SNVs), structural variants, and haplotyping. We introduce Barcode Linked Reads (BLR), an open-source haplotyping pipeline capable of handling millions of barcodes and data from multiple linked-read technologies including DBS, 10× Genomics, TELL-seq and stLFR. Running BLR on DBS linked-reads yielded megabase-scale phasing with low (&lt;0.2%) switch error rates. Of 13616 protein-coding genes phased in the GIAB benchmark set (v4.2.1), 98.6% matched the BLR phasing. In addition, large structural variants showed concordance with HPRC-HG002 reference assembly calls. Compared to diploid assembly with PacBio HiFi reads, BLR phasing was more continuous when considering switch errors. We further show that integrating long reads at low coverage (∼10×) can improve phasing contiguity and reduce switch errors in tandem repeats. When compared to Long Ranger on 10× Genomics data, BLR showed an increase in phase block N50 with low switch-error rates. For TELL-Seq and stLFR linked reads, BLR generated longer or similar phase block lengths and low switch error rates compared to results presented in the original publications. In conclusion, BLR provides a flexible workflow for comprehensive haplotype analysis of linked reads from multiple platforms.</p>

    <title>Introduction</title>
    <p>The immense growth of massively parallel sequencing technologies in the last decade has contributed to a deeper understanding of genetic variations. Arguably, the most successful platform has been short-read sequencing combining high accuracy and throughput with a low cost per base. The biggest flaw of this platform is the limited field of view these reads provide. In a haplotype context, the short read length fails to fully capture the cumulative impact of both structural variants (SVs) and short variants such as single nucleotide variants (SNVs) (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Methods like Hi-C (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>) and Strand-seq (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>) have leveraged short reads to gain chromosome-scale insights but they fall short in terms of phasing completeness (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>) and when mapping to difficult regions such as repeats (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Long-read sequencing has shown some promise for haplotyping (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8–10</xref>), especially in a hybrid approach with Hi-C or Strand-seq (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Accurate long reads such as PacBio HiFi have also enabled diploid assembly as a reference-free approach for haplotyping (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12–16</xref>). These strategies are however expensive, laborious and require copious input material. One of the most viable solutions is the use of linked-read sequencing. Here, short subsections of long genomic DNA (gDNA) molecules are linked with a shared barcode, thus enabling computational reconstruction of the original molecule following short-read sequencing. Linked reads thereby retain long-range genetic information without compromising single-base accuracy.</p>
    <p>Several linked-read solutions have been reported in recent years. The methods rely on different strategies for compartmentalization. In this context, compartmentalization refers to the creation of physically or virtually isolated compartments wherein subsections of one-or-more long gDNA molecules are assigned to a unique barcode. Among these methods, CPT-seq (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>) employs the split-and-pool tagging strategy while CPT-seqv2 (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>), TELL-Seq (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>), stLFR (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>) and Haplotagging (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>) use Tn5-loaded barcoded beads to generate virtual compartments. A third strategy is compartmentalization through emulsion droplets employed by 10× Genomics (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>) and the DBS method introduced by Redin <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). All these linked-read methods offer numerous insights that usually are lost or difficult to obtain using conventional short-read technologies. Notably, they excel in revealing intricate details regarding structural variations, copy number variations and combinatorial SNV effects. It has also been shown that linked reads can enhance coverage in difficult regions (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>), which was recently used to improve upon genome benchmarks (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>).</p>
    <p>To uncover these genetic variations from linked reads, reference-based haplotype analysis can be applied. However, available linked-read specific pipelines come with several limitations. For example, the otherwise popular Long Ranger pipeline (<ext-link xlink:href="https://github.com/10XGenomics/longranger" ext-link-type="uri">https://github.com/10×Genomics/longranger</ext-link>) was primarily developed for 10× Genomics linked-read technology, which is currently commercially discontinued. Their method differs from other linked-read technologies in multiple important aspects. For example, the number of compartments generated by 10× Genomics is generally around a million, while other technologies like TELL-Seq and stLFR generate what corresponds to 10 million or more compartments. 10× Genomics is also the only technology not relying on tagmentation in library production. While Long Ranger is used in downstream analysis of other linked-read technologies (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>), this requires computationally translated barcodes. Aquila (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>) provides an alternative approach to haplotype analysis by doing reference-guided assembly and takes both 10× Genomics and TELL-seq linked reads, while its related pipeline Aquila_stLFR (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>) enables stLFR input. Other pipelines (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19–21</xref>) such as TELL-Read/TELL-Sort for TELL-Seq data, are single-purpose tools, often without proper workflow management (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>), each designed for their specific technology. Although most of these pipelines are open-access, they cannot be easily adapted to orthogonal linked-read technologies. They also lack the integration of novel tools for linked-read analysis such as Emerald (EMA) (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>).</p>
    <p>Apart from the lack of a flexible analysis pipeline for multiple technologies, access to high molecular weight (HMW) gDNA is considered a prerequisite for practical linked-read employment (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). Indeed, longer gDNA input has been shown to improve phasing completeness (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). However, this requirement may not be met in all studies as the gDNA might be degraded or otherwise hard to extract without damage. In addition, most linked-read methods are fundamentally limited in their resolution, where a typical assay assigns multiple independent DNA molecules to a single barcode (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22–24</xref>). The resolution could be improved to e.g. single molecule, but this would require running several reactions to achieve similar coverage with added costs thereto. In addition, the resulting increase in the number of barcodes might prohibit analysis using existing pipelines such as Long Ranger. Optimally, a linked-read method of choice should be affordable, not require specialized equipment, not necessitate the use of extreme HMW gDNA and simultaneously be a feasible solution for producing single-molecule resolution barcodes. Although several of the solutions that are available today would be capable of meeting these targets, the spread has been hampered by practical limitations relating to cost, scalability, or a combination of these.</p>
    <p>Here we present Barcode Linked Reads (BLR, <ext-link xlink:href="https://github.com/AfshinLab/BLR" ext-link-type="uri">https://github.com/AfshinLab/BLR</ext-link>), an open-source haplotyping pipeline capable of handling both millions of barcodes and data from multiple linked-read technologies, including 10× Genomics, TELL-Seq and stLFR. The pipeline implements several linked-read optimized software in interchangeable modules, rendering it a universal platform for haplotype analysis of linked reads. In addition, we utilize the unique combined aspects of our DBS technology (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>) with respect to cost, scalability and flexibility as an alternative linked-read technology to haplotype resolve the entire human genome.</p>

      <title>BLR pipeline</title>
      <p>The BLR pipeline workflow can be broken down into several steps as outlined in Figure <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. The pipeline is implemented using Snakemake (v6.4.1) (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>) as a workflow manager and packaged as a Python command-line tool. Conda is used for dependencies management. The pipeline integrates multiple published software as well as pipeline-specific scripts into the same Python package that are available as subcommands, e.g. ‘blr tagfastq’. In some steps, different tools can be used interchangeably for flexibility. For example, mapping can be done using BWA-MEM instead of EMA. The tools outlined below represent the current defaults and are subject to change as optimization continues and new software is released.</p>

          <p>Overview of the BLR pipeline workflow. On the left, selected steps are visualized from the aspect of aligned reads. On the right, the flowchart outlines all steps from input FASTQs to final outputs. Within the flowchart, major processing steps are shown in gray with substeps outlined to the right. For each substep, the software used is indicated in parenthesis. FASTQs are first processed according to their linked-read technology to generate barcoded FASTQs. The barcoded reads are aligned to a reference genome, sorted and indexed to yield an initial BAM file. To parallelize processing, the barcode-tagged alignments are split over chromosomes for the remaining steps. First, overlapping barcodes are collapsed, then duplicates are marked. Molecule information is assigned to alignments and used to filter out high molecule count barcodes. This yields a filtered BAM file that is used for short variant calling. The short variants are then filtered and used in phasing to generate a phased VCF. The phased VCF is then used with the filtered BAM to assign the alignments to a haplotype yielding a phased BAM. This is in turn used to call large structural variants (SVs). Throughout the pipeline, useful statistics and data are collected that are compiled into a MultiQC report.</p>
        </caption>
        <graphic xlink:href="gkad1010fig1" position="float"/>
      </fig>
      <p>For any BLR run, the subcommand ‘blr init’ initializes a working directory with the FASTQs and configurations. Configuration parameters can then be updated using ‘blr config’. Finally, the pipeline is started using ‘blr run’ which runs the workflow from start to finish.</p>
      <p>In the first step of BLR, FASTQs from sequencing are processed to extract and correct the barcode sequences. The adapter-trimmed inserts are then labeled with their corresponding corrected barcode sequence in the FASTQ header. This first step depends on the technology used for generating the linked-read library (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>). FastQC (<ext-link xlink:href="https://github.com/s-andrews/FastQC" ext-link-type="uri">https://github.com/s-andrews/FastQC</ext-link>, v0.11.9) is used for quality control of trimmed reads from all technologies.</p>
      <p>For DBS libraries, the barcode sequences are extracted from read1 using Cutadapt (v2.5) (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). The sequences are corrected by clustering using starcode (v1.4) (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>) with options ‘-d 2 -r 5’. Adaptor sequences are trimmed from read1 and 2 using Cutadapt and the reads are subsequently tagged with the corrected barcode using the subcommand ‘blr tagfastq’.</p>
      <p>For 10× Genomics libraries, the preprocessing is performed using EMA (v0.6.2) (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). EMA extracts the barcode sequence from the reads and corrects the barcode using a provided barcode whitelist to any sequence within a Hamming distance of one.</p>
      <p>For TELL-Seq libraries, barcodes were corrected as described by Wang <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>) and implemented as the subcommand ‘blr correctbc’. In brief, unique barcode sequences were counted and singleton barcodes (with a count of one) are corrected to any remaining barcode with multiple counts that is within a Hamming distance of one. Reads belonging to singleton barcodes with conflicting matches to sequences with multiple counts are removed. Additionally, any reads assigned to a barcode not matching the pattern NNHNNYRNNNNYRNNHNN (IUPAC notation) are also discarded. Adaptor sequences are trimmed from each read pair using Cutadapt and the reads are subsequently tagged with the corrected barcode using ‘blr tagfastq’.</p>
      <p>For stLFR libraries, FASTQs containing the corrected barcode's numerical indices in the header are used as input. Reads are first trimmed to remove possible 3′ adaptors using Cutadapt. Since EMA requires FASTQs to be tagged with a canonical DNA string, these barcode indexes (e.g. ‘#473_1282_95’) are converted to unique 16 nucleotide IUPAC barcode sequences using ‘blr process_stlfr’. These sequences are then used to tag the adaptor-trimmed reads.</p>
      <p>In the next step, barcode-tagged reads are aligned to a reference genome using EMA. This also moves the barcode from the read header to the BX tag. The output BAM is sorted and indexed using samtools (v1.12) (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). The sorted BAM is then split by chromosomes to allow for parallel processing. First, barcode multiplets are collapsed by looking for barcodes sharing two identical insert positions within a defined window (in this study a 30 kb window was used except for 10× where we used 50 kb) using ‘blr find_clusterdups’. Positions with excessively high barcode counts are excluded to avoid collapsing unconnected barcodes. Next, duplicates within barcodes are marked using picard (<ext-link xlink:href="https://github.com/broadinstitute/picard" ext-link-type="uri">https://github.com/broadinstitute/picard</ext-link>, v2.26.2) using options ‘READ_ONE_BARCODE_TAG = BX READ_TWO_BARCODE_TAG = BX’. Following this, the molecules of origin are inferred from the aligned reads within each barcode by grouping reads within a defined sliding window using ‘blr buildmolecules’. Only molecules containing four or more reads are kept and for these multiple statistics are collected. To avoid having molecules overlapping the same region, barcodes carrying too many molecules (current threshold set to 260 molecules) are filtered out using ‘blr filterclusters’. Multiple statistics and quality metrics are collected using mosdepth (v0.3.2) (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>), samtools, picard and custom Python scripts.</p>
      <p>Next, short variants (&lt;50 bp) are called from the processed and filtered BAMs using either GATK HaplotypeCaller (v4.2.1) (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>), DeepVariant (v1.3.0) (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>) or FreeBayes (v1.3.5) (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). These variants are then split into SNVs and INDELs and filtered. For GATK calls, the thresholds used for SNVs were QUAL &lt;15, MQRankSum &gt;6.0 and AF &lt;0.15, while for INDELs QUAL &lt;15, MQRankSum &gt;6.0 and AF &lt;0.25 was used. For DeepVariant and FreeBayes calls were only filtered based on quality using threshold QUAL &lt;15 for both SNVs and INDELs. These variant calls are then phased using HapCUT2 (v1.3.2) (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Specifically heterozygous variants were extracted using the ‘extractHairs’ command with options ‘–realign_variants 1 –10 × 1’. These variants were then linked by barcode using the HapCUT2-included script ‘LinkFragments.py’. The window size (option ‘–distance’ in ‘LinkFragments.py’) used for linking variants on the same barcodes was the same that was used in ‘blr buildmolecules’. Finally, the linked variants were assembled into the phased haplotypes using the command ‘hapcut2’ with option ‘nf 1’. The phased calls are then used to assign alignments to haplotypes 1 and 2 using ‘whatshap haplotag’ (v1.1) (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). These phased alignments are finally used for structural variant calling using a modified version of NAIBR (<ext-link xlink:href="https://github.com/pontushojer/NAIBR" ext-link-type="uri">https://github.com/pontushojer/NAIBR</ext-link>, v0.4.1) (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>) with default settings. Multiple statistics are collected using WhatsHap, HapCUT2 and custom Python scripts. Finally, the statistics are compiled into a comprehensive report using a custom MultiQC (v1.11) (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>) plugin.</p>
      <p>The custom scripts were written in Python (v3.6.13) and relied heavily on the packages numpy (v1.19.5) (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>), pandas (v1.15) (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>), tqdm (v4.62.3) and pysam (v0.16.0.1) (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>).</p>

      <p>Human genomic DNA from the GM24385 cell line was obtained from the 10× Chromium Genome Kit. The consequent steps for library preparation were carried out in the same way as detailed by Redin <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>), with few disclosed exceptions. For every single molecule (SM) library, a total of 500 pg HMW gDNA was used for the on-bead tagmentation reaction. Next, the beads carrying single DNA molecules were divided into 10 separate reactions resulting in every emulsion reaction containing only 50 pg of DNA. Following emulsion PCR, the libraries were pooled and cleaned up 4 times to remove unused barcodes. In the same way, for each multiple-molecule (MM) library, a total of 7 ng genomic DNA was used for tagmentation and 1/7th of the beads were encapsulated in emulsion droplets (i.e. 1 ng genomic DNA in each of the MM emulsion reactions). Sample enrichment, preparation of the final library (including indexing) and sequencing was done as described by Redin <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>).</p>

Long Ranger outputs the SVs in two separate VCFs which were concatenated using bcftools (v1.12) (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>). For the HG002-HPRC deletions, we used a VCF generated with DipCall from <ext-link xlink:href="https://data.nist.gov/od/ds/ark:/88434/mds2-2578/assemblies-and-benchmarking_results/HG002-HPRC.tar.gz" ext-link-type="uri">https://data.nist.gov/od/ds/ark:/88434/mds2-2578/assemblies-and-benchmarking_results/HG002-HPRC.tar.gz</ext-link>.

      <p>Additional SV calling was performed on the MM + SM dataset run with BLR/DeepVariant. LinkedSV (<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>) (<ext-link xlink:href="https://github.com/WGLab/LinkedSV" ext-link-type="uri">https://github.com/WGLab/LinkedSV</ext-link>, commit: 154ea2a) was run on the phased BAM in germline mode with options ‘-v hg38 –germline_mode –wgs’. The output from LinkedSV is multiple SV BEDPE files (*filtered_large_svcalls.bedpe, *large_cnv.bedpe, *large_cnv.bedpe) that were converted to VCF using a custom Python script (linkedsv_bedpe_to_vcf.py) and then combined using bcftools to create a single VCF for comparison. Besides LinkedSV, Manta (v1.6.0) (<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>) was also run on the phased BAM using default parameters. From the output VCF only ‘diploidSV.vcf.gz’ was used. MTG-Link (v2.4.1) (<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>) was used to call large insertions. From the Manta SV VCF, candidate large insertion sites were extracted by filtering for insertions with the LEFT_SVINSSEQ and RIGHT_SVINSSEQ INFO fields. These variants were then converted to a GFA file using the MTG-Link script ‘vcf2gfa.py’ with options ‘–contigs 10 000 -ext 50’.

      <title>Phasing evaluation metrics</title>
      <p>To evaluate phasing multiple metrics were provided. Switch errors refer to inconsistent phasing relative to a reference haplotype and are normally reported in two classes as short and long switch errors respectively. Short switch errors denote errors where one position has been flipped while long switch errors require multiple positions in a row. Their rate is reported as the fraction of all positions available for switch errors. Phase block length was reported as Nx curves which shows what percentage of the total haplotype assembly is covered by phase blocks of a certain length or longer. Note that at 50% of the total haplotype length, we get the N50 metric. We also report the area under the Nx curve as auN as this provides a more stable metric for contiguity than N50. We further report switch-corrected phase block lengths in the form of QNx curves and corresponding QN50 and auQN values. For this, we account for switch errors in the phase blocks by splitting them at switch locations to get the block lengths that were correctly phased.</p>

Specifically, the command ‘rtg vcfeval’ was used with options ‘-m combine’ and ‘–bed-regions HG002_GRCh38_1_22_v4.2.1_benchmark_noinconsistent.bed’ where the BED file was downloaded from: <ext-link xlink:href="https://ftp-trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/giab/ftp/release/AshkenazimTrio/HG002_NA24385_son/NISTv4.2.1/GRCh38/HG002_GRCh38_1_22_v4.2.1_benchmark_noinconsistent.bed" ext-link-type="uri">https://ftp-trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/giab/ftp/release/AshkenazimTrio/HG002_NA24385_son/NISTv4.2.1/GRCh38/HG002_GRCh38_1_22_v4.2.1_benchmark_noinconsistent.bed</ext-link>. The coordinates for protein-coding genes on GRCh38 were acquired from Ensembl (release 106). Genes were considered phased if they contained at least two phased heterozygous SNVs.

      <title>Switch error stratifications</title>
      <p>To evaluate phasing accuracy in different genomic contexts we used genome stratifications defined by the Global Alliance for Genomic Health (GA4GH), GIAB and Telomere-to-Telomere Consortium (T2T) for GRCh38 (v3.1) available from <ext-link xlink:href="https://ftp-trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ReferenceSamples/giab/release/genome-stratifications/v3.1/v3.1-genome-stratifications-GRCh38.tar.gz" ext-link-type="uri">https://ftp-trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ReferenceSamples/giab/release/genome-stratifications/v3.1/v3.1-genome-stratifications-GRCh38.tar.gz</ext-link>. The stratifications used with file names in parenthesis were: segmental duplications (‘GRCh38_segdups.bed.gz’), self-chain (‘GRCh38_chainSelf.bed.gz’), low mappability (‘GRCh38_lowmappabilityall.bed.gz’), tandem repeats (‘GRCh38_allTandemRepeats.bed.gz’) and high/low GC content (‘GRCh38_gclt30orgt55_slop50.bed.gz’). Phased variants were only evaluated on chromosome 1 for simplicity. RTGtools was used to compare and extract variants marked as true positives relative to the GIAB benchmark (v4.2.1). Variants involved in switch errors were identified using WhatsHap (v1.7) with command ‘compare’ (parameter ‘–switch-error-bed’) comparing to the same GIAB benchmark.

The workflow was implemented as a Snakemake workflow wrapped as a Python package. The starting point is VCF files with SV calls from which calls that pass filters and match the desired SV type are kept. Overlapping SV calls within each dataset were collapsed using truvari (v3.1.0) (<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>) with the subcommand ‘collapse’ and parameters ‘–chain –pctsim 0 –pctovl 0.8 –pctsize 0.8 –refdist 2000’. SVs were then filtered against a blacklist and for the desired size interval using SURVIVOR (v1.0.7) (<xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>). Calls with both breakpoints within 20 kb of segmental duplications were also removed using a custom Python script. Overlapping calls between different sample sources were assessed using SURVIVOR. Calls were considered to be overlapping if both breakpoints were within an interval corresponding to 10% of the total length of the SV. Blacklists and segmental duplications were downloaded from the 10× Genomics webpage (<ext-link xlink:href="https://support.10xgenomics.com/genome-exome/software/pipelines/latest/advanced/reference" ext-link-type="uri">https://support.10×genomics.com/genome-exome/software/pipelines/latest/advanced/reference</ext-link>). The blacklist was expanded by 10 kb using bedtools (v2.30.0) (<xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>) to remove proximal calls. Venn diagrams were created using R (v4.1.3) with VennDiagram (v1.7.3). Overlap scores were calculated as the ratio between the number of SVs in the intersect and the number of SVs in the smallest of the compared sets. For comparisons with a reference set, matching calls are counted as true positives (TP). Non-matching calls belonging to the query set are counted as false positives (FP) and those belonging to the reference set are counted as false negatives (FN). From this, recall is calculated as TP / (TP + FP), precision as TP / (TP + FN) and the F1 score is 2 * ((recall * precision) / (recall + precision)).</p>

Since the Long Ranger run had been downsampled, the same set of reads was extracted from the provided phased BAM for input into BLR. For mapping, the same 10× Genomics hg19 reference (version 2.1.0) was used as in the Long Ranger run. A window size of 50 kb was used to infer molecules and phased variants instead of the default 30 kb. Long Ranger metrics in Table <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">2</xref> were taken from the file ‘NA12878_WGS_v2_summary.csv’ except for coverage stats which were computed using mosdepth (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>) and switched error rates which were separately evaluated on the phased VCF (‘NA12878_WGS_v2_phased_variants.vcf.gz’) using ‘blr calculate_haplotype_statistics’.

      <title>Method description</title>
      <p>We have developed a referenced-based analysis pipeline called BLR (Figure <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) and continued development of the DBS method (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 2</xref>). The pipeline can run data from the DBS method and from other linked-read methods such as 10× Genomics (GemCode or Chromium Genome), stLFR and TELL-Seq. Preprocessing of the input FASTQs prior to mapping is dependent on the linked-read technology since they vary in read structure and barcoding approach (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>). In the case of DBS, the technology makes use of degenerate barcodes which are extracted from read 1 (see Methods for the other technologies). Each DNA barcode is corrected by clustering barcode sequences within a defined edit distance using a message-passing algorithm (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). The reads are then trimmed to remove adaptors, and the corrected barcode is tagged to the read-pair of origin. The barcode-tagged reads are then aligned to a reference genome using the barcode-aware mapper EMA (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). Following alignment, reads are split by chromosome to speed up downstream processing. In the DBS technique, it is possible to encapsulate two or more barcodes in one droplet. This phenomenon has also been observed in 10× Genomics droplet generation (<xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>). To address this issue, the barcodes with overlapping read sets are collapsed and duplicate reads are marked within each barcode. The molecules are inferred for each barcode by splitting read pairs whose pairwise distance exceeds a defined threshold into separate molecules. To avoid molecules covering overlapping genomic regions within a barcode, barcodes with an excessive number of molecules are removed. This is followed by short variant calling using either GATK HaplotypeCaller(38), DeepVariant(39), or FreeBayes(40). Variants were then filtered to yield a set of high-quality heterozygous variants. The heterozygous short variants are phased using HapCUT2 (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). The phased variants are then used to assign haplotypes back to the mapped reads using WhatsHap (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Finally, using the phased reads, structural variants are called using NAIBR (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). At various points, a number of quality metrics and statistics are collected and compiled into a comprehensive report (example in <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 3</xref>) based on MultiQC (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>).</p>

      <title>BLR generates highly continuous and accurate phasing on DBS data</title>
      <p>We first evaluated the BLR pipeline on linked reads generated by the DBS method. By lowering the amount of gDNA per reaction and running multiple parallel reactions we were able to generate linked-read libraries with single-molecule (SM) resolution. For comparison, we also generated libraries containing multiple molecules (MM) per droplet, similar to Redin <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). Three SM libraries and two MM libraries were generated using gDNA corresponding to Genome in a Bottle (GIAB) reference genome HG002 (NA24385). Despite the slightly degraded quality of the obtained gDNA for this genome, we proceeded due to its benchmarking utility (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>). These libraries were run separately through the BLR pipeline using reference genome GRCh38 and then merged to form the MM and SM datasets at 23× and 21× median coverage respectively (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). We also merged these to form a high-coverage (44×) MM + SM dataset (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 1</xref>).</p>
      <p>We first benchmarked different variant callers that are currently integrated into BLR on the MM + SM dataset. Calls from DeepVariant, FreeBayes, and GATK on chromosome 1 were evaluated against the GIAB benchmark set (v4.2.1) (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>) using hap.py (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). DeepVariant demonstrated superior performance across SNPs and INDELs, achieving F1 scores of 98.3% and 88.4% respectively. Furthermore, when focusing on heterozygous calls, which play a crucial role in haplotype phasing, DeepVariant once again outperformed other methods with the highest precision (99.4% for SNPs and 99.3% for INDELs) and F1 scores (97.7% for SNPs and 89.0% for INDELs). Compared to SNPs, INDELs generally scored lower and were also observed to be 3–6 times less frequent. The relatively low frequency of INDELs may limit their impact on phasing. Consequently, we chose to exclude INDELs to conduct a comparative analysis of their impact on phasing. The majority of heterozygous calls were successfully phased across the variant callers, irrespective of whether INDELs were included or excluded (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 3</xref>). GATK and FreeBayes with INDELs included produced the longest phase blocks at N50 of 24.2 Mb and 18.5 Mb respectively compared to ∼4 Mb for the other conditions (Figure <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2A</xref>, <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 3</xref>). Switch error rates (SER) were low (0.01–0.12%) with DeepVariant having the lowest across variant callers. Including INDELs increased switch errors, especially the short SER which increased by more than double. To obtain a more comprehensive measure of phasing completeness, we evaluated the effect of switch errors on phase block length by splitting phase blocks at switch positions (Figure <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2B</xref>). The result showed that the highly continuous phasing created using GATK and FreeBayes calls with INDELs was largely inflated. The switch-corrected block lengths when using DeepVariant or only SNP calls much better represented the assembled block lengths. Repetitive regions remain a challenge for accurate phasing (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). We therefore stratified these haplotype phasings across various difficult genomic regions to look for enrichments in switch errors (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 4</xref>). Overall, switch errors were more common in repetitive regions such as segmental duplications and tandem repeats. Compared to the other variant callers, DeepVariant calls generated fewer switch errors in these regions. One exception is when including INDELs for tandem repeats where FreeBayes only had 0.22% switched variants compared to 0.47% for DeepVariant. Based on these benchmarks we selected DeepVariant calls with INDELs for phasing the full datasets, while also providing phasing-inflating GATK calls for a reference.</p>

      <p>We hypothesized that having multiple molecules per barcode might generate noise in the barcode-aware software tools such as HapCUT2. Comparing the MM and SM datasets they had similar genome coverage (∼22×, <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 5a</xref>), molecule length (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 5b</xref>), and molecule coverage (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 5c</xref>) while a majority of barcodes (55.0%) in the SM dataset contained a single DNA molecule versus a median of seven molecules for MM (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 5d</xref>). Furthermore, duplicate rates were higher for the SM dataset compared to MM (Table <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Comparing phase block lengths, an increase was seen from MM to SM dataset with the GATK calls (Figure <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2C</xref>) with an N50 of 7.1 megabases (Mb) and 11.7 Mb, respectively. DeepVariant variants generated phase blocks of a similar length for both MM and SM but were shorter compared to GATK with an N50 of about ∼2.2 Mb. Considering the switch-corrected phase blocks (Figure <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2D</xref>), no difference in length was observed between the SM and MM datasets.</p>

      </table-wrap>
      <p>Because of the rather modest coverage of the MM and SM datasets we combined both to generate a high-coverage dataset MM + SM with a median of 44X coverage (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 5a</xref>). The added depth was reflected in the increased phase block length (Figure <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2C</xref>) to an N50 of 4.4 Mb with DeepVariant and 24.8 Mb with GATK (Table <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). This increase in phasing contiguity was also accompanied by lower SER, dropping from 0.146–0.196% to 0.103–0.109% for GATK and from 0.031–0.074% to 0.027–0.051% for DeepVariant (Table <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Looking at switch-corrected phase blocks (Figure <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2D</xref>), DeepVariant calls again generated more continuous and accurate phasing with a QN50 of 2.15 Mb compared to GATK at 1.52 Mb. This reaffirms the benchmarking finding that running BLR with GATK calls might generate spurious phasing.</p>
      <p>To validate the usefulness of the phasing, we evaluated phasing across all protein-coding genes in the MM + SM high-coverage dataset. We used the GIAB benchmark set (v4.2.1) and Ensembl (release 106) gene annotations for reference. A protein-coding gene was considered phased if it contained at least two phased SNPs which left 13616 genes phased out of a total of 19054 in the benchmark set. For these phased genes we observed a high level of agreement with the GIAB benchmark set (Figure <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2E</xref>). In the DBS MM + SM dataset with DeepVariant calls, 98.6% (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 13 426) were phased without switch errors. Accurate phasing is particularly important for highly polymorphous regions such as the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) region. Looking at the 19 HLA genes we found that of the 15 genes phased in GIAB (including HLA-A, -B, -C), all were phased without errors in the MM + SM set (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 4</xref>).</p>
      <p>BLR also performs SV calling using NAIBR which calls deletions, inversions and duplications from about 500 bp and upwards. To compare calls, we developed lsvtool that can filter, select and compare SVs from multiple sources (see Methods for details). From 1213–2312 initial calls from NAIBR, 731–947 calls remained after processing with lsvtool (Table <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Comparing calls between MM + SM and the two low-coverage datasets showed good overlap (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 6</xref>). Calls consisted mostly of deletions with a few large (&gt;10 kb) inversions and duplications (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 6a and b</xref>). Therefore, we focused on deletion calls. To validate the DBS MM + SM SV deletions we compared them against calls from PacBio and 10× Genomics. Deletions from the HPRC reference assembly of HG002 (<xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>) were additionally included as a benchmark set. Overlap was generally good between the datasets and the majority of DBS deletions matched HPRC (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 6c and d</xref>). Quantifying this overlap using HPRC as the reference set the precision was acceptable at 0.59–0.60 for the DBS dataset while the recall was considerably lower at 0.34 compared to 0.48 for 10× Genomics and 0.61 for PacBio (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 5</xref>). Looking at the size distribution, most calls below 1kb were from PacBio and HPRC while 10× Genomics had the majority of calls above 100 kb (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 6e</xref>). Deletions were therefore further limited to the range of 1 to 100 kb since this would yield a fairer comparison with all datasets adequately represented. In this range most deletions were matched between datasets (Figure <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2F</xref>) and both precision (0.84–0.86) and recall (0.64) were improved for the DBS dataset (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 5</xref>).</p>
      <p>For calling SVs, multiple tools are available besides NAIBR that utilize linked-read information (<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,<xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59–63</xref>), many of which can be run directly from BLR output. To further benchmark the NAIBR calls, we called SVs using LinkedSV (<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>) and short-read caller Manta (<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>) on the DBS MM + SM dataset phased with DeepVariant calls. Calls were stratified by length and scored against the HPRC reference set (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 7a</xref>). PacBio PBSV and 10× Genomics Long Ranger were also included for comparison. Although NAIBR allows calling deletions below 1kb, there is a high drop in recall and precision for calls in this range. Manta and LinkedSV scored much better below 1kb, even outperforming the PacBio calls in precision. Deletions called by PacBio however had the highest recall up to around 10kb. Above 10kb, calls were relatively few resulting in big fluctuations in precision and recall for all callers. Looking at F1 Score, linked-read based callers NAIBR and Long Ranger (on 10× Genomics data) generally performed best in this range as compared to the short-read caller Manta.</p>
      <p>Linked reads also enable the calling of large insertions (<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>,<xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>,<xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>). To showcase this application, we utilized the fact that the Manta SV caller is able to identify sites for putative large insertions. These sites were used as input to MTG-Link that reconstructs the insertion using local assembly of linked reads connected to the particular site (<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>). From 321 candidate sites, 80 large insertions could be identified. Out of these insertions 54 (67.5%) matched PacBio PBSV calls and 57 (71.3%) matched insertions from the HPRC reference set (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 7b</xref>). Similarly for the Manta called insertions a majority (83.6–84.8%) of calls overlapped with the external sets. Looking at the size distribution (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 7c</xref>), MTG-Link was able to resolve calls within a wider range than Manta, with the longest MTG-Link insertion verified by the HPRC set being 975 bp. While this approach enables detection of longer insertions, the majority of calls are missed as compared to PacBio.</p>

      <title>Integration of DBS linked reads with low-coverage long reads improves haplotype phasing</title>
      <p>The introduction of accurate long-read sequencing, primarily in the form of PacBio HiFi reads, has enabled the generation of diploid assemblies as an alternative approach to haplotyping (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12–16</xref>). We therefore compared the reference-based phasing generated by BLR to a recent diploid assembly of HG002 using Hifiasm (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>) (v0.16.1) on PacBio HiFi reads (30×). At 30× coverage the cost for PacBio HiFi library preparation and sequencing is significantly higher compared to BLR, even if including the latest PacBio Revio instrument (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 6</xref>). For the comparison, we used the DBS MM + SM dataset using DeepVariant calls and limited analysis to chromosome 1. The phased contigs of the Hifiasm assembly were more continuous compared to the BLR phase blocks (Figure <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2G</xref>) with N50 of 70.2 and 67.0 Mb for haplotypes 1 and 2. Conversely, the long switch error rate was more than ten times higher than BLR (0.03%) at 0.39% for Hifiasm. This resulted in considerably lower contiguity than BLR when correcting for switch errors (Figure <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2H</xref>). Stratifying the Hifiasm phasing, the rate of switched variants was only moderately elevated for difficult regions (Figure <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2I</xref>). The rate was still considerably higher compared to BLR which had rates closer to the HG002-HPRC reference assembly (<xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>).</p>
      <p>Despite DBS generating a more accurate phasing of HG002 compared to Hifiasm, switch rates were considerably elevated in low mappability, low complexity (segmental duplications and self-chain regions), and tandem repeat regions. We hypothesized that a hybrid phasing approach with low coverage long reads could be a more cost-effective way to improve switch rates in some of these regions (see <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 6</xref> for a cost comparison for different sequencing technologies). Therefore, we integrated publicly available long-read data from HG002 with our DBS MM + SM data for variant phasing, employing the DeepVariant calls. We integrated both relatively short (∼20 kb) but accurate PacBio HiFi reads and longer (&gt;100 kb) but low base-quality Nanopore Ultra-long reads (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 8a</xref>). The limited length of the PacBio HiFi reads did not provide any significant improvements in phasing contiguity on integration compared to just using DBS data (Figure <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2G</xref>, <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 8b and c</xref>). Integration of Nanopore Ultra-long reads however increased contiguity considerably, even at the lowest (5×) coverage. Looking at the genome stratifications (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 8d</xref>) a coverage-linked reduction in switched variant rates was seen for both tandem repeats and high/low GC regions. For low complexity regions and low mappability regions, the results were more mixed, and long read integration even increased switched variant rates for certain levels of coverage. Based on this, integrating Nanopore Ultra-long reads at low coverage (∼10×) could be beneficial to improve contiguity and phase repetitive regions more accurately (Figure <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2I</xref>).</p>

      <title>BLR compares favorably to Long Ranger on 10× Genomics linked reads</title>
      <p>While 10× Genomics linked-read technology is no longer commercially available, there are many genomic datasets in the public domain with more still being released (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 9</xref>). All could benefit from an improved pipeline for reference-based haplotyping. To assess how well BLR compares to the 10× Genomics Long Ranger pipeline, we downloaded a NA12878 dataset from the 10× Genomics webpage that had been run through Long Ranger (version 2.2.1). The same 10× Genomics sequencing reads were processed through the BLR pipeline.</p>
      <p>Comparing coverage, insert size and inferred molecule lengths, BLR and Long Ranger produce similar results (Table <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). The number of reads per molecule was higher for BLR at an N50 of 67 compared to 44 for Long Ranger (Table <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Looking at the phasing statistics, BLR phased almost all (∼99.9%) of SNVs versus 99.5% for Long Ranger (Table <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). BLR also generated considerably longer phase blocks (Figure <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3A and B</xref>) with an N50 of 40.0 Mb (GATK) and 24.2 (DeepVariant) compared to 10.1 Mb for Long Ranger. Switch errors were benchmarked against the GIAB NA12878 benchmark set (v.4.2.1). Rates were low (&lt;0.05%) for both pipelines although BLR run with GAKT generated slightly higher rates similar to the runs on DBS data (Table <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Correcting for errors, the phasing generated by BLR using DeepVariant was still more continuous than Long Ranger with a QN50 of 6.3 compared to 5.1 (Figure <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3A</xref> and <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">C</xref>, Table <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">2</xref>).</p>

      <p>To compare SV calls from Long Ranger to the BLR NAIBR calls, NAIBR was also run on the Long Ranger phased BAM. Long Ranger uses different algorithms for SVs larger than 30 kb and deletions smaller than 30 kb, so the comparison was done separately for these intervals. After filtering 577–647 deletions remained in the 1 to 30 kb range while 15–25 remained above 30 kb (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 7</xref>). Good agreement was observed for both ranges with about 50% of deletions being shared across the compared callsets (Figure <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3D</xref>).</p>
      <p>For completion, Aquila (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>) was also used to analyze the same 10× Genomics dataset. Compared to both BLR and Long Ranger, the phasing generated by Aquila was less continuous (Figure <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3B</xref> and <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">C</xref>) with both N50 and QN50 at around 0.7 Mb (Table <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Structural variants were compared against NAIBR and Long Ranger calls along with PBSV calls on PacBio HiFi reads to evaluate the insertions called by Aquila (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 10</xref>). Overlap between Aquila calls and other tools were in general poor with overlap scores of 22.6–25.7% for deletions and 22.9% for insertions compared to PBSV calls. The poor performance can likely be explained by low coverage as the genome fraction covered by the Aquila assembly was only 64.1% (H1) and 63.4% (H2) for the respective haplotypes.</p>

      <title>BLR enables haplotyping of TELL-Seq and stLFR linked reads</title>
      <p>BLR is also able to process linked reads from other technologies such as TELL-Seq and stLFR. To investigate the performance of BLR on data generated with these technologies we ran two samples included in the original publication for the respective technology (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>).</p>
      <p>For TELL-Seq, we downloaded and processed a library generated from the NA24384 genome. Comparing BLR to the data presented by Chen <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>), the results are mostly similar (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 8</xref>). Using BLR with GATK calls again yielded longer phase blocks than DeepVariant but with considerably higher switch error rates (Figure <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3E</xref>). Looking at the switch-corrected lengths, the DeepVariant phasing can be considered more accurate with a QN50 of 3.8 Mb compared to 2.1 for GATK (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 8</xref>). Compared to the result reported by Chen <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> the BLR DeepVariant phasing had only a slightly shorter N50 at 7.8 versus 13.4 Mb but about half the switch error rate (Figure <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3E</xref>).</p>
      <p>For stLFR, we downloaded dataset stLFR-1 corresponding to individual NA12878 and ran it through the BLR workflow. Comparing the BLR results to those presented by Wang <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>), most stats are similar (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 9</xref>). Phase block lengths were similar between the workflows with an N50 of around 30 Mb (Figure <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3F</xref>). Switch error rates were higher for BLR at ∼0.6% compared to Wang <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> with 0.25% and 0.20% for short and long errors respectively (Figure <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3F</xref>).</p>

      <title>Diverse properties of linked read platforms unveiled with BLR</title>
      <p>Due to its ability to manage several linked-read technologies, BLR facilitates the evaluation of diverse technologies using a standardized workflow. Although there is a lack of linked read data from the same sample material, datasets on HG002 generated using DBS, 10× Genomics, TELL-Seq and stLFR linked reads exist. These datasets were run through BLR, mapping to GRCh38 and calling variants with DeepVariant. Note that the dataset for DBS and TELL-Seq are the same as presented above. Phasing was evaluated against the latest GIAB benchmark (v4.2.1). Coverage was similar around a median of 40X with DBS being slightly higher (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 11a</xref>). Multiple properties varied greatly with different technologies (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 11b to 11f</xref>). Molecule length (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplemental Figure 11b</xref>) is largely dependent on the DNA integrity and was shortest for DBS with stLFR and 10× Genomics having the longest. Of all technologies, 10× Genomics had the highest molecule coverage (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 11c</xref>), molecules per barcodes (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 11d</xref>) and insert size (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 11e</xref>). A distinctly left-leaning insert size distribution was noted for both TELL-Seq and stLFR (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 11e</xref>). This might be suboptimal as read pairs overlap the same bases for short inserts thus not providing additional information. GC bias plots showed a drop in coverage for high and low GC, with DBS having the lowest coverage in these regions followed by TELL-Seq and 10× Genomics (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 11f</xref>). Reduced coverage at high GC was also observed for stLFR, in low GC regions coverage was instead increased. Comparing phase block lengths before (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 11g</xref>) and after (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 11h</xref>) switch correction they largely correlate with molecule length.</p>

    <title>Discussion</title>
    <p>In this work, we present BLR as an analysis pipeline to haplotype resolve genomes through linked-read sequencing. Unlike other pipelines, BLR natively runs on sequencing data from multiple technologies, including DBS, 10× Genomics, TELL-Seq and stLFR. BLR also integrates several linked-read-specific software such as EMA into a flexible open-source pipeline.</p>
    <p>Benchmarking BLR on DBS data for different variant callers we show that DeepVariant calls generated the lowest number of switch errors and the best overall phasing. Including FreeBayes or GATK INDELs in phasing caused overinflation of phasing, likely due to their lower INDEL precision compared to DeepVariant. In our high-coverage DBS dataset, we showed that BLR generates highly continuous phasing while maintaining low (&lt;1%) switch error rates. In fact, most (98.6%) of the GIAB-phased protein-coding genes matched the phasing in the high-coverage dataset, including the highly polymorphic HLA genes. Evaluating structural variant calls we show that a majority of deletions match those found in the HG002-HPRC reference. Comparing diploid assembly using PacBio HiFi reads we found that BLR produced considerably longer phase blocks when correcting for switch errors. Evaluating phasing for genomic context we saw enrichment for switched variants in low complexity, low mappability and repeat regions. Levels were however still below diploid assembly using Hifiasm. We further show that integrating low-coverage Nanopore data can be a way to both increase phasing contiguity and reduce switch errors in tandem repeats. Furthermore, we compared BLR to Long Ranger on 10× Genomics data, where BLR generated longer phase blocks while maintaining low switch errors. Similarly, BLR generated longer or similar phase block sizes and low switch error rates when run on TELL-Seq and stLFR linked reads. Finally, we use BLR to show the diverse properties of different linked read platforms.</p>
    <p>There are several improvements to consider in the continual development of BLR. While both large SVs and short variants are called in the pipeline, structural variants in the ‘lower’ (∼50–1000 bp) size range are missed. This range could be covered by the integration of an additional SV caller, such as Manta or LinkedSV that demonstrated good performance in this range. In addition, some of the default parameters might need tuning to run optimally for different linked-read technologies. Pipeline steps could also be modified to integrate new or replace existing software as these are validated. For example, other phasing tools could be considered instead of HapCUT2 such as HapTree-X (<xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>) or SpecHap (<xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>). Furthermore, novel linked-read technologies, such as Haplotagging (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>), need to be integrated as they mature. While there are many avenues for improvements, BLR as an open-source workflow can benefit from contributions from the entire linked-read community.</p>

      <title>Abstract</title>
      <p>Linked-read sequencing promises a one-method approach for genome-wide insights including single nucleotide variants (SNVs), structural variants, and haplotyping. We introduce Barcode Linked Reads (BLR), an open-source haplotyping pipeline capable of handling millions of barcodes and data from multiple linked-read technologies including DBS, 10× Genomics, TELL-seq and stLFR. Running BLR on DBS linked-reads yielded megabase-scale phasing with low (&lt;0.2%) switch error rates. Of 13616 protein-coding genes phased in the GIAB benchmark set (v4.2.1), 98.6% matched the BLR phasing. In addition, large structural variants showed concordance with HPRC-HG002 reference assembly calls. Compared to diploid assembly with PacBio HiFi reads, BLR phasing was more continuous when considering switch errors. We further show that integrating long reads at low coverage (∼10×) can improve phasing contiguity and reduce switch errors in tandem repeats. When compared to Long Ranger on 10× Genomics data, BLR showed an increase in phase block N50 with low switch-error rates. For TELL-Seq and stLFR linked reads, BLR generated longer or similar phase block lengths and low switch error rates compared to results presented in the original publications. In conclusion, BLR provides a flexible workflow for comprehensive haplotype analysis of linked reads from multiple platforms.</p>

    <title>Introduction</title>
    <p>The immense growth of massively parallel sequencing technologies in the last decade has contributed to a deeper understanding of genetic variations. Arguably, the most successful platform has been short-read sequencing combining high accuracy and throughput with a low cost per base. The biggest flaw of this platform is the limited field of view these reads provide. In a haplotype context, the short read length fails to fully capture the cumulative impact of both structural variants (SVs) and short variants such as single nucleotide variants (SNVs) (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Methods like Hi-C (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>) and Strand-seq (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>) have leveraged short reads to gain chromosome-scale insights but they fall short in terms of phasing completeness (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>) and when mapping to difficult regions such as repeats (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Long-read sequencing has shown some promise for haplotyping (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8–10</xref>), especially in a hybrid approach with Hi-C or Strand-seq (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Accurate long reads such as PacBio HiFi have also enabled diploid assembly as a reference-free approach for haplotyping (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12–16</xref>). These strategies are however expensive, laborious and require copious input material. One of the most viable solutions is the use of linked-read sequencing. Here, short subsections of long genomic DNA (gDNA) molecules are linked with a shared barcode, thus enabling computational reconstruction of the original molecule following short-read sequencing. Linked reads thereby retain long-range genetic information without compromising single-base accuracy.</p>
    <p>Several linked-read solutions have been reported in recent years. The methods rely on different strategies for compartmentalization. In this context, compartmentalization refers to the creation of physically or virtually isolated compartments wherein subsections of one-or-more long gDNA molecules are assigned to a unique barcode. Among these methods, CPT-seq (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>) employs the split-and-pool tagging strategy while CPT-seqv2 (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>), TELL-Seq (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>), stLFR (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>) and Haplotagging (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>) use Tn5-loaded barcoded beads to generate virtual compartments. A third strategy is compartmentalization through emulsion droplets employed by 10× Genomics (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>) and the DBS method introduced by Redin <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). All these linked-read methods offer numerous insights that usually are lost or difficult to obtain using conventional short-read technologies. Notably, they excel in revealing intricate details regarding structural variations, copy number variations and combinatorial SNV effects. It has also been shown that linked reads can enhance coverage in difficult regions (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>), which was recently used to improve upon genome benchmarks (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>).</p>
    <p>To uncover these genetic variations from linked reads, reference-based haplotype analysis can be applied. However, available linked-read specific pipelines come with several limitations. For example, the otherwise popular Long Ranger pipeline (<ext-link xlink:href="https://github.com/10XGenomics/longranger" ext-link-type="uri">https://github.com/10×Genomics/longranger</ext-link>) was primarily developed for 10× Genomics linked-read technology, which is currently commercially discontinued. Their method differs from other linked-read technologies in multiple important aspects. For example, the number of compartments generated by 10× Genomics is generally around a million, while other technologies like TELL-Seq and stLFR generate what corresponds to 10 million or more compartments. 10× Genomics is also the only technology not relying on tagmentation in library production. While Long Ranger is used in downstream analysis of other linked-read technologies (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>), this requires computationally translated barcodes. Aquila (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>) provides an alternative approach to haplotype analysis by doing reference-guided assembly and takes both 10× Genomics and TELL-seq linked reads, while its related pipeline Aquila_stLFR (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>) enables stLFR input. Other pipelines (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19–21</xref>) such as TELL-Read/TELL-Sort for TELL-Seq data, are single-purpose tools, often without proper workflow management (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>), each designed for their specific technology. Although most of these pipelines are open-access, they cannot be easily adapted to orthogonal linked-read technologies. They also lack the integration of novel tools for linked-read analysis such as Emerald (EMA) (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>).</p>
    <p>Apart from the lack of a flexible analysis pipeline for multiple technologies, access to high molecular weight (HMW) gDNA is considered a prerequisite for practical linked-read employment (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). Indeed, longer gDNA input has been shown to improve phasing completeness (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). However, this requirement may not be met in all studies as the gDNA might be degraded or otherwise hard to extract without damage. In addition, most linked-read methods are fundamentally limited in their resolution, where a typical assay assigns multiple independent DNA molecules to a single barcode (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22–24</xref>). The resolution could be improved to e.g. single molecule, but this would require running several reactions to achieve similar coverage with added costs thereto. In addition, the resulting increase in the number of barcodes might prohibit analysis using existing pipelines such as Long Ranger. Optimally, a linked-read method of choice should be affordable, not require specialized equipment, not necessitate the use of extreme HMW gDNA and simultaneously be a feasible solution for producing single-molecule resolution barcodes. Although several of the solutions that are available today would be capable of meeting these targets, the spread has been hampered by practical limitations relating to cost, scalability, or a combination of these.</p>
    <p>Here we present Barcode Linked Reads (BLR, <ext-link xlink:href="https://github.com/AfshinLab/BLR" ext-link-type="uri">https://github.com/AfshinLab/BLR</ext-link>), an open-source haplotyping pipeline capable of handling both millions of barcodes and data from multiple linked-read technologies, including 10× Genomics, TELL-Seq and stLFR. The pipeline implements several linked-read optimized software in interchangeable modules, rendering it a universal platform for haplotype analysis of linked reads. In addition, we utilize the unique combined aspects of our DBS technology (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>) with respect to cost, scalability and flexibility as an alternative linked-read technology to haplotype resolve the entire human genome.</p>

      <title>BLR pipeline</title>
      <p>The BLR pipeline workflow can be broken down into several steps as outlined in Figure <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. The pipeline is implemented using Snakemake (v6.4.1) (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>) as a workflow manager and packaged as a Python command-line tool. Conda is used for dependencies management. The pipeline integrates multiple published software as well as pipeline-specific scripts into the same Python package that are available as subcommands, e.g. ‘blr tagfastq’. In some steps, different tools can be used interchangeably for flexibility. For example, mapping can be done using BWA-MEM instead of EMA. The tools outlined below represent the current defaults and are subject to change as optimization continues and new software is released.</p>

          <p>Overview of the BLR pipeline workflow. On the left, selected steps are visualized from the aspect of aligned reads. On the right, the flowchart outlines all steps from input FASTQs to final outputs. Within the flowchart, major processing steps are shown in gray with substeps outlined to the right. For each substep, the software used is indicated in parenthesis. FASTQs are first processed according to their linked-read technology to generate barcoded FASTQs. The barcoded reads are aligned to a reference genome, sorted and indexed to yield an initial BAM file. To parallelize processing, the barcode-tagged alignments are split over chromosomes for the remaining steps. First, overlapping barcodes are collapsed, then duplicates are marked. Molecule information is assigned to alignments and used to filter out high molecule count barcodes. This yields a filtered BAM file that is used for short variant calling. The short variants are then filtered and used in phasing to generate a phased VCF. The phased VCF is then used with the filtered BAM to assign the alignments to a haplotype yielding a phased BAM. This is in turn used to call large structural variants (SVs). Throughout the pipeline, useful statistics and data are collected that are compiled into a MultiQC report.</p>
        </caption>
        <graphic xlink:href="gkad1010fig1" position="float"/>
      </fig>
      <p>For any BLR run, the subcommand ‘blr init’ initializes a working directory with the FASTQs and configurations. Configuration parameters can then be updated using ‘blr config’. Finally, the pipeline is started using ‘blr run’ which runs the workflow from start to finish.</p>
      <p>In the first step of BLR, FASTQs from sequencing are processed to extract and correct the barcode sequences. The adapter-trimmed inserts are then labeled with their corresponding corrected barcode sequence in the FASTQ header. This first step depends on the technology used for generating the linked-read library (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>). FastQC (<ext-link xlink:href="https://github.com/s-andrews/FastQC" ext-link-type="uri">https://github.com/s-andrews/FastQC</ext-link>, v0.11.9) is used for quality control of trimmed reads from all technologies.</p>
      <p>For DBS libraries, the barcode sequences are extracted from read1 using Cutadapt (v2.5) (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). The sequences are corrected by clustering using starcode (v1.4) (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>) with options ‘-d 2 -r 5’. Adaptor sequences are trimmed from read1 and 2 using Cutadapt and the reads are subsequently tagged with the corrected barcode using the subcommand ‘blr tagfastq’.</p>
      <p>For 10× Genomics libraries, the preprocessing is performed using EMA (v0.6.2) (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). EMA extracts the barcode sequence from the reads and corrects the barcode using a provided barcode whitelist to any sequence within a Hamming distance of one.</p>
      <p>For TELL-Seq libraries, barcodes were corrected as described by Wang <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>) and implemented as the subcommand ‘blr correctbc’. In brief, unique barcode sequences were counted and singleton barcodes (with a count of one) are corrected to any remaining barcode with multiple counts that is within a Hamming distance of one. Reads belonging to singleton barcodes with conflicting matches to sequences with multiple counts are removed. Additionally, any reads assigned to a barcode not matching the pattern NNHNNYRNNNNYRNNHNN (IUPAC notation) are also discarded. Adaptor sequences are trimmed from each read pair using Cutadapt and the reads are subsequently tagged with the corrected barcode using ‘blr tagfastq’.</p>
      <p>For stLFR libraries, FASTQs containing the corrected barcode's numerical indices in the header are used as input. Reads are first trimmed to remove possible 3′ adaptors using Cutadapt. Since EMA requires FASTQs to be tagged with a canonical DNA string, these barcode indexes (e.g. ‘#473_1282_95’) are converted to unique 16 nucleotide IUPAC barcode sequences using ‘blr process_stlfr’. These sequences are then used to tag the adaptor-trimmed reads.</p>
      <p>In the next step, barcode-tagged reads are aligned to a reference genome using EMA. This also moves the barcode from the read header to the BX tag. The output BAM is sorted and indexed using samtools (v1.12) (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). The sorted BAM is then split by chromosomes to allow for parallel processing. First, barcode multiplets are collapsed by looking for barcodes sharing two identical insert positions within a defined window (in this study a 30 kb window was used except for 10× where we used 50 kb) using ‘blr find_clusterdups’. Positions with excessively high barcode counts are excluded to avoid collapsing unconnected barcodes. Next, duplicates within barcodes are marked using picard (<ext-link xlink:href="https://github.com/broadinstitute/picard" ext-link-type="uri">https://github.com/broadinstitute/picard</ext-link>, v2.26.2) using options ‘READ_ONE_BARCODE_TAG = BX READ_TWO_BARCODE_TAG = BX’. Following this, the molecules of origin are inferred from the aligned reads within each barcode by grouping reads within a defined sliding window using ‘blr buildmolecules’. Only molecules containing four or more reads are kept and for these multiple statistics are collected. To avoid having molecules overlapping the same region, barcodes carrying too many molecules (current threshold set to 260 molecules) are filtered out using ‘blr filterclusters’. Multiple statistics and quality metrics are collected using mosdepth (v0.3.2) (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>), samtools, picard and custom Python scripts.</p>
      <p>Next, short variants (&lt;50 bp) are called from the processed and filtered BAMs using either GATK HaplotypeCaller (v4.2.1) (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>), DeepVariant (v1.3.0) (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>) or FreeBayes (v1.3.5) (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). These variants are then split into SNVs and INDELs and filtered. For GATK calls, the thresholds used for SNVs were QUAL &lt;15, MQRankSum &gt;6.0 and AF &lt;0.15, while for INDELs QUAL &lt;15, MQRankSum &gt;6.0 and AF &lt;0.25 was used. For DeepVariant and FreeBayes calls were only filtered based on quality using threshold QUAL &lt;15 for both SNVs and INDELs. These variant calls are then phased using HapCUT2 (v1.3.2) (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Specifically heterozygous variants were extracted using the ‘extractHairs’ command with options ‘–realign_variants 1 –10 × 1’. These variants were then linked by barcode using the HapCUT2-included script ‘LinkFragments.py’. The window size (option ‘–distance’ in ‘LinkFragments.py’) used for linking variants on the same barcodes was the same that was used in ‘blr buildmolecules’. Finally, the linked variants were assembled into the phased haplotypes using the command ‘hapcut2’ with option ‘nf 1’. The phased calls are then used to assign alignments to haplotypes 1 and 2 using ‘whatshap haplotag’ (v1.1) (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). These phased alignments are finally used for structural variant calling using a modified version of NAIBR (<ext-link xlink:href="https://github.com/pontushojer/NAIBR" ext-link-type="uri">https://github.com/pontushojer/NAIBR</ext-link>, v0.4.1) (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>) with default settings. Multiple statistics are collected using WhatsHap, HapCUT2 and custom Python scripts. Finally, the statistics are compiled into a comprehensive report using a custom MultiQC (v1.11) (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>) plugin.</p>
      <p>The custom scripts were written in Python (v3.6.13) and relied heavily on the packages numpy (v1.19.5) (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>), pandas (v1.15) (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>), tqdm (v4.62.3) and pysam (v0.16.0.1) (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>).</p>

      <p>Human genomic DNA from the GM24385 cell line was obtained from the 10× Chromium Genome Kit. The consequent steps for library preparation were carried out in the same way as detailed by Redin <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>), with few disclosed exceptions. For every single molecule (SM) library, a total of 500 pg HMW gDNA was used for the on-bead tagmentation reaction. Next, the beads carrying single DNA molecules were divided into 10 separate reactions resulting in every emulsion reaction containing only 50 pg of DNA. Following emulsion PCR, the libraries were pooled and cleaned up 4 times to remove unused barcodes. In the same way, for each multiple-molecule (MM) library, a total of 7 ng genomic DNA was used for tagmentation and 1/7th of the beads were encapsulated in emulsion droplets (i.e. 1 ng genomic DNA in each of the MM emulsion reactions). Sample enrichment, preparation of the final library (including indexing) and sequencing was done as described by Redin <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>).</p>

Long Ranger outputs the SVs in two separate VCFs which were concatenated using bcftools (v1.12) (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>). For the HG002-HPRC deletions, we used a VCF generated with DipCall from <ext-link xlink:href="https://data.nist.gov/od/ds/ark:/88434/mds2-2578/assemblies-and-benchmarking_results/HG002-HPRC.tar.gz" ext-link-type="uri">https://data.nist.gov/od/ds/ark:/88434/mds2-2578/assemblies-and-benchmarking_results/HG002-HPRC.tar.gz</ext-link>.

      <p>Additional SV calling was performed on the MM + SM dataset run with BLR/DeepVariant. LinkedSV (<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>) (<ext-link xlink:href="https://github.com/WGLab/LinkedSV" ext-link-type="uri">https://github.com/WGLab/LinkedSV</ext-link>, commit: 154ea2a) was run on the phased BAM in germline mode with options ‘-v hg38 –germline_mode –wgs’. The output from LinkedSV is multiple SV BEDPE files (*filtered_large_svcalls.bedpe, *large_cnv.bedpe, *large_cnv.bedpe) that were converted to VCF using a custom Python script (linkedsv_bedpe_to_vcf.py) and then combined using bcftools to create a single VCF for comparison. Besides LinkedSV, Manta (v1.6.0) (<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>) was also run on the phased BAM using default parameters. From the output VCF only ‘diploidSV.vcf.gz’ was used. MTG-Link (v2.4.1) (<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>) was used to call large insertions. From the Manta SV VCF, candidate large insertion sites were extracted by filtering for insertions with the LEFT_SVINSSEQ and RIGHT_SVINSSEQ INFO fields. These variants were then converted to a GFA file using the MTG-Link script ‘vcf2gfa.py’ with options ‘–contigs 10 000 -ext 50’. MTG-Link was then run with the generated GFA file following the developers’ documentation using parameters ‘-flank 10 000 -occ 2 -ext 500 -l 1 000 000 -m 1000’.

      <title>Phasing evaluation metrics</title>
      <p>To evaluate phasing multiple metrics were provided. Switch errors refer to inconsistent phasing relative to a reference haplotype and are normally reported in two classes as short and long switch errors respectively. Short switch errors denote errors where one position has been flipped while long switch errors require multiple positions in a row. Their rate is reported as the fraction of all positions available for switch errors. Phase block length was reported as Nx curves which shows what percentage of the total haplotype assembly is covered by phase blocks of a certain length or longer. Note that at 50% of the total haplotype length, we get the N50 metric. We also report the area under the Nx curve as auN as this provides a more stable metric for contiguity than N50. We further report switch-corrected phase block lengths in the form of QNx curves and corresponding QN50 and auQN values. For this, we account for switch errors in the phase blocks by splitting them at switch locations to get the block lengths that were correctly phased.</p>

Phased variants were only evaluated on chromosome 1 for simplicity. RTGtools was used to compare and extract variants marked as true positives relative to the GIAB benchmark (v4.2.1). Variants involved in switch errors were identified using WhatsHap (v1.7) with command ‘compare’ (parameter ‘–switch-error-bed’) comparing to the same GIAB benchmark.

      <title>Structural variant analysis</title>
      <p>For the analysis of structural variants, we developed a separate workflow called lsvtool (<ext-link xlink:href="https://github.com/AfshinLab/lsvtool" ext-link-type="uri">https://github.com/AfshinLab/lsvtool</ext-link>, v0.1) to facilitate common clustering, filtering and integration of SV calls from different sources. The workflow was implemented as a Snakemake workflow wrapped as a Python package. The starting point is VCF files with SV calls from which calls that pass filters and match the desired SV type are kept. Overlapping SV calls within each dataset were collapsed using truvari (v3.1.0) (<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>) with the subcommand ‘collapse’ and parameters ‘–chain –pctsim 0 –pctovl 0.8 –pctsize 0.8 –refdist 2000’. SVs were then filtered against a blacklist and for the desired size interval using SURVIVOR (v1.0.7) (<xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>). Calls with both breakpoints within 20 kb of segmental duplications were also removed using a custom Python script. Overlapping calls between different sample sources were assessed using SURVIVOR. Calls were considered to be overlapping if both breakpoints were within an interval corresponding to 10% of the total length of the SV. Blacklists and segmental duplications were downloaded from the 10× Genomics webpage (<ext-link xlink:href="https://support.10xgenomics.com/genome-exome/software/pipelines/latest/advanced/reference" ext-link-type="uri">https://support.10×genomics.com/genome-exome/software/pipelines/latest/advanced/reference</ext-link>). The blacklist was expanded by 10 kb using bedtools (v2.30.0) (<xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>) to remove proximal calls. Venn diagrams were created using R (v4.1.3) with VennDiagram (v1.7.3). Overlap scores were calculated as the ratio between the number of SVs in the intersect and the number of SVs in the smallest of the compared sets. For comparisons with a reference set, matching calls are counted as true positives (TP). Non-matching calls belonging to the query set are counted as false positives (FP) and those belonging to the reference set are counted as false negatives (FN). From this, recall is calculated as TP / (TP + FP), precision as TP / (TP + FN) and the F1 score is 2 * ((recall * precision) / (recall + precision)).</p>

      <title>Method description</title>
      <p>We have developed a referenced-based analysis pipeline called BLR (Figure <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) and continued development of the DBS method (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 2</xref>). The pipeline can run data from the DBS method and from other linked-read methods such as 10× Genomics (GemCode or Chromium Genome), stLFR and TELL-Seq. Preprocessing of the input FASTQs prior to mapping is dependent on the linked-read technology since they vary in read structure and barcoding approach (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>). In the case of DBS, the technology makes use of degenerate barcodes which are extracted from read 1 (see Methods for the other technologies). Each DNA barcode is corrected by clustering barcode sequences within a defined edit distance using a message-passing algorithm (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). The reads are then trimmed to remove adaptors, and the corrected barcode is tagged to the read-pair of origin. The barcode-tagged reads are then aligned to a reference genome using the barcode-aware mapper EMA (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). Following alignment, reads are split by chromosome to speed up downstream processing. In the DBS technique, it is possible to encapsulate two or more barcodes in one droplet. This phenomenon has also been observed in 10× Genomics droplet generation (<xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>). To address this issue, the barcodes with overlapping read sets are collapsed and duplicate reads are marked within each barcode. The molecules are inferred for each barcode by splitting read pairs whose pairwise distance exceeds a defined threshold into separate molecules. To avoid molecules covering overlapping genomic regions within a barcode, barcodes with an excessive number of molecules are removed. This is followed by short variant calling using either GATK HaplotypeCaller(38), DeepVariant(39), or FreeBayes(40). Variants were then filtered to yield a set of high-quality heterozygous variants. The heterozygous short variants are phased using HapCUT2 (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). The phased variants are then used to assign haplotypes back to the mapped reads using WhatsHap (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Finally, using the phased reads, structural variants are called using NAIBR (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). At various points, a number of quality metrics and statistics are collected and compiled into a comprehensive report (example in <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 3</xref>) based on MultiQC (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>).</p>

      <title>BLR generates highly continuous and accurate phasing on DBS data</title>
      <p>We first evaluated the BLR pipeline on linked reads generated by the DBS method. By lowering the amount of gDNA per reaction and running multiple parallel reactions we were able to generate linked-read libraries with single-molecule (SM) resolution. For comparison, we also generated libraries containing multiple molecules (MM) per droplet, similar to Redin <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). Three SM libraries and two MM libraries were generated using gDNA corresponding to Genome in a Bottle (GIAB) reference genome HG002 (NA24385). Despite the slightly degraded quality of the obtained gDNA for this genome, we proceeded due to its benchmarking utility (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>). These libraries were run separately through the BLR pipeline using reference genome GRCh38 and then merged to form the MM and SM datasets at 23× and 21× median coverage respectively (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). We also merged these to form a high-coverage (44×) MM + SM dataset (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 1</xref>).</p>
      <p>We first benchmarked different variant callers that are currently integrated into BLR on the MM + SM dataset. Calls from DeepVariant, FreeBayes, and GATK on chromosome 1 were evaluated against the GIAB benchmark set (v4.2.1) (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>) using hap.py (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). DeepVariant demonstrated superior performance across SNPs and INDELs, achieving F1 scores of 98.3% and 88.4% respectively. Furthermore, when focusing on heterozygous calls, which play a crucial role in haplotype phasing, DeepVariant once again outperformed other methods with the highest precision (99.4% for SNPs and 99.3% for INDELs) and F1 scores (97.7% for SNPs and 89.0% for INDELs). Compared to SNPs, INDELs generally scored lower and were also observed to be 3–6 times less frequent. The relatively low frequency of INDELs may limit their impact on phasing. Consequently, we chose to exclude INDELs to conduct a comparative analysis of their impact on phasing. The majority of heterozygous calls were successfully phased across the variant callers, irrespective of whether INDELs were included or excluded (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 3</xref>). GATK and FreeBayes with INDELs included produced the longest phase blocks at N50 of 24.2 Mb and 18.5 Mb respectively compared to ∼4 Mb for the other conditions (Figure <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2A</xref>, <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 3</xref>). Switch error rates (SER) were low (0.01–0.12%) with DeepVariant having the lowest across variant callers. Including INDELs increased switch errors, especially the short SER which increased by more than double. To obtain a more comprehensive measure of phasing completeness, we evaluated the effect of switch errors on phase block length by splitting phase blocks at switch positions (Figure <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2B</xref>). The result showed that the highly continuous phasing created using GATK and FreeBayes calls with INDELs was largely inflated. The switch-corrected block lengths when using DeepVariant or only SNP calls much better represented the assembled block lengths. Repetitive regions remain a challenge for accurate phasing (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). We therefore stratified these haplotype phasings across various difficult genomic regions to look for enrichments in switch errors (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 4</xref>). Overall, switch errors were more common in repetitive regions such as segmental duplications and tandem repeats. Compared to the other variant callers, DeepVariant calls generated fewer switch errors in these regions. One exception is when including INDELs for tandem repeats where FreeBayes only had 0.22% switched variants compared to 0.47% for DeepVariant. Based on these benchmarks we selected DeepVariant calls with INDELs for phasing the full datasets, while also providing phasing-inflating GATK calls for a reference.</p>

Furthermore, duplicate rates were higher for the SM dataset compared to MM (Table <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).

      <p>Because of the rather modest coverage of the MM and SM datasets we combined both to generate a high-coverage dataset MM + SM with a median of 44X coverage (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 5a</xref>). The added depth was reflected in the increased phase block length (Figure <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2C</xref>) to an N50 of 4.4 Mb with DeepVariant and 24.8 Mb with GATK (Table <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). This increase in phasing contiguity was also accompanied by lower SER, dropping from 0.146–0.196% to 0.103–0.109% for GATK and from 0.031–0.074% to 0.027–0.051% for DeepVariant (Table <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Looking at switch-corrected phase blocks (Figure <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2D</xref>), DeepVariant calls again generated more continuous and accurate phasing with a QN50 of 2.15 Mb compared to GATK at 1.52 Mb. This reaffirms the benchmarking finding that running BLR with GATK calls might generate spurious phasing.</p>
      <p>To validate the usefulness of the phasing, we evaluated phasing across all protein-coding genes in the MM + SM high-coverage dataset. We used the GIAB benchmark set (v4.2.1) and Ensembl (release 106) gene annotations for reference. A protein-coding gene was considered phased if it contained at least two phased SNPs which left 13616 genes phased out of a total of 19054 in the benchmark set. For these phased genes we observed a high level of agreement with the GIAB benchmark set (Figure <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2E</xref>). In the DBS MM + SM dataset with DeepVariant calls, 98.6% (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 13 426) were phased without switch errors. Accurate phasing is particularly important for highly polymorphous regions such as the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) region. Looking at the 19 HLA genes we found that of the 15 genes phased in GIAB (including HLA-A, -B, -C), all were phased without errors in the MM + SM set (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 4</xref>).</p>
      <p>BLR also performs SV calling using NAIBR which calls deletions, inversions and duplications from about 500 bp and upwards. To compare calls, we developed lsvtool that can filter, select and compare SVs from multiple sources (see Methods for details). From 1213–2312 initial calls from NAIBR, 731–947 calls remained after processing with lsvtool (Table <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Comparing calls between MM + SM and the two low-coverage datasets showed good overlap (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 6</xref>). Calls consisted mostly of deletions with a few large (&gt;10 kb) inversions and duplications (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 6a and b</xref>). Therefore, we focused on deletion calls. To validate the DBS MM + SM SV deletions we compared them against calls from PacBio and 10× Genomics. Deletions from the HPRC reference assembly of HG002 (<xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>) were additionally included as a benchmark set. Overlap was generally good between the datasets and the majority of DBS deletions matched HPRC (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 6c and d</xref>). Quantifying this overlap using HPRC as the reference set the precision was acceptable at 0.59–0.60 for the DBS dataset while the recall was considerably lower at 0.34 compared to 0.48 for 10× Genomics and 0.61 for PacBio (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 5</xref>). Looking at the size distribution, most calls below 1kb were from PacBio and HPRC while 10× Genomics had the majority of calls above 100 kb (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 6e</xref>). Deletions were therefore further limited to the range of 1 to 100 kb since this would yield a fairer comparison with all datasets adequately represented. In this range most deletions were matched between datasets (Figure <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2F</xref>) and both precision (0.84–0.86) and recall (0.64) were improved for the DBS dataset (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 5</xref>).</p>
      <p>For calling SVs, multiple tools are available besides NAIBR that utilize linked-read information (<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,<xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59–63</xref>), many of which can be run directly from BLR output. To further benchmark the NAIBR calls, we called SVs using LinkedSV (<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>) and short-read caller Manta (<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>) on the DBS MM + SM dataset phased with DeepVariant calls. Calls were stratified by length and scored against the HPRC reference set (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 7a</xref>). PacBio PBSV and 10× Genomics Long Ranger were also included for comparison. Although NAIBR allows calling deletions below 1kb, there is a high drop in recall and precision for calls in this range. Manta and LinkedSV scored much better below 1kb, even outperforming the PacBio calls in precision. Deletions called by PacBio however had the highest recall up to around 10kb. Above 10kb, calls were relatively few resulting in big fluctuations in precision and recall for all callers. Looking at F1 Score, linked-read based callers NAIBR and Long Ranger (on 10× Genomics data) generally performed best in this range as compared to the short-read caller Manta.</p>
      <p>Linked reads also enable the calling of large insertions (<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>,<xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>,<xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>). To showcase this application, we utilized the fact that the Manta SV caller is able to identify sites for putative large insertions. These sites were used as input to MTG-Link that reconstructs the insertion using local assembly of linked reads connected to the particular site (<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>). From 321 candidate sites, 80 large insertions could be identified. Out of these insertions 54 (67.5%) matched PacBio PBSV calls and 57 (71.3%) matched insertions from the HPRC reference set (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 7b</xref>). Similarly for the Manta called insertions a majority (83.6–84.8%) of calls overlapped with the external sets. Looking at the size distribution (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 7c</xref>), MTG-Link was able to resolve calls within a wider range than Manta, with the longest MTG-Link insertion verified by the HPRC set being 975 bp. While this approach enables detection of longer insertions, the majority of calls are missed as compared to PacBio.</p>

      <title>Integration of DBS linked reads with low-coverage long reads improves haplotype phasing</title>
      <p>The introduction of accurate long-read sequencing, primarily in the form of PacBio HiFi reads, has enabled the generation of diploid assemblies as an alternative approach to haplotyping (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12–16</xref>). We therefore compared the reference-based phasing generated by BLR to a recent diploid assembly of HG002 using Hifiasm (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>) (v0.16.1) on PacBio HiFi reads (30×). At 30× coverage the cost for PacBio HiFi library preparation and sequencing is significantly higher compared to BLR, even if including the latest PacBio Revio instrument (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 6</xref>). For the comparison, we used the DBS MM + SM dataset using DeepVariant calls and limited analysis to chromosome 1. The phased contigs of the Hifiasm assembly were more continuous compared to the BLR phase blocks (Figure <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2G</xref>) with N50 of 70.2 and 67.0 Mb for haplotypes 1 and 2. Conversely, the long switch error rate was more than ten times higher than BLR (0.03%) at 0.39% for Hifiasm. This resulted in considerably lower contiguity than BLR when correcting for switch errors (Figure <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2H</xref>). Stratifying the Hifiasm phasing, the rate of switched variants was only moderately elevated for difficult regions (Figure <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2I</xref>). The rate was still considerably higher compared to BLR which had rates closer to the HG002-HPRC reference assembly (<xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>).</p>
      <p>Despite DBS generating a more accurate phasing of HG002 compared to Hifiasm, switch rates were considerably elevated in low mappability, low complexity (segmental duplications and self-chain regions), and tandem repeat regions. We hypothesized that a hybrid phasing approach with low coverage long reads could be a more cost-effective way to improve switch rates in some of these regions (see <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 6</xref> for a cost comparison for different sequencing technologies). Therefore, we integrated publicly available long-read data from HG002 with our DBS MM + SM data for variant phasing, employing the DeepVariant calls. We integrated both relatively short (∼20 kb) but accurate PacBio HiFi reads and longer (&gt;100 kb) but low base-quality Nanopore Ultra-long reads (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 8a</xref>). The limited length of the PacBio HiFi reads did not provide any significant improvements in phasing contiguity on integration compared to just using DBS data (Figure <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2G</xref>, <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 8b and c</xref>). Integration of Nanopore Ultra-long reads however increased contiguity considerably, even at the lowest (5×) coverage. Looking at the genome stratifications (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 8d</xref>) a coverage-linked reduction in switched variant rates was seen for both tandem repeats and high/low GC regions. For low complexity regions and low mappability regions, the results were more mixed, and long read integration even increased switched variant rates for certain levels of coverage. Based on this, integrating Nanopore Ultra-long reads at low coverage (∼10×) could be beneficial to improve contiguity and phase repetitive regions more accurately (Figure <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2I</xref>).</p>

      <title>BLR compares favorably to Long Ranger on 10× Genomics linked reads</title>
      <p>While 10× Genomics linked-read technology is no longer commercially available, there are many genomic datasets in the public domain with more still being released (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 9</xref>). All could benefit from an improved pipeline for reference-based haplotyping. To assess how well BLR compares to the 10× Genomics Long Ranger pipeline, we downloaded a NA12878 dataset from the 10× Genomics webpage that had been run through Long Ranger (version 2.2.1). The same 10× Genomics sequencing reads were processed through the BLR pipeline.</p>
      <p>Comparing coverage, insert size and inferred molecule lengths, BLR and Long Ranger produce similar results (Table <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). The number of reads per molecule was higher for BLR at an N50 of 67 compared to 44 for Long Ranger (Table <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Looking at the phasing statistics, BLR phased almost all (∼99.9%) of SNVs versus 99.5% for Long Ranger (Table <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). BLR also generated considerably longer phase blocks (Figure <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3A and B</xref>) with an N50 of 40.0 Mb (GATK) and 24.2 (DeepVariant) compared to 10.1 Mb for Long Ranger. Switch errors were benchmarked against the GIAB NA12878 benchmark set (v.4.2.1). Rates were low (&lt;0.05%) for both pipelines although BLR run with GAKT generated slightly higher rates similar to the runs on DBS data (Table <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Correcting for errors, the phasing generated by BLR using DeepVariant was still more continuous than Long Ranger with a QN50 of 6.3 compared to 5.1 (Figure <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3A</xref> and <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">C</xref>, Table <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">2</xref>).</p>

      <p>To compare SV calls from Long Ranger to the BLR NAIBR calls, NAIBR was also run on the Long Ranger phased BAM. Long Ranger uses different algorithms for SVs larger than 30 kb and deletions smaller than 30 kb, so the comparison was done separately for these intervals. After filtering 577–647 deletions remained in the 1 to 30 kb range while 15–25 remained above 30 kb (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 7</xref>). Good agreement was observed for both ranges with about 50% of deletions being shared across the compared callsets (Figure <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3D</xref>).</p>
      <p>For completion, Aquila (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>) was also used to analyze the same 10× Genomics dataset. Compared to both BLR and Long Ranger, the phasing generated by Aquila was less continuous (Figure <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3B</xref> and <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">C</xref>) with both N50 and QN50 at around 0.7 Mb (Table <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Structural variants were compared against NAIBR and Long Ranger calls along with PBSV calls on PacBio HiFi reads to evaluate the insertions called by Aquila (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 10</xref>). Overlap between Aquila calls and other tools were in general poor with overlap scores of 22.6–25.7% for deletions and 22.9% for insertions compared to PBSV calls. The poor performance can likely be explained by low coverage as the genome fraction covered by the Aquila assembly was only 64.1% (H1) and 63.4% (H2) for the respective haplotypes.</p>

      <title>BLR enables haplotyping of TELL-Seq and stLFR linked reads</title>
      <p>BLR is also able to process linked reads from other technologies such as TELL-Seq and stLFR. To investigate the performance of BLR on data generated with these technologies we ran two samples included in the original publication for the respective technology (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>).</p>
      <p>For TELL-Seq, we downloaded and processed a library generated from the NA24384 genome. Comparing BLR to the data presented by Chen <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>), the results are mostly similar (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 8</xref>). Using BLR with GATK calls again yielded longer phase blocks than DeepVariant but with considerably higher switch error rates (Figure <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3E</xref>). Looking at the switch-corrected lengths, the DeepVariant phasing can be considered more accurate with a QN50 of 3.8 Mb compared to 2.1 for GATK (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 8</xref>). Compared to the result reported by Chen <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> the BLR DeepVariant phasing had only a slightly shorter N50 at 7.8 versus 13.4 Mb but about half the switch error rate (Figure <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3E</xref>).</p>
      <p>For stLFR, we downloaded dataset stLFR-1 corresponding to individual NA12878 and ran it through the BLR workflow. Comparing the BLR results to those presented by Wang <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>), most stats are similar (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 9</xref>). Phase block lengths were similar between the workflows with an N50 of around 30 Mb (Figure <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3F</xref>). Switch error rates were higher for BLR at ∼0.6% compared to Wang <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> with 0.25% and 0.20% for short and long errors respectively (Figure <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3F</xref>).</p>

      <title>Diverse properties of linked read platforms unveiled with BLR</title>
      <p>Due to its ability to manage several linked-read technologies, BLR facilitates the evaluation of diverse technologies using a standardized workflow. Although there is a lack of linked read data from the same sample material, datasets on HG002 generated using DBS, 10× Genomics, TELL-Seq and stLFR linked reads exist. These datasets were run through BLR, mapping to GRCh38 and calling variants with DeepVariant. Note that the dataset for DBS and TELL-Seq are the same as presented above. Phasing was evaluated against the latest GIAB benchmark (v4.2.1). Coverage was similar around a median of 40X with DBS being slightly higher (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 11a</xref>). Multiple properties varied greatly with different technologies (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 11b to 11f</xref>). Molecule length (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplemental Figure 11b</xref>) is largely dependent on the DNA integrity and was shortest for DBS with stLFR and 10× Genomics having the longest. Of all technologies, 10× Genomics had the highest molecule coverage (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 11c</xref>), molecules per barcodes (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 11d</xref>) and insert size (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 11e</xref>). A distinctly left-leaning insert size distribution was noted for both TELL-Seq and stLFR (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 11e</xref>). This might be suboptimal as read pairs overlap the same bases for short inserts thus not providing additional information. GC bias plots showed a drop in coverage for high and low GC, with DBS having the lowest coverage in these regions followed by TELL-Seq and 10× Genomics (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 11f</xref>). Reduced coverage at high GC was also observed for stLFR, in low GC regions coverage was instead increased. Comparing phase block lengths before (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 11g</xref>) and after (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 11h</xref>) switch correction they largely correlate with molecule length.</p>

    <title>Discussion</title>
    <p>In this work, we present BLR as an analysis pipeline to haplotype resolve genomes through linked-read sequencing. Unlike other pipelines, BLR natively runs on sequencing data from multiple technologies, including DBS, 10× Genomics, TELL-Seq and stLFR. BLR also integrates several linked-read-specific software such as EMA into a flexible open-source pipeline.</p>
    <p>Benchmarking BLR on DBS data for different variant callers we show that DeepVariant calls generated the lowest number of switch errors and the best overall phasing. Including FreeBayes or GATK INDELs in phasing caused overinflation of phasing, likely due to their lower INDEL precision compared to DeepVariant. In our high-coverage DBS dataset, we showed that BLR generates highly continuous phasing while maintaining low (&lt;1%) switch error rates. In fact, most (98.6%) of the GIAB-phased protein-coding genes matched the phasing in the high-coverage dataset, including the highly polymorphic HLA genes. Evaluating structural variant calls we show that a majority of deletions match those found in the HG002-HPRC reference. Comparing diploid assembly using PacBio HiFi reads we found that BLR produced considerably longer phase blocks when correcting for switch errors. Evaluating phasing for genomic context we saw enrichment for switched variants in low complexity, low mappability and repeat regions. Levels were however still below diploid assembly using Hifiasm. We further show that integrating low-coverage Nanopore data can be a way to both increase phasing contiguity and reduce switch errors in tandem repeats. Furthermore, we compared BLR to Long Ranger on 10× Genomics data, where BLR generated longer phase blocks while maintaining low switch errors. Similarly, BLR generated longer or similar phase block sizes and low switch error rates when run on TELL-Seq and stLFR linked reads. Finally, we use BLR to show the diverse properties of different linked read platforms.</p>
    <p>There are several improvements to consider in the continual development of BLR. While both large SVs and short variants are called in the pipeline, structural variants in the ‘lower’ (∼50–1000 bp) size range are missed. This range could be covered by the integration of an additional SV caller, such as Manta or LinkedSV that demonstrated good performance in this range. In addition, some of the default parameters might need tuning to run optimally for different linked-read technologies. Pipeline steps could also be modified to integrate new or replace existing software as these are validated. For example, other phasing tools could be considered instead of HapCUT2 such as HapTree-X (<xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>) or SpecHap (<xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>). Furthermore, novel linked-read technologies, such as Haplotagging (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>), need to be integrated as they mature. While there are many avenues for improvements, BLR as an open-source workflow can benefit from contributions from the entire linked-read community.</p>

      <title>Abstract</title>
      <p>Linked-read sequencing promises a one-method approach for genome-wide insights including single nucleotide variants (SNVs), structural variants, and haplotyping. We introduce Barcode Linked Reads (BLR), an open-source haplotyping pipeline capable of handling millions of barcodes and data from multiple linked-read technologies including DBS, 10× Genomics, TELL-seq and stLFR. Running BLR on DBS linked-reads yielded megabase-scale phasing with low (&lt;0.2%) switch error rates. Of 13616 protein-coding genes phased in the GIAB benchmark set (v4.2.1), 98.6% matched the BLR phasing. In addition, large structural variants showed concordance with HPRC-HG002 reference assembly calls. Compared to diploid assembly with PacBio HiFi reads, BLR phasing was more continuous when considering switch errors. We further show that integrating long reads at low coverage (∼10×) can improve phasing contiguity and reduce switch errors in tandem repeats. When compared to Long Ranger on 10× Genomics data, BLR showed an increase in phase block N50 with low switch-error rates. For TELL-Seq and stLFR linked reads, BLR generated longer or similar phase block lengths and low switch error rates compared to results presented in the original publications. In conclusion, BLR provides a flexible workflow for comprehensive haplotype analysis of linked reads from multiple platforms.</p>

    <title>Introduction</title>
    <p>The immense growth of massively parallel sequencing technologies in the last decade has contributed to a deeper understanding of genetic variations. Arguably, the most successful platform has been short-read sequencing combining high accuracy and throughput with a low cost per base. The biggest flaw of this platform is the limited field of view these reads provide. In a haplotype context, the short read length fails to fully capture the cumulative impact of both structural variants (SVs) and short variants such as single nucleotide variants (SNVs) (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Methods like Hi-C (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>) and Strand-seq (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>) have leveraged short reads to gain chromosome-scale insights but they fall short in terms of phasing completeness (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>) and when mapping to difficult regions such as repeats (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Long-read sequencing has shown some promise for haplotyping (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8–10</xref>), especially in a hybrid approach with Hi-C or Strand-seq (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Accurate long reads such as PacBio HiFi have also enabled diploid assembly as a reference-free approach for haplotyping (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12–16</xref>). These strategies are however expensive, laborious and require copious input material. One of the most viable solutions is the use of linked-read sequencing. Here, short subsections of long genomic DNA (gDNA) molecules are linked with a shared barcode, thus enabling computational reconstruction of the original molecule following short-read sequencing. Linked reads thereby retain long-range genetic information without compromising single-base accuracy.</p>
    <p>Several linked-read solutions have been reported in recent years. The methods rely on different strategies for compartmentalization. In this context, compartmentalization refers to the creation of physically or virtually isolated compartments wherein subsections of one-or-more long gDNA molecules are assigned to a unique barcode. Among these methods, CPT-seq (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>) employs the split-and-pool tagging strategy while CPT-seqv2 (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>), TELL-Seq (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>), stLFR (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>) and Haplotagging (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>) use Tn5-loaded barcoded beads to generate virtual compartments. A third strategy is compartmentalization through emulsion droplets employed by 10× Genomics (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>) and the DBS method introduced by Redin <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). All these linked-read methods offer numerous insights that usually are lost or difficult to obtain using conventional short-read technologies. Notably, they excel in revealing intricate details regarding structural variations, copy number variations and combinatorial SNV effects. It has also been shown that linked reads can enhance coverage in difficult regions (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>), which was recently used to improve upon genome benchmarks (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>).</p>
    <p>To uncover these genetic variations from linked reads, reference-based haplotype analysis can be applied. However, available linked-read specific pipelines come with several limitations. For example, the otherwise popular Long Ranger pipeline (<ext-link xlink:href="https://github.com/10XGenomics/longranger" ext-link-type="uri">https://github.com/10×Genomics/longranger</ext-link>) was primarily developed for 10× Genomics linked-read technology, which is currently commercially discontinued. Their method differs from other linked-read technologies in multiple important aspects. For example, the number of compartments generated by 10× Genomics is generally around a million, while other technologies like TELL-Seq and stLFR generate what corresponds to 10 million or more compartments. 10× Genomics is also the only technology not relying on tagmentation in library production. While Long Ranger is used in downstream analysis of other linked-read technologies (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>), this requires computationally translated barcodes. Aquila (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>) provides an alternative approach to haplotype analysis by doing reference-guided assembly and takes both 10× Genomics and TELL-seq linked reads, while its related pipeline Aquila_stLFR (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>) enables stLFR input. Other pipelines (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19–21</xref>) such as TELL-Read/TELL-Sort for TELL-Seq data, are single-purpose tools, often without proper workflow management (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>), each designed for their specific technology. Although most of these pipelines are open-access, they cannot be easily adapted to orthogonal linked-read technologies. They also lack the integration of novel tools for linked-read analysis such as Emerald (EMA) (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>).</p>
    <p>Apart from the lack of a flexible analysis pipeline for multiple technologies, access to high molecular weight (HMW) gDNA is considered a prerequisite for practical linked-read employment (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). Indeed, longer gDNA input has been shown to improve phasing completeness (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). However, this requirement may not be met in all studies as the gDNA might be degraded or otherwise hard to extract without damage. In addition, most linked-read methods are fundamentally limited in their resolution, where a typical assay assigns multiple independent DNA molecules to a single barcode (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22–24</xref>). The resolution could be improved to e.g. single molecule, but this would require running several reactions to achieve similar coverage with added costs thereto. In addition, the resulting increase in the number of barcodes might prohibit analysis using existing pipelines such as Long Ranger. Optimally, a linked-read method of choice should be affordable, not require specialized equipment, not necessitate the use of extreme HMW gDNA and simultaneously be a feasible solution for producing single-molecule resolution barcodes. Although several of the solutions that are available today would be capable of meeting these targets, the spread has been hampered by practical limitations relating to cost, scalability, or a combination of these.</p>
    <p>Here we present Barcode Linked Reads (BLR, <ext-link xlink:href="https://github.com/AfshinLab/BLR" ext-link-type="uri">https://github.com/AfshinLab/BLR</ext-link>), an open-source haplotyping pipeline capable of handling both millions of barcodes and data from multiple linked-read technologies, including 10× Genomics, TELL-Seq and stLFR. The pipeline implements several linked-read optimized software in interchangeable modules, rendering it a universal platform for haplotype analysis of linked reads. In addition, we utilize the unique combined aspects of our DBS technology (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>) with respect to cost, scalability and flexibility as an alternative linked-read technology to haplotype resolve the entire human genome.</p>

      <title>BLR pipeline</title>
      <p>The BLR pipeline workflow can be broken down into several steps as outlined in Figure <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. The pipeline is implemented using Snakemake (v6.4.1) (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>) as a workflow manager and packaged as a Python command-line tool. Conda is used for dependencies management. The pipeline integrates multiple published software as well as pipeline-specific scripts into the same Python package that are available as subcommands, e.g. ‘blr tagfastq’. In some steps, different tools can be used interchangeably for flexibility. For example, mapping can be done using BWA-MEM instead of EMA. The tools outlined below represent the current defaults and are subject to change as optimization continues and new software is released.</p>

          <p>Overview of the BLR pipeline workflow. On the left, selected steps are visualized from the aspect of aligned reads. On the right, the flowchart outlines all steps from input FASTQs to final outputs. Within the flowchart, major processing steps are shown in gray with substeps outlined to the right. For each substep, the software used is indicated in parenthesis. FASTQs are first processed according to their linked-read technology to generate barcoded FASTQs. The barcoded reads are aligned to a reference genome, sorted and indexed to yield an initial BAM file. To parallelize processing, the barcode-tagged alignments are split over chromosomes for the remaining steps. First, overlapping barcodes are collapsed, then duplicates are marked. Molecule information is assigned to alignments and used to filter out high molecule count barcodes. This yields a filtered BAM file that is used for short variant calling. The short variants are then filtered and used in phasing to generate a phased VCF. The phased VCF is then used with the filtered BAM to assign the alignments to a haplotype yielding a phased BAM. This is in turn used to call large structural variants (SVs). Throughout the pipeline, useful statistics and data are collected that are compiled into a MultiQC report.</p>
        </caption>
        <graphic xlink:href="gkad1010fig1" position="float"/>
      </fig>
      <p>For any BLR run, the subcommand ‘blr init’ initializes a working directory with the FASTQs and configurations. Configuration parameters can then be updated using ‘blr config’. Finally, the pipeline is started using ‘blr run’ which runs the workflow from start to finish.</p>
      <p>In the first step of BLR, FASTQs from sequencing are processed to extract and correct the barcode sequences. The adapter-trimmed inserts are then labeled with their corresponding corrected barcode sequence in the FASTQ header. This first step depends on the technology used for generating the linked-read library (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>). FastQC (<ext-link xlink:href="https://github.com/s-andrews/FastQC" ext-link-type="uri">https://github.com/s-andrews/FastQC</ext-link>, v0.11.9) is used for quality control of trimmed reads from all technologies.</p>
      <p>For DBS libraries, the barcode sequences are extracted from read1 using Cutadapt (v2.5) (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). The sequences are corrected by clustering using starcode (v1.4) (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>) with options ‘-d 2 -r 5’. Adaptor sequences are trimmed from read1 and 2 using Cutadapt and the reads are subsequently tagged with the corrected barcode using the subcommand ‘blr tagfastq’.</p>
      <p>For 10× Genomics libraries, the preprocessing is performed using EMA (v0.6.2) (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). EMA extracts the barcode sequence from the reads and corrects the barcode using a provided barcode whitelist to any sequence within a Hamming distance of one.</p>
      <p>For TELL-Seq libraries, barcodes were corrected as described by Wang <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>) and implemented as the subcommand ‘blr correctbc’. In brief, unique barcode sequences were counted and singleton barcodes (with a count of one) are corrected to any remaining barcode with multiple counts that is within a Hamming distance of one. Reads belonging to singleton barcodes with conflicting matches to sequences with multiple counts are removed. Additionally, any reads assigned to a barcode not matching the pattern NNHNNYRNNNNYRNNHNN (IUPAC notation) are also discarded. Adaptor sequences are trimmed from each read pair using Cutadapt and the reads are subsequently tagged with the corrected barcode using ‘blr tagfastq’.</p>
      <p>For stLFR libraries, FASTQs containing the corrected barcode's numerical indices in the header are used as input. Reads are first trimmed to remove possible 3′ adaptors using Cutadapt. Since EMA requires FASTQs to be tagged with a canonical DNA string, these barcode indexes (e.g. ‘#473_1282_95’) are converted to unique 16 nucleotide IUPAC barcode sequences using ‘blr process_stlfr’. These sequences are then used to tag the adaptor-trimmed reads.</p>
      <p>In the next step, barcode-tagged reads are aligned to a reference genome using EMA. This also moves the barcode from the read header to the BX tag. The output BAM is sorted and indexed using samtools (v1.12) (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). The sorted BAM is then split by chromosomes to allow for parallel processing. First, barcode multiplets are collapsed by looking for barcodes sharing two identical insert positions within a defined window (in this study a 30 kb window was used except for 10× where we used 50 kb) using ‘blr find_clusterdups’. Positions with excessively high barcode counts are excluded to avoid collapsing unconnected barcodes. Next, duplicates within barcodes are marked using picard (<ext-link xlink:href="https://github.com/broadinstitute/picard" ext-link-type="uri">https://github.com/broadinstitute/picard</ext-link>, v2.26.2) using options ‘READ_ONE_BARCODE_TAG = BX READ_TWO_BARCODE_TAG = BX’. Following this, the molecules of origin are inferred from the aligned reads within each barcode by grouping reads within a defined sliding window using ‘blr buildmolecules’. Only molecules containing four or more reads are kept and for these multiple statistics are collected. To avoid having molecules overlapping the same region, barcodes carrying too many molecules (current threshold set to 260 molecules) are filtered out using ‘blr filterclusters’. Multiple statistics and quality metrics are collected using mosdepth (v0.3.2) (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>), samtools, picard and custom Python scripts.</p>
      <p>Next, short variants (&lt;50 bp) are called from the processed and filtered BAMs using either GATK HaplotypeCaller (v4.2.1) (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>), DeepVariant (v1.3.0) (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>) or FreeBayes (v1.3.5) (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). These variants are then split into SNVs and INDELs and filtered. For GATK calls, the thresholds used for SNVs were QUAL &lt;15, MQRankSum &gt;6.0 and AF &lt;0.15, while for INDELs QUAL &lt;15, MQRankSum &gt;6.0 and AF &lt;0.25 was used. For DeepVariant and FreeBayes calls were only filtered based on quality using threshold QUAL &lt;15 for both SNVs and INDELs. These variant calls are then phased using HapCUT2 (v1.3.2) (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Specifically heterozygous variants were extracted using the ‘extractHairs’ command with options ‘–realign_variants 1 –10 × 1’. These variants were then linked by barcode using the HapCUT2-included script ‘LinkFragments.py’. The window size (option ‘–distance’ in ‘LinkFragments.py’) used for linking variants on the same barcodes was the same that was used in ‘blr buildmolecules’. Finally, the linked variants were assembled into the phased haplotypes using the command ‘hapcut2’ with option ‘nf 1’. The phased calls are then used to assign alignments to haplotypes 1 and 2 using ‘whatshap haplotag’ (v1.1) (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). These phased alignments are finally used for structural variant calling using a modified version of NAIBR (<ext-link xlink:href="https://github.com/pontushojer/NAIBR" ext-link-type="uri">https://github.com/pontushojer/NAIBR</ext-link>, v0.4.1) (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>) with default settings. Multiple statistics are collected using WhatsHap, HapCUT2 and custom Python scripts. Finally, the statistics are compiled into a comprehensive report using a custom MultiQC (v1.11) (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>) plugin.</p>
      <p>The custom scripts were written in Python (v3.6.13) and relied heavily on the packages numpy (v1.19.5) (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>), pandas (v1.15) (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>), tqdm (v4.62.3) and pysam (v0.16.0.1) (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>).</p>

      <p>Human genomic DNA from the GM24385 cell line was obtained from the 10× Chromium Genome Kit. The consequent steps for library preparation were carried out in the same way as detailed by Redin <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>), with few disclosed exceptions. For every single molecule (SM) library, a total of 500 pg HMW gDNA was used for the on-bead tagmentation reaction. Next, the beads carrying single DNA molecules were divided into 10 separate reactions resulting in every emulsion reaction containing only 50 pg of DNA. Following emulsion PCR, the libraries were pooled and cleaned up 4 times to remove unused barcodes. In the same way, for each multiple-molecule (MM) library, a total of 7 ng genomic DNA was used for tagmentation and 1/7th of the beads were encapsulated in emulsion droplets (i.e. 1 ng genomic DNA in each of the MM emulsion reactions). Sample enrichment, preparation of the final library (including indexing) and sequencing was done as described by Redin <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>).</p>

      <title>Analysis of DBS datasets</title>
      <p>DBS NA24385 datasets MM1, MM2, SM1, SM2 and SM3 were all run through the BLR pipeline using the reference genome GRCh38. MM1 and MM2 libraries were merged to form MM and SM1, SM2 and SM3 libraries were merged to generate SM. All datasets were also merged to form the MM + SM run. Merging was performed on the filtered BAMs prior to variant calling. Switch error rates were compared against the GIAB benchmark (v4.2.1) for NA24385 downloaded from <ext-link xlink:href="https://ftp-trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/giab/ftp/release/AshkenazimTrio/HG002_NA24385_son/NISTv4.2.1/GRCh38/SupplementaryFiles/HG002_GRCh38_1_22_v4.2.1_benchmark_phased_MHCassembly_StrandSeqANDTrio.vcf.gz" ext-link-type="uri">https://ftp-trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/giab/ftp/release/AshkenazimTrio/HG002_NA24385_son/NISTv4.2.1/GRCh38/SupplementaryFiles/HG002_GRCh38_1_22_v4.2.1_benchmark_phased_MHCassembly_StrandSeqANDTrio.vcf.gz</ext-link>.

Long Ranger outputs the SVs in two separate VCFs which were concatenated using bcftools (v1.12) (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>). For the HG002-HPRC deletions, we used a VCF generated with DipCall from <ext-link xlink:href="https://data.nist.gov/od/ds/ark:/88434/mds2-2578/assemblies-and-benchmarking_results/HG002-HPRC.tar.gz" ext-link-type="uri">https://data.nist.gov/od/ds/ark:/88434/mds2-2578/assemblies-and-benchmarking_results/HG002-HPRC.tar.gz</ext-link>. The HG002-HPRC VCF was annotated using Truvari (command: ‘truvari anno svinfo’) to add the required INFO fields.</p>
      <p>Additional SV calling was performed on the MM + SM dataset run with BLR/DeepVariant. LinkedSV (<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>) (<ext-link xlink:href="https://github.com/WGLab/LinkedSV" ext-link-type="uri">https://github.com/WGLab/LinkedSV</ext-link>, commit: 154ea2a) was run on the phased BAM in germline mode with options ‘-v hg38 –germline_mode –wgs’. The output from LinkedSV is multiple SV BEDPE files (*filtered_large_svcalls.bedpe, *large_cnv.bedpe, *large_cnv.bedpe) that were converted to VCF using a custom Python script (linkedsv_bedpe_to_vcf.py) and then combined using bcftools to create a single VCF for comparison. Besides LinkedSV, Manta (v1.6.0) (<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>) was also run on the phased BAM using default parameters. From the output VCF only ‘diploidSV.vcf.gz’ was used. MTG-Link (v2.4.1) (<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>) was used to call large insertions. From the Manta SV VCF, candidate large insertion sites were extracted by filtering for insertions with the LEFT_SVINSSEQ and RIGHT_SVINSSEQ INFO fields. These variants were then converted to a GFA file using the MTG-Link script ‘vcf2gfa.py’ with options ‘–contigs 10 000 -ext 50’. MTG-Link was then run with the generated GFA file following the developers’ documentation using parameters ‘-flank 10 000 -occ 2 -ext 500 -l 1 000 000 -m 1000’. The output FASTA containing the assembled insertions were converted to VCF format using a custom Python script (‘create_mtglink_vcf.py’).</p>

      <title>Phasing evaluation metrics</title>
      <p>To evaluate phasing multiple metrics were provided. Switch errors refer to inconsistent phasing relative to a reference haplotype and are normally reported in two classes as short and long switch errors respectively. Short switch errors denote errors where one position has been flipped while long switch errors require multiple positions in a row. Their rate is reported as the fraction of all positions available for switch errors. Phase block length was reported as Nx curves which shows what percentage of the total haplotype assembly is covered by phase blocks of a certain length or longer. Note that at 50% of the total haplotype length, we get the N50 metric. We also report the area under the Nx curve as auN as this provides a more stable metric for contiguity than N50. We further report switch-corrected phase block lengths in the form of QNx curves and corresponding QN50 and auQN values. For this, we account for switch errors in the phase blocks by splitting them at switch locations to get the block lengths that were correctly phased.</p>

      <title>Phased genes analysis</title>
      <p>For the investigation of phased genes RTGtools (v3.10.1) (<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>) was used to match DBS MM + SM calls with calls from the GIAB benchmark (v4.2.1) (<ext-link xlink:href="https://ftp-trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/giab/ftp/release/AshkenazimTrio/HG002_NA24385_son/NISTv4.2.1/GRCh38/SupplementaryFiles/HG002_GRCh38_1_22_v4.2.1_benchmark_phased_MHCassembly_StrandSeqANDTrio.vcf.gz" ext-link-type="uri">https://ftp-trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/giab/ftp/release/AshkenazimTrio/HG002_NA24385_son/NISTv4.2.1/GRCh38/SupplementaryFiles/HG002_GRCh38_1_22_v4.2.1_benchmark_phased_MHCassembly_StrandSeqANDTrio.vcf.gz</ext-link>). Specifically, the command ‘rtg vcfeval’ was used with options ‘-m combine’ and ‘–bed-regions HG002_GRCh38_1_22_v4.2.1_benchmark_noinconsistent.bed’ where the BED file was downloaded from: <ext-link xlink:href="https://ftp-trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/giab/ftp/release/AshkenazimTrio/HG002_NA24385_son/NISTv4.2.1/GRCh38/HG002_GRCh38_1_22_v4.2.1_benchmark_noinconsistent.bed" ext-link-type="uri">https://ftp-trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/giab/ftp/release/AshkenazimTrio/HG002_NA24385_son/NISTv4.2.1/GRCh38/HG002_GRCh38_1_22_v4.2.1_benchmark_noinconsistent.bed</ext-link>. The coordinates for protein-coding genes on GRCh38 were acquired from Ensembl (release 106). Genes were considered phased if they contained at least two phased heterozygous SNVs. For all phased SNVs in the MM + SM dataset with corresponding GIAB phasing, the phasing was compared for possible switch errors.</p>

      <title>Switch error stratifications</title>
      <p>To evaluate phasing accuracy in different genomic contexts we used genome stratifications defined by the Global Alliance for Genomic Health (GA4GH), GIAB and Telomere-to-Telomere Consortium (T2T) for GRCh38 (v3.1) available from <ext-link xlink:href="https://ftp-trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ReferenceSamples/giab/release/genome-stratifications/v3.1/v3.1-genome-stratifications-GRCh38.tar.gz" ext-link-type="uri">https://ftp-trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ReferenceSamples/giab/release/genome-stratifications/v3.1/v3.1-genome-stratifications-GRCh38.tar.gz</ext-link>. The stratifications used with file names in parenthesis were: segmental duplications (‘GRCh38_segdups.bed.gz’), self-chain (‘GRCh38_chainSelf.bed.gz’), low mappability (‘GRCh38_lowmappabilityall.bed.gz’), tandem repeats (‘GRCh38_allTandemRepeats.bed.gz’) and high/low GC content (‘GRCh38_gclt30orgt55_slop50.bed.gz’). Phased variants were only evaluated on chromosome 1 for simplicity. RTGtools was used to compare and extract variants marked as true positives relative to the GIAB benchmark (v4.2.1). Variants involved in switch errors were identified using WhatsHap (v1.7) with command ‘compare’ (parameter ‘–switch-error-bed’) comparing to the same GIAB benchmark. The rate was calculated as the fraction of switch-involved variants relative to the total number of variants in the genome stratification.</p>

We only included chromosome 1 for simplicity. The data was subsampled to 5X, 10×, 15X and 20X coverage using samtools (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). Phasing was performed using HapCUT2 (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>) with DeepVariant calls from the DBS MM + SM dataset. Haplotype informative reads were extracted using the tool extractHAIRS (options ‘–nf 1 –indels 1’) provided in the HapCUT2 package. We used presets tunned for PacBio (option ‘–pacbio 1’) and Nanopore (option ‘–ont 1’) reads respectively.

      <title>Structural variant analysis</title>
      <p>For the analysis of structural variants, we developed a separate workflow called lsvtool (<ext-link xlink:href="https://github.com/AfshinLab/lsvtool" ext-link-type="uri">https://github.com/AfshinLab/lsvtool</ext-link>, v0.1) to facilitate common clustering, filtering and integration of SV calls from different sources. The workflow was implemented as a Snakemake workflow wrapped as a Python package. The starting point is VCF files with SV calls from which calls that pass filters and match the desired SV type are kept. Overlapping SV calls within each dataset were collapsed using truvari (v3.1.0) (<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>) with the subcommand ‘collapse’ and parameters ‘–chain –pctsim 0 –pctovl 0.8 –pctsize 0.8 –refdist 2000’. SVs were then filtered against a blacklist and for the desired size interval using SURVIVOR (v1.0.7) (<xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>). Calls with both breakpoints within 20 kb of segmental duplications were also removed using a custom Python script. Overlapping calls between different sample sources were assessed using SURVIVOR. Calls were considered to be overlapping if both breakpoints were within an interval corresponding to 10% of the total length of the SV. Blacklists and segmental duplications were downloaded from the 10× Genomics webpage (<ext-link xlink:href="https://support.10xgenomics.com/genome-exome/software/pipelines/latest/advanced/reference" ext-link-type="uri">https://support.10×genomics.com/genome-exome/software/pipelines/latest/advanced/reference</ext-link>). The blacklist was expanded by 10 kb using bedtools (v2.30.0) (<xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>) to remove proximal calls. Venn diagrams were created using R (v4.1.3) with VennDiagram (v1.7.3). Overlap scores were calculated as the ratio between the number of SVs in the intersect and the number of SVs in the smallest of the compared sets. For comparisons with a reference set, matching calls are counted as true positives (TP). Non-matching calls belonging to the query set are counted as false positives (FP) and those belonging to the reference set are counted as false negatives (FN). From this, recall is calculated as TP / (TP + FP), precision as TP / (TP + FN) and the F1 score is 2 * ((recall * precision) / (recall + precision)).</p>

Since the Long Ranger run had been downsampled, the same set of reads was extracted from the provided phased BAM for input into BLR. For mapping, the same 10× Genomics hg19 reference (version 2.1.0) was used as in the Long Ranger run. A window size of 50 kb was used to infer molecules and phased variants instead of the default 30 kb. Long Ranger metrics in Table <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">2</xref> were taken from the file ‘NA12878_WGS_v2_summary.csv’ except for coverage stats which were computed using mosdepth (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>) and switched error rates which were separately evaluated on the phased VCF (‘NA12878_WGS_v2_phased_variants.vcf.gz’) using ‘blr calculate_haplotype_statistics’.

      <title>Method description</title>
      <p>We have developed a referenced-based analysis pipeline called BLR (Figure <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) and continued development of the DBS method (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 2</xref>). The pipeline can run data from the DBS method and from other linked-read methods such as 10× Genomics (GemCode or Chromium Genome), stLFR and TELL-Seq. Preprocessing of the input FASTQs prior to mapping is dependent on the linked-read technology since they vary in read structure and barcoding approach (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>). In the case of DBS, the technology makes use of degenerate barcodes which are extracted from read 1 (see Methods for the other technologies). Each DNA barcode is corrected by clustering barcode sequences within a defined edit distance using a message-passing algorithm (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). The reads are then trimmed to remove adaptors, and the corrected barcode is tagged to the read-pair of origin. The barcode-tagged reads are then aligned to a reference genome using the barcode-aware mapper EMA (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). Following alignment, reads are split by chromosome to speed up downstream processing. In the DBS technique, it is possible to encapsulate two or more barcodes in one droplet. This phenomenon has also been observed in 10× Genomics droplet generation (<xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>). To address this issue, the barcodes with overlapping read sets are collapsed and duplicate reads are marked within each barcode. The molecules are inferred for each barcode by splitting read pairs whose pairwise distance exceeds a defined threshold into separate molecules. To avoid molecules covering overlapping genomic regions within a barcode, barcodes with an excessive number of molecules are removed. This is followed by short variant calling using either GATK HaplotypeCaller(38), DeepVariant(39), or FreeBayes(40). Variants were then filtered to yield a set of high-quality heterozygous variants. The heterozygous short variants are phased using HapCUT2 (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). The phased variants are then used to assign haplotypes back to the mapped reads using WhatsHap (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Finally, using the phased reads, structural variants are called using NAIBR (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). At various points, a number of quality metrics and statistics are collected and compiled into a comprehensive report (example in <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 3</xref>) based on MultiQC (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>).</p>

      <title>BLR generates highly continuous and accurate phasing on DBS data</title>
      <p>We first evaluated the BLR pipeline on linked reads generated by the DBS method. By lowering the amount of gDNA per reaction and running multiple parallel reactions we were able to generate linked-read libraries with single-molecule (SM) resolution. For comparison, we also generated libraries containing multiple molecules (MM) per droplet, similar to Redin <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). Three SM libraries and two MM libraries were generated using gDNA corresponding to Genome in a Bottle (GIAB) reference genome HG002 (NA24385). Despite the slightly degraded quality of the obtained gDNA for this genome, we proceeded due to its benchmarking utility (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>). These libraries were run separately through the BLR pipeline using reference genome GRCh38 and then merged to form the MM and SM datasets at 23× and 21× median coverage respectively (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). We also merged these to form a high-coverage (44×) MM + SM dataset (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 1</xref>).</p>
      <p>We first benchmarked different variant callers that are currently integrated into BLR on the MM + SM dataset. Calls from DeepVariant, FreeBayes, and GATK on chromosome 1 were evaluated against the GIAB benchmark set (v4.2.1) (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>) using hap.py (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). DeepVariant demonstrated superior performance across SNPs and INDELs, achieving F1 scores of 98.3% and 88.4% respectively. Furthermore, when focusing on heterozygous calls, which play a crucial role in haplotype phasing, DeepVariant once again outperformed other methods with the highest precision (99.4% for SNPs and 99.3% for INDELs) and F1 scores (97.7% for SNPs and 89.0% for INDELs). Compared to SNPs, INDELs generally scored lower and were also observed to be 3–6 times less frequent. The relatively low frequency of INDELs may limit their impact on phasing. Consequently, we chose to exclude INDELs to conduct a comparative analysis of their impact on phasing. The majority of heterozygous calls were successfully phased across the variant callers, irrespective of whether INDELs were included or excluded (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 3</xref>). GATK and FreeBayes with INDELs included produced the longest phase blocks at N50 of 24.2 Mb and 18.5 Mb respectively compared to ∼4 Mb for the other conditions (Figure <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2A</xref>, <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 3</xref>). Switch error rates (SER) were low (0.01–0.12%) with DeepVariant having the lowest across variant callers. Including INDELs increased switch errors, especially the short SER which increased by more than double. To obtain a more comprehensive measure of phasing completeness, we evaluated the effect of switch errors on phase block length by splitting phase blocks at switch positions (Figure <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2B</xref>). The result showed that the highly continuous phasing created using GATK and FreeBayes calls with INDELs was largely inflated. The switch-corrected block lengths when using DeepVariant or only SNP calls much better represented the assembled block lengths. Repetitive regions remain a challenge for accurate phasing (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). We therefore stratified these haplotype phasings across various difficult genomic regions to look for enrichments in switch errors (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 4</xref>). Overall, switch errors were more common in repetitive regions such as segmental duplications and tandem repeats. Compared to the other variant callers, DeepVariant calls generated fewer switch errors in these regions. One exception is when including INDELs for tandem repeats where FreeBayes only had 0.22% switched variants compared to 0.47% for DeepVariant. Based on these benchmarks we selected DeepVariant calls with INDELs for phasing the full datasets, while also providing phasing-inflating GATK calls for a reference.</p>

      <p>We hypothesized that having multiple molecules per barcode might generate noise in the barcode-aware software tools such as HapCUT2. Comparing the MM and SM datasets they had similar genome coverage (∼22×, <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 5a</xref>), molecule length (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 5b</xref>), and molecule coverage (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 5c</xref>) while a majority of barcodes (55.0%) in the SM dataset contained a single DNA molecule versus a median of seven molecules for MM (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 5d</xref>). Furthermore, duplicate rates were higher for the SM dataset compared to MM (Table <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Comparing phase block lengths, an increase was seen from MM to SM dataset with the GATK calls (Figure <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2C</xref>) with an N50 of 7.1 megabases (Mb) and 11.7 Mb, respectively. DeepVariant variants generated phase blocks of a similar length for both MM and SM but were shorter compared to GATK with an N50 of about ∼2.2 Mb. Considering the switch-corrected phase blocks (Figure <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2D</xref>), no difference in length was observed between the SM and MM datasets.</p>

      <p>Because of the rather modest coverage of the MM and SM datasets we combined both to generate a high-coverage dataset MM + SM with a median of 44X coverage (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 5a</xref>). The added depth was reflected in the increased phase block length (Figure <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2C</xref>) to an N50 of 4.4 Mb with DeepVariant and 24.8 Mb with GATK (Table <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). This increase in phasing contiguity was also accompanied by lower SER, dropping from 0.146–0.196% to 0.103–0.109% for GATK and from 0.031–0.074% to 0.027–0.051% for DeepVariant (Table <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Looking at switch-corrected phase blocks (Figure <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2D</xref>), DeepVariant calls again generated more continuous and accurate phasing with a QN50 of 2.15 Mb compared to GATK at 1.52 Mb. This reaffirms the benchmarking finding that running BLR with GATK calls might generate spurious phasing.</p>
      <p>To validate the usefulness of the phasing, we evaluated phasing across all protein-coding genes in the MM + SM high-coverage dataset. We used the GIAB benchmark set (v4.2.1) and Ensembl (release 106) gene annotations for reference. A protein-coding gene was considered phased if it contained at least two phased SNPs which left 13616 genes phased out of a total of 19054 in the benchmark set. For these phased genes we observed a high level of agreement with the GIAB benchmark set (Figure <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2E</xref>). In the DBS MM + SM dataset with DeepVariant calls, 98.6% (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 13 426) were phased without switch errors. Accurate phasing is particularly important for highly polymorphous regions such as the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) region. Looking at the 19 HLA genes we found that of the 15 genes phased in GIAB (including HLA-A, -B, -C), all were phased without errors in the MM + SM set (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 4</xref>).</p>
      <p>BLR also performs SV calling using NAIBR which calls deletions, inversions and duplications from about 500 bp and upwards. To compare calls, we developed lsvtool that can filter, select and compare SVs from multiple sources (see Methods for details). From 1213–2312 initial calls from NAIBR, 731–947 calls remained after processing with lsvtool (Table <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Comparing calls between MM + SM and the two low-coverage datasets showed good overlap (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 6</xref>). Calls consisted mostly of deletions with a few large (&gt;10 kb) inversions and duplications (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 6a and b</xref>). Therefore, we focused on deletion calls. To validate the DBS MM + SM SV deletions we compared them against calls from PacBio and 10× Genomics. Deletions from the HPRC reference assembly of HG002 (<xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>) were additionally included as a benchmark set. Overlap was generally good between the datasets and the majority of DBS deletions matched HPRC (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 6c and d</xref>). Quantifying this overlap using HPRC as the reference set the precision was acceptable at 0.59–0.60 for the DBS dataset while the recall was considerably lower at 0.34 compared to 0.48 for 10× Genomics and 0.61 for PacBio (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 5</xref>). Looking at the size distribution, most calls below 1kb were from PacBio and HPRC while 10× Genomics had the majority of calls above 100 kb (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 6e</xref>). Deletions were therefore further limited to the range of 1 to 100 kb since this would yield a fairer comparison with all datasets adequately represented. In this range most deletions were matched between datasets (Figure <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2F</xref>) and both precision (0.84–0.86) and recall (0.64) were improved for the DBS dataset (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 5</xref>).</p>
      <p>For calling SVs, multiple tools are available besides NAIBR that utilize linked-read information (<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,<xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59–63</xref>), many of which can be run directly from BLR output. To further benchmark the NAIBR calls, we called SVs using LinkedSV (<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>) and short-read caller Manta (<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>) on the DBS MM + SM dataset phased with DeepVariant calls. Calls were stratified by length and scored against the HPRC reference set (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 7a</xref>). PacBio PBSV and 10× Genomics Long Ranger were also included for comparison. Although NAIBR allows calling deletions below 1kb, there is a high drop in recall and precision for calls in this range. Manta and LinkedSV scored much better below 1kb, even outperforming the PacBio calls in precision. Deletions called by PacBio however had the highest recall up to around 10kb. Above 10kb, calls were relatively few resulting in big fluctuations in precision and recall for all callers. Looking at F1 Score, linked-read based callers NAIBR and Long Ranger (on 10× Genomics data) generally performed best in this range as compared to the short-read caller Manta.</p>
      <p>Linked reads also enable the calling of large insertions (<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>,<xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>,<xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>). To showcase this application, we utilized the fact that the Manta SV caller is able to identify sites for putative large insertions. These sites were used as input to MTG-Link that reconstructs the insertion using local assembly of linked reads connected to the particular site (<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>). From 321 candidate sites, 80 large insertions could be identified. Out of these insertions 54 (67.5%) matched PacBio PBSV calls and 57 (71.3%) matched insertions from the HPRC reference set (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 7b</xref>). Similarly for the Manta called insertions a majority (83.6–84.8%) of calls overlapped with the external sets. Looking at the size distribution (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 7c</xref>), MTG-Link was able to resolve calls within a wider range than Manta, with the longest MTG-Link insertion verified by the HPRC set being 975 bp. While this approach enables detection of longer insertions, the majority of calls are missed as compared to PacBio.</p>

      <title>Integration of DBS linked reads with low-coverage long reads improves haplotype phasing</title>
      <p>The introduction of accurate long-read sequencing, primarily in the form of PacBio HiFi reads, has enabled the generation of diploid assemblies as an alternative approach to haplotyping (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12–16</xref>). We therefore compared the reference-based phasing generated by BLR to a recent diploid assembly of HG002 using Hifiasm (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>) (v0.16.1) on PacBio HiFi reads (30×). At 30× coverage the cost for PacBio HiFi library preparation and sequencing is significantly higher compared to BLR, even if including the latest PacBio Revio instrument (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 6</xref>). For the comparison, we used the DBS MM + SM dataset using DeepVariant calls and limited analysis to chromosome 1. The phased contigs of the Hifiasm assembly were more continuous compared to the BLR phase blocks (Figure <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2G</xref>) with N50 of 70.2 and 67.0 Mb for haplotypes 1 and 2. Conversely, the long switch error rate was more than ten times higher than BLR (0.03%) at 0.39% for Hifiasm. This resulted in considerably lower contiguity than BLR when correcting for switch errors (Figure <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2H</xref>). Stratifying the Hifiasm phasing, the rate of switched variants was only moderately elevated for difficult regions (Figure <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2I</xref>). The rate was still considerably higher compared to BLR which had rates closer to the HG002-HPRC reference assembly (<xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>).</p>
      <p>Despite DBS generating a more accurate phasing of HG002 compared to Hifiasm, switch rates were considerably elevated in low mappability, low complexity (segmental duplications and self-chain regions), and tandem repeat regions. We hypothesized that a hybrid phasing approach with low coverage long reads could be a more cost-effective way to improve switch rates in some of these regions (see <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 6</xref> for a cost comparison for different sequencing technologies). Therefore, we integrated publicly available long-read data from HG002 with our DBS MM + SM data for variant phasing, employing the DeepVariant calls. We integrated both relatively short (∼20 kb) but accurate PacBio HiFi reads and longer (&gt;100 kb) but low base-quality Nanopore Ultra-long reads (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 8a</xref>). The limited length of the PacBio HiFi reads did not provide any significant improvements in phasing contiguity on integration compared to just using DBS data (Figure <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2G</xref>, <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 8b and c</xref>). Integration of Nanopore Ultra-long reads however increased contiguity considerably, even at the lowest (5×) coverage. Looking at the genome stratifications (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 8d</xref>) a coverage-linked reduction in switched variant rates was seen for both tandem repeats and high/low GC regions. For low complexity regions and low mappability regions, the results were more mixed, and long read integration even increased switched variant rates for certain levels of coverage. Based on this, integrating Nanopore Ultra-long reads at low coverage (∼10×) could be beneficial to improve contiguity and phase repetitive regions more accurately (Figure <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2I</xref>).</p>

      <title>BLR compares favorably to Long Ranger on 10× Genomics linked reads</title>
      <p>While 10× Genomics linked-read technology is no longer commercially available, there are many genomic datasets in the public domain with more still being released (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 9</xref>). All could benefit from an improved pipeline for reference-based haplotyping. To assess how well BLR compares to the 10× Genomics Long Ranger pipeline, we downloaded a NA12878 dataset from the 10× Genomics webpage that had been run through Long Ranger (version 2.2.1). The same 10× Genomics sequencing reads were processed through the BLR pipeline.</p>
      <p>Comparing coverage, insert size and inferred molecule lengths, BLR and Long Ranger produce similar results (Table <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). The number of reads per molecule was higher for BLR at an N50 of 67 compared to 44 for Long Ranger (Table <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Looking at the phasing statistics, BLR phased almost all (∼99.9%) of SNVs versus 99.5% for Long Ranger (Table <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). BLR also generated considerably longer phase blocks (Figure <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3A and B</xref>) with an N50 of 40.0 Mb (GATK) and 24.2 (DeepVariant) compared to 10.1 Mb for Long Ranger. Switch errors were benchmarked against the GIAB NA12878 benchmark set (v.4.2.1). Rates were low (&lt;0.05%) for both pipelines although BLR run with GAKT generated slightly higher rates similar to the runs on DBS data (Table <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Correcting for errors, the phasing generated by BLR using DeepVariant was still more continuous than Long Ranger with a QN50 of 6.3 compared to 5.1 (Figure <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3A</xref> and <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">C</xref>, Table <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">2</xref>).</p>

      <p>To compare SV calls from Long Ranger to the BLR NAIBR calls, NAIBR was also run on the Long Ranger phased BAM. Long Ranger uses different algorithms for SVs larger than 30 kb and deletions smaller than 30 kb, so the comparison was done separately for these intervals. After filtering 577–647 deletions remained in the 1 to 30 kb range while 15–25 remained above 30 kb (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 7</xref>). Good agreement was observed for both ranges with about 50% of deletions being shared across the compared callsets (Figure <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3D</xref>).</p>
      <p>For completion, Aquila (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>) was also used to analyze the same 10× Genomics dataset. Compared to both BLR and Long Ranger, the phasing generated by Aquila was less continuous (Figure <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3B</xref> and <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">C</xref>) with both N50 and QN50 at around 0.7 Mb (Table <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Structural variants were compared against NAIBR and Long Ranger calls along with PBSV calls on PacBio HiFi reads to evaluate the insertions called by Aquila (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 10</xref>). Overlap between Aquila calls and other tools were in general poor with overlap scores of 22.6–25.7% for deletions and 22.9% for insertions compared to PBSV calls. The poor performance can likely be explained by low coverage as the genome fraction covered by the Aquila assembly was only 64.1% (H1) and 63.4% (H2) for the respective haplotypes.</p>

      <title>BLR enables haplotyping of TELL-Seq and stLFR linked reads</title>
      <p>BLR is also able to process linked reads from other technologies such as TELL-Seq and stLFR. To investigate the performance of BLR on data generated with these technologies we ran two samples included in the original publication for the respective technology (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>).</p>
      <p>For TELL-Seq, we downloaded and processed a library generated from the NA24384 genome. Comparing BLR to the data presented by Chen <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>), the results are mostly similar (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 8</xref>). Using BLR with GATK calls again yielded longer phase blocks than DeepVariant but with considerably higher switch error rates (Figure <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3E</xref>). Looking at the switch-corrected lengths, the DeepVariant phasing can be considered more accurate with a QN50 of 3.8 Mb compared to 2.1 for GATK (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 8</xref>). Compared to the result reported by Chen <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> the BLR DeepVariant phasing had only a slightly shorter N50 at 7.8 versus 13.4 Mb but about half the switch error rate (Figure <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3E</xref>).</p>
      <p>For stLFR, we downloaded dataset stLFR-1 corresponding to individual NA12878 and ran it through the BLR workflow. Comparing the BLR results to those presented by Wang <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>), most stats are similar (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 9</xref>). Phase block lengths were similar between the workflows with an N50 of around 30 Mb (Figure <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3F</xref>). Switch error rates were higher for BLR at ∼0.6% compared to Wang <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> with 0.25% and 0.20% for short and long errors respectively (Figure <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3F</xref>).</p>

      <title>Diverse properties of linked read platforms unveiled with BLR</title>
      <p>Due to its ability to manage several linked-read technologies, BLR facilitates the evaluation of diverse technologies using a standardized workflow. Although there is a lack of linked read data from the same sample material, datasets on HG002 generated using DBS, 10× Genomics, TELL-Seq and stLFR linked reads exist. These datasets were run through BLR, mapping to GRCh38 and calling variants with DeepVariant. Note that the dataset for DBS and TELL-Seq are the same as presented above. Phasing was evaluated against the latest GIAB benchmark (v4.2.1). Coverage was similar around a median of 40X with DBS being slightly higher (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 11a</xref>). Multiple properties varied greatly with different technologies (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 11b to 11f</xref>). Molecule length (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplemental Figure 11b</xref>) is largely dependent on the DNA integrity and was shortest for DBS with stLFR and 10× Genomics having the longest. Of all technologies, 10× Genomics had the highest molecule coverage (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 11c</xref>), molecules per barcodes (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 11d</xref>) and insert size (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 11e</xref>). A distinctly left-leaning insert size distribution was noted for both TELL-Seq and stLFR (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 11e</xref>). This might be suboptimal as read pairs overlap the same bases for short inserts thus not providing additional information. GC bias plots showed a drop in coverage for high and low GC, with DBS having the lowest coverage in these regions followed by TELL-Seq and 10× Genomics (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 11f</xref>). Reduced coverage at high GC was also observed for stLFR, in low GC regions coverage was instead increased. Comparing phase block lengths before (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 11g</xref>) and after (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 11h</xref>) switch correction they largely correlate with molecule length.</p>

    <title>Discussion</title>
    <p>In this work, we present BLR as an analysis pipeline to haplotype resolve genomes through linked-read sequencing. Unlike other pipelines, BLR natively runs on sequencing data from multiple technologies, including DBS, 10× Genomics, TELL-Seq and stLFR. BLR also integrates several linked-read-specific software such as EMA into a flexible open-source pipeline.</p>
    <p>Benchmarking BLR on DBS data for different variant callers we show that DeepVariant calls generated the lowest number of switch errors and the best overall phasing. Including FreeBayes or GATK INDELs in phasing caused overinflation of phasing, likely due to their lower INDEL precision compared to DeepVariant. In our high-coverage DBS dataset, we showed that BLR generates highly continuous phasing while maintaining low (&lt;1%) switch error rates. In fact, most (98.6%) of the GIAB-phased protein-coding genes matched the phasing in the high-coverage dataset, including the highly polymorphic HLA genes. Evaluating structural variant calls we show that a majority of deletions match those found in the HG002-HPRC reference. Comparing diploid assembly using PacBio HiFi reads we found that BLR produced considerably longer phase blocks when correcting for switch errors. Evaluating phasing for genomic context we saw enrichment for switched variants in low complexity, low mappability and repeat regions. Levels were however still below diploid assembly using Hifiasm. We further show that integrating low-coverage Nanopore data can be a way to both increase phasing contiguity and reduce switch errors in tandem repeats. Furthermore, we compared BLR to Long Ranger on 10× Genomics data, where BLR generated longer phase blocks while maintaining low switch errors. Similarly, BLR generated longer or similar phase block sizes and low switch error rates when run on TELL-Seq and stLFR linked reads. Finally, we use BLR to show the diverse properties of different linked read platforms.</p>
    <p>There are several improvements to consider in the continual development of BLR. While both large SVs and short variants are called in the pipeline, structural variants in the ‘lower’ (∼50–1000 bp) size range are missed. This range could be covered by the integration of an additional SV caller, such as Manta or LinkedSV that demonstrated good performance in this range. In addition, some of the default parameters might need tuning to run optimally for different linked-read technologies. Pipeline steps could also be modified to integrate new or replace existing software as these are validated. For example, other phasing tools could be considered instead of HapCUT2 such as HapTree-X (<xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>) or SpecHap (<xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>). Furthermore, novel linked-read technologies, such as Haplotagging (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>), need to be integrated as they mature. While there are many avenues for improvements, BLR as an open-source workflow can benefit from contributions from the entire linked-read community.</p>
