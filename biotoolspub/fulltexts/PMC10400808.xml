    <abstract id="ab0010">
      <p>Large-scale multidimensional cancer genomic and pharmacological profiles have been created by several large consortium projects, including NCI-60, GDSC and DepMap, providing novel opportunities for data mining and further understanding of intrinsic therapeutic response mechanisms. However, it is increasingly challenging for experimental biologists, especially those without a bioinformatic background, to integrate, explore, and analyse these tremendous pharmacogenomics. To address this gap, IMOPAC, an interactive and easy-to-use web-based tool, was introduced to provide rapid visualizations and customizable functionalities on the basis of these three publicly available databases, which may reduce pharmacogenomic profiles from cell lines into readily understandable genetic, epigenetic, transcriptionomic, proteomic, metabolomic, and pharmacological events. The user-friendly query interface together with customized data storage enables users to interactively investigate and visualize multiomics alterations across genes and pathways and to link these alterations with drug responses across cell lines from diverse cancer types. The analyses in our portal include pancancer expression, drug-omics/pathway correlation, cancer subtypes, omics-omics (cis-/trans-regulation) correlation, fusion query analysis, and drug response prediction analysis. The comprehensive multiomics and pharmacogenomic analyses with simple clicking through IMOPAC will significantly benefit cancer precision medicine, contribute to the discoveries of potential biological mechanisms and facilitate pharmacogenomics mining in the identification of clinically actionable biomarkers for both basic researchers and clinical practitioners.

    <title>Introduction</title>
    <p id="p0010">The complexity and heterogeneity of tumour genomes bring an enormous challenge when developing novel molecular therapeutics <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. These strategies greatly depend on our understanding of the genetic events that are causally implicated in malignancy <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Observations from clinical practice indicate that molecular alterations in the oncogenome strongly impact the effectiveness of anticancer therapies, and dozens of targeted drugs currently utilized in the clinic or developed in clinical trials have not been linked to specific molecular events <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. To bridge the gap between precision medicine and cancer heterogeneity, it is crucial to systematically shape a comprehensive pharmacogenomic landscape of patient-derived cancer models at scale. Recent years have witnessed rapidly accumulated large-scale drug sensitivity screens and corresponding multiomics across pancancer to characterize pharmacogenomics, capture the genetic diversity of cancer and identify drug response biomarkers in multiple public databases, including GDSC <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, DepMap <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, and NCI60 <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>; together, they present detailed genetic and pharmacological annotations on more than 2000 cancer cell models. Collectively, such data can be used for biological hypothesis testing, facilitating pharmacogenomics mining in the discovery or repurposing of new anticancer therapeutics and the identification of clinically actionable biomarkers. However, it is still significantly challenging for experimental biologists, especially those without bioinformatic experience, to integrate, explore, analyse, and visualize these large-scale pharmacogenomic profiles. Therefore, we developed the IMOPAC, an interactive and easy-to-use webserver for comprehensively characterizing the landscape of pharmacogenomic interactions and easily visualizing the pharmacogenomic profiles in preclinical cancer models.</p>
    <p id="p0015">There are numerous and diverse methods for analysing pharmacogenomics. Clustering analysis, based on multiomics, can identify which cell line models most closely resemble specific cancer subtypes and provide a better understanding of biological mechanisms by directly linking in vitro models to patient tumour samples with curated clinical data available. Liu et al., for instance, divided SNU398, HepG2 and SNU475 cells into three distinct DNA methylation HCC subtypes by unsupervised clustering analysis, which can act as a preclinical model representing different HCC molecular features to investigate the response of HCC cells to DNMTi treatment <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Pancancer expression analysis is also widely used to facilitate a comprehensive understanding of a given gene’s molecular pattern across multiple different cancer types. Chai et al. revealed that <italic>ACE2</italic> was overexpressed in lung adenocarcinoma by pancancer expression analysis <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. It is generally recognized that multiomics alterations, including somatic mutation, copy number variation, DNA methylation, transcriptomics, and proteomics, remarkably impact the clinical drug response to treatment and, in numerous situations, are potential biomarkers for sensitivity to chemotherapy <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Correlation analysis between drug sensitivity and multiomics alterations or pathway activity is applied to facilitate pharmacogenomics mining in the discovery of the underlying biological mechanism of drug resistance. By combining large-scale genomic dependency and pharmaceutical screening datasets within preclinical cell line models, Zhou et al. revealed that the combination of ERBB inhibitors could augment the efficacy of CDK4/6 inhibitor monotherapy in several squamous cell lines both in vitro and in vivo <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Cis-regulation analysis is used to investigate the correlation among the multiomics levels of a specific gene at the same time. In recent studies, several DNA methylation-driven genes were identified based on the correlation of gene expression and promoter DNA methylation <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Transregulation analysis is applied to estimate the association among various genes from the same or different omics. Because genes with similar expression features have a tendency to possess related functions, it is frequently desirable to detect genes with expression similarities to a known gene, acting as a known tumour chemotherapy target <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Gene fusions frequently result from rearrangements in cancer genomes. In various instances, gene fusions play an important role in oncogenesis <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. A better understanding of the gene fusion detected in cell lines may improve diagnosis and further benefit translational research into targeted therapies necessary to treat these malignancies <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. In addition, prediction of clinical drug response for cancer drugs is critical for personalized treatment <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>.</p>
    <p id="p0020">Currently, CellMinerCDB <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, PharmacoDB 2.0 <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref> and RNAactDrug <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref> have provided many useful visualization and analysis tools for pharmacogenomic analysis in patient-derived cancer cell lines. CellMinerCDB aims to integrate genomic alterations, molecular signatures and specific drug responses of cancer cell lines. PharmacoDB 2.0 has focused on integrating across a wider range of pharmacogenomics studies and includes major pancancer screening initiatives as well as smaller, tissue-specific studies. RNAactDrug is a comprehensive database of RNAs, including lncRNAs, miRNAs and mRNAs, associated with drug sensitivity from multiomics data, which allows the user to explore drug sensitivity and RNA molecule associations directly. While these databases are exceptionally valuable and widely used, many additional functions are often requested by experimental biologists but are not adequately addressed by existing tools. For example, correlation analyses between customized pathway activity (by user or originating from MSigDB <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>) and drug responses are commonly performed, but this function is not available in CellMinerCDB. In addition, while PharmacoDB 2.0 provides tissue-specific pharmacogenomic analysis, it does not integrate any gene essentiality data and does not allow to explore any molecular features associated with drug response. Furthermore, correlation analyses between drug response and other omics, including proteomics, metabolomics, and genetic dependency data, the visualization of tissue-specific gene–drug associations, and multivariate analysis of drug response with respect to multiple-omic features simultaneously are not available in RNAactDrug. None of the existing databases allow specific analyses based on cis-regulation (the correlation among the multiomics level of a specific gene) and trans-regulation (the association among various user-input genes from the same or different omics). The effect of DNA methylation in promoter versus gene body CGIs on its corresponding gene expression remains contradictory <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. The pharmacogenomic analyses based on gene body or promoter DNA methylation are not available in previous databases. Moreover, none of the databases provide a fusion query, molecular classification across pancancer or within specific cancer types, or pancancer expression analysis in patient-derived cancer cell lines. Based on the abovementioned needs that are not adequately addressed, we developed IMOPAC, a web server to deliver fast and customizable functionalities to complement with the existing tools.</p>

      <title>Data collection and preprocessing</title>
      <p id="p0030">IMOPAC is based on multiomics and drug response screens originating from three publicly available databases (6 omics, 992 cell lines from 28 cancer types and 173 drugs are available in GDSC; 12 omics, 1773 cell lines from 34 cancer types and 22 drugs are available in DepMap database; 8 omics, 60 cell lines from 9 cancer types and 695 drugs are available in NCI60) (<xref rid="tbl0005" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). A flowchart of the IMOPAC pipeline is shown in <xref rid="fig0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>B. The input gene-related CpG sites were annotated by the <italic>IlluminaHumanMethylation450kanno.ilmn12.hg19</italic> R package <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. The DNA methylation profiles of the gene promoter and body were generated by calculating the average DNA methylation value of CpG sites in the promoter and body region of the specific gene, respectively. Detailed clinical and biological features of all cell models, including age, sex, ploidy, microsatellite status, mutational burden, culture type, and culture medium, were retrieved from Cell Model Passports <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref> and DepMap <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Whole genes and drugs in this database were annotated by the HGNC <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref> and pubchem <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref> databases, respectively. We excluded drugs whose sensitivity values were ‘NA’ in greater than 15 % of the cell lines. The gene fusion profile was estimated based on RNA-seq data from DepMap Public 22Q1. Data were filtered using the following: 1. removing fusion involving mitochondrial chromosomes or HLA genes; 2. removing common false-positive fusions (red herring annotations as described in the STAR-Fusion docs); 3. recurrent fusions observed in DepMap across cell lines (in 10 % or more of the samples); 4. removing fusions where SpliceType = 'INCL_NON_REF_SPLICE' and LargeAnchorSupport = 'NO_LDAS' and FFPM &lt; 0.1.<table-wrap position="float" id="tbl0005"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>The available omics in three public datasets.</p></caption><alt-text id="at0050">Table 1</alt-text><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th colspan="4">The available omics in three public datasets<hr/></th></tr><tr><th/><th>GDSC</th><th>DepMap</th><th>NCI60</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Mutation</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td>CNV</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td>mRNA</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td>DNA methylation (Body)</td><td>Yes</td><td>No</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td>DNA methylation (Promoter)</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td>DNA methylation (CpG site)</td><td>Yes</td><td>No</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td>Fusion</td><td>No</td><td>Yes</td><td>No</td></tr><tr><td>microRNA</td><td>No</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td>Protein</td><td>No</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td>Metabolomics</td><td>No</td><td>Yes</td><td>No</td></tr><tr><td>Global Chromatin</td><td>No</td><td>Yes</td><td>No</td></tr><tr><td>Metastatic Potential</td><td>No</td><td>Yes</td><td>No</td></tr><tr><td>RNAi dependency</td><td>No</td><td>Yes</td><td>No</td></tr><tr><td>CRISPR dependency</td><td>No</td><td>Yes</td><td>No</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p>

    <title>Discussion</title>
    <p id="p0195">IMOPAC is an interactive web application for interactive multiomics and pharmacological analyses of patient-derived cancer cell lines originating from three publicly available databases, including GDSC, DepMap, and NCI60, using the output of a standard processing pipeline for pharmacogenomics.</p>
    <p id="p0200">It was primarily developed to comprehensively characterize the landscape of pharmacogenomic interactions and easily visualize the pharmacogenomic profiles in preclinical cancer models. Our web server provides biologists, without the need for complex programming technology or expertise, with the ability to perform pharmacogenomics mining in the discovery of the potential biological mechanism of drug resistance or repurpose new anticancer therapeutics and identify clinically actionable biomarkers by the correlation analysis between drug sensitivity and multiomics alteration or pathway activity and allows users to easily identify which cell line models most closely resemble specific cancer subtypes and provide a better understanding of biological mechanisms by directly linking in vitro models with patient tumour samples with curated clinical data. What’s more, by utilizing the overlapping drug response data of the same cell lines in both the DepMap and GDSC databases and conducting correlation analysis, we have found that the two databases maintain good consistency (<xref rid="sec0150" ref-type="sec">Fig. S1</xref>). In addition, users can also perform pancancer expression analysis to assess a comprehensive understanding of a given gene’s molecular pattern across multiple different cancer types in our portal. Because genes with similar expression features have a tendency to possess related functions, it is frequently desirable to detect genes with expression similarities to a known gene, acting as a known tumour chemotherapy target. In doing so, cis- and trans-regulation correlation analysis can be performed in IMOPAC to identify multiomics molecules with homologous expression patterns. Because gene fusions play an important role in oncogenesis, the comprehensive gene fusion landscape of the user-defined cell line can also be visualized in our tool. Finnally, the drug response prediction module in IMOPAC on the basis of GDSC database, which provides 10 different machine learning algorithms for predicting response to various drugs based on user-defined omics data and gene sets, presents its potential value in guiding anti-cancer drug selection. However, it is crucial to note that the predictive model may be affected by other factors, and it is necessary to conduct further validation on an independent dataset in the future analysis.</p>
    <p id="p0205">At the same time, the custom drawing parameters of IMOPAC allow users great freedom to customize the visual output, for example, by selecting the type of omics, the method of correlation analysis, cluster algorithm, form of display for <italic>P</italic>-values, or ascertaining the cut-off of regression coefficient.</p>
    <p id="p0210">IMOPAC will be updated quarterly, with more analytical functions and interactive visualizations developed, as well as additional valuable cohort-based public datasets integrated in the future, which will collect multiomics and drug screens from patient-derived tumour xenografts and organoids. With these further developments, IMOPAC will complement other available tools to assist biological and clinical researchers in characterizing pharmacogenomics, capturing the genetic diversity of cancer and identifying drug response biomarkers across pancancer.</p>
    <p id="p0215">IMOPAC is a time-saving and intuitive web-based tool that provides users, especially biologists without background knowledge of computer programming, with a powerful tool for biomarker discovery, drug repurposing, and precision treatment. With continuous user feedback and further enhancement, IMOPAC has the potential to become an integral part of routine data analysis for experimental biologists.</p>

    <abstract id="ab0010">
      <p>Large-scale multidimensional cancer genomic and pharmacological profiles have been created by several large consortium projects, including NCI-60, GDSC and DepMap, providing novel opportunities for data mining and further understanding of intrinsic therapeutic response mechanisms. However, it is increasingly challenging for experimental biologists, especially those without a bioinformatic background, to integrate, explore, and analyse these tremendous pharmacogenomics. To address this gap, IMOPAC, an interactive and easy-to-use web-based tool, was introduced to provide rapid visualizations and customizable functionalities on the basis of these three publicly available databases, which may reduce pharmacogenomic profiles from cell lines into readily understandable genetic, epigenetic, transcriptionomic, proteomic, metabolomic, and pharmacological events. The user-friendly query interface together with customized data storage enables users to interactively investigate and visualize multiomics alterations across genes and pathways and to link these alterations with drug responses across cell lines from diverse cancer types. The analyses in our portal include pancancer expression, drug-omics/pathway correlation, cancer subtypes, omics-omics (cis-/trans-regulation) correlation, fusion query analysis, and drug response prediction analysis. The comprehensive multiomics and pharmacogenomic analyses with simple clicking through IMOPAC will significantly benefit cancer precision medicine, contribute to the discoveries of potential biological mechanisms and facilitate pharmacogenomics mining in the identification of clinically actionable biomarkers for both basic researchers and clinical practitioners.

    <title>Introduction</title>
    <p id="p0010">The complexity and heterogeneity of tumour genomes bring an enormous challenge when developing novel molecular therapeutics <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. These strategies greatly depend on our understanding of the genetic events that are causally implicated in malignancy <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Observations from clinical practice indicate that molecular alterations in the oncogenome strongly impact the effectiveness of anticancer therapies, and dozens of targeted drugs currently utilized in the clinic or developed in clinical trials have not been linked to specific molecular events <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. To bridge the gap between precision medicine and cancer heterogeneity, it is crucial to systematically shape a comprehensive pharmacogenomic landscape of patient-derived cancer models at scale. Recent years have witnessed rapidly accumulated large-scale drug sensitivity screens and corresponding multiomics across pancancer to characterize pharmacogenomics, capture the genetic diversity of cancer and identify drug response biomarkers in multiple public databases, including GDSC <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, DepMap <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, and NCI60 <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>; together, they present detailed genetic and pharmacological annotations on more than 2000 cancer cell models. Collectively, such data can be used for biological hypothesis testing, facilitating pharmacogenomics mining in the discovery or repurposing of new anticancer therapeutics and the identification of clinically actionable biomarkers. However, it is still significantly challenging for experimental biologists, especially those without bioinformatic experience, to integrate, explore, analyse, and visualize these large-scale pharmacogenomic profiles. Therefore, we developed the IMOPAC, an interactive and easy-to-use webserver for comprehensively characterizing the landscape of pharmacogenomic interactions and easily visualizing the pharmacogenomic profiles in preclinical cancer models.</p>
    <p id="p0015">There are numerous and diverse methods for analysing pharmacogenomics. Clustering analysis, based on multiomics, can identify which cell line models most closely resemble specific cancer subtypes and provide a better understanding of biological mechanisms by directly linking in vitro models to patient tumour samples with curated clinical data available. Liu et al., for instance, divided SNU398, HepG2 and SNU475 cells into three distinct DNA methylation HCC subtypes by unsupervised clustering analysis, which can act as a preclinical model representing different HCC molecular features to investigate the response of HCC cells to DNMTi treatment <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Pancancer expression analysis is also widely used to facilitate a comprehensive understanding of a given gene’s molecular pattern across multiple different cancer types. Chai et al. revealed that <italic>ACE2</italic> was overexpressed in lung adenocarcinoma by pancancer expression analysis <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. It is generally recognized that multiomics alterations, including somatic mutation, copy number variation, DNA methylation, transcriptomics, and proteomics, remarkably impact the clinical drug response to treatment and, in numerous situations, are potential biomarkers for sensitivity to chemotherapy <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Correlation analysis between drug sensitivity and multiomics alterations or pathway activity is applied to facilitate pharmacogenomics mining in the discovery of the underlying biological mechanism of drug resistance. By combining large-scale genomic dependency and pharmaceutical screening datasets within preclinical cell line models, Zhou et al. revealed that the combination of ERBB inhibitors could augment the efficacy of CDK4/6 inhibitor monotherapy in several squamous cell lines both in vitro and in vivo <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Cis-regulation analysis is used to investigate the correlation among the multiomics levels of a specific gene at the same time. In recent studies, several DNA methylation-driven genes were identified based on the correlation of gene expression and promoter DNA methylation <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Transregulation analysis is applied to estimate the association among various genes from the same or different omics. Because genes with similar expression features have a tendency to possess related functions, it is frequently desirable to detect genes with expression similarities to a known gene, acting as a known tumour chemotherapy target <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Gene fusions frequently result from rearrangements in cancer genomes. In various instances, gene fusions play an important role in oncogenesis <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. A better understanding of the gene fusion detected in cell lines may improve diagnosis and further benefit translational research into targeted therapies necessary to treat these malignancies <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. In addition, prediction of clinical drug response for cancer drugs is critical for personalized treatment <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>.</p>
    <p id="p0020">Currently, CellMinerCDB <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, PharmacoDB 2.0 <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref> and RNAactDrug <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref> have provided many useful visualization and analysis tools for pharmacogenomic analysis in patient-derived cancer cell lines. CellMinerCDB aims to integrate genomic alterations, molecular signatures and specific drug responses of cancer cell lines. PharmacoDB 2.0 has focused on integrating across a wider range of pharmacogenomics studies and includes major pancancer screening initiatives as well as smaller, tissue-specific studies. RNAactDrug is a comprehensive database of RNAs, including lncRNAs, miRNAs and mRNAs, associated with drug sensitivity from multiomics data, which allows the user to explore drug sensitivity and RNA molecule associations directly. While these databases are exceptionally valuable and widely used, many additional functions are often requested by experimental biologists but are not adequately addressed by existing tools. For example, correlation analyses between customized pathway activity (by user or originating from MSigDB <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>) and drug responses are commonly performed, but this function is not available in CellMinerCDB. In addition, while PharmacoDB 2.0 provides tissue-specific pharmacogenomic analysis, it does not integrate any gene essentiality data and does not allow to explore any molecular features associated with drug response. Furthermore, correlation analyses between drug response and other omics, including proteomics, metabolomics, and genetic dependency data, the visualization of tissue-specific gene–drug associations, and multivariate analysis of drug response with respect to multiple-omic features simultaneously are not available in RNAactDrug. None of the existing databases allow specific analyses based on cis-regulation (the correlation among the multiomics level of a specific gene) and trans-regulation (the association among various user-input genes from the same or different omics). The effect of DNA methylation in promoter versus gene body CGIs on its corresponding gene expression remains contradictory <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. The pharmacogenomic analyses based on gene body or promoter DNA methylation are not available in previous databases. Moreover, none of the databases provide a fusion query, molecular classification across pancancer or within specific cancer types, or pancancer expression analysis in patient-derived cancer cell lines. Based on the abovementioned needs that are not adequately addressed, we developed IMOPAC, a web server to deliver fast and customizable functionalities to complement with the existing tools.</p>

      <p id="p0030">IMOPAC is based on multiomics and drug response screens originating from three publicly available databases (6 omics, 992 cell lines from 28 cancer types and 173 drugs are available in GDSC; 12 omics, 1773 cell lines from 34 cancer types and 22 drugs are available in DepMap database; 8 omics, 60 cell lines from 9 cancer types and 695 drugs are available in NCI60) (<xref rid="tbl0005" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). A flowchart of the IMOPAC pipeline is shown in <xref rid="fig0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>B. The input gene-related CpG sites were annotated by the <italic>IlluminaHumanMethylation450kanno.ilmn12.hg19</italic> R package <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. The DNA methylation profiles of the gene promoter and body were generated by calculating the average DNA methylation value of CpG sites in the promoter and body region of the specific gene, respectively. Detailed clinical and biological features of all cell models, including age, sex, ploidy, microsatellite status, mutational burden, culture type, and culture medium, were retrieved from Cell Model Passports <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref> and DepMap <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>.

We excluded drugs whose sensitivity values were ‘NA’ in greater than 15 % of the cell lines. The gene fusion profile was estimated based on RNA-seq data from DepMap Public 22Q1.

      <p id="p0175">In the “Omics-Omics (transregulation)” module, trans-regulation analysis is used to estimate the association among various user-input genes from the same or different omics. For example, a numeric variable (the mRNA level of <italic>TP53</italic>) was chosen as a reference, and the correlation is visualized in <xref rid="fig0035" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>A. Meanwhile, the reference can also be categorical (the mutation status of <italic>TP53</italic>), and the association is visualized in <xref rid="fig0035" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>B.<fig id="fig0035"><label>Fig. 7</label><caption><p><bold>Examples of Omics-Omics (transregulation) correlation analysis in the “Omics-Omics (transregulation)” module.</bold> By clicking the "START" button, this module will present a trans-regulatory correlation plot based on users' input omics-gene lists, in which the samples are ordered ascendingly by the omics level of reference, white colour is used to present NA values, and the statistical results (for reference with continuous settings (A), black colour represents that the absolute correlation coefficients are more than user-defined cut-off; when the data type of reference is discrete (B), black colour represents that <italic>P</italic> or FDR values are less than 0.05) are shown on the right-hand side. Except for DNA methylation profiles, the omics levels of variables with continuous settings illustrated in the figure were normalized by deviation standardization.</p></caption><alt-text id="at0035">Fig. 7</alt-text><graphic xlink:href="gr7"/></fig></p>

      <title>Fusion analysis</title>
      <p id="p0180">Gene fusions frequently result from rearrangements in cancer genomes. In various instances, gene fusions play an important role in oncogenesis. In this module, a circos plot was used to visualize the comprehensive gene fusion landscape of the user-defined cell line in the “Fusions” module of IMOPAC. For example, the fusion landscape of HUH28, one of the bile duct cancer cell lines, was visualized based on the DepMap dataset in <xref rid="fig0040" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>.<fig id="fig0040"><label>Fig. 8</label><caption><p>The circos link plot is provided in the “Fusions” module based on users' custom input cell line.</p></caption><alt-text id="at0040">Fig. 8</alt-text><graphic xlink:href="gr8"/></fig></p>

      <title>Prediction of drug response analysis</title>
      <p id="p0185">In the “Machine Learning in Predicting Drug Response” module of IMOPAC, users could investigate the performance of multiomics signature, including mRNA, DNA methylation, CNV to predict the response of user-defined drug using ten maching learning algorithms with 5-fold stratified cross validation, which was visualized by AUC curve in GDSC dataset. For example, the ability of hypoxia signature in prediction of Nilotinib is visualized in <xref rid="fig0045" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9</xref> using random forest algorithm.<fig id="fig0045"><label>Fig. 9</label><caption><p><bold>Examples of Prediction of Drug response analysis in the “Machine Learning in Predicting Drug Response” module.</bold> By clicking the "START" button, this module will present an AUC curve based on the specific machine learning algorithm (Random forest), which will visualize the performance of predicting the Nilotinib response by hypoxia signature. (Hypoxia signature <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref> is based on 15-gene expression signature (ACOT7, ADM, ALDOA, CDKN3, ENO1, LDHA, MIF, MRPS17, NDRG1, P4HA1, PGAM1, SLC2A1, TPI1, TUBB6 and VEGFA)).</p></caption><alt-text id="at0045">Fig. 9</alt-text><graphic xlink:href="gr9"/></fig></p>

    <title>Discussion</title>
    <p id="p0195">IMOPAC is an interactive web application for interactive multiomics and pharmacological analyses of patient-derived cancer cell lines originating from three publicly available databases, including GDSC, DepMap, and NCI60, using the output of a standard processing pipeline for pharmacogenomics.</p>
    <p id="p0200">It was primarily developed to comprehensively characterize the landscape of pharmacogenomic interactions and easily visualize the pharmacogenomic profiles in preclinical cancer models. Our web server provides biologists, without the need for complex programming technology or expertise, with the ability to perform pharmacogenomics mining in the discovery of the potential biological mechanism of drug resistance or repurpose new anticancer therapeutics and identify clinically actionable biomarkers by the correlation analysis between drug sensitivity and multiomics alteration or pathway activity and allows users to easily identify which cell line models most closely resemble specific cancer subtypes and provide a better understanding of biological mechanisms by directly linking in vitro models with patient tumour samples with curated clinical data. What’s more, by utilizing the overlapping drug response data of the same cell lines in both the DepMap and GDSC databases and conducting correlation analysis, we have found that the two databases maintain good consistency (<xref rid="sec0150" ref-type="sec">Fig. S1</xref>). In addition, users can also perform pancancer expression analysis to assess a comprehensive understanding of a given gene’s molecular pattern across multiple different cancer types in our portal. Because genes with similar expression features have a tendency to possess related functions, it is frequently desirable to detect genes with expression similarities to a known gene, acting as a known tumour chemotherapy target. In doing so, cis- and trans-regulation correlation analysis can be performed in IMOPAC to identify multiomics molecules with homologous expression patterns. Because gene fusions play an important role in oncogenesis, the comprehensive gene fusion landscape of the user-defined cell line can also be visualized in our tool. Finnally, the drug response prediction module in IMOPAC on the basis of GDSC database, which provides 10 different machine learning algorithms for predicting response to various drugs based on user-defined omics data and gene sets, presents its potential value in guiding anti-cancer drug selection. However, it is crucial to note that the predictive model may be affected by other factors, and it is necessary to conduct further validation on an independent dataset in the future analysis.</p>
    <p id="p0205">At the same time, the custom drawing parameters of IMOPAC allow users great freedom to customize the visual output, for example, by selecting the type of omics, the method of correlation analysis, cluster algorithm, form of display for <italic>P</italic>-values, or ascertaining the cut-off of regression coefficient.</p>
    <p id="p0210">IMOPAC will be updated quarterly, with more analytical functions and interactive visualizations developed, as well as additional valuable cohort-based public datasets integrated in the future, which will collect multiomics and drug screens from patient-derived tumour xenografts and organoids. With these further developments, IMOPAC will complement other available tools to assist biological and clinical researchers in characterizing pharmacogenomics, capturing the genetic diversity of cancer and identifying drug response biomarkers across pancancer.</p>
    <p id="p0215">IMOPAC is a time-saving and intuitive web-based tool that provides users, especially biologists without background knowledge of computer programming, with a powerful tool for biomarker discovery, drug repurposing, and precision treatment. With continuous user feedback and further enhancement, IMOPAC has the potential to become an integral part of routine data analysis for experimental biologists.</p>
