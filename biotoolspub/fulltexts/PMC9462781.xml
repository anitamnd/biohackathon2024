      <p>Despite the world-wide prevalence of hypertension, there is a lack in open-source software for analyzing blood pressure data. The R package <monospace>bp</monospace> fills this gap by providing functionality for blood pressure data processing, visualization, and feature extraction. In addition to the comprehensive functionality, the package includes six sample data sets covering continuous arterial pressure data (AP), home blood pressure monitoring data (HBPM) and ambulatory blood pressure monitoring data (ABPM), making it easier for researchers to get started. The R package <monospace>bp</monospace> is publicly available on CRAN and at <ext-link xlink:href="https://github.com/johnschwenck/bp" ext-link-type="uri">https://github.com/johnschwenck/bp</ext-link>.</p>

    <title>Introduction</title>
    <p>Cardiovascular disease remains the leading cause of death worldwide, with hypertension alone affecting over 1.1 billion people annually according to the American Heart Association [<xref rid="pone.0268934.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Hypertension is characterized by elevated levels of blood pressure (BP), therefore diagnosis and effective management of hypertension relies on monitoring an individual’s BP readings. On one hand, BP can exhibit pronounced changes over a long-term time horizon (weeks, months, years, etc.) due to aging or behavioral factors (e.g., smoking). On the other hand, BP exhibits noticeable fluctuations over a 24 hour period (day-night changes, sleep-awake changes, etc.), with high 24 hour BP variability being an independent predictor of cardiovascular events such as heart attack, stroke, or another potentially fatal infarction [<xref rid="pone.0268934.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Thus, characterization of blood pressure variability (BPV), e.g. fluctuations in BP readings, depends on the chosen time-scale: <italic toggle="yes">very short-term</italic> (continuous beat-to-beat arterial BP), <italic toggle="yes">short-term</italic> (within 24 hours, typically in intervals ranging from 5 minutes to every hour), <italic toggle="yes">middle-term</italic> (day-to-day), and <italic toggle="yes">long-term</italic> (visit-to-visit, etc) [<xref rid="pone.0268934.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p>
    <p>Different BP measuring methods are used depending on the chosen time-scale. Continuous arterial pressure (AP) waveform data is collected at a very high sampling rate (i.e. 100 Hz) and used to assess very short-term variability. By contrast, devices that acquire data from a sphygmomanometer such as office monitors, home blood pressure monitors (HBPM), or ambulatory blood pressure monitors (ABPM) discretize the AP waveform data into summarized output. Home blood pressure monitoring (HBPM) devices or office readings are effective at measuring variability over the middle- and long-term horizons since patients are typically more willing to take measurements at a lower frequency (once or twice per day) for a longer duration (weeks, months, years). However, HBPM data are limited to measurements taken at convenient times, as the patient must initiate the recording. The resulting readings are unequally spaced in time, as they lack the consistent frequency of automatic measuring devices. Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) devices are used for short-term measurements as they take automatic readings from patient in a free environment at the pre-specified intervals (e.g. 30 min) over a 24-hour period or longer. A distinct advantage of ABPM compared to other methods is that they can provide nocturnal measurements at night in addition to diurnal measurements during the day.</p>
    <p>The complexity and variety of BP measurements data pose computational challenges for clinicians and researchers. Substantial effort is required to identify the proper BP data format, visualize the data, and calculate various metrics including the overall average, the variance, and temporal differences. Existing software for analyses of temporal BP data has several limitations. First, most of the available software is proprietary (e.g. AccuWin Pro<sup>™</sup> by SunTech Medical, CardioSoft<sup>™</sup> by GE Healthcare) with associated costs. Second, the “black-box” nature of underlying calculations makes these software undesirable for researchers looking for accessible and reproducible solutions. Third, the existing mobile applications designed for the patient’s self-management (e.g. OMRON connect, Withings Health Mate, QARDIO) lack export capabilities and are unable to calculate BP metrics beyond standard summary statistics for customized analysis. Finally, the existing open source software for BP data, e.g. Python package <monospace>pyPDA</monospace> [<xref rid="pone.0268934.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], have limited functionality (e.g. lack visualization capabilities, small set of BP variability measures). Thus, there remains a need for a comprehensive open-source software for the analysis of BP data.</p>
    <p>The objective of this work is to introduce <monospace>bp</monospace>—an open-source (GPL-3) R package dedicated to analyzing blood pressure data, and the first R package designed for this purpose. We chose to use R software platform over existing alternatives due to several reasons. First, R is a script-based programming language, which allows the creation of reproducible scripts for all BP data processing and metric calculation steps. This is not possible with point and click software solutions, such as Excel or SPSS statistical software. Second, while SAS and SPSS statistical software are commonly used for analyses of blood pressure datasets, R is also gaining popularity as evidenced by its use in multiple studies involving blood pressure data [<xref rid="pone.0268934.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0268934.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. This trend in using R for BP data sets is consistent with R being one of the most popular and heavily utilized data analysis platforms [<xref rid="pone.0268934.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0268934.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], with [<xref rid="pone.0268934.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] providing detailed guidelines and comparison of functionality for SAS and SPSS software users who wish to use R. Third, being free and open-source, R has an incredibly rich set of data analysis and graphics tools, with over 5,000 add-on packages available in addition to its base functionality. We are able to take advantage of this functionality in designing customized functions and visualizations. Specifically, the <monospace>bp</monospace> package has built-in automatic processing functionality for three main types of blood pressure data: arterial pressure (AP) continuous waveform recordings, home blood pressure monitoring (HBPM) and ambulatory blood pressure (ABPM). The <monospace>bp</monospace> package also allows one to assess the dynamics of blood pressure changes by implementing quantitative BP metrics such as ARV [<xref rid="pone.0268934.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], wSD [<xref rid="pone.0268934.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], morning BP surge [<xref rid="pone.0268934.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], dipping [<xref rid="pone.0268934.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] and several others. Finally, <monospace>bp</monospace> has multiple visualization capabilities to assist with data interpretation.</p>
    <p>In this paper, we summarize the BP data sets included with the package, describe the package’s automatic data processing functionality, and provide an overview of implemented BP metrics and visualizations. To illustrate the package functionality in practice, we highlight two case studies that analyze both a single-subject data set with HBPM measurements (Case Study I), and a multi-subject data set with ABPM measurements (Case Study II).</p>

    <p><monospace>bp_children</monospace>: The data set contains HBPM measurements on 1, 283 children from Bristol, UK. Three blood pressure readings per visit were collected (at 9 years of age and 11 years of age). Additionally, information on their physical activity has been collected. The aim of the study [<xref rid="pone.0268934.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] was to examine how sedentary behavior influences children progressing through primary school, and to understand the association between elevated blood pressure in children and its impact on the development of cardiovascular disease into adulthood.</p>

    <title>Data processing</title>
    <p>All of the functions in the <monospace>bp</monospace> package assume that the data has been processed in a common format. To reduce the required data processing burden, the package includes a <monospace>process_data</monospace> function that transforms the input data source into a data frame with a unified format. The underlying functionality includes standardization of the column names, formats for dates and times, and classification of readings into blood pressure stages among other processing steps. The <monospace>process_data</monospace> function should be applied first before performing any other analyses using the <monospace>bp</monospace> package.</p>
    <p>As an example, consider the <monospace>bp_jhs</monospace> and <monospace>bp_hypnos</monospace> data sets. These data sets correspond to different types of BP data (HBPM and ABPM, respectively), have different column names, and not all of the same variables are present in both data sets.</p>

    <p>First, the user must specify the type of blood pressure data (“<monospace>ap</monospace>”, “<monospace>hbpm</monospace>” or “<monospace>abpm</monospace>”) via the <monospace>bp_type</monospace> argument, where the default is “<monospace>hbpm</monospace>”. Specifying the correct type is crucial as the behavior of some package functionality changes depending on the type. For example, nocturnal metrics, such as <monospace>dip_calc</monospace> or <monospace>mbps</monospace> (refer to <italic toggle="yes">Nocturnal BP metrics</italic> section), can be used with ABPM data (which contain nocturnal recordings) but not with HBPM data (which cannot contain nocturnal readings as the user must be awake to initiate the recording). The time of nocturnal readings is determined from either the user-supplied <monospace>WAKE</monospace> column (based on additional information from an actigraphy device), or the <monospace>ToD_int</monospace> parameter (based on time of day) in the absence of <monospace>WAKE</monospace>. The default nocturnal period (when <monospace>WAKE = 0</monospace>) ranges from 12AM to 6AM.</p>
    <p>Second, the user must specify the column names corresponding to <monospace>sbp</monospace> (systolic blood pressure) and <monospace>dbp</monospace> (diastolic blood pressure). The specification of the remaining columns names (i.e. heart rate <monospace>hr</monospace>) is optional based on the data available in a specific dataset.

      <title>Classification of blood pressure into stages</title>
      <p>In clinical practice, it is common to characterize blood pressure into stages based on the BP readings. The explicit characterization of the stages, however, may change with time as new findings emerge.</p>
      <p>Recent guidelines from the American Heart Association [<xref rid="pone.0268934.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] suggest five stages: Normal (SBP &lt; 120 and DBP &lt; 80), Elevated / Pre-Hypertension (SBP ≥ 120 and DBP &lt; 80), Stage 1 Hypertension (SBP ∈ [130, 139] or DBP ∈ [80, 89]), Stage 2 Hypertension (SBP ≥ 140 or DBP ≥ 90), and Hypertensive Crisis (SBP ≥ 180 or DBP ≥ 120). While these thresholds offer insight into an individual’s hypertension severity, they do not characterize the entire spectrum of blood pressure variability. It is unclear how to classify subjects who exhibit isolated systolic or diastolic hypertensive episodes, where either the systolic value is unusually high and the diastolic value is either normal or unusually low, or vice versa. Lee et al. [<xref rid="pone.0268934.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] outlines eight blood pressure stages that incorporate isolated systolic or diastolic hypertensive episode thresholds, leading to an unambiguous 2-to-1 mapping of (SBP, DBP) values to a stage as described in <xref rid="pone.0268934.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>.</p>

      <p>Following these guidelines, <monospace>process_data</monospace> function generates three columns with blood pressure classification: <monospace>SBP_CATEGORY</monospace>, <monospace>DBP_CATEGORY</monospace> and <monospace>BP_CLASS</monospace>. The first two separately classify SBP or DBP recording (as either “Normal”, “Elevated”, “Stage 1” or “Stage 2”), whereas <monospace>BP_CLASS</monospace> allocates the stage based on the paired value (SBP, DBP) using the classification as in [<xref rid="pone.0268934.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p>
      <p>The threshold values in <xref rid="pone.0268934.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> are based on office BP values. These thresholds are often adjusted when monitoring hypertension via out-of-office HBPM [<xref rid="pone.0268934.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] and ABPM measurements [<xref rid="pone.0268934.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], however there is some variability across studies and guidelines regarding the recommended adjustments. We refer the reader to Tables 3 and 4 in [<xref rid="pone.0268934.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] for summary of thresholds correspondence with ABPM and HBPM, respectively. <monospace>process_data</monospace> function allows customization of default threshold values to match the adjustment chosen by the user via optional <monospace>bp_cutoffs</monospace> argument. <monospace>process_data</monospace> function also allows for automatic thresholds adjustment based on American Heart Association guidelines [<xref rid="pone.0268934.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] by setting <monospace>guidelines = “AHA”</monospace>.</p>

    <p>The functionality of the <bold>bp</bold> package revolves around recommendations outlined in O’Brien and Atkins [<xref rid="pone.0268934.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] to facilitate the wider use of BP data in clinical practice. Specifically, it focuses on ease of use, visualizations, the ability to create a user-friendly one-page report, and the ability to export the output for research purposes. All implemented BP metrics and visualizations are thus available as both standalone functions and as part of an aggregated report suitable for clinical use. <xref rid="pone.0268934.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> provides an overview of the available metrics and visualizations in version 2.0.1 of the <monospace>bp</monospace> package.

      <title>Characterizing blood pressure variability</title>
      <p>As previously mentioned, blood pressure variability (BPV) plays a crucial role in predicting health outcomes, and characterization of BPV depends on the chosen time-scale: <italic toggle="yes">very short-term</italic> (continuous beat-to-beat arterial BP), <italic toggle="yes">short-term</italic> (within 24 hours), <italic toggle="yes">middle-term</italic> (day-to-day), and <italic toggle="yes">long-term</italic> (visit-to-visit, etc) [<xref rid="pone.0268934.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p>
      <p>The <monospace>bp</monospace> package contains traditional measures of dispersion, such as standard deviation (SD) and the coefficient of variation (CV), in addition to more modern metrics from the literature, such as the average real variability (<monospace>bp_arv</monospace>) and successive variation (<monospace>bp_sv</monospace>). The latter two take into account the temporal information in BP changes, in contrast with SD and CV. ARV is calculated as the average of absolute differences between consecutive readings [<xref rid="pone.0268934.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], while SV is based on squared differences [<xref rid="pone.0268934.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p>

      <p>A comprehensive comparison of all BP variability metrics can be acquired using the <monospace>bp_stats</monospace> function. Furthermore, the <monospace>bp_tables</monospace> function offers a list of exploratory tables summarizing frequencies of BP readings by BP stages, time of day, day of the week, etc.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, the conventional 24-h standard deviation (SD) fails to account for the contribution of the nocturnal BP fall. The weighted standard deviation (wSD), by contrast, is a combination of standard deviations during the diurnal and nocturnal periods. Thus, it incorporates additional information about the distribution of BP measurements, and has been shown to be associated with ventricular mass index (in contrast to standard SD) [<xref rid="pone.0268934.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Traditional SD is typically larger than wSD as it does not factor in nocturnal fall. As wSD relies on data during the nocturnal period (i.e. measurements from ABPM), it is calculated within the <monospace>bp_sleep_metrics</monospace> function.</p>

      <title>Nocturnal BP metrics</title>
      <p>Blood pressure follows a circadian variation characterized by fluctuations in a subject’s BP levels which rise during the day (diurnal state) when the subject is awake and fall during the night (nocturnal state), typically when the subject is at rest or asleep. This nocturnal BP reduction was first referred to as “dipping” by O’Brien [<xref rid="pone.0268934.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] who noted that subjects whose blood pressure does not follow this pattern are at an increased risk for cerebrovascular complications, i.e. stroke.</p>
      <p>The <monospace>bp</monospace> package delineates BP measurements into two states based on the <monospace>WAKE</monospace> column where <monospace>WAKE = 1</monospace> corresponds to the diurnal period (awake/daytime), and <monospace>WAKE = 0</monospace> corresponds to the nocturnal period (asleep/nighttime). It is important to note that in a clinical context, sleep is primarily determined via electroencephalogram (EEG) equipment; for the sake of simplicity however, the <monospace>bp</monospace> package makes no distinction of whether the sleep indicator in the <monospace>WAKE</monospace> column is derived from EEG-recorded sleep data or sleep data inferred from actigraphy devices common among most consumer-grade fitness trackers. The <monospace>WAKE</monospace> column is either specified by the user (e.g. in case this information is available from actigraphy), or is initialized by <monospace>process_data</monospace> function based on time of day (<monospace>ToD</monospace>) argument, with night time taken as sleep, and all other times as wake (refer to <italic toggle="yes">Data processing</italic> section).</p>
      <p>The percentage of nocturnal decline (known as the dipping percentage) is a BP metric calculated as the percentage change between average BP values during sleep and wake:

      <p>The Ohasama Study [<xref rid="pone.0268934.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] outlines four dipping classification groups: (1) <italic toggle="yes">inverted (or reverse) dippers</italic>, (2) <italic toggle="yes">non-dippers</italic>, (3) <italic toggle="yes">dippers</italic>, and (4) <italic toggle="yes">extreme dippers</italic>.

    <title>Case Study I—Single subject HBPM data</title>
    <p>HBPM data have a higher degree of measurement error as a result of the user initializing the BP monitoring device [<xref rid="pone.0268934.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] compared to ABPM data which automatically takes recordings at prescribed intervals. Here, we consider the <monospace>bp_jhs</monospace> data set [<xref rid="pone.0268934.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] which corresponds to a single-subject HBPM data set, wherein the user took multiple measurements in succession within short intervals of time. The user also exhibited atypical circadian rhythms (falling asleep well after midnight). We show how the <monospace>bp</monospace> package can be used to automatically process the data, aggregate the consecutive measurements, adjust the day-night allocation based on individual circadian rhythms, and create a one page report for easy communication of HBPM summaries.</p>
    <sec id="sec010">
      <title>Aggregation of consecutive readings</title>
      <p>Schulze at al. [<xref rid="pone.0268934.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] argue that the number of HBPM BP readings taken in succession along with the nature of how the readings were taken (left vs. right arm, supine vs. sitting vs. standing, etc.) significantly influences the variation of the resulting BP measurements. Furthermore, the longer one sits to take additional readings, the more one’s BP decreases due to the natural decline in BP over prolonged sitting time. Therefore, it is recommended to average successive readings to reduce measurement error.</p>
      <p>In the case of <monospace>bp_jhs</monospace>, there are many instances where readings were taken in succession (generally within 3 minutes), but the subject was not consistent in taking the same number of successive readings at the same times throughout each day. A subset of the data <italic toggle="yes">without</italic> averaging is shown below.</p>
      <p>
        <bold>Code Block 6</bold>

      <p>There are three separate instances of consecutive readings in the above output: two recordings on Sunday around 3:15PM (rows 10—11) within two minutes of each other, three recordings on Monday around 5:40AM (rows 7—9) within three minutes of each other, and two recordings on Tuesday around 1:45PM (rows 4—5) within two minutes of each other.</p>
      <p>The <monospace>process_data</monospace> function automatically aggregates BP measurements using the <monospace>agg = TRUE</monospace> option with a user-specified threshold (<monospace>agg_thresh</monospace>) denoting the maximum duration (in minutes) between successive readings, with the default value being 3 minutes.</p>
      <p>

      <p>In the output above, all instances of consecutive readings within 3 minutes of each other have been averaged together as in the case of rows 4—5, rows 7—9, and rows 10—11. Previously, the BP stages in the original data set classified row 7 as <italic toggle="yes">ISH—S1</italic>, row 8 as <italic toggle="yes">IDH—S1</italic> and row 9 as <italic toggle="yes">ISH—S2</italic>. After aggregation, the readings for this particular instance are all reclassified to <italic toggle="yes">Stage 1</italic> based on their new average values (133 SBP / 80 DBP). By default, the number of rows stays in tact representing the original data, however the user can further collapse the data set to omit redundant rows using the <monospace>collapse_df</monospace> argument.</p>

      </p>
      <p>As shown above, when <monospace>collapse_df = TRUE</monospace>, the first row of each consecutive reading sequence is kept and the redundant rows (in this case, rows 5, 8, 9, and 11 from the previous output) that remain are removed, reducing the overall size of the resulting data set.</p>

      <title>End-of-Day (EOD) determination</title>
      <p>Depending on the population of interest, the delineation between night and day may change due to late-night work shifts, time zone differences, or individuals’ circadian rhythms. In the case of the <monospace>bp_jhs</monospace> data set, the subject almost never fell asleep before midnight, with the sleep onset times being highly variable (from before midnight to 5AM). Given that the data is of the HBMP type, it is clear that each reading occurred when the subject was awake; however, summarizing such data using the standard midnight cutoff for end-of-day may not be advisable. Depending on the context, readings could be considered as part of either the previous day’s readings (in the event that the reading was taken very late and the subject had not yet gone to sleep) or the current day’s readings (in the case that the subject woke up very early).</p>
      <p>Notice that in the original (non-collapsed) subset of the <monospace>bp_jhs</monospace> data from the <italic toggle="yes">Aggregation of consecutive readings</italic> section, the consecutive reading sequence on Monday night (rows 7—9) as well as the non-consecutive readings on Sunday night (rows 12 and 13) are all recorded in the early hours of the day (around 5AM and 2AM, correspondingly). These readings are thus either a part of the previous day’s readings (i.e. the reading was taken very late and the subject had not yet gone to sleep), or the current day’s readings (i.e. the subject woke up very early). By default, all readings will be assigned to the current date; however, this can be adjusted by the user by supplying the optional end-of-day argument (<monospace>eod</monospace>) in the <monospace>process_data</monospace> function. Here, we set the cutoff at 6AM, so that all readings in the early morning hours are automatically allocated to the previous day.</p>

The first table returns average SBP and DBP values broken down by <monospace>WAKE</monospace> status (where 0 indicates nocturnal measurements, i.e. the sleep period, and 1 indicates diurnal measurements, i.e. the wake period), and groups such as <monospace>VISIT</monospace> (if applicable). The second table returns dipping percentages (in proportion format) and corresponding dipping classifications according to <xref rid="pone.0268934.t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>.</p>
      <p>From the output, subject 70435 exhibits pronounced decreases in nocturnal BP during the first visit (“dipper” and “extreme” classifications for SBP and DBP, respectively); however, both SBP and DBP show a reverse dipping pattern for the subject’s second visit. In contrast, subject 70439 has similar dipping percentages for SBP across both visits (with the consistent “reverse” dipping classification), with DBP classification shifting from the “non-dipper” to “reverse” dipper category. Note also that the overall BP averages for subject 70439 decreased from first to second visit (the <monospace>avg_SBP</monospace> and <monospace>avg_DBP</monospace> columns) creating a contrast between the overall lowering of BP between visits and the worsening of the nocturnal patterns of the individual’s DBP dipping behavior.</p>
      <p>Examining the time series plot for subject 70439 (<xref rid="pone.0268934.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4</xref>) in conjunction with the output of <monospace>dip_calc</monospace> reveals an apparent DBP measurement at the end of the first visit that is an outlier. This is supported by investigating the top three highest DBP values for this subject using the <monospace>dplyr</monospace> package [<xref rid="pone.0268934.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]:</p>

        </disp-formula>
      </p>
      <p>The largest DBP value is nearly double the second highest value; a clear indication of an outlier. <monospace>bp</monospace> allows automatic filtering for such outliers in the <monospace>process_data</monospace> function via <monospace>DUL</monospace> argument (DBP Upper Limit). By default, the argument is set to 140 in accordance with [<xref rid="pone.0268934.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]; however, to remove the outlier for subject 70439, we set <monospace>DUL = 130</monospace> and recalculate the dipping percentages.</p>

        </disp-formula>
      </p>
      <p>Eliminating the outlier in <monospace>hypnos_proc</monospace> during the first visit decreased the overall average SBP and DBP values in the <monospace>hypnos_proc_recalc</monospace> output during the wake period (specifically, from 160 to 158 for <monospace>avg_SBP</monospace> and from 69.3 to 64.4 for <monospace>avg_DBP</monospace> in output <monospace>[[1]]</monospace> when <monospace>VISIT = 1</monospace> and <monospace>WAKE = 1</monospace>). This led to a decrease in the percentage that SBP fell during the nocturnal period from -4.42% to -5.59% (more precisely, an increase in the percentage that SBP rose during the nocturnal period) and a decrease in the percentage that DBP fell during the nocturnal period from +9.61% to +2.73% as a result of a smaller magnitude difference between values during wake and nocturnal periods. Note that despite the adjustments to these dipping percentages, the dipping classifications remained the same.</p>
      <p>The function <monospace>dip_class_plot</monospace> provides a display of dipping percentages together with their classification in accordance with [<xref rid="pone.0268934.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], and can be used to visualize the effect of removing the outlier by considering both the original data and the data after processing.</p>

      <title>Standard deviation (SD) vs weighted standard deviation (wSD)</title>
      <p>As noted earlier in the <italic toggle="yes">Characterizing blood pressure variability</italic> section, conventional 24-h standard deviation (SD) fails to account for the contribution of the nocturnal BP fall and is typically larger than wSD. This is reflected for subject 70439 in <monospace>hypnos_proc</monospace> data (original data with outlier).</p>

        </disp-formula>
      </p>
      <p>We now consider how SD and wSD change when the outlier is removed (via the <monospace>hypnos_proc_recalc</monospace> data).</p>

      </p>
      <p>As expected, the removal of the outlying measurement as described in the <italic toggle="yes">Nocturnal dipping calculation</italic> section reduces both metrics of standard deviation (SD and wSD); however, the conventional SD still remains greater than wSD.</p>

    <title>Discussion and future directions</title>
    <p>The <monospace>bp</monospace> package is designed to simplify the analysis of blood pressure data, and assist users with data processing, data visualization, and BP metric calculations following recommendations set forth by O’Brien and Atkins [<xref rid="pone.0268934.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The package includes a variety of sample data sets as references that cover all BP data types (AP, HBPM, and ABPM) to help get started. New BP metrics and visualizations will be incorporated into future versions of <monospace>bp</monospace> as they develop. The free and open-source nature of R makes the <monospace>bp</monospace> package advantageous compared with existing proprietary commercial software (e.g. AccuWin Pro<sup>™</sup> by SunTech Medical, CardioSoft<sup>™</sup> by GE Healthcare) and further allows for the creation of reproducible scripts that document the full analysis workflow from data processing to visualizations. A current limitation is that the users are required to have R programming experience, which may be a drawback for researchers and clinicians who are accustomed to point and click graphical user interfaces. Ideally, we would like to have a software solution that combines the advantages of R language with graphical user interface. This is possible to achieve by developing an accompanying Shiny application [<xref rid="pone.0268934.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], an interactive web application that provides graphical user interface for underlying R scripts. It is our goal to develop such a Shiny App for the <bold>bp</bold> package to further increase package accessibility in future work. Another limitation is the lack of device-specific import capabilities. An ideal configuration will allow to load the data directly from the device into R, however this will likely necessitate substantial adjustments to application programming interface (API) of the device or associated app, falling outside the scope of R package capabilities. An alternative is to work directly with existing export capabilities of the devices, most of which allow to export the data into CSV format. Such format is easy to load into R, and any device-specific discrepancies in column names, time configurations or pre-calculated valuates are standardized by <monospace>process_data</monospace> function as long as two basic inputs (SBP and DBP) are specified. Nevertheless, continuous development of new ABPM devices coupled with potentially varying data export formats across devices present definite challenges for any blood pressure analyses software. Finally, it would be of great interest to compare custom <monospace>bp</monospace> functionalities like dipping calculation in <monospace>dip_calc</monospace> against other software solutions, however such cross-comparison is challenging due to the lack of custom BP functionalities in SAS and SPSS software, and the cost associated with obtaining proprietary BP software (e.g. AccuWin Pro<sup>™</sup> by SunTech Medical). Nevertheless, we hope that public availability of our example datasets together with underlying source code is a useful preliminary step toward this endeavor.</p>

    <p>The <ext-link xlink:href="http://www.plosone.org/static/policies.action#sharing" ext-link-type="uri">PLOS Data policy</ext-link> requires authors to make all data underlying the findings described in their manuscript fully available without restriction, with rare exception (please refer to the Data Availability Statement in the manuscript PDF file). The data should be provided as part of the manuscript or its supporting information, or deposited to a public repository. For example, in addition to summary statistics, the data points behind means, medians and variance measures should be available. If there are restrictions on publicly sharing data—e.g. participant privacy or use of data from a third party—those must be specified.<!-- </font> --></p>

    <p>Reviewer #1: In this paper, the authors present a program for analyzing continuous BP, home BP, and ambulatory BP data. The program is developed in R language and provides data analysis and sample datasets functions.</p>
    <p>In general, although not novel, the idea is interesting since the software is provided as an open-source program.</p>
    <p>However, as correctly stated by the authors, the user needs to know how the R language works.</p>
    <p>Usually, BP data sets are analyzed with statistical packages such as SAS and SPSS. These programs are not free, at variance with the proposed program. However, they are beneficial in analyzing BP data by constructing simple lines of code. The authors should discuss the advantage of their program compared to these packages. The authors should have validated results obtained with their code with any known validated and certified software.</p>
    <p>A significant problem with this program is the classification of BP values which is based on office BP that are applied to home and ambulatory BP that have different thresholds. Since they are statisticians, I recommend they seek the support of an expert in out-of-office BP analysis. They should also refer to significant guidelines such as those from ESH: home BP <ext-link xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1097/HJH.0000000000002922" ext-link-type="uri">https://doi.org/10.1097/HJH.0000000000002922</ext-link></p>
    <p>ambulatory BP <ext-link xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1097/HJH.0000000000000221" ext-link-type="uri">https://doi.org/10.1097/HJH.0000000000000221</ext-link></p>
    <p>I recommend moving the explanation regarding wSD to the section “Characterizing blood pressure variability,” to which it better belongs.</p>
    <p>Reviewer #2: The work presented by Schwenck et al. addresses the unmet need for an open-source environment that is able to perform a large variety of blood pressure-related calculations in R independent from the device manufacturer. The manuscript is very well written, contains an adequate amount of references for all employed protocols and calculations and gives plenty of examples on how to use the software. I only have a few minor comments for the authors.</p>
    <p>1) I might have missed it, but the open source license of the software should be mentioned in the manuscript.</p>
    <p>2) Code listings from e.g. from line 508 on could include code comment blocks such as “# here we load the data” or similar as this makes the blocks easier to read and may open the software to novice R users.</p>
    <p>3) For the final version of the manuscript it may also be beneficial to add some kind of label to code blocks in order to refer to them from within the text.</p>
    <p>4) Although this goes more in the direction of the software than the manuscript, but I wonder if the authors have plans to include import functions for data from specific devices, such as Omron (where a clumsy CSV export is available).</p>

    <p>We thank the reviewers for their comments, and we have included our point by point response as a separate pdf compiled together with other submission files (the response is compiled in the end). The main changes are the following:</p>
    <p>- Expanded justification of the benefits of R software platform over existing alternatives</p>
    <p>- Significantly expanded discussion of limitations of the work and directions in need of further research</p>
    <p>- Expanded software functionality to allow both default and customized adjustment of BP treshold values depending on BP type (HBPM or ABPM) with corresponding summary in the manuscript of the differences between office and out-of-office BP thresholds</p>
    <p>- Expanded comments on and labelling of all code blocks to enhance readability and accessibility of examples</p>
