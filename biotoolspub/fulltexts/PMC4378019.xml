        <title>Background</title>
        <p>The initiation of flowering is an important developmental transition as it marks the beginning of the reproductive phase in plants. The MADS-box transcription factors (TFs) FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC) and SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE (SVP) form a complex to repress the expression of genes that initiate flowering in Arabidopsis. Both TFs play a central role in the regulatory network by conferring seasonal patterns of flowering. However, their interdependence and biological relevance when acting as a complex have not been extensively studied.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>Results</title>
        <p>We characterized the effects of both TFs individually and as a complex on flowering initiation using transcriptome profiling and DNA-binding occupancy. We find four major clusters regulating transcriptional responses, and that DNA binding scenarios are highly affected by the presence of the cognate partner. Remarkably, we identify genes whose regulation depends exclusively on simultaneous action of both proteins, thus distinguishing between the specificity of the SVP:FLC complex and that of each TF acting individually. The downstream targets of the SVP:FLC complex include a higher proportion of genes regulating floral induction, whereas those bound by either TF independently are biased towards floral development. Many genes involved in gibberellin-related processes are bound by the SVP:FLC complex, suggesting that direct regulation of gibberellin metabolism by FLC and SVP contributes to their effects on flowering.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>Conclusions</title>
        <p>The regulatory codes controlled by SVP and FLC were deciphered at the genome-wide level revealing substantial flexibility based on dependent and independent DNA binding that may contribute to variation and robustness in the regulation of flowering.</p>

    <title>Background</title>
    <p>Developmental programs of multicellular organisms require the establishment of defined temporal and spatial patterns of gene expression. In higher plants, the initiation of flowering is the first step in reproductive development, and is controlled by a complex regulatory network that converges on the transcription of a small number of floral integrator genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. This network primarily consists of transcription factors (TFs) that bind to <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements controlling gene transcription. Identifying the individual binding sites of TFs and their precise modes of regulation enables definition of such networks. The genome-wide binding sites of several TFs involved in flowering-time control and floral development were described based on the results of chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) focused on single TFs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. However, many TFs act in protein complexes, and both their activity and the sites to which they bind are likely to be strongly modulated by the presence or absence of other members of the complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Here, we examined the individual and combined activities of the MADS-box TFs SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE (SVP) and FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC), which, as flowering repressors that control the effect of environmental cues on floral induction, fulfil key functions within the network controlling flowering in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>.</p>
    <p>Over 2,000 TFs are encoded in the <italic>A. thaliana</italic> genome and these were classified into 58 families [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], many of which contribute to developmental programs. Among these TFs, the MADS domain family represents a group conserved in nearly all eukaryotes, but greatly expanded in land plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. MADS domain TFs in plants are heavily involved in controlling different stages of flowering, including the floral transition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] and determination of floral organ identity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] in which interacting MADS-box proteins form multimeric complexes that configure the ABC model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. According to this model different combinations of MADS-box TFs act in transcriptional complexes to specify distinct floral organ identities, which emphasises the significance of MADS protein complexes in conferring specificity.</p>
    <p>Two members of the MADS-box family, FLC and SVP, enhance the flowering response to seasonal cues by repressing flowering under non-inductive conditions. These functions were defined by genetic analysis that placed FLC in the autonomous and vernalisation pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. <italic>FLC</italic> represses flowering but its mRNA level is reduced by exposure to winter cold (vernalisation), allowing flowering to proceed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Similarly, SVP strongly delays flowering under non-inductive short days (SDs) but its transcription declines in the inflorescence meristem under inductive long days (LDs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. <italic>SVP</italic> mRNA reappears shortly after in floral primordia, allowing this TF to participate in flower development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. The abundance and activity of SVP protein are also reduced under high ambient temperatures that promote flowering [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].</p>
    <p>The inhibition of flowering caused by FLC and SVP is, at least in part, due to repression of the floral integrator genes <italic>FLOWERING LOCUS T</italic> (<italic>FT</italic>) and <italic>SUPPRESSOR OF OVEREXPRESSION OF CONSTANS1</italic> (<italic>SOC1</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. While <italic>FT</italic> is expressed in the leaves during floral induction, the major site of action for <italic>SOC1</italic> is in the shoot apical meristem. FLC acts in both organs to repress expression of these genes and delay flowering [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Similarly, genetic analysis, gene expression data and transgenic plants implicate SVP protein as acting in both tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Mutations in either <italic>FLC</italic> or <italic>SVP</italic> lead to early flowering and increased levels of <italic>FT</italic> and <italic>SOC1</italic> mRNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Notably, the double mutant results in an even earlier flowering phenotype, indicating that <italic>SVP</italic> and <italic>FLC</italic> have partially redundant functions during floral repression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>].</p>
    <p>Consistent with their shared activity in repressing flowering and the capacity of many other MADS-box TFs to form transcriptional complexes, SVP and FLC proteins directly interact [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. In agreement with this conclusion, each TF binds to similar regions of <italic>FT</italic> and <italic>SOC1</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. In addition, these proteins form high order molecular complexes with other MADS-box proteins, including MADS AFFECTING FLOWERING 3 (MAF3) and FLOWERING LOCUS M (FLM), which belong to the same subclade of the family as FLC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Functional analyses of SVP-FLM complex revealed the participation of SVP in the regulation of flowering response to ambient temperature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Furthermore, a high throughput yeast two hybrid interaction map of <italic>A. thaliana</italic> MADS-box proteins also reported, among others, APETALA1 (AP1), SOC1, and SEPALLATA 3 (SEP3) as components of the SVP interactome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>], and these interactions contribute to flower meristem identity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>].</p>
    <p>The activities of SVP and FLC were studied by ChIP PCR on individual target genes, and their genome-wide binding maps were characterized separately by ChIP followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq) or ChIP-on-chip approaches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. This analysis led to the identification of pathways in which each TF participates throughout development. However, no attempt has been made to decode their combined activity across the genome. More generally, TF binding sites are usually compared in separate experiments. However, defining binding sites of TF 'A' in the mutant background of its partner 'B' and <italic>vice versa</italic> has the potential to identify <italic>bona fide</italic> dependencies and to elucidate how both factors act in a combinatorial fashion to regulate transcription.</p>
    <p>Here, we studied the combinatorial activity of the TFs FLC and SVP at a genome-wide level by combining ChIP-seq and transcriptome gene expression profiling on experiments performed on different genetic backgrounds and tissues. Through this comprehensive approach we identified direct targets of SVP in the presence and absence of its partner FLC. Reciprocally, FLC ChIP-seq was performed in wild-type and the <italic>svp</italic> mutant. Our study shows that the formation of the FLC:SVP complex substantially influences occupancy of each factor at specific binding sites. The findings demonstrate that complex formation is indeed essential for DNA binding to a subset of genes, leading to the identification of novel <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements that may contribute to the recruitment of the complex. The distinct spatial roles of SVP and FLC are emphasised by the marked differences in observed gene expression profiles between leaves and apices. Thus, by describing the genome-wide effects of two MADS-box proteins capable of forming a multimeric complex we show how their interactions generate diverse patterns of co-regulation.</p>

      <title>Transcriptional network controlled by FLC and SVP in leaves and apices</title>
      <p>FLC and SVP delay flowering by repressing the expression of target genes such as <italic>FT</italic> and <italic>SOC1</italic> in the leaves and apices, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>], and were reported to participate in the same protein complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. SVP and FLC influence flowering time through various genetic pathways, but a specific function for their interaction remains unknown. We addressed this issue at the level of gene regulation in leaves and apices by performing genome-wide transcriptome analyses in single and double mutants of <italic>SVP</italic> and <italic>FLC</italic> under SDs. All plants carried a functional <italic>FRIGIDA</italic> (<italic>FRI</italic>) allele to ensure high levels of <italic>FLC</italic> transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. The transcriptome profiles of each single and double mutant were compared to wild-type <italic>SVP FLC FRI</italic> (WT) and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were selected for subsequent analysis (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>).</p>
      <p>DEGs differed between apices and leaves (Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>A). Overall, more genes changed in expression in leaves (818 genes) than in apices (184 genes), suggesting that SVP and FLC have broader roles in regulating gene expression in leaves. Furthermore, tissue-specific differences in the contributions of FLC and SVP were observed. While FLC regulated approximately twice as many genes as SVP in leaves, this relationship was reversed in apices (Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>A).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Characterization of the transcriptional network controlled by FLC and SVP in leaves and apices.

Plants were grown for 2 weeks under SD conditions, and leaves and apices were collected 8 h after dawn (Zeitgeber 8 (ZT8)).

      <p>Between 70 and 90% of DEGs in leaves showed increased transcript levels in mutants, in agreement with FLC and SVP acting predominantly as transcriptional repressors. However, in apices only 33 to 40% of DEGs increased in expression (Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>B; Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>), suggesting that many of the DEGs in the apical samples are indirectly regulated by FLC and SVP, or that these TFs may act more frequently as transcriptional activators in the apex. Among the genes that were up- or down-regulated in leaves or apices, only 10 to 15% were shared between the three mutant genotypes (121 in leaves and 13 in apices, Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>A) and these behaved similarly in single and double mutants (Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>B; Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). Moreover, DEGs identified only in double mutants were usually affected to a small degree in each single mutant (less than two-fold compared with WT and therefore below the cut-off to call a DEG; Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>B; Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>), suggesting an additive role of both TFs in the regulation of these genes.</p>
      <p>The roles of FLC and SVP in controlling gene expression during the transition to flowering were then evaluated. Flowering of <italic>A. thaliana</italic> is induced by exposure to LDs, and five LDs were sufficient to commit plants to flower [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Therefore, to identify genes that respond early in the flowering process, before commitment, another set of expression profiling experiments was performed on the same genotypes two days after transferring plants from SDs to LDs. SVP and FLC were required for the differential expression of 30 to 40% of the DEGs identified during transition from SDs to LDs in WT (Additional files <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref> and <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>). Furthermore, only 20% of DEGs in WT were shared between leaves and apices upon transition to LDs, indicating that the processes occurring during induction of flowering differ between these tissues (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>).</p>
      <p>Taken together, the gene expression profiling experiments revealed the signalling network defined by the two TFs and showed that they have differential yet partially redundant contributions in leaves and apices.</p>

      <title>Four patterns defined by FLC and SVP govern gene regulation in leaves and apices</title>
      <p>Single mutations in <italic>FLC</italic> or <italic>SVP</italic> partially suppress the late-flowering phenotype of <italic>SVP FLC FRI</italic> while FLC and SVP physically interact, suggesting the resulting complex has a significant role in the repression of flowering [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. If this protein complex were responsible for the full transcriptional response of SVP and FLC, single and double mutants would be expected to show similar transcriptome changes. However, our genome-wide transcriptome analysis demonstrated that transcriptional regulation by FLC and SVP cannot be explained in this way (Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>A,B), but rather is defined as the activity of the complex plus the activities of the individual TFs (Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>C).</p>
      <p>To understand modes of gene regulation by FLC and SVP, signalling allocation analysis was performed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. A detailed description of the basis of this analysis is provided in Additional files <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref> and <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref>. A linear model containing FLC, SVP and FLC:SVP as fixed terms explaining modes of transcriptional regulation was used to estimate the contribution to gene expression levels of FLC and SVP as single factors and of the FLC:SVP interaction (Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>D). The log<sub>2</sub> expression values were used as the input data set for the analysis. Negative values for the fixed terms represent positive contributions to gene expression. So, if FLC:SVP took a negative value while FLC and SVP terms were zero, this was interpreted as the FLC:SVP complex having a role in gene expression whereas the single factors do not contribute. If the FLC:SVP term was zero, and FLC and SVP terms were negative, FLC and SVP were assumed to act independently with no action of the complex. Instead, a positive value for FLC:SVP and negative values for single proteins indicated that they function redundantly to repress gene expression, again with no contribution of the complex. All the genes up-regulated in the mutants compared with WT were used for this analysis. However, genes whose expression changes were larger in single mutants than the double mutant were excluded, because in this case gene regulation cannot be explained by transcriptional repression functions of FLC, SVP and the FLC:SVP complex but rather additional factors must be postulated to explain the data (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media">6</xref>). Nevertheless, we show transcript levels of genes with expression patterns only affected by either of the two TFs (Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>A) in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM7" ref-type="media">7</xref>.</p>
      <p>Genome-wide modes of gene regulation by FLC and SVP were identified and classified into four representative clusters in leaves and apices (clusters A to D in leaves and A’ to D’ in apices in Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>D,E; Additional files <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref> and <xref rid="MOESM8" ref-type="media">8</xref>). The clusters are based on the contribution of the terms of the linear model to gene expression (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>). Under SDs, 199 genes were up-regulated in leaves and 40 in apices. Of these upregulated genes, around 75% were included in the four clusters of interest (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM8" ref-type="media">8</xref>). In leaves, cluster A is mainly reliant on FLC (Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>D; Additional files <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref> and <xref rid="MOESM8" ref-type="media">8</xref>). Consistently, this cluster includes genes showing significant up-regulation in <italic>flc-3</italic> but less in <italic>svp-41</italic> and a similar level of up-regulation in the <italic>svp-41 flc-3</italic> double mutant. Thus, genes in cluster A are regulated by FLC while the contribution of SVP or FLC:SVP complex to their regulation is very limited (Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>D,E; Additional file <xref rid="MOESM8" ref-type="media">8</xref>). Interestingly, in apices an analogous cluster was not detected, but instead an SVP-dependent cluster was identified (cluster A’; Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>D; Additional files <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref> and <xref rid="MOESM8" ref-type="media">8</xref>). No common genes were found between clusters A and A’, strengthening the idea that these TFs control different genes as individual TFs in different tissues. Thus, when considering genes regulated individually by FLC or SVP during vegetative development, repression in leaves is mostly controlled by FLC while SVP plays the major role in apices, although we observe minor contributions of SVP in leaves and FLC in apices (Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>D; Additional files <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref> and <xref rid="MOESM8" ref-type="media">8</xref>).</p>
      <p>Unlike clusters A and A’, the expression patterns of clusters B and D and B’ and D’ were similar in both leaves and apices. Expression of genes in clusters B and B’ was greatly affected in the double mutant while much less in single mutants (Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>E), suggesting that SVP and FLC can compensate for each other in the regulation of these genes. This conclusion is statistically confirmed by a significant positive coefficient for FLC:SVP and negative coefficients for FLC and SVP (Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>D; Additional file <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref>). Cluster B in leaves included genes regulating leaf cell size at an early developmental stage, such as <italic>ROTUNDIFOLIA</italic>-like [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>] and <italic>TEOSINTE BRANCHED1/CYCLOIDEA/PROLIFERATING CELL FACTOR 9</italic> (<italic>TCP9</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. Leaf shape changes were previously reported in <italic>svp</italic> and <italic>flc</italic> mutants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>], and <italic>FLC</italic> was found to have a direct role in leaf development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. Notably, <italic>TCP</italic> genes were also overrepresented among direct targets of other MADS-box proteins such as SEP3 and AP1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>].</p>
      <p>In clusters C and C’ (Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>D,E; Additional file <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref>), FLC and SVP individually contribute to gene expression in an additive manner as no significant effect of FLC:SVP was detected, whereas significant negative coefficients for FLC and SVP were observed (Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>D). This analysis indicates that FLC and SVP act independently to regulate these genes. Interestingly, cluster C’ in apices includes <italic>GIBBERELLIN 20 OXIDASE 2</italic> (<italic>GA20OX2</italic>), which encodes an enzyme involved in gibberellin (GA) biosynthesis and was recently shown to be repressed by <italic>SVP</italic> at the shoot apex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Here FLC was also found to regulate expression of <italic>GA20OX2</italic> independently of SVP (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM9" ref-type="media">9</xref>), suggesting that both TFs actively control bioactive levels of GA through this enzyme.</p>
      <p>Taken together, the genome-wide regulatory input of FLC and SVP revealed different quantitative contributions of the individual MADS-box TFs in regulating gene expression in different tissues, as well as considerable flexibility and diversity in their transcriptional responses, leading to independent (clusters A and A’), compensatory (clusters B and B’) or additive (clusters C and C’) modes of co-regulation.</p>

    <sec id="Sec5">
      <title>The FLC:SVP complex participates in transcriptional regulation</title>
      <p>The extent to which FLC:SVP regulates gene expression was then addressed. Clusters D (62 genes) and D’ (6 genes) exhibited negative interaction coefficients for FLC:SVP, indicating that FLC and SVP act in the same pathway and consistent with the proteins acting in a heterodimer to regulate the expression of these genes. We propose that their regulation could depend on the protein complex (Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>D; Additional files <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref> and <xref rid="MOESM8" ref-type="media">8</xref>). Similarly, the effect of mutating one TF on the expression of these genes was similar to the effect of mutating both (Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>E). This is particularly evident for cluster D’, whereas in cluster D a broader diversity in coefficient terms was observed (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref>) and the average expression of the cluster indicates that FLC and SVP do not contribute equally but that FLC can work to some extent alone (Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>D).</p>
      <p>Genes in these clusters that are involved in hormone-regulated processes or cold response were analysed in more detail. The <italic>JASMONATE ZIM-domain</italic> (<italic>JAZ</italic>) genes (<italic>JAZ 3</italic>, <italic>5</italic>, <italic>6</italic> and <italic>8</italic>), which contribute to the jasmonate signalling pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>], were regulated by FLC:SVP under SDs. The same association was shown by <italic>DARK INDUCIBLE 10</italic> (<italic>DIN10</italic>), also known as RAFFINOSE SYNTHASE, which encodes a glycosyl hydrolase associated with cold response, as well as light and sucrose stimulus. In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, <italic>DIN10</italic> transcript levels respond to cold treatments predicted to reduce <italic>FLC</italic> expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. This observation was confirmed by measuring the level of <italic>DIN10</italic> mRNA by independent real-time quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR) in leaves of <italic>svp</italic>, <italic>flc</italic> and <italic>svp flc</italic> mutants (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM10" ref-type="media">10</xref>). The <italic>din10</italic> mutant also showed a weak but significant early-flowering phenotype, which can be correlated with increased levels of <italic>FT</italic> mRNA (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM10" ref-type="media">10</xref>).</p>
      <p>Cluster D, whose expression is governed by FLC:SVP, contains 43% of the up-regulated genes in leaves under SDs while only 20% of the genes are present in cluster B, the compensation cluster. The signalling allocation analysis was repeated for plants shifted from SDs to LDs to evaluate the effect of an environmental stimulus that induces flowering. Interestingly, the proportion of genes controlled by the complex differed under SDs and LDs (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM8" ref-type="media">8</xref>). Contrary to what was found under SDs, cluster B contained almost 68% of the genes under LDs, constituting the main mode of transcriptional regulation under this condition (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM8" ref-type="media">8</xref>), whereas cluster D contained only 11% of the genes. This decrease in the proportion of FLC:SVP-dependent genes in leaves upon shift to LDs is in agreement with a weaker interaction between FLC and SVP detected in the leaves of 3- and 7-day-old LD grown seedlings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], suggesting that FLC:SVP complex might not form or regulate gene expression under these conditions.</p>
      <p>Overall, by separately analysing single and double mutants the contribution of the complex to gene expression was determined. These results indicate that FLC:SVP regulates around one third of the genes repressed by these proteins in the leaves under SDs but many fewer under LDs.</p>

      <title>SVP influences the genome-wide binding scenario of FLC and <italic>vice versa</italic></title>
      <p>The extent to which the described expression patterns can be explained by direct binding of FLC, SVP or FLC:SVP was determined by performing ChIP-seq to identify the genome-wide binding sites for each TF in the presence and absence of the other. Binding of SVP:GFP was studied in the above-ground tissue of seedlings using an anti-green fluorescent protein (GFP) antibody in the genotypes <italic>pSVP:SVP:GFP svp-41 FLC FRI</italic> (hereafter SVP:GFP in WT) and <italic>pSVP:SVP:GFP svp-41 flc-3 FRI</italic> (hereafter SVP in <italic>flc-3</italic>) (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM11" ref-type="media">11</xref>), allowing the influence of FLC on SVP:GFP binding to be determined. Similarly, polyclonal FLC antibody [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>] was used for ChIP-seq in <italic>SVP FLC FRI</italic> (FLC in WT) and <italic>svp-41 FLC FRI</italic> backgrounds (FLC in <italic>svp-41</italic>). Each ChIP-seq was done in triplicate. Irreproducible discovery rate (IDR) analysis was performed and only the peaks that were reproducible at an IDR ≤ 0.05 were selected for further processing (Materials and methods; Additional file <xref rid="MOESM12" ref-type="media">12</xref>).</p>
      <p>In WT, SVP:GFP binding was detected at 523 unique genomic regions that were assigned to 773 neighbouring genes (peaks reside 3 kb upstream of the transcription start site or 1 kb downstream of the transcription end site) (Figure <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>A; Additional file <xref rid="MOESM13" ref-type="media">13</xref>). On the other hand, in the <italic>flc-3</italic> mutant 264 peaks were called for SVP:GFP and annotated to 303 genes (Figure <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>A; Additional file <xref rid="MOESM13" ref-type="media">13</xref>). Among these genes, 220 were bound in both genotypes, indicating that SVP:GFP binds to these genes regardless of the presence or absence of FLC. Conversely, 83 genes were identified only when FLC was absent, whereas 553 genes were bound only in the presence of FLC (Figure <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>A). The proportion of SVP:GFP target genes found only in WT or <italic>flc-3</italic> differed significantly between the two genotypes (<italic>P</italic> &lt;2.2e-16, Chi-square test). Thus, overall the presence of FLC increased the number of SVP:GFP targets, but targets only bound in the absence of FLC were also detected. Binding to the flowering-related genes <italic>SEP3</italic>, <italic>SOC1</italic> and <italic>SCHLAFMUTZE</italic> (<italic>SMZ</italic>), which were previously shown to be targets of SVP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], did not depend on the presence of FLC. However, <italic>TEMPRANILLO 1</italic> (<italic>TEM1</italic>), <italic>CONSTANS-LIKE 1</italic> (<italic>COL1</italic>) and <italic>CONSTANS-LIKE 4</italic> (<italic>COL4</italic>) were exclusively bound in WT when both TFs were present. As described for other MADS-box TFs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], binding sites were mostly found in promoter regions 5’ of transcriptional start sites, and in smaller proportions in exons, introns and UTRs (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM14" ref-type="media">14</xref>). Overall, this distribution was not affected by the presence of FLC (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM14" ref-type="media">14</xref>).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Absence of cognate partner in the SVP-FLC complex influences genome-wide binding events of individual transcription factors.

      <p>For FLC, a total of 315 binding sites were detected in WT by ChIP-seq and these corresponded to 340 target genes, whereas 419 binding sites and 391 target genes were identified in <italic>svp-41</italic> mutant (Figure <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>B; Additional file <xref rid="MOESM13" ref-type="media">13</xref>). Only 183 genes were detected in both genotypes (Figure <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>B), among which were <italic>SEP3</italic> and <italic>SOC1</italic> that were also found in SVP:GFP ChIP-seq. Among the FLC target genes, 157 were detected only in the presence of SVP - again <italic>TEM1</italic> was one of them - but the total number of targets was lower in WT compared with <italic>svp-41</italic>. In this case, the proportion of unique genes did not significantly differ between the two genotypes (<italic>P</italic> = 0.1, Chi-square test). As for SVP, FLC peaks were mainly located in promoter regions in both genotypes (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM14" ref-type="media">14</xref>). Several binding sites for each TF were validated by ChIP quantitative PCR in independent experiments (Figure <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>C).</p>
      <p>The ChIP-seq data indicated that the presence of one of these MADS-box TFs influenced the binding of the other. SVP genome-wide targets approximately doubled in the presence of FLC. On the other hand, FLC binding sites were greatly altered by the presence of SVP, but in a qualitative rather than a quantitative manner, as the total number of targets did not increase. These results indicate that target recognition by complexes of MADS-box TFs can be substantially altered by the expression of their MADS cognate partners.</p>

    <sec id="Sec7">
      <title>Combinatorial binding and joint genomic occupancy of FLC and SVP</title>
      <p>To investigate co-regulation of target genes by FLC and SVP their binding sites were compared. First, the sites at which FLC and SVP bound DNA independently of each other were identified. Of the 303 genes recognized by SVP:GFP in <italic>flc-3</italic> background, 87 (29%) were also bound by FLC in <italic>svp-41</italic> (22% of the FLC targets <italic>in svp-41</italic>). Therefore, when FLC and SVP bind independently, about 20 to 30% of their target genes are shared. The presence of these common targets (Figure <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>D, top left) and the co-occurrence of binding sites (Figure <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>D, bottom) suggests that these TFs can regulate the same pathways independently of each other. Interestingly, among those targets where the proteins bind independently are the flowering integrator genes <italic>FT</italic> and <italic>SOC1</italic>. In agreement with this observation, signalling allocation analysis of <italic>FT</italic> and <italic>SOC1</italic> in the transcriptome data indicates that FLC:SVP is not required for repression of these genes (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM9" ref-type="media">9</xref>). On the other hand, 67 genes appear to be bound by both TFs only in the WT context (Figure <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>D, top right).</p>
      <p>Similarly, common regions bound by SVP:GFP in <italic>flc-3</italic> and in WT (Figure <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>A), and also those shared by FLC in <italic>svp-41</italic> and in WT, were very highly correlated (Figure <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>E). This analysis suggests that for these common targets the single proteins and the FLC:SVP heterodimer bind to the same regions.</p>
      <p>In summary, our results indicate that when FLC and SVP regulate the same target genes in the absence of the other protein they bind to common genomic regions (Figure <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>D, bottom). This observation suggests that for certain targets these factors can compensate for loss of activity of the other, acting redundantly and providing robustness to the system. Furthermore, at targets recognised by individual TFs and the complex, they locate to the same binding regions (Figure <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>E).</p>

      <title>Peak analysis reveals quantitative and significant differences in SVP and FLC binding sites</title>
      <p>In order to better elucidate the basis of the differences that we observed between the ChIP-seq datasets obtained in the different genetic backgrounds (Figure <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>A,B), we performed differential binding analyses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>] and quantitative comparisons of peak height [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>] (Materials and methods; Additional files <xref rid="MOESM12" ref-type="media">12</xref>, <xref rid="MOESM15" ref-type="media">15</xref> and <xref rid="MOESM16" ref-type="media">16</xref>).</p>
      <p>Differential binding in the two genotypes was examined for each TF in a region ±750 bp around the peak summits (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM12" ref-type="media">12</xref>). The peaks in each genotype were identified independently and then each peak was compared with the corresponding region in the other genotype. The 521 SVP:GFP peaks in WT were compared with the corresponding regions in <italic>flc-3</italic>, and 63 significant differences were detected (Hotelling’s T<sup>2</sup> test, adjusted <italic>P</italic>-value ≤ 0.05; Figure <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>A; Additional file <xref rid="MOESM16" ref-type="media">16</xref>). By contrast, the reciprocal comparison revealed one significant difference in 245 peaks (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM17" ref-type="media">17</xref>). However, a similar number of differences was found by comparing FLC peaks in WT with the same regions in <italic>svp-41</italic> (Figure <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>A) or FLC peaks in <italic>svp-41</italic> with the corresponding regions in WT (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM18" ref-type="media">18</xref>). Median profiles show that, overall, peaks in SVP:GFP in WT are more read-enriched than the same regions observed in the <italic>flc-3</italic> (Figure <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>A). Interestingly, the FLC binding pattern is the reverse, showing stronger binding in the <italic>svp-41</italic> mutant genetic background (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM18" ref-type="media">18</xref>).<fig id="Fig3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Normalized fold-change between ChIP-seq peak heights and peak shape analysis by functional PCA techniques show differences in binding behaviour.

      <p>To further explore TF binding strength in our data a quantitative analysis of peak changes was performed, dividing first the consensus lists of regions for FLC and SVP into three groups: peaks present in both WT and the mutant for the interacting TF referred to as ubiquitous (UB); peaks only identified in WT, that is, when both TFs were present (2TF); and peaks only identified in the mutant (1TF) (Figure <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>B). Of 144 SVP:GFP UB binding regions, 120 (83%) presented higher binding in the presence of FLC, whereas only 24 presented decreased binding (Figure <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>C). By contrast, for FLC, only 47 of 175 UB regions (27%) showed higher binding when SVP was present (Figure <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>C). Thus, the presence of FLC quantitatively increased peak height for SVP:GFP whereas FLC showed no strong dependency for binding strength on the presence of SVP. On the other hand, SVP has a more qualitative effect on binding of FLC.</p>

      <title><italic>Cis</italic>-regulatory elements vary among genotypes</title>
      <p>To study whether the sets of binding sites of FLC, SVP and FLC:SVP could be explained by the presence of different CArG-boxes or other sequences we performed <italic>de novo</italic> motif discovery using MEME [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. CArG-boxes bound by most plant MADS-box proteins correspond to the canonical sequence CC(A/T)<sub>6</sub>GG, although variations in the distribution of A and T nucleotides in the A/T stretch or its length have been described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>], even for the same TF at different developmental stages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. DNA regions bound by FLC and SVP were divided as before into three groups (UB, 1TF, 2TF; Figure <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>B). Three different motifs were enriched in the dataset (Figure <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>A). The canonical CC(A/T)<sub>6</sub>GG motif was found to be the most enriched in all genotypes, whether FLC or SVP and 1TF, 2TF or UB data were used (Figure <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>A,B) and CArG-boxes with different A/T stretches (for example, 5 and 7 bp length) were also enriched in the three categories (UB, 1TF, 2 TF) (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM19" ref-type="media">19</xref>). Therefore, FLC:SVP did not appear to recognise CArG-boxes with different A/T stretch lengths than those bound by the TFs acting independently. Nevertheless, analysis of the position weight matrix revealed differences between the recognition sites for the heterodimer and for the TFs acting independently (Figure <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>C). We identified differences in A/T distribution. For 1TF the A/T stretch clearly favours the T nucleotide for most of the positions, whereas for 2TF or UB this preference is less pronounced and in fact inclined more towards the A base (Figure <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>C; Additional file <xref rid="MOESM20" ref-type="media">20</xref>). This difference likely contributes to sequence-specific recognition capabilities for the heterodimer and TFs acting independently. <italic>De novo</italic> motif discovery also detected other motifs significantly enriched in the peak sequences. G-box motif (CACGTG) was found in UB or 2TF peaks but not in the 1TF set (Figure <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>A,B; Additional file <xref rid="MOESM21" ref-type="media">21</xref>). The selective enrichment of the G-box suggests that basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) or bZIP TFs might associate more often with the FLC:SVP heterodimer than with complexes containing only one of the factors. Significant co-occurrence of CArG and G-box motifs was observed when FLC and SVP were both present (Figure <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>D) and this appears to occur within a distance interval of 100 to 200 bp (Figure <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>E), indicating that both motifs occur in the same binding region. G-boxes were previously found adjacent to SVP binding sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. In addition, a previously undescribed Complex-Enriched motif (CE-box, sequence [CA]CGG[GT][AT]A[TG][AT]GCCGGT) was enriched only among the targets in the 2TF and UB of SVP ChIP-seq dataset (Figure <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>A,B; Additional file <xref rid="MOESM21" ref-type="media">21</xref>).<fig id="Fig4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>The FLC:SVP complex binds to distinctive</bold><bold><italic>cis</italic></bold><bold>-elements.

      <p>In summary, the data suggest that the heterodimer binds preferentially to different CArG sequences than the individual TFs, and might specifically interact with bHLH or bZIP TFs at G-boxes enriched adjacent to the CArG-boxes. Also, a novel motif (CE-box) was detected that is exclusively present adjacent to sites at which SVP binds in genotypes where it can form a complex with FLC.</p>

      <title>Targets of the complex and processes governed by FLC and SVP in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> flowering</title>
      <p>To gain further insight into the biological roles of FLC and SVP acting as a complex or individually, the genes targeted by these TFs in WT and mutant backgrounds were analysed. First, genes bound in WT but not in mutant genotypes were selected. The genes present in either 2TF group were bound by FLC or SVP only in WT, and therefore were combined in one set that contained 643 genes. This set was referred to as complex-enriched genes, because it was expected to contain all the genes bound by the complex, but might also contain some genes bound in WT by only one of the TFs. A more stringently selected set of genes bound by the complex is represented by those present in both 2TF groups. This set contained 67 genes that after stringent individual inspection was reduced to 45, and these were referred to as complex-exclusive genes.</p>
      <p>These gene lists were analysed according to their functional annotation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>] and Gene Ontology (GO) terms enriched in the different datasets were compared. In all datasets, as expected, overrepresentation of genes related to regulation of transcription was detected, indicating that FLC and SVP have indirect as well as direct effects on transcriptional regulation, expanding their impact to other biological processes. TFs present in the complex-enriched set or in those sets bound by the TFs acting independently consist mainly of proteins with MADS-box, AP2 or bHLH domains. Interestingly, considerable differences between enriched GO categories in the complex-enriched and individual factors gene sets were detected (Figure <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>A). A high enrichment in terms related to flower development was observed in the datasets obtained when the proteins were acting independently from each other (Figure <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>A). These genes include several encoding other MADS-box TFs such as <italic>SEP3</italic>, <italic>SHATTERPROOF 2</italic> (<italic>SHP2/AGL5</italic>), <italic>APETALA3</italic> (<italic>AP3</italic>), <italic>SOC1</italic> and <italic>SVP</italic> (Figure <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>A,B; Additional file <xref rid="MOESM22" ref-type="media">22</xref>). In contrast, genes involved in flower development are not as prominent among complex-enriched targets, but rather these include many genes controlling flowering time and environmental responses (Figure <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>A,B). The GO analysis also highlighted the enhanced function of the complex in responses to cold and temperature stimulus (Figure <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>A). Regulation of flowering by the complex appears to be achieved via diverse pathways such as photoperiod or circadian clock and the GA pathway (see later). <italic>AGAMOUS LIKE-16</italic> (<italic>AGL16</italic>) encodes a MADS-box TF that was described as a target of SVP and FLC in previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Our data indicate that its binding is dependent on the FLC:SVP complex (Figure <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>B), and it falls both in the complex-enriched and complex-exclusive lists. Its expression pattern correlates with this finding, being increased similarly in each single mutant and in the double mutant compared to WT (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM22" ref-type="media">22</xref>). Interestingly, AGL16 was recently shown to be involved in flowering-time control and to interact with FLC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. The ChIP-seq normalized read alignments for the 30 regions (45 associated genes) fulfilling the requirements for complex-exclusive binding are shown in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM25" ref-type="media">25</xref> along with descriptions of all the genes present. Twenty-four of these 45 genes were previously described as targets of SVP or FLC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].<fig id="Fig5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p><bold>Integration of transcriptional profiling and binding site data.

      <p>Taken together, our functional analyses suggest that individually FLC and SVP, probably coupled with other TFs, predominantly control flower development, whereas the FLC:SVP heterodimer acts as a major regulator of flowering time.</p>

      <title>Integration of transcriptional profiling and binding site data</title>
      <p>The correlation between DEGs and direct targets obtained by ChIP-seq was then assessed to determine how many of the transcriptional changes are due to direct binding of FLC and SVP. The DEGs in leaves and apices were combined and compared with the list of target genes obtained from seedlings in the ChIP-seq experiments. This global analysis showed that 15 to 20% of DEGs in all the mutants were direct targets of FLC or SVP (Figure <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>C,D, left; Additional file <xref rid="MOESM23" ref-type="media">23</xref>). Furthermore, 90% of the direct targets that were differentially expressed showed increased expression upon loss of the regulatory input of the TF. To uncover tissue specificity, DEGs in apices and leaves were compared with direct targets of FLC and SVP. Of the up-regulated genes in leaves and apices, 20% were bound by at least one of the TFs (Figure <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>C,D). Although in apices the majority of the differential transcripts were down-regulated in the mutants (Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>B), less than 2% were direct targets of FLC or SVP. Therefore, a high proportion of the down-regulated genes in apices of mutants are indirectly regulated by FLC or SVP. These data support the idea that FLC and SVP act predominately as repressors of transcription.</p>

      <title>Regulation of gibberellin-related genes partially depends on the FLC:SVP complex</title>
      <p>Several genes related to GA biosynthesis and response were present among the high-confidence FLC and SVP direct targets as well as DEGs (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM23" ref-type="media">23</xref>) and were also found to be overrepresented in the GO terms analysis (Figure <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>A; Additional file <xref rid="MOESM24" ref-type="media">24</xref>). Moreover, SVP was recently shown to indirectly reduce transcription of a GA biosynthetic enzyme to lower GA biosynthesis and delay the floral transition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Therefore, whether regulation of genes involved in GA-related processes depends on the FLC:SVP complex was examined. <italic>TEMPRANILLO</italic> (<italic>TEM</italic>) genes encode TFs that delay flowering by directly repressing <italic>FT</italic> and reducing GA levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>]<italic>.</italic> TEM1 directly binds to and represses transcription of paralogues encoding GIBBERELLIN 3-OXIDASE, <italic>GA3OX1</italic> and <italic>GA3OX2</italic>, an enzyme required for biosynthesis of bioactive GAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>]. <italic>TEM1</italic> and <italic>TEM2</italic> were among the direct targets of FLC and SVP and <italic>TEM1</italic> was in the complex-exclusive set (Figure <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>A). <italic>TEM1</italic> and <italic>TEM2</italic> mRNA levels were also changed in leaves and apices of single and double mutants, suggesting that binding of FLC and SVP regulates their expression (Figure <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>B). Interestingly, in agreement with what was found for FLM and SVP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], <italic>TEM2</italic> expression decreased up to three-fold in the <italic>svp flc</italic> double mutant, suggesting that it might be activated by FLC and SVP binding (Figure <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>B). By contrast, for <italic>TEM1</italic> the FLC and SVP proteins act as repressors (Figure <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>B). In addition, <italic>GA3OX1</italic> mRNA levels were increased in the mutant (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM23" ref-type="media">23</xref>), probably due to an indirect effect of the misregulation of the <italic>TEM</italic> genes as it was not detected as a direct target of either FLC or SVP.<fig id="Fig6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p><bold>Coordinated regulation of GA-related genes by FLC and SVP.

      <p><italic>DWARF AND DELAYED FLOWERING 1</italic> (<italic>DDF1</italic>) encodes an AP2-type TF that promotes expression of the GA catabolic enzyme <italic>GIBBERELLIN 2-OXIDASE 7</italic> (GA2OX7) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>]. <italic>DDF1</italic> was associated with a complex-exclusive peak (Figure <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>A; Additional files <xref rid="MOESM25" ref-type="media">25</xref> and <xref rid="MOESM26" ref-type="media">26</xref>) and <italic>DDF1</italic> mRNA levels were two-fold higher in single mutants of either <italic>svp-41</italic> or <italic>flc-3</italic> than WT and up to four-fold higher in the double mutant (Figure <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>B). Therefore, FLC and SVP additively repress expression of this activator of GA catabolism through direct binding to its promoter. Furthermore, <italic>GIBBERELLIN 2-OXIDASE 8</italic> (<italic>GA2OX8</italic>), a homologue of <italic>GA2OX7</italic>, was also present in the complex-exclusive list (Figure <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>A; Additional file <xref rid="MOESM25" ref-type="media">25</xref>). Regulation of this gene was further examined because ectopic expression of <italic>GA2OX8</italic> was shown to delay flowering in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>]. The complex-exclusive binding was validated independently by showing that FLC and SVP bind to canonical CArG-boxes of the first intron in <italic>GA2OX8</italic> (Figure <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>A; Additional files <xref rid="MOESM26" ref-type="media">26</xref> and <xref rid="MOESM27" ref-type="media">27</xref>). FLC and SVP repress <italic>GA2OX8</italic> expression in a complex-dependent manner as judged by the transcription profile of the respective single and double mutants (Figure <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>B). To functionally analyse the significance of this site, a T-DNA insertion at the intronic region, GK-61 F06, was analysed (Figure <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>C; Additional file <xref rid="MOESM27" ref-type="media">27</xref>). Strikingly, the mutant flowered later than WT under LDs and SDs (Figure <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>C; Additional file <xref rid="MOESM27" ref-type="media">27</xref>), a phenotype associated with overexpression of <italic>GA2OX8</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>]. In agreement with the late-flowering phenotype, the <italic>GA2OX8</italic> transcript in GK-61 F06 was more abundant than in WT (Figure <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>C), indicating that the insertion causes overexpression of the gene in leaves and apices. Disruption of the intron to which FLC and SVP bind therefore appears to cause up-regulation of <italic>GA2OX8</italic> mRNA. By contrast, an independent mutant allele of <italic>GA2OX8</italic> (WiscDsLox263B11) carrying a T-DNA insertion in the first exon (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM27" ref-type="media">27</xref>) caused early flowering (Figure <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>C; Additional file <xref rid="MOESM27" ref-type="media">27</xref>). Lastly, other direct targets of FLC and SVP include components associated with GA signalling. <italic>RGA-LIKE2</italic>, which encodes a DELLA protein repressor of GA signalling that is rapidly degraded in response to GA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>], is also bound by FLC and SVP (Figure <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>A; Additional file <xref rid="MOESM26" ref-type="media">26</xref>). Here, no significant misregulation of <italic>RGL2</italic> mRNA was detected in leaf or apical RNA samples of the mutants (Figure <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>B). Finally, the levels of the RGA protein DELLA fluctuate in single and double <italic>svp</italic> and <italic>flc</italic> mutants (Figure <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>D), consistent with effects on GA abundance and signalling in these genotypes.</p>
      <p>Previously, higher levels of bioactive GA were detected in the <italic>svp</italic> mutant due to deregulation of <italic>GA20OX2</italic> expression, which is indirectly repressed by SVP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], and FLC was reported to bind to one gene encoding a GA biosynthetic gene and to GID1c, a member of the GA receptor family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Here we show that SVP and FLC co-operatively regulate several genes with effects on GA biosynthesis, catabolism and signalling (Figure <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>E), suggesting that modulating the effects of GA constitutes a major function for these TFs.</p>

    <title>Discussion</title>
    <p>The <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> MADS-box TFs FLC and SVP interact to form a complex and each represses the transition from vegetative growth to flowering. Here we studied their functional interdependency at the genome-wide level. Transcript profiling and ChIP-seq studies were performed in WT plants in which both TFs are active as well as in mutants lacking activity of one or both TFs. The landscape of binding sites and regulated genes differed dramatically when both factors were active compared with when they functioned individually. Strikingly, a subset of binding sites that is recognized by each factor only when the other is present identified genes that are regulated specifically by the FLC:SVP complex. Genes involved in flowering time or environmental responses were enriched among those recognized by the complex whereas genes with developmental functions during flower development were over represented among those recognized by the TFs acting individually. Our study demonstrates at the genome-wide level how the functions of these plant MADS-box TFs with pivotal roles in reproductive development are influenced by their cognate partners.</p>
    <sec id="Sec14">
      <title>Genetic interactions of SVP and FLC on flowering time and gene expression</title>
      <p>SVP and FLC contribute to several endogenous and environmental pathways that govern floral induction in <italic>A. thaliana</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Their major function is to delay or prevent flowering in non-inductive environments so increasing the amplitude of the flowering response to inductive cues. Genetic analysis demonstrated that these two TFs have overlapping functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. SVP FLC plants are strongly delayed in flowering under inductive LDs or non-inductive SDs, although they can be accelerated to flower by exposure to vernalization that reduces <italic>FLC</italic> transcription. Mutation of <italic>FLC</italic> or <italic>SVP</italic> is sufficient to cause much earlier flowering under inductive LDs, while double mutants exhibit extreme early flowering even under non-inductive SDs. The genetic data demonstrate that although these TFs interact to form a complex, each protein must retain a function in the absence of the other. MADS-box TFs interact with other TFs of the same class to form higher order complexes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], so individual functions of SVP and FLC probably depend on interactions with other members of the family. Indeed, SVP interacts with a broad class of MADS-box TFs, including AP1, CAL, SEP3, AGL16 and FLM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>], whereas FLC interacts with at least MAF3, MAF4 and FLM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>].</p>
      <p>To define the contribution of FLC or SVP acting individually, genome-wide transcriptome analysis of the WT and single and double mutants in apices and leaves was carried out. Both genes are expressed in these tissues and influence flowering when expressed in either region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. As expected from the related mutant phenotypes, a considerable overlap in the function of FLC and SVP was observed at the transcriptome level, although each TF also showed specific effects. FLC controlled twice as many genes in leaves as SVP, and mutations in <italic>FLC</italic> have an effect on vegetative phase change reflected in leaf heteroblasty [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>], whereas this has not been described for <italic>svp</italic> mutants. However, mutations in <italic>SVP</italic> do increase GA levels leading to changes in chlorophyll accumulation in leaves and to leaf petiole elongation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. In contrast to leaves, SVP had a more significant effect on gene expression in the apex than FLC. The lower number of genes misexpressed in apices of <italic>flc</italic> mutants nevertheless included flowering-time genes such as <italic>SOC1</italic>. SVP has defined functions in flower development in part by interacting with other MADS proteins involved in this process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>] and such interactions might contribute to a broader role in the apex.</p>
      <p>Interestingly, a set of leaf and apex genes that are bound specifically by the FLC:SVP complex in seedlings was identified (Figures <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> and <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>; Additional file <xref rid="MOESM25" ref-type="media">25</xref>). Expression levels of a subset of these genes showed similarly increased levels of expression in the single and double mutants, demonstrating that both proteins are required for their repression. Similar comparative transcriptome data were reported for PISTILLATA and APETALA3 MADS-box factors that interact to specify petal development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. In that case similarities in the transcriptome were emphasized but the single mutants were not compared directly with the double mutant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The flexibility we observed for FLC and SVP is likely a feature of the ability of these TFs to interact with additional MADS-box proteins to substitute for the loss of one partner or to provide distinct specificities. Both FLC and SVP interact with other MADS-box TFs, as described above. Conceivably each of these TF complexes might bind to specific sets of targets as we show here for groups of genes that are recognized uniquely by the FLC:SVP complex but not by either protein acting individually.</p>

      <title>Effect of interactions between SVP and FLC on target site occupancy</title>
      <p>Genome-wide identification of binding sites for FLC and SVP revealed that 15 to 25% of the transcript changes were caused by direct regulation and that SVP and FLC act almost exclusively as repressors (Figure <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). Although the ChIP was performed on seedlings and the RNA expression analysis on apices or leaves, the proportion of misexpressed genes directly bound by the TFs is in a similar range to what has been observed previously for other MADS-box proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Inducible forms of TFs or induction of artificial microRNAs that lower TF activity at specific times can be used to reduce the indirect effects of TFs and increase the proportion of direct targets identified in transcript profiling experiments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p>
      <p>Genome-wide targets of FLC and SVP were previously described. Studies of SVP identified 2,982 targets by ChIP-seq in SD-grown plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] while Tao <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] reported 328 genes associated with SVP using ChIP to chip on plants grown under LDs. In WT, we identified 773 genes associated with SVP binding, which included 71 genes in common with Tao <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], and 54 with Gregis <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM28" ref-type="media">28</xref>). These differences might be caused by environment, the genotype (in one case overexpressing plants were used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] while the other utilized the endogenous promoter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]), the technology used to identify ChIP enriched fragments (ChIP-chip, ChIP-seq using a GAII sequencer or a Hi-Seq 2000 in our study) and the bioinformatics approach employed to analyse the data (replicate treatment, FDR versus IDR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>] and alignment tools). Nevertheless, our data were validated in triplicate biological replicates and using recently developed statistical tools, providing additional support for these binding sites. Strikingly, our SVP data showed higher overlap with published FLC target lists identified by ChIP-seq, 141 genes in common with Deng <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] and 223 genes in common with our FLC data. Overlap with FLC datasets from the other SVP studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] was less than 60 genes in all cases. The comparison of FLC targets identified by Deng <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] and by us showed a 40% overlap (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM28" ref-type="media">28</xref>). This high overlap found under different environments and performed independently in different laboratories provides strong support for our SVP and FLC target lists.</p>
      <p>Variation among sites recognised by the TFs acting individually or together was found at the level of <italic>cis</italic>-elements (Figure <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Canonical CArG boxes appear equally in genes bound by the single TFs or by the complex, but other <italic>cis</italic>-elements, such as G-boxes, were encountered more frequently at sites where the complex is formed. The presence of the G-box neighbouring the CArG boxes (Figure <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>D) could be part of a mechanism by which the complex and single factors discriminate between targets. For example, the FLC:SVP complex might associate with a bHLH or bZIP TF that recognizes G-boxes to control transcription of those target genes. This is in part supported by the transcriptome analysis as signal allocation analyses identified a group of genes whose expression pattern might be explained by the presence of a third factor (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media">6</xref>). Such a mechanism might strengthen the affinity for weak CArG boxes. Interestingly, a new motif was also found only in genes bound by SVP complexes (Figure <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>).</p>
      <p>The functional annotation analysis suggests that those genes regulated only by the complex have distinct biological functions to those regulated by the factors acting individually. Many genes involved in flower development were bound by FLC or SVP independently of the presence of the other TF. Several other MADS-box proteins that interact with FLC and SVP are involved in flower development, including SEP3, SHP2, PI, AP3 and SOC1. Therefore, interaction of these with either FLC or SVP could contribute to flower development and reduce the requirement for the complex. By contrast, the importance of the complex in controlling floral transition was evident because genes involved in several flowering pathways were overrepresented among its targets. The complex-enriched set contained the floral-induction related genes <italic>TEM1</italic>, <italic>TEM2</italic>, <italic>AP2</italic>, <italic>PIF3</italic>, <italic>TOE</italic>s, <italic>miR172</italic>, <italic>CONSTANS-LIKE</italic> genes, <italic>SPL15</italic>, <italic>GA2OX8</italic> and <italic>DDF1</italic> among others. The integrator genes <italic>SOC1</italic> and <italic>FT</italic>, whose regulation by FLC and SVP strongly contributes to flowering-time repression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], were bound by FLC and SVP acting independently. However, their effect is likely enhanced by regulation of other flowering-time genes by the complex, which could fine-tune the flowering response by influencing a wider range of pathways. Several of these pathways ultimately converge on <italic>FT</italic> so that FLC and SVP regulation of <italic>FT</italic> transcription could be achieved both by direct binding and indirectly through the complex regulating upstream pathways. For example, <italic>TEM1/TEM2</italic>, to which the FLC:SVP complex binds, encode direct repressors of <italic>FT</italic> transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>]. Overall we found that the FLC:SVP complex regulates multiple pathways within the flowering network (Figure <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>E).</p>
      <p>In flowering plants, multiple MADS-box TFs share similar structures and form complexes of dimers or tetramers. Therefore, they are able to multimerize in a combinatorial fashion, although the ultimate composition of these complexes <italic>in vivo</italic> is only beginning to be deciphered [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>]. We elucidated mutual interdependencies between the floral repressors FLC and SVP by performing ChIP-seq independently for each TF in different genetic backgrounds. This method allowed us to indirectly assess which genes are regulated by the complex. Future development of methods to detect the complex directly bound to DNA will further clarify which genes are regulated by FLC and SVP acting together.</p>

      <title>Regulation of gibberellin biosynthesis and signalling by FLC SVP</title>
      <p>The targets of FLC and SVP included several genes implicated in GA biosynthesis or signalling. GA has long been known to promote flowering of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, most strongly under SDs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>] but also under LDs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>]. However, how GA biosynthesis and response are regulated by and intersect with other flowering pathways that are comprised mainly of TFs is still poorly understood. SVP was recently shown to indirectly reduce <italic>GA20OX2</italic> mRNA abundance and thereby GA levels. Also, increased <italic>GA20OX2</italic> mRNA and GA levels contribute to the early flowering of <italic>svp</italic> mutants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Furthermore, <italic>GA3</italic>, which encodes an ent-kaurene oxidase that catalyzes early steps in GA biosynthesis, was identified as a target of FLC, as was GID1C, which is a member of a small gene family encoding GA receptor proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. However no effect of FLC on the expression of these genes was described. By contrast the TEM1 and TEM2 TFs that delay flowering are repressors of genes encoding the GA biosynthetic enzyme GA3ox [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>].</p>
      <p>Our data indicate that FLC and SVP have several roles in regulating GA metabolism, but that these appear to have opposing effects (Figure <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>E). For example, a major direct effect of FLC:SVP appears to be to repress expression of GA2 oxidases, which are GA catabolic enzymes. FLC:SVP bind directly to and repress the genes encoding <italic>GA2OX8</italic> and DDF1, a transcriptional activator of <italic>GA2OX7</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>]. In addition, <italic>GA2OX6</italic> and <italic>GA2OX2</italic> were not bound by FLC:SVP but were identified as upregulated DEGs in the mutants. The complex, therefore, represses the expression of enzymes required to reduce GA levels, and the transcripts encoding these enzymes are increased in abundance in early flowering <italic>flc svp</italic> double mutants. Paradoxically, increased expression of these enzymes in transgenic plants is associated with late flowering and reduced GA levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>], whereas <italic>flc svp</italic> mutants are early flowering and <italic>svp</italic> mutants contain elevated GA levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Genes encoding GA2 oxidases often exhibit precise spatial and temporal expression patterns [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>], and the FLC:SVP complex might regulate these genes in different cells to those in which GA levels must rise to promote flowering. In addition, FLC:SVP negatively regulates <italic>TEM1</italic> and positively regulates <italic>TEM2</italic>, which encode repressors of <italic>GA3ox1</italic>, whose product is an enzyme required for GA biosynthesis. In agreement with this binding, <italic>flc svp</italic> double mutants express higher levels of <italic>TEM1</italic> mRNA and lower levels of <italic>TEM2</italic> in leaves and apices as well as higher levels of <italic>GA3ox1</italic> mRNA in leaves. <italic>TEM1</italic> and <italic>TEM2</italic> might be expressed in different cells or at distinct times so that the effect of both genes confers a spatial pattern of GA biosynthesis that could be important in modulation of the floral transition and related processes. <italic>TEM1</italic> and <italic>TEM2</italic> were also reported to be bound by SVP and SOC1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. In total seedling RNA, <italic>soc1</italic> mutants showed increased <italic>TEM1</italic> and <italic>TEM2</italic> mRNA levels. By contrast, no effect of <italic>svp</italic> mutations was detected, although <italic>SVP</italic> overexpressors caused an increase in <italic>TEM1</italic> and <italic>TEM2</italic> mRNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Since FLC:SVP also represses <italic>SOC1</italic>, some of the effects on <italic>TEM1</italic> mRNA detected in <italic>svp flc</italic> mutants might be indirect due to increased <italic>SOC1</italic> expression. Finally, the mRNA encoding the biosynthetic enzyme <italic>GA20OX2</italic> was present at higher levels in single and double mutants, consistent with a previous report [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] and with the early flowering as well as increased GA levels detected for <italic>svp</italic> mutants.</p>
      <p>Thus, FLC and SVP have a broad role in regulating GA metabolism and an unexpectedly strong, direct effect in repressing GA catabolism, but integration of this into their role in controlling flowering awaits a more extensive understanding of the spatial and temporal expression of GA metabolism and its regulation during floral transition.</p>

      <title>FLC and SVP as an evolutionarily flexible system</title>
      <p>Plant MADS-box proteins were previously described as showing degeneracy, whereby different members can perform similar functions in one condition but distinct functions in another [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>]. This feature is believed to support robustness within biological processes while also providing flexibility for adaptation and evolution of the system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>]. Our genome-wide analysis of the MADS-box proteins FLC and SVP demonstrates that they function as degenerate elements, which are redundant in some scenarios but have distinct functions in others, and this might facilitate variation in their activity among <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> accessions. Such plants vary tremendously in the contributions of FLC and SVP to flowering control. Winter-annual accessions contain an active, highly expressed <italic>FLC</italic> gene whereas summer annuals do not and this difference confers variation in requirement for vernalization to flower [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Similarly, some early-flowering Asian accessions show reduced SVP activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>]. Furthermore, the important role of FLC in vernalization requirement seems to have evolved relatively recently at the origin of the Brassicaceae; although <italic>FLC</italic> orthologues were found in other families by utilizing conservation of synteny, their contribution to vernalization requirement remains unclear [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>]. Our data show that in the presence of FLC, the number of SVP binding sites and the strength of their recognition increases (Figures <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> and <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Therefore, FLC might have evolved such an important role in flowering in the Brassicaceae at least in part by enhancing the activity of SVP. Although FLC clearly also functions independently of SVP. Such overlapping or degenerate functions of these TFs might be important in ensuring that loss of activity of one of them does not impair essential functions and that, therefore, early flowering summer annual accessions can compete in natural populations.</p>

    <title>Conclusions</title>
    <p>Our work has general significance in understanding the combinatorial activity of MADS-box TFs. We decoded the genome-wide interdependency of FLC and SVP, two TFs that have crucial roles in flowering control. Our findings show that their activities change when they act individually or as a complex. This behaviour confers flexibility as well as robustness to the regulatory network they govern. Also, their overlapping activities may allow plants in natural populations to tolerate genetic variation at these two genes, and thereby contribute to phenotypic differences in seasonal flowering behaviour observed in nature.</p>

Low-quality reads in the raw data (FASTQ files) were filtered out using Parallel-QC 1.0 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">85</xref>]. Reads kept were then mapped to the <italic>A. thaliana</italic> genome (TAIR10) using Bowtie [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86">86</xref>] version 2.0.2 under default parameters. Technical replicates showed very high similarity and were combined. Reproducibility of reads mapped and peaks called was assessed between biological replicates. Peak calling was done using MACS version 2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87">87</xref>] with a <italic>P</italic>-value cutoff of 1e-3, followed by IDR analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">88</xref>]. Duplicated reads were not considered during peak calling in order to achieve a better specificity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. Peaks across the three replicates with an IDR ≤ 0.05 were retained. We further post-processed the peaks using shape analysis implemented in the Bioconductor package NarrowPeaks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. Only MACS peaks also detected by NarrowPeaks were considered for further processing. Final sets of peaks were annotated to TAIR10 using the Bioconductor package CSAR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89">89</xref>]. Analysis of peak distribution over exon, intron, enhancer, proximal promoter, 5’ UTR and 3’ UTR was done in R using ChIPpeakAnno [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90">90</xref>]. Proximal promoter and immediate downstream were considered, respectively, 3 kb upstream of the transcription start site and 1 kb downstream the transcription end site. Quantitative comparison of peaks was done following the procedure described in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>], without quantile normalization of the peak scores.

      <p>To confirm enrichment of <italic>de novo</italic> identified <italic>cis</italic>-elements 1,000 sets of regions with similar length to ChIP regions were selected randomly from the <italic>A. thaliana</italic> reference sequence (TAIR10). MOODS was used to re-screen ChIP and random regions. Average numbers of sequences with CArG-box and G-box as well as standard deviation in random sets were calculated to generate Z-scores for each motif for each of the six scenarios. Z-scores above 3 were considered as significant.</p>

The 1TF dependent mode suggests that gene regulation is achieved by binding of only one of the TFs, either SVP or FLC. The redundant mode of regulation suggests that they bind to the same sequence and either of them is functional. The independent mode of regulation suggests that they bind to different DNA regions to additively repress gene expression. The dependent mode suggests that the FLC:SVP protein complex is needed to bind and repress transcription. Cluster names for each mode are also indicated. <bold>(C)</bold> Heat map of coefficients obtained from signalling allocation analysis for genes up-regulated in leaves (199 genes; left) and apices (40 genes; right). Down-regulated genes in mutants were not included in this analysis because most or all of these were assumed to be indirectly regulated. Negative values for the coefficients for FLC and SVP represent positive contributions of each gene to repression of gene expression. For the interaction term, negative values represent that FLC and SVP work cooperatively (dependent); zero, independently and positive, redundant. Letters identify the different clusters found.</p>
