    <abstract>
      <p>In many beef and some dairy production systems, crossbreeding is used to take advantage of breed complementarity and heterosis. Admixed animals are frequently identified by their coat color and body conformation phenotypes, however, without pedigree information it is not possible to identify the expected breed composition of an admixed animal and in the presence of selection, the actual composition may differ from expectation. As the roles of DNA and genotype data become more pervasive in animal agriculture, a systematic method for estimating the breed composition (the proportions of an animal’s genome originating from ancestral pure breeds) has utility for a variety of downstream analyses including the estimation of genomic breeding values for crossbred animals, the estimation of quantitative trait locus effects, and heterosis and heterosis retention in advanced generation composite animals. Currently, there is no automated or semi-automated ancestry estimation platform for cattle and the objective of this study was to evaluate the utility of extant public software for ancestry estimation and determine the effects of reference population size and composition and number of utilized single nucleotide polymorphism loci on ancestry estimation. We also sought to develop an analysis pipeline that would simplify this process for members of the livestock genomics research community. We developed and tested a tool, “CRUMBLER”, to estimate the global ancestry of cattle using ADMIXTURE and SNPweights based on a defined reference panel. CRUMBLER, was developed and evaluated in cattle, but is a species agnostic pipeline that facilitates the streamlined estimation of breed composition for individuals with potentially complex ancestries using publicly available global ancestry software and a specified reference population SNP dataset. We developed the reference panel from a large cattle genotype data set and breed association pedigree information using iterative analyses to identify purebred individuals that were representative of each breed. We also evaluated the numbers of markers necessary for breed composition estimation and simulated genotypes for advanced generation composite animals to evaluate the precision of the developed tool. The developed CRUMBLER pipeline extracts a specified subset of genotypes that is common to all current commercially available genotyping platforms, processes these into the file formats required for the analysis software, and predicts admixture proportions using the specified reference population allele frequencies.</p>

    <title>Introduction</title>
    <p>Estimation of the breed composition of individuals with complex ancestries has utility for estimating breed direct and heterosis effects as well as for the estimation of the additive genetic merit of these individuals. It also has value for identifying the breed composition of training populations used for genomic selection and hence the identification of target breeds in which the developed prediction equations may have some relevance. Visual classification of cattle based on breed characteristics suffers from similar problems as the self-identification of ethnicity in humans [<xref rid="pone.0221471.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], as most visible breed characteristics are determined by alleles at relatively few loci. For example, recent extensive crossing with Angus cattle in the U.S. produces a black hided animal which masks all other solid coat colors found in other breeds and requires only a single dominant allele at the <italic>MC1R</italic> locus. As a consequence, black-hided cattle have a “cryptic” population structure [<xref rid="pone.0221471.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0221471.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] and the visual classification of black-hided animals for branded beef programs can result in the marketing of animals with vastly different Angus genome content.</p>
    <p>In the U.S. and many other countries, the breed of an animal is associated with its being registered with a breed association which requires that both parents of the animal be identified and also registered with the association. For the previous 50 years, parentage has been validated by each breed association using blood or, more recently, DNA typing. Many breed associations have closed herdbooks which means, in theory, that the pedigrees of all animals can be traced back to the animals that founded the breed’s herdbook. Other breed associations have open herdbooks, which means that crossbred animals can be registered with the breed if they have been graded up by crossbreeding to purebred status with the expectation that a certain percentage of their genome (e.g., 15/16ths) originates from the respective breed based upon pedigree records and parentage validation. Pedigree errors that occurred prior to, or that were not identified following the implementation of blood typing and DNA testing, lead to admixed animals being incorrectly classified as fullblood and incorrectly identified admixture proportions in purebred animals. The effects of recombination, random assortment of chromosomes into gametes and selection can also lead to considerable variation in the extent of identity by descent between relatives separated by more than a single meiosis and can also lead to admixture proportions that differ substantially from expectation based on pedigree.</p>
    <p>Crossbreeding is extensively used in commercial beef production and in other livestock species production systems to capitalize on the effects of breed complementarity and heterosis resulting in herds of females that may have very complex ancestries that frequently use fullblood or purebred bulls sourced from registered breeders. Changes in the decision as to which breed of bull to use can result in large changes in admixture proportions of replacement cows and marketed steers between years and large differences can occur between herds for the same reason. When commercially sourced animals are used to generate resource populations to study the genomics of economically important traits such as feed conversion efficiency [<xref rid="pone.0221471.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0221471.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] or bovine respiratory disease [<xref rid="pone.0221471.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], the presence of extensive admixture in the phenotyped and genotyped animals may impact the genome wide association analysis (GWAA) [<xref rid="pone.0221471.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0221471.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] and leads to the training of genomic prediction models in populations for which the breed composition is not understood. As a consequence, the utility of these models in other industry populations, including the registered breeds in which the majority of genetic improvement is generated is also not understood.</p>
    <p>As the number of genotyped beef animals has increased, the need to classify the breed composition of these animals has necessitated the development of a precise and accurate method for estimating breed composition in cattle based on single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data. Iterative ancestry estimation analyses performed using different software input parameters may identify those that cause output sensitivity and can lead to an interpretation of population structure that is close to the truth [<xref rid="pone.0221471.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. We developed the CRUMBLER analysis pipeline to streamline the genomic estimation of breed composition of crossbred cattle using high-density SNP genotype data, publicly available software, and a reference panel containing genotypes for members of cattle breeds that are numerically important in North America. The CRUMBLER pipeline is species agnostic and could be adapted for breed composition estimation in other species. CRUMBLER and the reference panel data are available on GitHub (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/tamarcrum/CRUMBLER">https://github.com/tamarcrum/CRUMBLER</ext-link>).

      <title>Genotype data</title>
      <p>From among the numerically most important cattle breeds in North America, in terms of their annual numbers of animal registrations, a list was compiled to define the target breeds for reference panel development. Composite breeds, such as Brangus and Braford, were not included in this list due to lack of available genotype data, but the progenitor Angus, Hereford and Brahman breeds were included. Breeds such as N’Dama, representing African taurine, and Nelore and Brahman, representing <italic>Bos taurus indicus</italic> cattle, were included. We also initially included breeds that were likely to be involved in early crossbreeding of cattle in the U.S. (Texas Longhorn).</p>
      <p>From the 170,544 cattle with high-density SNP genotypes stored within the University of Missouri Animal Genomics genotype database, we extracted genotypes for 48,776 animals identified as being registered with one of the numerically important U.S. Breed Associations or belonging to other world breeds. Pedigree data were also obtained for these animals from each of the Breed Associations, where available (<xref rid="pone.0221471.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). These individuals had been genotyped using at least one of 9 different genotyping platforms currently used internationally to genotype cattle including the GeneSeek (Lincoln, NE) GGP-90KT, GGP-F250, GGP-HDV3, GGP-LDV1, GGP-LDV3, and GGP-LDV4 assays, the Illumina (San Diego, CA) BovineHD and BovineSNP50 assays, and the Zoetis (Kalamazoo, MI) i50K assay. The numbers of variants queried by each assay and the number of individuals genotyped using each platform are shown in <xref rid="pone.0221471.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>.</p>

To retain as many SNP markers as possible for subsequent analysis, we identified the intersection of markers present on the GGP-90KT, GGP-F250, GGP-HDV3, GGP-LDV3, GGP-LDV4, BovineHD, BovineSNP50 and i50K assays. However, during the process of identifying the animals that would define the breed reference panel, only 16 individuals had been genotyped using the GGP-LDV4 (n = 2) and GGP-LDV3 (n = 14) assays and no animals had been genotyped using the GGP-LDV1 assay. This intersection set included 6,799 SNP markers (BC7K). The intersection of the markers representing 5 assays (GGP-90KT, GGP-F250, GGP-HDV3, BovineHD, and BovineSNP50) was 13,291 markers (BC13K). By removing only the 16 individuals from the breed reference panel that had been genotyped on the GGP-LDV3 and GGP-LDV4 assays, we were able to compare ancestry predictions using two marker set densities (BC13K and BC7K).</p>

The pipeline utilizes the PLINK marker filtering tool (—extract) to extract the user-specified marker subset for ancestry analysis. For analyses of animals genotyped on different genotyping platforms, the marker list representing the intersection of the platforms can be provided to extract the markers that are common to all assays.

However, the smartpca package included in EIGENSOFT versions beyond 5.0.2 is not compatible with SNPweights. SNPweights requires an input variable, “<italic>trace</italic>”, to be located in the log file output from the smartpca analysis.

      <title>Reference panel development</title>
      <p>The definition of a set of reference individuals that define the genotype frequencies at each SNP variant for each reference breed is technically demanding, but vitally important to the process of defining ancestry. This process assumes that selection has not operated to change gene frequencies between target and reference population animals, and that each population is sufficiently large that drift has not impacted allele frequencies. It also assumes that migration between different countries does not influence population allele frequencies when registered animals are imported or exported. FastSTRUCTURE [<xref rid="pone.0221471.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] analysis and iterations of animal filtering using SNPweights was performed using the genotypes of candidate reference panel individuals to remove individuals with significant evidence of admixture from the reference breed panel.

Following fastSTRUCTURE analysis using K = 19 after removal of Salers and using the BC7K marker set, Texas Longhorn was also removed from the reference panel breed list due to the inability to distinguish Texas Longhorn as a distinct population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221471.g002">Fig 2</xref>).

The term “fullblood” is used to identify cattle for which every ancestor is registered in the herdbook and can be traced back to the breed founders. The term “purebred” refers to animals that have been graded up via crossbreeding to purebred status. Charolais also has an open herdbook registry in the U.S., however, access to Full French imported Charolais breed members was limited. As a result, all Charolais individuals identified as purebred in the association registry were retained for downstream analysis, however, these individuals could contain up to 1/32 introgression from another breed. A random sample of 200 individuals was taken for each breed with more than 200 identified fullblood individuals, otherwise all animals were sampled.

      <p>Using the phased BC7K genotypes for the final reference population of 803 individuals (3 Nelore genotyped with the BovineHD assay were removed because they were determined to cause problems for the phasing software), we simulated genotypes for 803 individuals each generation (N = 1, 3, 5 and 10) by randomly sampling two individuals as parents from generation N-1 and using a Poisson distribution to sample at random a single recombinant chromosome from each parent. The number of recombination events for each sampled chromosome was sampled from a Poisson distribution with mean equal to chromosome length in Mb/100 (i.e. 1.58 Morgans for chromosome 1). Simulated genotypes were produced for individuals 1 generation removed from the fullblood/purebred reference population animals (i.e., 50% breed A and 50% breed B), 3, 5, and 10, generations, respectively, to evaluate the ability of CRUMBLER to detect large through to small admixture proportions in animals with increasing numbers of breeds represented in their ancestry. Breed composition estimates for these animals were obtained by tracing the breed of origin of every allele present in each generation N animal. For each marker, we attributed the genomic fragment from the center points of the intervals on each side of each marker to the breed of origin of the two alleles at each marker and summed these across all loci. Finally, we normalized these sums by dividing by the autosomal genome size using UMD3.1 coordinates.</p>

    <title>Results and discussion</title>
    <p>The concept of breed and breed membership is man-made and does not inherently exist in nature. Moreover, the formation of breeds of cattle is very recent, as cattle domestication began about 10,000 years ago but the formation of herdbooks has occurred only during the last 200–250 years [<xref rid="pone.0221471.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Nevertheless, the effects of drift and human selection over the last 200 years have caused sufficient divergence among breeds that breed differences are identifiable at the molecular level. Such signals are essential for breed ancestry analyses to be effective in modern admixed animals. Previous work on assigning breed composition in admixed cattle utilized 50K genotype data and a reference panel of 16 breeds, with the basis for reference panel inclusion being breed association registration [<xref rid="pone.0221471.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. However, the continual evolution of genotyping assays has led to content changes resulting in only a relatively small proportion of markers in common among assays. Consequently, there is a need to evaluate whether these markers are sufficient for breed content estimation, leading to their conservation in the design of future assays. Furthermore the development of an analytical pipeline based on these markers would simplify analysis for end-users and the use of a single reference panel would allow the direct comparison of results between applications.</p>
    <sec id="sec016">
      <title>Reference panel development</title>
      <p>Previously developed cattle reference panels have relied on pedigree accuracy and breed association registration for their definition [<xref rid="pone.0221471.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Conversely, we used an iterative approach for reference population curation that was able to validate the accuracy of the pedigree information used to identify candidates. FastSTRUCTURE analyses performed using the candidate individuals for each of the initial 19 reference breeds suggested population subdivision in both the Hereford and Simmental (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221471.g002">Fig 2</xref>). Pedigree analysis for the Herefords within each subpopulation indicated that the subpopulations comprised animals from the highly inbred USDA Miles City Line 1 Hereford population (L1) and other individuals representing broader U.S. Hereford pedigrees. Since the founding of the L1 Herefords, the migration of germplasm has been unidirectional from L1 into the broader U.S. industry, as the L1 population has been closed since its founding [<xref rid="pone.0221471.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. L1 Herefords do not segregate for recessive dwarfism, which has been a threat to Hereford breeders since the 1950s, and this has led to L1 cattle becoming popular in the process of purging herds of the defect [<xref rid="pone.0221471.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. In 2008, the average proportion of U.S. registered Herefords influenced by L1 genetics was 81% [<xref rid="pone.0221471.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p>
      <p>The detected subpopulation division within the Simmental breed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221471.g002">Fig 2</xref>) represents the differentiation between purebred and fullblood animals. For example, progeny of a popular fullblood Simmental sire are present in both subpopulations, however, in one subpopulation the family members are all fullblood and in the other they are all purebred or percentage Simmental animals. This result supports the need to identify fullblood animals as reference panel breed representatives for breeds with open herdbooks.</p>

    <sec id="sec017">
      <title>Reference population sample size</title>
      <p>By randomly sampling individuals from the candidate reference breed set and using SNPweights to assign these individuals to reference populations, we found that reference panel breed sample sizes of ≤50 or ≤100 individuals appeared to capture the diversity within each breed and appropriately determined the ancestry of the tested individuals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221471.g003">Fig 3A and 3B</xref>). For each breed, the percent ancestry predicted for the tested reference samples was, on average, 3.86% higher when the SNP weights were estimated using ≤50 individuals per breed than when ≤100 individuals per breed were used (<xref rid="pone.0221471.t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). This reflects the increased homogeneity of individuals within each breed and a greater genetic distance between individuals from different breeds as smaller samples of individuals from each breed are used to define the reference panel. Further, due to limitations in the number of genotyped individuals for some breeds (<xref rid="pone.0221471.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), as the sample size was increased globally, imbalances were created between the reference panel breed sample sizes which impacted breed composition estimation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0221471.s011">S9</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0221471.s012">S10</xref> Figs). It has previously been shown that the power to detect population structure improves as the reference population sample sizes become more similar [<xref rid="pone.0221471.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0221471.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p>

      <p>After the replacement of reference breed individuals with those identified to be fullblood based on pedigree analysis for the open herdbook Gelbvieh, Simmental, Limousin, Braunvieh, Shorthorn, and Charolais breeds, additional self-assignment analyses were conducted to evaluate the effects of marker set size on ancestry prediction. Breed reference panels were again constructed by randomly sampling ≤50 individuals per breed and SNP weights were calculated using both the BC13K markers and BC7K markers. The estimated SNP weights were then used to self-assign ancestry to members of the reference panel animals representing the reference breed set. The ancestry predictions for the reference breed individuals using either the BC7K (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221471.g004">Fig 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0221471.s013">S11 Fig</xref>) or BC13K (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221471.g004">Fig 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0221471.s014">S12 Fig</xref>) marker sets indicate that use of the BC13K marker set did not significantly impact the ancestry predictions. Consequently, the use of the 6,799 markers common to the 8 commercially available genotyping platforms appears to be sufficient to assign breed ancestry for the majority of animals produced in the U.S. The CRUMBLER pipeline can accommodate samples genotyped using alternative assays, however, the produced breed composition estimates will be based on the intersection of markers on the assay and the BC7K marker set.</p>

      <p>We next examined the effects of reference breed homogeneity on ancestry assignment by identifying reference panel members that had been assigned to their breed of registry using SNPweights with probabilities of ancestry of ≥90%, ≥85%, ≥80%, ≥75%, and ≥70%, respectively (<xref rid="pone.0221471.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). From these individuals, reference breed panels were obtained by randomly sampling ≤50 individuals per breed, until each individual was represented in at least one sample set. SNP weights were then estimated using the BC7K marker set and ancestry was assigned for these individuals using SNPweights (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221471.g005">5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221471.g006">6</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0221471.s015">S13</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0221471.s017">S15</xref> Figs). Limiting the reference breed panel members to those individuals with ≥90% ancestry assigned to their breed of registry produced a reference panel that did not represent the extent of diversity within each of the breeds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221471.g005">Fig 5</xref>). On the other hand, using an ancestry assignment of ≥85% clearly captured greater diversity within each breed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221471.g006">Fig 6</xref>) and maximized the self-assignment of ancestry to the breed of registration (<xref rid="pone.0221471.t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>).</p>

      <p>To examine whether the specific individuals represented in the reference panel sample influenced the self-assignment of ancestry to the sampled individuals, a second sample of ≤50 distinct individuals per breed was obtained from the individuals with ≥85% assignment to their breed of registration and analyzed with SNPweights (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221471.g007">Fig 7</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221471.g007">Fig 7</xref> indicates that the ability to predict ancestry was not influenced by the specific individuals sampled from the set of animals with ≥85% ancestry to their breed of registration.</p>

However, these figures also reveal small amounts of apparent introgression from other reference panel breeds within each of the breeds. This does not appear to be an issue of marker resolution since the analyses performed with the BC7K and BC13K marker sets generated similar results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221471.g004">Fig 4</xref>). We conclude that these apparent introgressions are either due to a lack of power to discriminate among breeds using the common markers designed onto commercial genotyping platforms, or represent the presence of common ancestry among the breeds prior to the formation of breed herdbooks ~200 years ago. Molecular evidence for this shared ancestry exists, for example, Hereford and Angus cattle share the <italic>Celtic</italic> polled allele [<xref rid="pone.0221471.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] and the segmental duplication responsible for the white anterior, ventral and dorsal coat color pattern occurs only in Hereford and Simmental cattle and their crosses [<xref rid="pone.0221471.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. These data clearly indicate that crossbreeding was widespread prior to the formal conceptualization of breeds.</p>

      <title>Reference panel validation</title>
      <p>To evaluate the ability of the selected reference breed panel to identify breed composition, an analysis was conducted for all 170,544 samples in the database (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221471.g006">6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221471.g007">7</xref>). We extracted animals with pedigree information including fullblood and purebred animals registered with open herdbook breed associations and 2,243 crossbred animals with varying degrees of admixture. Considering the amount of available data, the number of pedigreed admixed animals was very limited and the purebred animals all had similar expected admixture proportions. Consequently, we next simulated genotypes for animals by assuming the random mating of members of the reference breed panel for 1, 3, 5 and 10 generations assuming non-overlapping generations to generate generations of animals with different numbers of breeds and breed proportions represented in their genomes.</p>

      <title>Registered fullblood animals</title>
      <p>For the Gelbvieh, Limousin, Shorthorn, Simmental, and Braunvieh breeds that have open herdbook registries, fullblood or 100% ancestry individuals were identified based on pedigree data obtained from the respective breed associations (<xref rid="pone.0221471.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). CRUMBLER estimates were obtained for these fullblood individuals and the distribution of estimates by breed are in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221471.g008">Fig 8</xref>. For all breeds except Charolais, &gt;50% of the individuals had CRUMBLER estimated percentages of ≥80% to their respective breeds.

However, the number of genotyped imported Full French Charolais animals was limited and so we also analyzed all purebred Charolais individuals which could contain up to 1/32<sup>nd</sup> of their genome introgressed from another breed. The average Charolais breed assignment was 72% and the distribution of estimates was more variable than for the fullblood animals from the other breeds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221471.g008">Fig 8B</xref>).</p>

The analysis results agreed with the pedigree data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221471.g009">Fig 9A and 9B</xref>) To investigate the correlations between pedigree and CRUMBLER estimated breed proportions, we removed proportions for breeds that were less than 3% and normalized the remaining values.

      <title>Simulated genotypes</title>
      <p>Genomes were simulated using the phased genotypes for 803 individuals from the reference breed panel to contain varying breed numbers and admixture proportions after 1, 3, 5, and 10 generations of random mating with nonoverlapping generations. In generation 1, the admixed individuals were F<sub>1</sub> individuals with a 50:50 autosomal genome composition unless both parents were randomly sampled from the same breed. CRUMBLER estimates of breed composition using the simulated genotypes were strongly correlated with the simulated compositions, especially for generations 1 and 3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221471.g011">Fig 11</xref>). As the number of generations increased, the number of breeds represented in the simulated genomes tended to increase and the proportion of the genome originating from any one breed tended to decrease and the correlation between the simulated proportions and CRUMBLER estimates also decreased. Nevertheless, by generation 10 44% of animals had their genome proportions estimated with a correlation of at least 70%. In the U.S. commercial crossbreeding does not usually involve the use of more than 3–4 breeds of cattle and while the number of generations of crossbreeding may very well be 10 or perhaps more, many generations will involve the mating of animals with similar genome ancestries and the proportions for each breed will be much greater than present in the generation 10 animals in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221471.g011">Fig 11</xref>. Consequently, the achieved accuracies are likely to be closer to the generation 3 or 5 results where 99% and 68% of animals, respectively, had their genome proportions estimated with a correlation of greater than 80%.</p>

      <title>Advanced generation composite animals</title>
      <p>The ancestry model assumes that neither drift or selection has acted to alter the allele frequencies from those created by the initial admixture proportions. We examined CRUMBLER estimates of breed composition for advanced generation members of the Brangus (n = 11,362), Beefmaster (n = 3,832) and Santa Gertrudis (n = 2,010) composite breeds where selection has had the opportunity to change breed composition from expectations at breed formation. Brangus individuals are expected to be ⅝ Angus and ⅜ Brahman, Beefmaster individuals ¼ Hereford, ¼ Shorthorn and ½ Brahman, and Santa Gertrudis ⅝ Shorthorn and ⅜ Brahman, respectively. These breeds use mating strategies that produce individuals that are expected to possess these proportions for registration within each of the respective breed’s herdbook. However, registerable animals are ultimately advanced generation composites and so drift, meiotic sampling of parental chromosomes and selection are all expected to create individual variation in these ancestry proportions. CRUMBLER results for these advanced generation composites, also known as the American breeds, are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221471.g012">Fig 12</xref>. <xref rid="pone.0221471.t006" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref> contains the average breed proportion estimates assigned to each of these breeds by CRUMBLER and their standard deviations across the animals analyzed for each breed. In every instance, CRUMBLER underestimates the expected proportions for each of the American breed populations, however, the ancestral breeds clearly dominate the assignments (<xref rid="pone.0221471.t006" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref>). Interestingly, on average, CRUMBLER estimated proportions of Holstein ancestry for advanced generation Beefmaster and Brangus animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221471.g012">Fig 12</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0221471.t006" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref>). These American breeds do not contain any Holstein introgression and they do not contain ancestry from a “Ghost Population”, a population that is not present in the reference set, which would lead to a breed assignment to a reference breed that it most closely resembled [<xref rid="pone.0221471.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. We speculate that this effect is caused by selection creating a deviation in allele frequencies from those found in the founder breeds which the model explains by an introgression from a distantly related breed, in this case, Holstein. Stratifying these genotyped animals according to the number of generations from foundation fullblood animals and examining the extent of estimated Holstein introgression, which would be expected to increase with generation number, would enable this to be tested, but we did not have access to the necessary data. However, this hypothesis is supported by the fact that the Santa Gertrudis had the least estimated Holstein introgression and the breed has published estimates of additive genetic merit for many fewer years than the Beefmaster or Brangus.</p>

      <title>Admixture</title>
      <p>We also tested the ADMIXTURE software [<xref rid="pone.0221471.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] for ancestry estimation and integration into the CRUMBLER pipeline using the same reference breed panel that was developed for use with SNPweights. ADMIXTURE uses maximum likelihood estimation to fit the same statistical model as STRUCTURE, however, STRUCTURE does not allow the specification of individuals of known descent to be used as a reference panel [<xref rid="pone.0221471.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. ADMIXTURE allows a supervised analysis, in which the user can specify a reference set of individuals, by specifying the “—supervised” flag and requires an additional file with a “.pop” suffix to specify the genotypes of the reference population individuals [<xref rid="pone.0221471.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Unlike SNPweights, the reference population individuals’ genotypes must be provided in a genotype file for each analysis.</p>
      <p>We first conducted an ADMIXTURE analysis in which we self-assigned ancestry for the animals in the reference breed set formed with ≤50 individuals per breed from the individuals that had ≥85% assignment to the breed of registration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221471.g013">Fig 13</xref>). The results shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221471.g013">Fig 13</xref> are similar to those in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221471.g006">Fig 6</xref> for the same reference panel, albeit with perhaps less evidence of background introgression. We next conducted an analysis using the reference panel used in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221471.g013">Fig 13</xref> merged with data for the 2,005 high percentage crossbred Herefords animals. The results shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221471.g014">Fig 14</xref>, reveal a significant change in the ancestry proportions estimated for the reference panel Guernsey, Gelbvieh and Romagnola individuals between the two analyses which used exactly the same reference panel, but differed only in the number of individuals for which ancestry was to be estimated. This suggests that ADMIXTURE may use the target individuals to update information provided by the reference panel individuals specified in the “.pop” file. Consequently, the ADMIXTURE estimated ancestry proportions appear to be context dependent and may vary based on the other individuals included in the analysis.</p>

      <p>Moreover, the order in which the target individuals appear in the genotype input file also appears to affect ADMIXTURE estimates of ancestry proportions for the target individuals. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221471.g015">Fig 15</xref> shows the results of an ADMIXTURE analysis in which the target individuals were identical to those shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221471.g014">Fig 14</xref>, but for which the order of the reference individuals and the 2,005 Hereford crossbred individuals was reversed in the input files.

The results reveal a significant change in ancestry proportions for Guernsey and Gelbvieh, but the Romagnola now appear to be non-admixed. Finally, we performed an ADMIXTURE analysis for these animals in which the order of animals in the input genotype file was completely randomized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221471.g016">Fig 16</xref>). Following analysis, the individuals were sorted to generate <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221471.g016">Fig 16</xref>. Again, the ancestry proportions for the Guernsey, Gelbvieh and Romagnola individuals suggest these breeds to be admixed.</p>

      <p>STRUCTURE and ADMIXTURE are widely used for characterizing admixed populations [<xref rid="pone.0221471.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], however, we have not found any reports in the literature that indicate that the software is sensitive to the input order of individuals. However, we suspect that the majority of users would have no need or motivation to run the software with permuted data input files. Nevertheless, because of these inconsistencies between results, we chose to not use ADMIXTURE for ancestry estimation within the CRUMBLER pipeline.</p>

      <title>Broader application using additional commercially available assays</title>
      <p>To broaden the spectrum of data from different commercially available assays that can be evaluated, an additional intersection of markers was obtained using 11 commercially available bovine assays including the GGP-90KT, GGP-F250, GGP-HDV3, GGP-LDV3, GGP-LDV4, BovineHD, BovineSNP50, i50K, Irish Cattle Breeding Federation (Cork, Ireland) IDBv3, and GeneSeek (Lincoln, NE) BOVG50v1 assays. The intersection SNP set included 6,363 SNPs (BC6K). A SNPweights self-assignment analysis using the reference set of individuals with ≥85% assignment to their breed of registration was conducted to assess the effects of the reduction in number of markers used for ancestry assignment. The ancestry proportions assigned based on the BC6K marker set (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221471.g017">Fig 17</xref>) did not differ appreciably from those obtained using the BC7K marker set (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221471.g006">Fig 6</xref>). This result indicates the utility of CRUMBLER and the reference panel breed set across the spectrum of commercially available genotyping platforms.</p>

    <title>Conclusions</title>
    <p>The determination of a set of reference population breeds and individuals that define allele and genotype frequencies at each variant for each of the breeds is arguably the most important, yet technically difficult step in the process of ancestry estimation. We employed several iterations of filtering to remove recently admixed individuals and identify a relatively homogeneous set of individuals that nevertheless represented the variation that might be expected among individuals within a breed. Once determined, the reference panel genotype data need only be processed once to obtain SNP weights removing the need to share genotype data for reference individuals in subsequent studies [<xref rid="pone.0221471.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The upfront development of an external reference breed panel capitalizes on the rich ancestry information available in large available datasets, and relatedness, variation in sample sizes and diversity among the target individuals does not affect the inference of ancestry [<xref rid="pone.0221471.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p>
    <p>In cattle, the visual evaluation of breed characteristics is a poor method for evaluating the ancestry of individuals. Breed association pedigrees can be used to estimate expected breed compositions, however, the random assortment of chromosomes into gametes and selection can lead to ancestry proportions that differ from those expected based upon pedigree. Moreover, the vast majority of commercial beef cattle in the U.S. have no or very limited pedigree information and since these animals are frequently used for genomic research [<xref rid="pone.0221471.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0221471.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], there is a need for a tool that can routinely provide ancestry estimates for downstream use in GWAA or other genetic studies.</p>
    <p>We tested ADMIXTURE and SNPweights and found that results from ADMIXTURE appear to depend on the ancestry and order of appearance of individuals within the genotype input file. We therefore developed an analysis pipeline, CRUMBLER, based upon PLINK, EIGENSOFT and SNPweights to automate the process of ancestry estimation. The developed bovine pipeline utilizes the 6,799 SNPs present on 8 commercially utilized bovine SNP genotyping assays and results using these SNPs are consistent with results obtained when 13,291 SNPs were used. From an available 48,776 genotyped individuals, we also developed a reference panel of 806 individuals sampled from 17 breeds to have ≤50 individuals per breed that had ≥85% assignment to their breed of registration. This panel appears to allow the robust estimation of the ancestry of advanced generation admixed animals, however, all breeds share some common ancestry which predates the recent development of breed association herdbooks [<xref rid="pone.0221471.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0221471.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The greatest constraint that we faced in the development of the reference panel was the unequal sample sizes for genotyped registered animals and the sensitivity of ancestry software to unequal sample sizes. If access could be gained to the very large samples of genotyped animals from each of the U.S. breed associations, simply taking a random sample from each population such that the sample size within each breed was 4-5X the effective population size (N<sub>e</sub>~100 for each breed), we suspect that we would have effectively created representative samples for the reference panel. Furthermore, our panel of 6,799 SNPs represents the the intersection of markers on the commonly used genotyping assays and these SNPs are probably represented on all assays because they have high call rates and minor allele frequencies in the majority of breeds. Consequently, these SNPs are probably far from being desirable as ancestry informative markers. A future research direction would be to identify a relatively small set of ancestry informative markers available either on currently available genotyping assays or, preferably, from whole genome sequencing projects such as the 1000 Bull Genomes project and include these ancestry informative markers on future design iterations of bovine genotyping assays.</p>
    <p>CRUMBLER is not limited to application in cattle and with the provision of suitable reference breed allele frequencies can be applied to other species for ancestry estimation. CRUMBLER pipeline scripts and reference panel breed SNP weights are available on GitHub (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/tamarcrum/CRUMBLER">https://github.com/tamarcrum/CRUMBLER</ext-link>).</p>
