    <abstract id="Abs1">
      <p id="Par1">To understand the cellular composition and region-specific specialization of white matter — a disease-relevant, glia-rich tissue highly expanded in primates relative to rodents — we profiled transcriptomes of ~500,000 nuclei from 19 tissue types of the central nervous system of healthy common marmoset and mapped 87 subclusters spatially onto a 3D MRI atlas. We performed cross-species comparison, explored regulatory pathways, modeled regional intercellular communication, and surveyed cellular determinants of neurological disorders. Here, we analyze this resource and find strong spatial segregation of microglia, oligodendrocyte progenitor cells, and astrocytes. White matter glia are diverse, enriched with genes involved in stimulus-response and biomolecule modification, and predicted to interact with other resident cells more extensively than their gray matter counterparts. Conversely, gray matter glia preserve the expression of neural tube patterning genes into adulthood and share six transcription factors that restrict transcriptome complexity.

    <title>Introduction</title>
    <p id="Par3">An understanding of microenvironmental heterogeneity and its broad impact on biological processes is necessary to interpret experimental perturbations, especially in the central nervous system (CNS). Recent advances in genetic profiling tools have uncovered regional cellular diversity in the brain’s gray matter (GM) far beyond what had traditionally been appreciated<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. However, the characterization of cellular profiles in white matter (WM) is limited due to its modest representation in mouse. The common marmoset (<italic>Callithrix jacchus</italic>) is an emerging animal model that bridges mouse and higher primates genetically, immunologically, and behaviorally. Importantly, there is a massively greater (&gt;5-fold) subcortical WM to cortical GM volumetric ratio in marmoset compared to mouse<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>, raising the possibility that primates evolved novel but as-yet-undescribed glial heterogeneity to support this expansion.</p>
    <p id="Par4">Moreover, beyond obvious differences in the density of neurons and oligodendrocytes between GM and WM, the extent of structural and functional heterogeneity of other resident cells remains unclear. Motivating a deep investigation of such heterogeneity are prior observations that WM-astrocytes are primed to be more advanced in their response to pathological challenges<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. For example, compared to astrocytes in GM, astrocytes in WM have a higher capacity for glutamate clearance to handle excitotoxic insults and disproportionally higher senescence-induced expression of GFAP (a reactive gliosis indicator)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Similarly, more microglia are found in WM than in GM of normal human brain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>, and microglia in WM are primed to be more active and respond to injury faster than their GM counterparts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Additionally, it has been shown that the timing and efficiency of remyelination mediated by oligodendrocyte progenitor cell (OPC) differentiation varies significantly between GM and WM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>.</p>
    <p id="Par5">To determine whether location-specific regulatory programs broadly influence resident cells, and whether these microenvironmental cues lead to transcriptomic segregation that further defines cell identities, we here describe a detailed map of the cellular composition across 19 CNS regions, including many WM areas, created by profiling all cell types without preselection. We extensively investigate the regional diversity of cells, especially with respect to GM-WM segregation, by comparing transcriptome similarity across species and datasets. We demonstrate ways of using this resource to classify unknown cell types, query intercellular communication, and discover associations with disease. Our carefully annotated marmoset brain cell atlas resource, “CjPCA,” is designed to inform future studies in evolutionary, developmental, and pathological neurobiology.</p>

      <p id="Par6">To build an atlas with sampling reproducibility, a low bias in cell-type recovery, and good compatibility with clinical studies, we performed single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) of nuclei extracted from uniformly sized tissue punches without preselection or sorting. snRNA-seq is widely applied in human tissue<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>, able to identify cell types similarly to single-cell (sc) RNA-seq<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>, and the only proven method to analyze tissue that cannot be readily dissociated into single-cell suspensions without introducing additional artifacts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. We performed in vivo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the 2 marmoset brains, cross-referenced the imaging data to 3D MRI atlases to guide tissue sampling, surveyed cells without preselection, and grouped them into three different categories to facilitate downstream comparison (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a–d</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). As indexed in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref>, we use “WM,” “GM,” and “other” (in quote marks) to indicate sampling sites as specifically defined in our paper; WM/GM (without quote marks) is used for general descriptive purposes, including when mentioning published works.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><title>Glial transcriptome reflects differential residence in gray and white matter.</title><p><bold>a</bold> Experimental workflow to scan and map images to marmoset MRI atlases. <bold>b</bold> Location of samples collected as cylinders of 2 mm diameter and 3 mm thickness on the standard slab (SS) index.

      <p id="Par7">To ensure that common artifacts were properly addressed in droplet-based transcriptome analysis, we applied SoupX<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup> to subtract ambient RNA background and DoubletFinder<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup> to remove doublets for individual samples before data integration with Harmony<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup> (Methods, Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>, Supplementary Figs. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>–<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref>, and Supplementary Data <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">1</xref>). We confirmed that the segregation between major cell classes is stable and that paired samples from different animals are comparable, without much variation even before data alignment with Harmony (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3a</xref>). After data integration, a total of 534,575 nuclei were recovered in Level 1 analysis, and six cell classes were determined by the expression of canonical markers (NEU, <italic>CNTN5</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup> neurons; OLI, <italic>MOG</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup> oligodendrocytes; AST, <italic>ALDH1L1</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup> astrocytes; OPC, <italic>PDGFRA</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup> oligodendrocyte progenitor cells; MIC, <italic>PTPRC</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup> microglia/immune cells; VAS, <italic>LEPR</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup> vascular cells/<italic>CEMIP</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup> meningeal cells / <italic>TMEM232</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup> ventricular cells; Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1e</xref>). We found that only a modest number of neurons (~11% median abundance of total cells; Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1f</xref>) were present in “WM,” showcasing the precision of image-guided tissue sampling. We compared the profile of ambient RNA, frequently detected genes, and high-ranked variable genes in different cell types across brain regions and found no evidence of systematic tissue type-specific contamination from background RNA or doublets after quality control (Supplementary Figs. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5</xref>, <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6</xref>).<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Key resources</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Deposited Data</th><th>Identifier</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Hammond et. al. 2019</td><td>GEO: GSE121654</td></tr><tr><td>Marisca et. al. 2020</td><td>GEO: GSE132166</td></tr><tr><td>Marques et. al. 2016</td><td>GEO: GSE75330</td></tr><tr><td>Zeisel et. al. 2018</td><td><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://mousebrain.org/">http://mousebrain.org/</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td>Zhang et. al. 2014</td><td>GEO: GSE52564</td></tr><tr><td>Polioudakis et. al. 2019</td><td>dbGaP: phs001836</td></tr><tr><td>Lake et. al. 2018</td><td>GEO: GSE97930</td></tr><tr><td>Habib et. al. 2017</td><td>GEO: GSE104525</td></tr><tr><td>Zhang et. al. 2016</td><td>GEO: GSE73721</td></tr><tr><td>Jäkel et. al. 2019</td><td>GEO: GSE118257</td></tr><tr><td>Absinta et. al. 2021</td><td>GEO: GSE180759</td></tr><tr><td>Marmoset Gene Atlas</td><td><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://gene-atlas.brainminds.riken.jp/">https://gene-atlas.brainminds.riken.jp/</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td>Marmoset Brain Mapping</td><td><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://marmosetbrainmapping.org/">https://marmosetbrainmapping.org/</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td><bold>Software and Algorithms</bold></td><td><bold>Identifier</bold></td></tr><tr><td>R (v3.6.1 2019-07-05)</td><td><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/">https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td>Cellranger (v3.0.2)</td><td><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.10xgenomics.com/">https://www.10xgenomics.com/</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td>seurat (v3.1.5)</td><td><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/satijalab/seurat">https://github.com/satijalab/seurat</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td>DoubletFinder (v2.0.2)</td><td><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/chris-mcginnis-ucsf/DoubletFinder">https://github.com/chris-mcginnis-ucsf/DoubletFinder</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td>clustree (v0.4.3)</td><td><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/lazappi/clustree">https://github.com/lazappi/clustree</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td>SoupX (v1.4.5)</td><td><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/constantAmateur/SoupX">https://github.com/constantAmateur/SoupX</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td>harmony (v1.0)</td><td><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/immunogenomics/harmony">https://github.com/immunogenomics/harmony</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td>monocle3 (v0.2.0)</td><td><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/cole-trapnell-lab/monocle3">https://github.com/cole-trapnell-lab/monocle3</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td>gprofiler2 (v0.1.9)</td><td><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gprofiler2/index.html">https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gprofiler2/index.html</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td>nichenetr (v0.1.0)</td><td><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/saeyslab/nichenetr">https://github.com/saeyslab/nichenetr</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td>EWCE (v0.99.2)</td><td><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/NathanSkene/EWCE">https://github.com/NathanSkene/EWCE</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td>Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (v01-16)</td><td><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://digitalinsights.qiagen.com/product-login/">https://digitalinsights.qiagen.com/product-login/</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td>Fiji (v2.1.0/1.53c)</td><td><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://imagej.net/Fiji/Downloads">https://imagej.net/Fiji/Downloads</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td><bold>Other</bold></td><td><bold>Identifier</bold></td></tr><tr><td>CjPCA website</td><td><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://cjpca.ninds.nih.gov">https://cjpca.ninds.nih.gov</ext-link></td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p>
      <p id="Par8">The abundance of oligodendrocytes and neurons was correlated across tissue types (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4e</xref>), such that more oligodendrocytes were found in “WM” and more neurons in “GM,” as expected. By contrast, “other” had cellular composition intermediate between “WM” and “GM” (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1f</xref>). The relative composition of marmoset major cell types (47% neurons, 35% oligodendrocyte-lineage cells, 12% astrocytes, and 4% immune cells) across 19 selected regions corresponds well to morphological counting of cell types in the human neocortex (42% neurons, 43% oligodendrocyte-lineage cells, 11% astrocytes, and 3% immune cells) across age (18–93 years) and sex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>.

      <p id="Par10">With respect to neurons, it was not our primary focus to define new subtypes or quantify region and layer specificity, but we performed some basic analyses to anchor the resolution of our atlas with published datasets collected primarily from cortical regions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. In the current atlas, we profiled five different cortical areas and employed MRI-guided tissue collection to ensure consistency across animals. We note that a 2-mm-diameter tissue punch is sufficient to cover nearly the full thickness of marmoset cortex. Furthermore, the purity of cortical sampling can be estimated by the number of oligodendrocytes present in “GM” (~8% median abundance; Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1f</xref>).</p>
      <p id="Par11">For neurons, a total of 248,091 nuclei yielded 50 NEU subclusters. We intentionally subclustered neurons at relatively low resolution to facilitate tracking of spatial origin. We highlight well-studied markers, cluster annotations, and sampling sites to facilitate cross-database comparison (Supplementary Figs. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">9</xref>, <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">10</xref>). Nuclei in the UMAP were first colored by the expression of vesicular glutamate transporters (VGLUT; <italic>SLC17A7</italic>, <italic>SLC17A6</italic>, <italic>SLC17A8</italic>) (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">9b</xref>) and dot plot colored by neurotransmitter module scores (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">9b</xref>), dropping subclusters with less than 10% detection rate of VGLUT transcripts. We also colored nuclei by sampling site, which demonstrated, as expected based on our sampling, that cortical “GM” was the major contributor of neurons, with relatively high consistency in neuronal composition across “GM” (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">10c–g</xref>). In addition, we observed that cortical excitatory neurons (primarily VGLUT1<sup>+</sup>) were arranged onto a continuous path in the UMAP plot (lamination layer L2–L6, NEU32–45), which indicates similarity in the transcriptomes of neurons that reside in adjacent laminae. As previously reported in mouse and human<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>, the expression of <italic>STAB2</italic> (L2–6), <italic>LAMP5</italic> (L2/3), <italic>RORB</italic> (L4), and <italic>THEMIS</italic> (L5/6) anchor the transition of the graded pattern along this path. Given that the establishment of lamination is completed prenatally<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>, we cross-referenced our findings in the adult with an available in situ hybridization (ISH) database (Marmoset Gene Atlas) from P0 marmoset<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. We found that the expression of lamina-enriched genes agreed with what has been examined spatially in the database (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">11</xref>).</p>
      <p id="Par12">Overall, the major features related to neurons (Supplementary Figs. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">9</xref>–<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">13</xref>) closely agree with several previous reports<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Therefore, we focused on the strong GM-WM spatial segregation of microglia, OPC, and astrocytes (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1g</xref>) to assess glial heterogeneity across 19 brain regions in detail. We further used GM-glia and WM-glia (i.e., WM-microglia, WM-OPC, WM-astrocytes, written here without quote marks) to indicate regionally enriched glial subtypes, as opposed to glia sampled from “GM” or “WM,” which include all glia collected from the indicated area regardless of subtype. The design of our study does not enable us to address directly if GM- and WM-glia diverge autonomously (such as from different progenitors). However, we first explored the possibility that, regardless of developmental origin, glia might be specialized within each microenvironment in response to different functional demands. As gene expression often falls along a spectrum, we considered the transcriptomic landscape in its entirety instead of using one or a few genes to define each subpopulation. In the following analysis, we approach glial heterogeneity by comparing the biological programs we identified in marmoset with 11 published single-cell or single-nucleus studies in other species.</p>

      <p id="Par14">We identified regionally enriched subtypes across 19 tissue types. We denoted two subtypes (MIC1 and MIC2) as GM-microglia, for they were found to be most abundant in “GM.” We then named the other major cluster (MIC3) WM-microglia for its absence in “GM” and enrichment in “WM.” All three subtypes of microglia present with various proportions in “other,” which had cellular composition intermediate between relative pure WM and GM (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">14a, b</xref>). This GM-WM segregation of microglia was so strong that the abundance of WM-microglia (MIC3) was positively and negatively correlated with the number of oligodendrocytes and neurons, respectively. In contrast, GM-microglia (MIC1 and MIC2) had similar densities across brain regions (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">14c</xref>). We found that the expression of <italic>SLC15A1</italic>, an oligopeptide transporter, is selectively enriched in WM-microglia (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>) and validated that anti-SLC15A1 preferentially labels IBA1<sup>+</sup> cells in WM (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3d</xref>). Next, we performed particle and morphological analysis on IBA1 labeling to compare the density and the shape of microglia in GM and adjacent WM. We found two to three times more IBA1<sup>+</sup> cells present in WM compared to GM, which agrees with the relative abundance of microglia profiled from “GM” and “WM” with snRNA-seq (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>). Moreover, the shape of microglia in WM was more elongated, indicated by a larger value of reciprocal circularity, compared to GM (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3e–h</xref>).</p>
      <p id="Par15">To understand the functional implication of this segregation, we identified pathways that are differentially weighted in each microglia subtype using gene module<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup> and gene ontology (GO) analysis and explored the similarity of these programs compared to published work (Supplementary Figs. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">14</xref>–<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">17</xref> and Supplementary Data <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">2</xref>). It has been shown that normal aging impacts GM and WM asynchronously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. Therefore, we sought to compare these regionally enriched modules in microglia against a dataset with temporal resolution. We linked marmoset gene names to their mouse orthologs, then cross-referenced the expression pattern of the defined modules in microglia extracted from the whole mouse brain (ages E14.5 to P540)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. After splitting mouse microglia into 3 age groups (embryo, neonate, and adult; Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3i</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">16</xref>), we found that gene modules enriched in marmoset GM-microglia were highly expressed in microglia of young mice, whereas gene modules enriched in marmoset WM-microglia were also highly expressed in microglia of adult mice (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3j</xref>). These findings suggest that the transcriptomic profile of WM-microglia appears further aged than that of GM-microglia. GM-WM segregation of the microglial transcriptome is observed as early as P7 (during myelinogensis) in mouse<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup> and persists with normal aging in both human and mouse<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. Understanding whether environmental cues in myelin-rich regions drive microglia specialization requires further study.</p>
      <p id="Par16">Next, we performed a GO analysis to summarize the regulatory programs enriched in each gene module. As a positive control, we found the expected sharing across microglia subtypes of gene modules involved in synapse pruning, complement system, and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">17a</xref>). Next, we focused on comparing GO terms that are specifically enriched in each subtype. Terms related to synaptic plasticity, neurotransmitter secretion, and neuron survival are enriched in GM-microglia (Knn.m3; Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">17b</xref>), whereas terms related to biomolecule metabolism, cell movement, and response to stimulus are enriched in WM-microglia (PG.m1/4; Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">17d, e</xref>). Therefore, GM-microglia appear younger and more involved in modulating neuronal activity, while WM-microglia appear older and are primed to a more reactive state even in homeostasis.</p>

      <p id="Par18">Interestingly, several top-enriched genes related to general nervous system functioning were shared between GM-OPC (OPC1) and GM-microglia (MIC1), and both populations had fewer detected genes compared to their WM counterparts (Supplementary Figs. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">14b</xref>, <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">18b</xref>).

      <p id="Par19">In line with our finding that marmoset WM-microglia appear transcriptionally more advanced in normal aging than their GM counterparts (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3i, j</xref>), it has been reported that rat OPC in WM are more mature than those in GM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>, and that they differentiate into mature oligodendrocytes more efficiently than OPC in GM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>.

Consistent with what has been reported for OPC derived from the adult human brain, we did not observe a separate cycling OPC cluster (<italic>TOP2A</italic><sup>+</sup>) in adult marmoset brain, as has been reported for OPC derived from zebrafish, adult mouse, and developing human cortex (Supplementary Figs. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">22</xref>, <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">23</xref>). Instead, cells expressing S and G2/M phase genes were dispersed across the OPC1–3 subclusters.

      <p id="Par22">Prior to this comparison, we humanized gene names of each species with one-to-one orthologs and only included genes that are detected in all datasets, which might limit the depth of the comparison. However, we found agreement in oligodendrocyte-lineage differentiation features across species (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>): marmoset differentiating OPC (OPC5) and oligodendrocytes (OLI) correlate with <italic>ENPP6</italic><sup>+</sup>/<italic>MAG</italic><sup>+</sup> oligodendrocyte-lineage cells in mouse (mm1_2, mm2_1, mm3_NFO, mm3_OLI) and human (hs1_4, hs2_2, hs3_3, hs4_OLI), but less so in zebrafish (dr_3). Also, we observed consistently larger differences between marmoset WM-OPC (OPC3) and OPC from all other species analyzed. We quantified this observation by comparing the fold-change of similarity between OPC subclusters, measured as the ratio of <italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup> values across clusters (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c</xref>). Although the underrepresentation of a marmoset WM-OPC-like population in other datasets may partially be due to technical differences, such as sampling site, it is also possible that OPC were broadly undersampled in other datasets. As clustering resolution is sensitive to cell counts in single-cell studies, low recovery number of OPC (particularly those derived from humans) and/or lack of inclusion of enough equivalent WM regions (especially in mice, where there is little WM) might contribute to this observation.</p>

Therefore, we denoted as OLI1 the subcluster that is <italic>PDGFRA</italic><sup>−</sup>/<italic>TNS3</italic><sup>+</sup>/<italic>ENPP6</italic><sup>high</sup> and named the other OLI clusters (OLI2–6) consecutively (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">25e</xref>). Instead of a clear GM-WM segregation, we found proportional differences along the intermingled OLI subtypes across brain regions.

      <p id="Par25">Based on this expression pattern, one might surmise that OLI1 are the youngest and OLI6 the oldest oligodendrocytes; however, we found them to be close in the space of the 2D UMAP projection, which could indicate transcriptomic similarity; alternatively, a 2D projection may not be sufficient to capture important aspects of the data. Therefore, we pursued a 3D UMAP analysis of oligodendrocytes, finding that the two ends are separated along a spiral pattern that was also observed upon reanalysis of previously reported human<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup> (Supplementary Figs. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">28</xref>, <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">29</xref>) and mouse<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup> (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">30</xref>) oligodendrocyte transcriptomes.

      <p id="Par26">Despite some discrepancy in the assignment of subcluster identity among datasets, five major stages of oligodendrocyte-lineage cells are widely accepted in the field to annotate the trajectory: OPC, differentiation-committed oligodendrocyte precursors (COP), newly formed oligodendrocytes (NFOL), myelin-forming oligodendrocytes (MFOL), and mature oligodendrocytes (MOL). Interestingly, however, <italic>ENPP6</italic><sup>high</sup> oligodendrocytes are located at both ends of the trajectory in mouse datasets (Supplementary Figs. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">30</xref>, <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">31</xref>), but only at one end of the trajectory in marmoset and human. This observation raises the question of whether the second <italic>ENPP6</italic><sup>high</sup> population was selectively lost in primates, or, alternatively, whether labeling the marmoset <italic>ENPP6</italic><sup>high</sup> population as “youngest” is not valid.</p>
      <p id="Par27">To address this question, we compared the transcriptomes from a bulk-RNA sequencing dataset from brain cells immunopanned with surface markers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup> and two single-cell sequencing datasets in mouse<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. We found that the transcriptome of NFOL, as defined by their cell surface marker (GalC<sup>+</sup>), was most closely correlated with that of mature oligodendrocytes, as defined by single-cell analysis, and that the pattern of correlation did not track with the ordering of those oligodendrocyte subclusters in UMAP space (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">31</xref>). These observations raise the possibility that the single-path model of the differentiation trajectory of oligodendrocytes requires modification.</p>
      <p id="Par28">Whereas <italic>ENPP6</italic>, a choline-supplying enzyme<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>, is enriched in OLI1–3, OLI4–6 were selectively labeled by <italic>MUSK</italic> (muscle-associated receptor tyrosine kinase) enrichment (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5b</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">25e</xref>). The oligodendroglial expression of <italic>MUSK</italic> has not been described; however, its functions in cholinergic signaling at the neuromuscular junction are known. With mechanism unknown, its expression in the brain is thought to mediate cholinergic responses, synaptic plasticity, and memory formation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>, suggesting that OLI4–6 might be a neuron activity-dependent population, consistent with findings from studies of adaptive myelination<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup>. Moreover, it seems likely that there is species disparity in the expression of <italic>MUSK</italic> in oligodendrocytes, for it was detected in both marmoset and human but not in any mouse datasets. Although protein-level validation of MUSK expression in tissue was unsuccessful, we found that <italic>MUSK</italic> was indeed expressed by oligodendrocytes by fluorescent in situ hybridization: <italic>MUSK</italic><sup>+</sup>/<italic>OLIG2</italic><sup>+</sup> double-labeled cells were found in both GM and WM of marmoset brain, and there was no noticeable difference in <italic>MUSK</italic> level per individual <italic>OLIG2</italic><sup>+</sup> in GM compared to WM (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5c</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">27d, e</xref>). Whether <italic>MUSK</italic> expression is unique to primates or animals in specific phylogenetic branches, and the extent to which it is developmentally regulated, require further investigation.</p>
      <p id="Par29">Next, we asked whether graded transcriptomic changes along the spiral oligodendrocyte trajectory can be modeled by waves of influence from within and/or directional stimuli from the environment. To address this, we performed a pseudotime analysis of marmoset oligodendrocytes and mapped the expression of transcription factors along pseudotime trajectories. We set <italic>ENPP6</italic><sup>high</sup> oligodendrocytes as the starting point for this analysis and visualized gene expression dynamics along the pseudotime axis (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5b</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">25d</xref>). Although the pattern of expression dynamics agrees with the visual impression of gene expression along the spiral 3D UMAP path, we found that molecular distances from OLI4 to OLI5 and from OLI4 to OLI6 were similar, indicating that OLI5 and OLI6 might develop in parallel rather than dependently (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5d, e</xref>). We next mapped the expression pattern of transcription factors along the trajectory and found that different sets of regulator profiles were used by different subsets of oligodendrocytes (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5d–g</xref>). Of all transcription factors examined, only <italic>ELF2</italic> and <italic>ETV5</italic> peaked in the middle stages of oligodendrocytes (OLI2 and OLI3, respectively), whereas the other transcription factors were clustered either at the “early” (OLI1) or “late” (OLI4–6) stages. A positive correlation between <italic>ELF2</italic> and myelin was supported in a human snRNA-seq study, in which <italic>ELF2</italic> was high in control WM, normal-appearing WM, and remyelinated multiple sclerosis lesions but lower in WM lesions (active, chronic active, and chronic inactive)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>.

That <italic>ETV5</italic> expression peaks in OLI3 (Step 60–80, Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5d</xref>) suggests that OLI3 might be a population that is poised to further specialization upon appropriate signaling.</p>

      <p id="Par30">In Level 1 analysis, we observed an intermingled distribution of nuclei with shared transcriptomic features from the astrocyte (AST) and vascular (VAS) classes. Therefore, we pooled these two classes for the second round of quality control, which facilitated artifact imputation before further cell class splitting. A total of 74,204 nuclei comprising astrocytes and primary cell types (endothelial cells, meningeal cells, and ependymal cells) present at the CNS barriers (blood–brain, blood–CSF, and brain–CSF) remained after quality control (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">32</xref>). As the neurovascular unit is mostly established prenatally<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup>, we referred to a currently available ISH atlas of P0 marmoset<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup> to confirm the localization of markers expressed by these cell types.

      <p id="Par32">For astrocytes, a total of 61,147 nuclei were partitioned into 8 subclusters (AST1–8; Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">37</xref>). Similar to what was identified for microglia and OPC classes, AST1 was found most abundant in “GM,” and AST3 was enriched in “WM” (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6a</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">37c</xref>).

      <p id="Par33">In “WM” samples, different profiles of astrocyte subtypes were observed; for example, AST4 and AST5 were enriched in the pCC and OpT but not in other WM areas, similar to what was found in Thal, LGN, MB, Pons, and cSC (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6a</xref>). Moreover, GFAP<sup>+</sup> astrocytes greatly varied in density, size, and shape across the brain (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6b–d</xref>). This agrees with what has been described in the human brain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref></sup>, specifically that protoplasmic astrocytes are primarily found in the cortex, whereas WM-astrocytes are fibrous in morphology (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6b</xref>). The number and dimension of GFAP<sup>+</sup> cells are diverse across cortical layers, tissue type, and even WM areas. These results lead to a prediction that the brain’s astroglial response to stimuli may be heterogeneous even across WM areas (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6b–d</xref>).</p>
      <p id="Par34">Similar to what has been described in a mouse brain cell atlas<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>, we found that grouping tissue by developmental category together with WM-GM disparity most effectively describes astrocyte segregation (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6e</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">37a</xref>). This observation led us to investigate further the effect of local neural tube patterning signals in defining astrocyte subclusters and whether these signals also affect other cell types in the same region. Therefore, we examined the expression of patterning genes along the anterior-posterior axis across cell classes and tissue types (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6e, f</xref>). We found that the expression of patterning genes across brain regions was grossly preserved across cell types, with some interesting exceptions. In the telencephalon, all cell classes in cortical GM expressed high levels of patterning genes that were most prominently detected in the forebrain (<italic>FEZF2</italic>, <italic>EMX1</italic>, <italic>FOXG1</italic>, <italic>DLX1</italic>, <italic>SHH</italic>, and <italic>DLX5</italic>). Caudate (enriched with <italic>SIX3</italic>) and hippocampus, though belonging to telencephalon gray (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">37a</xref>), have mostly lost the expression of forebrain patterning genes (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6f</xref>). Similarly, most WM cells appeared to have lost this specification, except for some <italic>FEZF2</italic> and <italic>FOXG1</italic> expression in astrocytes and neurons. Cells in the posterior corpus callosum had patterning gene expression similar to that observed in the thalamus, LGN, and midbrain (<italic>WNT3</italic>, <italic>OTX2</italic>, <italic>GBX2</italic>, <italic>LHX9</italic>, and <italic>EN1</italic>). <italic>EN2</italic> was enriched in the cerebellum, but hindbrain patterning genes (<italic>HOX</italic> genes) were high in pons, cervical spinal cord, and sporadically in the optic tract.</p>
      <p id="Par35">In conclusion, we observed that the transcriptomes of WM cells seem to deviate from the profile of forebrain patterning. This forebrain, midbrain, and hindbrain specification was preserved prominently in astrocytes and indeed determined their identity as distinct AST subclusters (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6f</xref>). This suggests that heterogeneity in developmental origin might play a role in subtype specialization in addition to GM-WM disparity in diversifying astrocytes.</p>

      <title>GM-glia share regulatory pathways, and WM-glia interact with other resident cells more than GM-glia</title>
      <p id="Par36">The presence of gray-white matter segregation within some glial cell types, together with the observation of transcriptional similarity across glia within tissue types, led us to hypothesize that there might be regulatory programs that are shared by resident cells within the same microenvironment to execute intercellular functions properly. We reasoned that the similarity of enriched gene modules among resident glia might be due to the activation of common transcription factors. To explore this possibility, we extracted and compared differentially expressed transcription factors between matching GM-/WM-glia pairs (MIC1/MIC3, OPC1/OPC3, and AST1/AST3). We found greater overlap in differentially enriched transcription factors in GM-glia (15 overlapping transcription factors) than in WM-glia (three overlapping transcription factors). Interestingly, six transcription factors were shared across all GM-glia, whereas no transcription factors were shared across all WM-glia. GM-glia transcription factors (<italic>EGR1</italic>, <italic>HLF</italic>, <italic>PEG3</italic>, <italic>MYT1L</italic>, <italic>HIVEP2</italic>, and <italic>BHLHE40</italic>) are known to restrict RNA biosynthesis, potentially explaining the observation that GM-glia are low in RNA features compared to their WM counterparts (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7a</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">40a</xref>).<fig id="Fig7"><label>Fig. 7</label><caption><title>GM-glia share regulatory pathways and express fewer genes than WM-glia.</title><p><bold>a</bold> Venn diagram showing shared, differentially expressed transcription factors across GM-glia (left) and WM-glia (right).

      <p id="Par37">Our observation of top-ranked GO terms that were similar among GM-glia but not among WM-glia led us to seek a better method to quantify this pattern systematically. We compared the similarity of terms by calculating the Jaccard index between module pairs across cell classes and visualizing their similarity as networks. Conformingly, GO terms were more similar among gene modules enriched in GM-glia than other gene modules, and regulatory programs in GM-microglia showed the highest similarity with those in GM-OPC (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7b</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">40b</xref>).</p>
      <p id="Par38">We reasoned that this cross-cell-type enrichment of similar regulatory programs might be achieved by close communication between neighboring cells; therefore, we modeled ligand-receptor interactions to test this hypothesis. To achieve this, we employed NicheNet analysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref></sup>, which curates known ligand-receptor and receptor-target relationships and ranks them based on the level of support in published literature. We performed this analysis taking the subtypes of microglia, OPC, and astrocytes that were primarily enriched in “GM” (MIC1, OPC1, and AST1) and “WM” (MIC3, OPC3, and AST3) as “receivers” and other cells in the same tissue type as “senders” (Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8a</xref>). We consistently found more, and more unique, ligand-target pairs in “WM” than in “GM,” and these were generated by a wider variety of sender types (Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8b, c</xref>, Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">41</xref>, and Supplementary Data <xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media">3</xref>). In “WM,” endothelial cells and astrocytes were the most frequently observed additional sender types (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">41f, i, l</xref>). Astrocytes (4830 pairs) formed more ligand-target pairs than microglia (2828 pairs) or OPC (1813 pairs). Among ligand-target pairs found shared in “GM” and “WM” (1753 for microglia, 1236 for OPC, 3015 for astrocytes), certain senders were represented disproportionately to their relative abundance (Figs. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>f, <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>c, <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">37c</xref>), with microglia and OPC constituting the most common top-ranked senders (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">42</xref>).

Interestingly, we observed the potential contribution of a subset of oligodendrocytes (OLI4–6) to parkinsonism, consistent with recent reports from postmortem brain transcriptomic data<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref></sup>.</p>
      <p id="Par41">Consistent with the microenvironment specialization of glia reported here, we found examples in which genes associated with an organic mental disorder were differentially expressed in GM-microglia (MIC1) and GM-astrocytes (AST1) but not in their WM counterparts. Genes associated with CNS tumor were enriched in WM-microglia (MIC3) and WM-OPC (OPC3), but surprisingly not in astrocytes. By contrast, all microglia subtypes (MIC1–MIC3), but not other cell types, appear to contribute to multiple sclerosis pathogenesis (Fig. <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9b</xref>), consistent with results from genome-wide association studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref></sup>. Interestingly, genes unique to CNS tumor and encephalitis (List.21) are differentially enriched in MIC2, a less dominant GM-microglia that is present in various proportions in microglia sampled from “WM” (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">14a</xref>). Together, these results support our contention that there is transcriptome diversity among GM- and WM-glia, and that these variations are significant enough for specific subtypes to be predicted to contribute differentially to various neurological disorders.</p>

    <title>Discussion</title>
    <p id="Par42">We have provided a resource and initial analysis for each major cell class across 19 CNS tissue types. We observed the greatest GM-WM spatial segregation in subclusters of microglia, OPC, and astrocytes. GM-glia are generally naïve, protoplasmic, and enriched in GO terms related to neuronal functioning, whereas WM-glia are more active, fibrous, and enriched in GO terms related to morphogenesis and signaling dynamics. We accumulated some evidence that WM-glia have accrued additional features, are further advanced in the program of specialization, and are more interactive than their GM counterparts. This atlas, therefore, serves as a bridge between rodent and human data that may prove useful for the understanding of the cellular and molecular basis of human neurological disorders.</p>
    <p id="Par43">Although our study was carefully designed and executed, and rigorous quality control steps were implemented at every stage of the experimental and analysis pipeline, technical variation and artifacts remain intermingled with biological effects. For example, spinal cord samples were outside the region covered by the MRI atlas, and results were derived from two libraries prepared with 10x v2 and 1 library with 10x v3 chemistry (fewer genes were recovered using v2 than from v3 on average). Additionally, while snRNA-seq has several advantages, including higher tolerance for tissue processing, it captures only nascent RNAs and cannot interrogate locally enriched species along neural cell processes. Another limitation is that annotations for genes and transcripts, and associated functional terms, are less complete for marmoset than for mouse or human, and some annotations are inferred and might change in the future. We were therefore relatively conservative in clustering and defining cell types, and it is likely that further subclustering would have yielded more distinct cell types.</p>
    <p id="Par44">We defined cell types and linked their molecular properties to functions with more than one method, including pathway analysis, disease association mapping, and morphological analysis; however, electrophysiological features remain unlinked. With respect to sampling, although we profiled as many nuclei as possible in each round, often &lt;1% of nuclei were studied from each region (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1e</xref>), meaning that rare subclusters were probably missed. Additionally, given finite resources, we elected to sample the brain richly rather than to include samples from additional marmosets, limiting, for example, our ability to answer age-, sex-, or left-right asymmetry-related questions. Instead, we performed associational analysis and first highlighted shared features across coarse tissue types. Further analysis in combination with direct experimental tissue-level validation is necessary to assess region-specific phenotypes in each fine structure.</p>
    <p id="Par45">These limitations aside, the protocol described here is easily adapted to other settings and allows nuclei to be mapped onto relatively small regions to increase reproducibility and aid future validation studies. Our analysis, therefore, provides a framework for understanding the diversity of cell types in the marmoset brain, allowing us to form actionable hypotheses and laying the groundwork for future studies.</p>

      <p id="Par46">Our CNS marmoset cell atlas was generated from two healthy, 5.5-year-old common marmosets (<italic>Callithrix jacchus</italic>), one female (CJH01) and one male (CJR02). Staining was done using 4 healthy 4–6-year-old marmosets, two females (CJaT01 and CJaV02) and two males (CJaB03 and CJaD04). All marmosets were housed and handled with the approval of the NINDS/NIDCD/NCCIH Animal Care and Use Committee (ACUC). On the day of imaging, marmosets were anesthetized by intramuscular injection of 10 mg/kg ketamine, intubated, and ventilated with a mixture of isoflurane and oxygen during in vivo MRI scans. MRI was performed on a 7 T Bruker scanner to generate a series of proton density-weighted images with a resolution of 0.15 × 0.15 × 1 mm<sup>3</sup> per voxel and a matrix of 213 × 160 × 36 per session<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref></sup>.

The volume was then used to create a custom-made brain holder by 3D printing (Ultimaker 2<sup>+</sup>) for each marmoset to guide ex vivo tissue sampling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref></sup>. After each in vivo scan section, marmosets were weaned from 2% isoflurane, recovered with a lactated ringer injection subcutaneously, and returned to their original housing.</p>

        <p id="Par47">On the day of tissue harvest, marmosets were deeply anesthetized with 5% isoflurane until any visible signs of breathing were no longer detected. Animals were transcardially perfused with ice-cold artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF) for 5 min with a pump. Brains were removed from the skull and submerged into ice-cold aCSF, and after the removal of meninges within the aCSF solution, were positioned in a custom-designed brain holder within 10 min post-perfusion. The brain was sectioned at 3 mm into 12–13 slabs in one step with a homemade blade-separator set in the aCSF solution. Each brain slab was transferred into a 6-well plate, submerged into RNAlater (RNAlater™ Stabilization Solution, AM7021, Invitrogen) with a homemade brain trap, and stored at 4 °C overnight. The following day, brain slabs were positioned in 25 × 20 × 5 mm molds (Tissue-Tek® Cryomold®, 4557, Sakura Finetek) on ice to facilitate target sampling. Slabs were matched to MRI for each animal, and tissue annotation for gray<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup> and white matter<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref></sup> was informed by marmoset 3D MRI atlases V1 and V2. A cylinder of tissue 2 mm in diameter and 3 mm in height for each region (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>) was collected with a tissue punch (EMS-core sampling tool, 69039-20, EMS). There were five white matter samples from temporal and parietal lobes that did not exactly match the two animals, however, they were paired in lobes of the brain and showed no significant differences in subsequent analysis (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>, SS05, SS06, and SS08). The cylinders were ejected into PCR tubes filled with 100 µL of RNAlater and stored at −80 °C. The quality of RNAlater-preserved tissue was assessed by measuring RNA Integrity Number (RIN) on the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (G2939BA, Agilent). Bulk RNA was isolated with TRIzol™ Reagent (15596026, Invitrogen) and measured with Agilent RNA 6000 Pico Kit (5067-1513, Agilent); samples with RIN &gt;8.5 were used in the study.</p>

        <p id="Par48">Nuclei preparation was carried out as described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref></sup>, with minor modifications. Briefly, on the day of dissociation, tissue samples were thawed on ice, removed from the solution, dabbed with Kimwipes to remove residual RNAlater, and placed in a 1 mL douncer tube (Dounce Tissue Grinder, 357538, Wheaton). Each tissue was homogenized in 500 μL of lysis buffer containing 400 units of RNase inhibitor (RNaseOUT Recombinant Ribonuclease Inhibitor, 10777-019, Invitrogen) and 0.1% Triton-X100 in low sucrose buffer (0.32 M sucrose, 10 mM HEPES, 5 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 3 mM MgAc, 0.1 mM EDTA, and 1 mM DTT in ddH<sub>2</sub>O, pH8) with loose pestle 25 times and tight pestle ten times. The homogenate was filtered through a 40-μm mesh (Falcon® 40 µm Cell Strainer, 352340, Corning) to a 50-mL Falcon tube on ice. An additional 5 mL of low sucrose buffer was used to rinse the douncer tube and cell strainer. The filtered homogenate was further mixed with a handheld homogenizer (VWR® 200 Homogenizer) at a speed of ~1000 rpm to brake nuclei clumps for 5 s. After homogenization, a serological pipet filled with 12 mL of high sucrose buffer (1 M sucrose, 10 mM HEPES, 3 mM MgAc, and 1 mM DTT in ddH<sub>2</sub>O, pH8) was placed underneath the lysate and disconnected from the pipettor, and the buffer was released from the serological pipette by gravity and set on ice. When most of the high sucrose buffer was released to form a density layer underneath the homogenate, the serological pipet was retrieved along the wall of the Falcon tube gently, without disturbing the low-high sucrose interface. The Falcon tube was capped and placed in a swing bucket to be centrifuged at 3200 × <italic>g</italic> for 30 min at 4 °C. At the end of a spin, the supernatant was decanted quickly without tabbing, and 1 mL of resuspension buffer (0.02% BSA in 1X PBS, pH7.4) containing 200 units of RNase inhibitor was added to the Falcon tube to rinse the nuclei. Slow pipetting was employed to resuspend nuclei along the Falcon tube wall below the 5-mL mark to preserve nuclei integrity. Specifically, nuclei were rinsed off the wall in courses of 2 s per trituration for 20 times total per tube. The Falcon tube was then capped and spun at 3200×<italic>g</italic> for 10 min at 4 °C. At the end of spin, the supernatant was removed by gently tabbing the tube until no visible liquid drop was left behind, and 200 μL of resuspension buffer was added to each sample to collect the nuclei. The nuclei suspension was filtered through a 35-μm mesh (Cell Strainer Snap Cap, 352235, Corning) twice and counted on a hemocytometer by trypan blue staining. During counting, the size and quantity of myelin and other debris were visually inspected under the scope, and the suspension was filtered 1–3 more times through the 35-μm mesh if necessary. Only round and dark-blue stained nuclei were considered of good quality and included in the final count.</p>

        <p id="Par50">The raw sequencing reads were aligned to a marmoset genome assembly, ASM275486v1 (GCA_002754865.1). To build a reference package suitable for analyzing both unspliced pre-mRNA and mature mRNA in the nuclei, as well as to include sequences of mitochondrial genome, marmoset DNA sequence (FASTA) and annotation (GTF) files were acquired from the Ensembl release-95 and modified as follows. The complete mitochondrial sequence (NC_025586.1, GenBank) and its annotation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref></sup> were manually added to the FASTA and GTF files. Next, a pre-mRNA GTF was made by replacing “transcript” with “exon” as the feature-type entry in the original GTF before making a reference package with CellRanger software (v3.0.2, 10x Genomics). This custom-built reference package was then used in CellRanger (version 3.1.0, 10x Genomics) to align sequencing reads for all samples. The option to estimate cell number automatically was used for most of the samples, unless otherwise specified (see Supplementary Data <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">1</xref> for details). A filtered cell barcode-to-gene feature matrix was generated from the software and used for downstream analysis (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2a</xref>).</p>

Cells with &lt;200 genes, &gt;5000 genes, or &gt;5% of counts mapped to the mitochondrial genome were excluded. Genes observed in &lt;5 cells were excluded. The filtered raw count matrix was then log normalized (ln(counts × 100,000 + 1)) within each cell and scaled to account for differences in sequencing depth with Seurat. Next, DoubletFinder<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup> was used to estimate and remove putative doublets to mitigate technical confounding artifacts in droplet-based sequencing data analysis. The top 3000 variable genes calculated by Seurat were used in linear dimension reduction (principal components analysis, PCA), and the top 30 principal components (PC) were used for clustering at low resolution (parameter = 0.4) to define coarse cell types. These unsupervised clusters were used to provide a quick cluster annotation for homotypic doublet probability modeling in DoubletFinder. The doublet rate was estimated by fitting a linear equation over a multiplet rate table provided by 10x Genomics. The rate = (0.0008 × cell.number + 0.0527)/100) was used to calculate a Poisson distribution with and without homotypic doublet proportion to generate low confidence (DF.found.1) and high confidence (DF.found.2) doublet annotation. Unless otherwise specified, pN = 0.25, pK = 0.005, and automatic doublet removal based on DF.found.2 annotation were used, as the first line of screening.</p>
        <p id="Par52">In parallel, SoupX<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup> was used for ambient RNA background correction. Taken from the output of the 10x Genomics pipeline (raw_feature_bc_matrix), the ambient RNA from empty droplets that contained &lt;10 unique molecular identifiers (UMI) were profiled, and the “soup” contamination fraction was calculated for each cluster. Given that the nuclear transcriptome was profiled, genes that mapped to the mitochondrial genome could be considered as a marker of ambient input. Specifically, the top mitochondrial genes (species with &gt;1000 accumulated counts across profiled empty droplets) were used to estimate the global contamination fraction and adjust the raw count matrix. Next, the cell barcode that passed the DoubletFinder was used as an index to subset the SoupX-corrected matrix to generate a new matrix as our downstream input (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2a</xref>). For individual samples, a Seurat object was created, and the index labels (IL01_uniqueID, IL02_species, IL03_source, IL04_sex, IL05_ageDays, IL06_tissue.1 (coarse category), IL06_tissue.2 (developmental category), IL06_tissue.3 (fine category), IL07_location, IL08_condition, IL09_illumina, IL10_chemistry, IL11_batch, IL12_LMinDays, IL13_LMaxDays, IL14_dataset, IL15_annotation) were added to the metadata as cell attributes. For each sample, 90% of nuclei were randomly selected, then all 42 samples were merged for downstream comparison.

In the first round of clustering and visualization, 100 PC were computed and used for Harmony (v1)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup> to integrate different samples, specifically variability over the IL01_uniqueID attribute, with default setting (theta = 2, lambda = 1, sigma = 0.1). The UMAP space and nearest-neighbor analyses were calculated on the top 50 Harmony embeddings with resolutions from 0.4–1.2. Cell barcodes of a cluster of nuclei annotated as “low quality,” which resided at the center of the 2D UMAP (H50), were recorded; these nuclei had a high percentage of reads mapped to the mitochondrial genome, low RNA counts and features, and/or expressed genes that mapped to multiple canonical markers of different cell types. No single set of parameters can adequately separate ~500 K nuclei to identify subclusters from all major cell types simultaneously, as either over-splitting for low complexity cells (e.g., glia) or under-splitting for high complexity cells (e.g., neurons) would result. Therefore, a stepwise clustering approach was used, whereby major cell classes (neurons and oligodendrocytes, etc.) were first identified and then divided into subclusters for each class (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>).</p>

        <p id="Par55">To divide nuclei into classes and facilitate artifact identification, nuclei were first classified using a set of parameters that do not highlight granular detail. In this round of clustering, only 50 PC for Harmony were computed to perform linear correction over IL01_uniqueID, as the elbow plot from the preliminary analysis showing the standard deviation stopped visually decreasing after the top 50 PC. The top five Harmony-corrected embeddings (H5) were used for Seurat to learn the UMAP and find cell classes at a low resolution (0.2). Canonical cell-type markers (<italic>PTPRC</italic> for immune cells, <italic>PDGFRA</italic> for OPC, <italic>MAG</italic> for oligodendrocytes, <italic>GFAP</italic> and <italic>SLC1A2</italic> for astrocytes, <italic>LEPR</italic> and <italic>CEMIP</italic> for vasculature and meningeal cells, and <italic>CNTN5</italic> and <italic>NRG1</italic> for neurons) annotated 6 of the classes unambiguously. One cluster in the middle of the H5 UMAP had mixed expression of canonical markers, which suggested an artifact. The “low quality” cell barcodes that were found from the H50 condition (defined above) were overlaid on the H5 UMAP, which exclusively highlighted the putative artifact cluster. These nuclei were removed from further analysis, although the original UMAP embeddings were maintained for plotting purposes (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1e</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref>).</p>

        <p id="Par56">Nuclei that passed Level 1 QC were divided into five classes (MIC, OPC, OLI, VAS/AST, NEU) based on the H5 UMAP result. Astrocytes and vasculature/meningeal cells were pooled into a single class prior to subclustering to facilitate artifact identification (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>). Shared features in this class of cells are potentially explainable by their close association at CNS barriers (blood–CSF, blood–brain, and CSF–brain interfaces). For each class, log-normalization and scaling were repeated from the divided raw count matrix, and the top 3000 variable genes were used for 50 PC computation, Harmony correction over IL01_uniqueID, UMAP learning, and clustering, as described above. The clustering resolution was iteratively increased from low to high (0–1.2), and clustering stability was tracked with clustree (v0.4.3). NEU Level 2 clustering stability was also tracked by calculating the Jaccard index at resolution 2 (res.2, Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">13a, b</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. Aided by the branch visualization provided by clustree, a tentative resolution that was relatively stable was selected, then differentially expressed gene (DEG) analysis on the clusters found with this parameter set was performed. The expression patterns of the top-expressed genes for each cluster within and across classes were checked, and artifact clusters were manually imputed. Doublets tended to form small distinct clusters in the UMAP plots that branched early in the clustering tree analysis with a low splitting resolution, had mixed canonical marker-gene expression, and had similar expression patterns to cells in other partitions; thus, these doublets could be easily spotted and removed. For putative doublets within each class, additional rounds of DEG analysis were performed as necessary. Each time nuclei were removed, basic normalization, scaling, Harmony, and UMAP learning were repeated. To control for over-splitting, for clusters that appeared to be a single pile in the 2D UMAP space but were annotated into &gt;1 cluster, additional rounds of DEG analysis were performed to see if binary labeling markers could be found. In addition, clustering was projected onto a 3D UMAP space to ensure effects were not masked due to overcrowding in 2D. This strategy helped to further elucidate cluster associations, aid decision-making with respect to groups of clusters that should be tested further, and spot potential gradient changes among clusters. If unique and/or binary patterns could not be found in the current splitting resolution after these steps were performed, a step lower in resolution on the clustering tree was examined, and the analysis was repeated. The following compound naming convention to label the 87 subclusters was used: general category in numeric order, major tissue or location contributor for each cell type, and binary marker combination where applicable.</p>

      <title>NicheNet ligand-receptor-target analysis</title>
      <p id="Par62">Potential intercellular communication in WM and GM was modeled using nichenetr (v0.1.0)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref></sup> The cross-partition objects for WM and GM generated as described above were used for this analysis (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2e</xref>). Bioinformatic resources and protocols were modified from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/saeyslab/nichenetr">https://github.com/saeyslab/nichenetr</ext-link>. Briefly, NicheNet studies intercellular communication computationally by leveraging known ligand-to-receptor and receptor-to-target relationships in its database. It allows the prediction of interactions between ligands expressed by “sender” cells and receptors expressed by “receiver” cells, and models how these interactions might drive gene expression changes in cells of interests (target DEG in the receivers).</p>
      <p id="Par63">We hypothesized that differences between WM and GM might partially explain tissue-type-specific subpopulations of microglia, OPC, and astrocytes. Therefore, NicheNet was used to test if transcriptome changes between subclusters could be explained by environmental signals from nearby cells. WM and GM differentially enriched microglia, OPC, and astrocyte subpopulations were defined as receivers in each test, and DEG between MIC1 and MIC3, OPC1 and OPC3, and AST1 and AST3 were derived. DEG were filtered at adjusted <italic>p</italic> value (&lt;0.05) and absolute log (ln) fold-change (&gt;0.25). Potential senders were defined from clusters with &gt;50 nuclei in the same tissue type as each receiver, and genes detected in &gt;10% of the nuclei in a cluster were kept for further analysis. Preconstructed databases were downloaded for ligand_target_martix [<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://zenodo.org/record/3260758/files/ligand_target_matrix.rds">https://zenodo.org/record/3260758/files/ligand_target_matrix.rds</ext-link>], ligand_receptor_database [<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://zenodo.org/record/3260758/files/lr_network.rds">https://zenodo.org/record/3260758/files/lr_network.rds</ext-link>], and weighted networks [<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://zenodo.org/record/3260758/files/weighted_networks.rds">https://zenodo.org/record/3260758/files/weighted_networks.rds</ext-link>]. Gene names for these databases were built with human data, therefore human genes with one-to-one orthologs were translated to marmoset gene names with BioMart. The weighted ligand-receptor-target (LRT) matrix was thereby constructed, with weighting factors implemented so that informative data sources maximized prediction accuracy in the final model. The list of sources used to build this database and the method to calculate the weighted scores have been specified<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref></sup>. After “expressed ligands” were defined for senders and “expressed receptors” for receivers (&gt;10% detection rate), the existence of ligand-target pairs was established. The ligand-target pairs were ranked based on the presence of the target genes (defined by the receptor-target database) in the calculated DEG using the predict_ligand_activities() function. The filtered DEG present in the top 200 predicted target genes per ligand were kept for further ligand-target analysis.</p>
      <p id="Par64">For visualization of this complicated intercellular interaction, Circos plots were generated. First, the lists of ligand-target pairs in WM and GM were compared and divided into three categories (GM, WM, and shared), and a Venn diagram was generated for each type of receiver (microglia, OPC, and astrocytes; Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8c</xref>). The unique ligand-target pairs for each environment were plotted in enlarged Circos plots, and the shared ligand-target pairs in smaller Circos plots, for categorical visual reference (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">41e, h, k</xref>, bottom panels). The shared Circos plots were also enlarged to aid the visibility of individual genes (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">42</xref>). Since any given ligand might be expressed by &gt;1 cell type, each ligand was assigned to the cell cluster that ranks highest in the product of detection rate (%) and expression level (<italic>z</italic>-score scaled). Since the probability is low for any ligand to be assigned to a particular cell type with this strategy, it is sufficient to map intercellular interaction qualitatively and categorically (see Supplementary Data <xref rid="MOESM7" ref-type="media">4</xref> for full report). The senders by Level 1 classes (MIC, OPC, OLI, AST, VAS, and NEU) were colored, and pie charts tabulating the proportion of unique (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">41</xref>) and shared (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">42</xref>) ligand-target pairs were generated. For each Circos plot, up to 100 weighted ligand-target interactions were presented to limit overcrowding. For shared ligand-target pairs, an inter-categorical agreement was calculated and presented in Sankey diagrams using the networkD3 (v0.4) package.</p>

Serial sections were cut at 5 µm from the brain and spinal cord tissue blocks from each animal using a Leica RM2235 Manual Rotary Microtome. Sections were mounted onto Superfrost<sup>+</sup>/Colorfrost<sup>+</sup> microslides (Daigger, 75 mm × 25 mm, #EF15978Z) and stored at room temperature. Before staining, sectioned slides were deparaffinized with xylene three times for 5 min each, rehydrated with EtOH (100, 70, 50% for 5 min each), and rinsed in DI H<sub>2</sub>O for 5 min at RT. Hematoxylin &amp; eosin staining was subsequently performed. Hematoxylin (basophilic) stains nucleic acids and nuclei purple, whereas eosin (acidophilic) stains cytoplasmic components of the cell pink. For hematoxylin staining: slides were dipped one-by-one in hematoxylin (Leica, 100% Surgipath SelecTech Hematoxylin 560MX, 3801575) for 1 min and immediately placed in running tap water to stop the reaction and rinse off excess stain.

Each region was imaged at 10X magnification with a Nikon Eclipse Ci microscope. The number of cells in each area of interest was counted using Fiji ImageJ. A color image threshold of 0–165 was chosen to highlight an optimal number of cells and limit the number of falsely identified cells. Using the “Analyze Particles” function, the number of cells at the chosen threshold was counted automatically, with the pixel size range set to 20–200, and the circularity range to 0.25–1.00, to exclude as much background noise and as many linear particles as possible. After the automatic counting, falsely identified cells were manually deleted, and a new count was saved. Additional cells not detected by the automatic counter were manually added using the CellCounter plugin. A final image with automatic and manual cell count markers was saved, and the total number of cells (including manual deletions and additions to the automatic count) was recorded. Cell counts were normalized to the imaged area to get the density of nuclei per tissue type in each animal. The averaged nuclei density per mm<sup>2</sup> in each tissue type was then quantified. To estimate the initial number of nuclei for single-nucleus sequencing per cylinder of 2 mm diameter and 3 mm height (V = 3π µL), the averaged 2D density measured from hematoxylin &amp; eosin-stained sections was used after multiplication by section thickness (5 µm).
