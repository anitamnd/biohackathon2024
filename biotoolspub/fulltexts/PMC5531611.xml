    <abstract>
      <p id="P1">The physiology of a cell can be viewed as the product of thousands of proteins acting in concert to shape the cellular response. Coordination is achieved in part through networks of protein-protein interactions that assemble functionally related proteins into complexes, organelles, and signal transduction pathways. Understanding the architecture of the human proteome has the potential to inform cellular, structural, and evolutionary mechanisms and is critical to elucidation of how genome variation contributes to disease<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>–<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>. Here, we present BioPlex 2.0 (<underline>B</underline>iophysical <underline>I</underline>nteractions of <underline>O</underline>RFEOME-derived com<underline>plex</underline>es), which employs robust affinity purification-mass spectrometry (AP-MS) methodology<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> to elucidate protein interaction networks and co-complexes nucleated by more than 25% of protein coding genes from the human genome, and constitutes the largest such network to date. With &gt;56,000 candidate interactions, BioPlex 2.0 contains &gt;29,000 previously unknown co-associations and provides functional insights into hundreds of poorly characterized proteins while enhancing network-based analyses of domain associations, subcellular localization, and co-complex formation. Unsupervised Markov clustering (MCL)<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> of interacting proteins identified more than 1300 protein communities representing diverse cellular activities. Genes essential for cell fitness<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> are enriched within 53 communities representing central cellular functions. Moreover, we identified 442 communities associated with more than 2000 disease annotations, placing numerous candidate disease genes into a cellular framework. BioPlex 2.0 exceeds previous experimentally derived interaction networks in depth and breadth, and will be a valuable resource for exploring the biology of incompletely characterized proteins and for elucidating larger-scale patterns of proteome organization.</p>

  <p id="P2">Understanding the cellular function and dysfunction of ~20,000 individual protein coding genes, alternatively spliced forms, and allelic variants<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> will require a comprehensive model of proteome architecture that reveals how individual proteins assemble into functional modules and networks dedicated to specific biological activities. A first step towards this goal is a reference interaction map that places individual proteins within molecular assemblies. Previous large-scale efforts towards this goal in metazoans have involved binary interaction mapping via the yeast two-hybrid system<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>, as well as mass spectrometry-based correlation profiling<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> and AP-MS<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>, yet interaction partners and co-complexes for only a fraction of the human proteome have been delineated.</p>
  <p id="P3">To address challenges of scale in high-throughput AP-MS, we have established a robust AP-MS pipeline capable of targeting up to 500 human open reading frames (ORF’s) per month<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>, leveraging the human ORFEOME (v. 8.1)<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> to create C-terminally HA-FLAG-tagged lentiviral constructs for stable expression and affinity purification in HEK293T cells. This platform includes <italic>CompPASS-Plus</italic>, a naïve Bayes classifier that identifies high-confidence candidate interacting proteins (HCIPs) using abundance, frequency, reproducibility of peptide spectral matches, and other features across thousands of parallel AP-MS experiments (see METHODS)<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>. <italic>CompPASS-Plus</italic> performance to exclude false positives is similar to or exceeds other HCIP detection methods when benchmarked against the CORUM database<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> of high-quality protein interactions<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>. The aggregate output of this pipeline, termed BioPlex 2.0, contains 3297 new AP-MS experiments together with 2594 reanalyzed AP-MS experiments in BioPlex 1.0<sup>4</sup>. BioPlex 2.0 is the largest collection of human co-complex data assembled from a single pipeline to date, containing 56,553 interactions from 10,961 proteins, (<xref rid="F11" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a–d</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). The number of proteins characterized is significantly larger than recent interaction studies using yeast-two-hybrid<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>, correlation profiling<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>, and affinity-purification mass spectrometry<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> (<xref rid="F11" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a,c,d</xref>), including landmark interaction studies in humans and other metazoans<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>. Notably, 87% of BioPlex interactions have not been reported previously through independent research efforts, as reported in several protein interaction databases (<xref rid="F11" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref>). Several protein families (e.g. kinases) are enriched more than by chance, suggesting that such proteins are highly interactive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Extended Data Fig. 1a</xref>). Thus, BioPlex 2.0 constitutes a powerful resource for biological inquiry.</p>
  <p id="P4">As AP-MS experiments have been added, increases in network scope and density have improved both quality and coverage of the protein interaction space. In its current form, 54% of proteins in BioPlex 2.0 have been targeted as baits and the mean number of interactions per protein has increased to 5.2, reflecting increased coverage and reciprocity within multi-subunit complexes. The range of bait expression levels as quantified by spectral counting has remained consistent with that seen in BioPlex 1.0<sup>4</sup>. Of 340 CORUM complexes represented in BioPlex 2.0 with two or more bait proteins, 50% displayed greater than 90% coverage of co-complex membership, and 45% displayed 100% coverage (<xref rid="F12" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>). By this measure, the performance of BioPlex 2.0 substantially surpasses that of BioPlex 1.0, which displayed &gt;90% coverage for only 33% of CORUM complexes (<xref rid="F12" ref-type="fig">Fig 2a</xref>)<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>. In cases such as the Arp2/3 complex for which two bait proteins captured all seven members in BioPlex 1.0, addition of 2 bait proteins revealed 3 additional edge interactions (<xref rid="F12" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>). By comparison, inclusion of ~2-fold additional subunits fthe TFIIH complex (10 members), the checkpoint Rad complex (8 members), and the NuA4/Tip60 complex (8 members), which were sparsely (40–75%) covered in BioPlex 1.0, greatly increased coverage, now identifying 100% of complex members (<xref rid="F12" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c–e</xref>). A series of validation experiments examining: 1) interactions of 12 poorly studied BioPlex 2.0 proteins in HCT116 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Extended Data Fig. 1b–m</xref>), 2) reciprocal interactions of 14-3-3 interacting proteins in HEK293T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Extended Data Fig. 2a–c</xref>), and 3) a PDLIM7-PTPN14 network in MCF10A cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Extended Data Fig. 2d–i</xref>) indicated that BioPlex 2.0 provides a robust platform for discovery of new interactions (see Extended Text in the METHODS section; see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplementary Table 2</xref>).</p>
  <p id="P5">Proteome architecture is driven in part through modular interaction domains that form interfaces in multi-subunit complexes<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> and through protein subcellular localization. Moreover, co-association can accelerate ontology-based annotation of poorly understood proteins<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>. Therefore, we mined BioPlex 2.0 for evidence of protein localization, domain co-association, or partitioning by biological function. We predicted the subcellular localization of largely uncharacterized proteins based on first- and second-degree interaction partners and their reported localizations in Uniprot<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>, resulting in localization predictions for hundreds of proteins, including 101 additional uncharacterized ORF (C_ORF) proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Extended Data Fig. 3a,b</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplementary Table 3</xref>). Of 65 uncharacterized C_ORF proteins examined using antibodies in the Human Protein Atlas<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>, 41 were compatible with our predictions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Extended Data Fig. 3b</xref>), including several proteins with recently validated localizations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Extended Data Fig. 3c,d,e,g,i</xref>) as well as proteins that remain largely unknown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Extended Data Fig. 3f,h,i</xref>). Using immunofluorescence of 44 lentivirally-expressed proteins with predicted primary localizations, we confirmed 80% either localizing exclusively to the predicted location or localizing in multiple compartments including the predicted compartment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Extended Data Fig. 4</xref>), further indicating that the predictions are of general utility.</p>
  <p id="P6">We next sought Protein Family (PFAM)<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> domain pairs that were unusually likely to associate, directly or indirectly, through pairs of interacting proteins. The enhanced statistical power afforded by the larger network identified 7000 pairwise domain associations (2.3-fold more than BioPlex 1.0) while increasing the statistical significance of each pair (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Extended Data Fig. 5a,b</xref>). While some of these additional associations are known (GDI/Ras and KBP_C/Kinesin; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Extended Data Figure 5e–f</xref>), many place domains of unknown function (DUFs) into candidate biological processes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Extended Data Fig. 5c–d, g</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Supplementary Table 4</xref>). The power of this approach to recognize functionally interactive pairs is highlighted by the cullin-RING E3 ubiquitin ligase system (CRL), which uses modular adaptor proteins to recruit substrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Fig. 6a</xref>). The cullin domain was paired <italic>de novo</italic> with 15 additional domains, many of which also co-associated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Figure 6b</xref>). Complementary protein-centric quantification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Figure 6c,d</xref>) revealed that every cullin domain association can be explained through direct or indirect interaction of cullins and their associated adaptors or regulatory proteins. Neighbors of proteins containing RBX1/2-binding cullin homology domains were enriched with BTB, BTB_2, SOCS and FBOX domains known to bind the cullin N-terminal domain (NTD) directly or indirectly through SKP1 or ELOC adaptors, as well as with substrate-binding WD40, FBA, ANK, SH2, and KELCH domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Fig. 6b–d</xref>). Similar conclusions were drawn for regulatory domains linked with cullins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Fig. 6a–d</xref>). In contrast, other cullin-domain-containing proteins (ANAPC2 and CUL9) were not enriched in these domains, consistent with their known biology. Notably, while Kelch 2, Kinetochor Ybp2, and MitMem Reg domain enrichment failed to reach statistical significance among neighbors of any individual cullin-containing protein, seeking domain-domain associations across the entire interaction network increased sensitivity and enabled detection of associations involving these uncommon domains found in CRL regulators.</p>
  <p id="P7">BioPlex 2.0 often suggests candidate functions for poorly characterized proteins (e.g. coiled-coil domain-containing, CCDC, and C_ORF) through guilt-by-association, as proteins neighboring most of these poorly characterized proteins are enriched for one or more gene ontology terms or known protein complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 7a</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Supplementary Table 5</xref>). These include, among others (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 7b–k</xref>), the RUBCN (RUBICON)<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>-related protein C13orf18 associated with the BECN1-PIK3R4-PIK3C3 complex, which was validated by reciprocal immunoprecipitation-western analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 7b, l–n</xref>), and CCDC65 (mutated in a cilia-associated disease<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>) associated with the centrosome-localized proteins PCM1 and HERC2-NEURL4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 7k</xref>). Further exploration of BioPlex 2.0 interactions involving poorly studied proteins, together with the domain-domain and localization enrichment parameters, will assist elucidation of functional modules and pathways for poorly studied components of the human proteome.</p>
  <p id="P8">Functionally-related proteins often segregate into tightly interconnected communities that correspond to multi-protein complexes or pathways important for cellular fitness or targeted in disease. To explore protein communities in BioPlex 2.0, we applied unsupervised Markov clustering (MCL)<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> for data-driven discovery of highly interconnected protein clusters, identifying 1320 communities of between 3 and 76 proteins with 286 topologies (<xref rid="F13" ref-type="fig">Figure 3a</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8">Supplementary Tables 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9">7</xref>). While each community within BioPlex 2.0 is by definition highly interconnected, most are more sparsely defined in BioPlex 1.0, as exemplified by a cluster centered on the ribosomal biogenesis protein RRS1 (<xref rid="F13" ref-type="fig">Figure 3e</xref>) and additional examples in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 8b–e</xref>. Through a binomial comparison of BioPlex 1.0 and 2.0 communities, we found that 45% of BioPlex 2.0 clusters showed no enrichment in BioPlex 1.0 above background interaction rates (p&lt;8.08×10<sup>−4</sup>) (<xref rid="F13" ref-type="fig">Figure 3b</xref>, see METHODS), underscoring the extent to which depth and coverage has increased in BioPlex 2.0.</p>
  <p id="P9">We next examined the community enrichment of proteins critical to cellular fitness<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>. Eighty-six percent of 2940 genes deemed important for cell fitness are detected in BioPlex 2.0, and 55% of these (1359 proteins) reside within one of 53 communities that are enriched with cellular fitness proteins (<xref rid="F13" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a–d</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Fig. 9a</xref>). An additional 350 clusters contained 2 or more fitness proteins without reaching statistically significant enrichment (<xref rid="F13" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c</xref>). Fitness genes within the BioPlex 2.0 network differed from the overall BioPlex 2.0 proteome with respect to several network properties (<xref rid="F13" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3d</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Fig. 9b–e</xref>, p&lt;10<sup>−200</sup>): 1) an increased number of average interacting proteins (10.3 versus 12.4), 2) increased eigenvector centrality indicative of an increased number and/or importance of neighbors, 3) elevated mean local clustering coefficient indicative of higher connectivity among neighbors, and 4) increased graph assortativity, which measures the extent to which fitness proteins and non-fitness proteins preferentially associate with their own kind. Communities enriched for fitness genes often involved core cellular functions, including transcription-splicing-translation [e.g. ribosome (39/45 subunits) and mediator (29/36 subunits)], electron transport chain function, protein degradation, and chromatin modification (<xref rid="F13" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3e,f</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Fig 9f</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD10">Supplementary Table 8</xref>). Even communities with multiple essential proteins that lacked statistical enrichment nevertheless displayed increased centrality, consistent with essential proteins tending to reside in highly interactive complexes (<xref rid="F13" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3d</xref>).</p>
  <p id="P10">Disease alleles are often found in groups of genes that function in a common biological process, yet information relating interactions of disease-linked proteins within pathways, and how mutations affect complex assembly, is limited in part due to incomplete underlying network structure<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>. We therefore mapped genes associated with 13,000 partially redundant disease annotations from DisGeNET<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> onto 1320 BioPlex 2.0 communities, identifying 4292 associations relating 442 communities to 2053 disease annotations (<xref rid="F14" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD10">Supplementary Table 8</xref>). Neoplasms are unusually centrally located within these disease networks, reflecting: <italic>i)</italic> diverse pathways contributing to dysregulated growth characteristic of neoplasia; and <italic>ii)</italic> a small number of common communities linked to many neoplastic disorders. These principles are evident among eleven communities containing 99 proteins, 65 of which are linked with colorectal cancer (<xref rid="F14" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4c</xref>). Hypertensive Disease, a centrally-located, non-neoplastic disease with systemic effects (<xref rid="F14" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4d</xref>), spans communities containing ion channels, transcription factors, and metabolic enzymes. In contrast, congenital and hereditary diseases are less centrally located, targeting individual complexes that are not necessarily associated with multiple disease states. Typical examples include Bardet-Biedl Syndrome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Extended Data Fig. 10a</xref>), a genetic disruption of cilia formation and function driven by defects in a cluster of interacting proteins called the BBSome; genetic Mitochondrial Complex I Deficiency involving components of the electron transport chain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Extended Data Fig. 10b</xref>); and Hereditary Spastic Paraplegia (HSP) involving components of the WASH complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Extended Data Fig. 10c</xref>). To demonstrate the utility of BioPlex 2.0 to identify complexes relevant to disease, we examined interactions of a poorly understood member of the WASH complex (KIAA0196, also called SPG8) in KIAA0196<sup>−/−</sup> 293T cells expressing flag-tagged wild-type and HSP patient mutant forms at near-endogenous levels with other WASH complex components using 10-plex tandem mass tagging as well as AP-Western (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Extended data Fig. 10e,f</xref>). KIAA0196<sup>N471D</sup>, and to a lesser extent L619F, displayed reduced association with all detectable WASH complex components except KIAA1033, consistent with loss of function, while the V626F mutant displayed interactions similar to wild-type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Extended Data Fig. 10d,g–i</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11">Supplementary Table 9</xref>).</p>
  <p id="P11">Although unparalleled in scope among experimentally-derived interaction networks, BioPlex 2.0 remains an incomplete model of the human interactome. This reflects the dynamic nature of the proteome, the potential for alternative interactions in distinct cell lineages, and the fact that certain classes of protein complexes (e.g. membrane proteins) are sensitive to detergents used for protein extraction<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup>. For example, previous studies using digitonin recovered both the NDUFAB1-LYRM5-ETFA/B complex and the 8-subunit CoQ complex<sup><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup>, while we only recovered the NDUFAB1 complex using NP40 as detergent. BioPlex 2.0 can also be used for hypothesis generation and discovery of functional interactions. Recent mining of this network led to the discovery that the unstudied protein GATSL3 (now called CASTOR1), a binding partner of the mTOR regulatory complex GATOR2<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>, functions as a cellular arginine sensor<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup>. Similarly, association of SNX2 with VAPB in BioPlex<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> led to the finding that SNX2 tethers the ER-localized VAPB protein to retromer binding sites on lysosomes<sup><xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup>.

Following sequence validation, clones were introduced into HEK293T, HCT116, or MCF10A cells (all from American Type Culture Collection) via lentiviral transfection. Cells were expanded under puromycin selection to obtain five 10-cm dishes per cell line prior to AP-MS. Bait proteins have been selected from the ORFeome for high-throughput AP-MS analysis in batches corresponding to individual 96-well plates. Plates have been selected for processing in random order. For AP-MS experiments in MCF10A cells, 1.15 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells per 15 cm<sup>2</sup> dish were harvested after 3 days (sub-confluent) or after 14 days in culture (contact inhibited) in order to allow for expulsion of YAP1 from the nucleus and Hippo pathway activation.

Briefly, cell pellets were lysed in the presence of 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 300 mM NaCl, 0.5% (v/v) NP40, followed by centrifugation and filtration to remove debris. Immunoprecipitation was achieved using immobilized and pre-washed mouse monoclonal α-HA agarose resin (Sigma-Aldrich, clone HA-7) that was incubated with clarified lysate for four hours at 4°C prior to removal of supernatant and four washes with lysis buffer followed by two washes with PBS (pH 7.2).

      <title>Identification of Interacting Proteins</title>
      <p id="P15">A brief synopsis of our methods for identifying peptides and proteins from LC-MS data and distinguishing <italic>bona fide</italic> interacting proteins from background is provided here. For full details, refer to Huttlin et al<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>. The BioPlex 2.0 network was generated by reanalyzing Sequest search results from the BioPlex 1.0 dataset, combined with additional new AP-MS datasets.</p>
      <p id="P16">Sequest<sup><xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> was used to match MS/MS spectra with peptide sequences from the Uniprot<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> human protein database supplemented with sequences of GFP (our negative control), our FLAG-HA affinity tag, and common contaminant proteins. This version of the Uniprot database includes both SwissProt and Trembl entries and was current in 2013, at the outset of this project when the first AP-MS data were collected and searched. All protein sequences were included in forward and reversed orientations. Only fully tryptic peptides with 2 or fewer missed cleavages were considered and precursor and product ion mass tolerances were set to 50 ppm and 0.05 Da, respectively. The sole variable modification considered was oxidation of methionine (+15.9949). Target-decoy filtering<sup><xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> was applied to control false discovery rates, employing a linear discriminant function for peptide filtering and probabilistic scoring at the protein level<sup><xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup>. Linear discriminant analysis considered Xcorr, D-Cn, peptide length, charge state, fractions of ions matched, and precursor mass error to distinguish correct from incorrect identifications. Peptide-spectral matches from each run were filtered to a 1% protein-level FDR with additional entropy-based filtering<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> to reduce the final dataset protein-level FDR to well under 1%. Protein identifications supported by only a single peptide were discarded as well. These additional post-search filters further reduced the dataset-level FDR by over 100-fold.</p>
      <p id="P17">Scoring to identify high confidence candidate interacting proteins (HCIPs) was performed in multiple stages after combining technical duplicate analyses of each AP-MS experiment and mapping all protein ID’s to Entrez Gene ID’s to minimize technical issues due to protein isoforms. Protein abundances in each IP were quantified using spectral counts averaged across technical replicates. The <italic>CompPASS</italic> algorithm<sup><xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup> compared abundances of the proteins detected in each IP with their average levels across all other IPs, returning a Z-score that quantifies the extent that a protein’s abundance exceeds its average levels across the dataset as well as the empirical NWD-score that accounts for a protein’s abundance, frequency of detection, and consistency across duplicate analyses. Subsequent filtering based on PSM counts, entropy scoring, and each protein’s frequency of detection within each batch of samples minimized false positives, LC-carry-over and technical artifacts. Putative bait-prey interactions were further filtered using <italic>CompPASS-Plus</italic><sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>, a Naïve Bayes classifier that learns to distinguish true interacting proteins from nonspecific background and false positive identifications based on <italic>CompPASS</italic> scores and several other metrics described previously. The algorithm modeled true interactions using examples from STRING<sup><xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup> and GeneMania<sup><xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup> databases. False positive protein identifications were modeled using decoy identifications that had survived previous filters. All remaining data were used to model background. Cross-validation was applied by batch, with each 96-well plate of IPs scored using a model trained on ~57 different plates. Bait-prey interactions were then assembled across IPs to produce a single network, combining scores of reciprocal interactions to increase their weight. BioPlex 2.0 was obtained by pruning this network to retain only those interactions that earned scores above 0.75, as described previously<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>.

      <title>Community Detection via MCL Clustering</title>
      <p id="P24">The Markov Clustering Algorithm (MCL)<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> was employed to partition the BioPlex 2.0 network into communities of tightly interconnected proteins, using an implementation provided by the algorithm’s creator, Stijn van Dongen, at micans.org/mcl/. The option –force-connected=y was used to ensure that final clusters correspond to connected components. The MCL algorithm requires specification of one parameter, the inflation parameter, which controls the granularity of the clusters that are produced. Clustering of BioPlex 2.0 was repeated for several values of the inflation parameter between 1.5 and 2.5. After comparing experimentally-derived clusters with known protein complexes, an inflation parameter of 2.0 was selected for final clustering. Clusters containing fewer than three proteins were discarded, producing a final list of 1320 protein communities. Each cluster and its members are summarized in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8">Supplementary Table 6</xref>; GO terms and PFAM domains enriched in each community are provided in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9">Supplementary Table 7</xref>.</p>
      <p id="P25">One important question has been the extent to which each of the clusters observed in BioPlex 2.0 is also visible in BioPlex 1.0. To address this question, we mapped each cluster detected in BioPlex 2.0 onto the BioPlex 1.0 network. If a given cluster is also reflected in the BioPlex 1.0, then we would expect to see an enrichment of interactions; conversely, if interactions are not enriched among the relevant set of proteins above background, then there is no evidence to support the indicated cluster. After mapping each cluster of tightly interconnected proteins from BioPlex 2.0 onto the BioPlex 1.0 network, we used a binomial test to evaluate the enrichment of BioPlex 1.0 interactions among matching proteins. The probability of interaction was estimated from the fraction of all possible interactions in the BioPlex 1.0 network that was actually detected (8.08×10<sup>−4</sup>); the number of trials was taken to be the maximum number of interactions possible among those proteins within the cluster that were part of the BioPlex 1.0 network; the number of interactions actually observed in this portion of BioPlex 1.0 was taken as the number of successes. A one-sided binomial test was performed and a correction for multiple testing was applied<sup><xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></sup>. Overall, 45% of complexes detected in BioPlex 2.0 did not show any enrichment for protein interactions in BioPlex 1.0, suggesting that these were macromolecular complexes not covered in the first interaction network. Moreover, although the remaining 55% of complexes were at least partially reflected in BioPlex 1.0, the density of their coverage consistently increased with incorporation of additional AP-MS data into the BioPlex 2.0 network.</p>
      <p id="P26">In addition to using MCL clustering to partition the BioPlex 2.0 network into individual clusters of tightly interconnected proteins, we also wanted to explore patterns of interconnection within the network that relate these clusters to each other. For this purpose, we searched for pairs of clusters that were connected to each other through interactions among their constituent proteins more often than would be expected. First, the full set of 56,553 interactions was trimmed to include only those interactions connecting one cluster with another and the set of all cluster pairs connected by one or more interactions was identified. For each of these pairs of clusters, the number of interactions connecting the pair was determined, as were the numbers of interactions involving each cluster individually. Fisher’s Exact Test was used to identify pairs of clusters that were enriched for interactions among them, followed by multiple testing correction<sup><xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></sup>.

      <title>Fitness Gene Network Analysis</title>
      <p id="P27">The first step toward examining network properties of fitness proteins was to combine lists of proteins associated with increased cellular fitness from Blomen et al. and Wang et al. into a single composite list<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>. For our purposes, we used the union of both lists to define the set of fitness proteins. Entrez gene IDs were associated with proteins on this list and mapped onto the BioPlex 2.0 network.</p>
      <p id="P28">To assess network properties of fitness proteins, the composite list of proteins associated with increased cellular fitness was superimposed onto the BioPlex network, effectively subdividing all proteins in the network into two groups corresponding to fitness and non-fitness proteins. Vertex degrees, local clustering coefficients, and eigenvector centralities were then computed and averaged across all fitness proteins. To evaluate whether these values differed for fitness proteins compared to randomly selected protein subsets of equivalent size, fitness and non-fitness labels were scrambled across the network and a new average was calculated for the randomized list of fitness proteins. This process was repeated 10,000 times to define null distributions for each statistic. Since these distributions were normally distributed, Gaussian distributions were fitted to each and used to assign z-scores and p-values for each statistic associated with the true set of fitness proteins. To evaluate graph assortativity, the BioPlex network was subdivided into fitness and non-fitness proteins and the assortativity of the partitioned graph was calculated. This process was repeated 10,000 times, randomizing fitness and non-fitness labels, and the resulting distribution was fitted to a Gaussian distribution and used to determine a z-score and p-value associated with the true assortativity.</p>
      <p id="P29">A second goal has been to identify clusters that are enriched with fitness proteins. For this purpose, a one-sided hypergeometric test was used to evaluate the enrichment of fitness proteins, taking into account the size of the cluster, the size of the BioPlex network, and the fraction of network proteins that were associated with increased cellular fitness. Only clusters containing two or more fitness proteins were considered for this analysis. Once a multiple testing correction<sup><xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></sup> was applied, 53 communities were found to be enriched with fitness proteins at a 1% FDR. These clusters are summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Figure 9</xref>. Levels of enrichment are summarized for those communities containing two or more cellular fitness proteins in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD10">Supplementary Table 8</xref>.</p>
      <p id="P30">To assess the tendency for clusters containing fitness proteins or enriched for fitness proteins to be centrally located within the cluster-cluster association network (<xref rid="F13" ref-type="fig">Figure 3a</xref>), all clusters were sorted according to their eigenvector centralities. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was used to compare distributions of clusters enriched and not enriched with fitness proteins within the ranked list of all clusters. This process was repeated to compare distributions of clusters containing multiple fitness proteins with clusters containing 0 or 1 fitness proteins, as shown in <xref rid="F13" ref-type="fig">Figure 3d</xref>.</p>

      <title>Associating Protein Complexes and Disease Processes</title>
      <p id="P31">The basis for our study of protein complexes and disease was the DisGeNET database of disease-gene associations<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>. For our analysis we employed the full database that relates over 16,000 genes with 13,000 partially redundant disease classifications. Each disease state and its associated proteins were then mapped onto each BioPlex 2.0 complex and evaluated for enrichment using a hypergeometric test, taking into account the size of the complex, the number of disease proteins in the complex, the number of disease proteins within the network, and the total network size. This process was repeated for each community and for each disease state. Following multiple testing correction<sup><xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></sup>, those complexes enriched with proteins involved with each disease at a 1% FDR were deemed associated. The resulting disease-complex associations were assembled into a network in which clusters and disease states are both represented as nodes, with edges connecting clusters with significantly-associated disease states, depicted in full in <xref rid="F14" ref-type="fig">Figure 4a</xref>. All significant disease-cluster associations are provided in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD10">Supplementary Table 8</xref>.</p>
      <p id="P32">The eigenvector centralities assigned to disease states within the composite disease-community network were used to compare across a range of disease states. Disease classifications were taken from the DisGeNET database as reported in their SQLite download. All disease states in the network were ranked according to increasing eigenvector centrality. For each disease classification (e.g. “Neoplasms”), the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was used to compare the distributions of matching and non-matching disease states within the entire ranked list. After multiple testing correction, disease states that appeared differentially distributed with respect to eigenvector centrality at a 1% FDR were identified and highlighted in <xref rid="F14" ref-type="fig">Figure 4b</xref>.</p>

      <title>Validation of interactions by IP-Western in 293T cells and AP-MS in MCF10A cells</title>
      <p id="P34">HEK293T cells were transfected with FLAG-HA-GFP control plasmid, C13orf18-GFP, GFP-BECN1, or RUFY1-FLAG-HA plasmids, and after 48h, cells were harvested in lysis buffer (50mM Tris pH 7.5, 150mM NaCl, 1% NP-40), with protease and phosphatase inhibitors (Roche) on ice. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation, and subjected to affinity purification using α-GFP antibodies (Chromotek, GFP-Trap, GTMA-20) or α-FLAG magnetic beads (Sigma, A2220)) for 2 hours at 4°C. Beads were washed 4× with lysis buffer, and subsequently subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with the following antibodies: BECN1 (Cell Signaling, clone D40C5), GFP (Roche, mouse IgG clones 7.1 and 13.1), C13orf18 (Proteintech, 21183-1-AP), and HA (Biolegend, clone HA.11).</p>

Affinity purification was performed essentially as described previously<sup><xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup>, but eluted α-HA immune complexes (Sigma-Aldrich, clone HA-7) were analyzed in two ways.

After identification of HCIPs for proteins in HCT116 cells, we determined the interactions in common with HEK293T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Extended data Fig. 1b–m</xref>). Over the 12 bait proteins identified, we observed 30–100% validation of interactions seen for individual baits in HEK293T cells. Cumulatively, this reflected an overall 60% validation (92 of 147 interactions seen in HEC293T cells were seen in HCT116). This rate of validation is comparable to that seen in focused studies examining F-box protein interactors in these two cell lines (51%)<sup><xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref></sup>.

        <title>Analysis of proteins interacting with 14-3-3 proteins</title>
        <p id="P40">14-3-3 proteins represent a well-studied group of 7 proteins (YWHAB, YWHAE, YWHAZ, YWHAH, YWHAQ, YWHAG, and SFN) that typically associate with phosphorylated proteins. Thirty-nine baits in BioPlex 2.0 were found to interact with one or more of these 14-3-3 proteins, with YWHAZ being detected most frequently (35 baits) and SFN being detected the least frequently (4 baits) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Extended Data Fig. 2</xref>). Seventeen of these proteins are not known to interact with 14-3-3 proteins based on BioGrid. Because only the atypical 14-3-3 protein SFN had been targeted as a bait in BioPlex 2.0, the remaining six 14-3-3 proteins were submitted to our standard AP-MS pipeline using ORFEOME 8.1 clones; while the clone for YWHAE failed at the sequence validation stage, the remaining five 14-3-3 proteins were processed successfully, identifying 130–360 HCIP’s (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). While eight of 39 BioPlex 2.0 baits that had been observed to interact with one or more 14-3-3 proteins were not detected in 293T cells and thus may be impossible to detect in reciprocal IP’s, 63% of interactions eligible for reciprocal detection were confirmed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Extended Data Fig. 2a–c</xref>).

      <title>BioPlex Communities Subdivide the Interaction Network according to Functional Properties and Fitness Effects</title>
      <p><bold>a</bold>, network of communities revealed through MCL clustering of the BioPlex 2.0 network. Nodes represent distinct communities and are scaled to reflect the numbers of proteins in each (3–76 proteins). Nodes are connected by edges when proteins within the respective communities interact with unusually high frequency (see <bold>Online Methods</bold>). Filled nodes depict communities that were also found to be interconnected by unusual numbers of interactions in BioPlex 1.0; open circles represent communities of proteins that exhibited only background numbers of interactions in BioPlex 1.0. Communities containing 2 or more proteins associated with increased cellular fitness are highlighted in light green; communities that are enriched with cellular fitness proteins (1% FDR) are highlighted in dark green. <bold>b</bold>, Mapping BioPlex 2.0 communities onto BioPlex 1.0 reveals lower connectivity, with 45% of complexes showing no significant enrichment of interactions above background levels (binomial test; Benjamini-Hochberg-adjusted p-values &lt; 0.05). <bold>c</bold>, Relative fractions of 1320 communities that contain specified numbers of fitness proteins. <bold>d</bold>, When BioPlex 2.0 clusters are ranked according to their eigenvector centrality within the BioPlex 2.0 community network (panel a), clusters that contain multiple fitness proteins (light green) or are enriched for fitness proteins (dark green) tend to have higher centralities (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test). <bold>e–f</bold>, selected BioPlex 2.0 communities highlighting proteins associated with cellular fitness (green). Inset maps depict the same communities as observed in BioPlex 1.0. Filled nodes indicate proteins that were in BioPlex 1.0, while black edges indicate interactions that were visible. In contrast, open circles indicate proteins that were not found in BioPlex 1.0.</p>
