    <abstract>
      <p>Phylogenomic analyses of hundreds of protein-coding genes aimed at resolving phylogenetic relationships is now a common practice. However, no software currently exists that includes tools for dataset construction and subsequent analysis with diverse validation strategies to assess robustness. Furthermore, there are no publicly available high-quality curated databases designed to assess deep (&gt;100 million years) relationships in the tree of eukaryotes. To address these issues, we developed an easy-to-use software package, PhyloFisher (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://github.com/TheBrownLab/PhyloFisher" ext-link-type="uri">https://github.com/TheBrownLab/PhyloFisher</ext-link>), written in Python 3. PhyloFisher includes a manually curated database of 240 protein-coding genes from 304 eukaryotic taxa covering known eukaryotic diversity, a novel tool for ortholog selection, and utilities that will perform diverse analyses required by state-of-the-art phylogenomic investigations. Through phylogenetic reconstructions of the tree of eukaryotes and of the Saccharomycetaceae clade of budding yeasts, we demonstrate the utility of the PhyloFisher workflow and the provided starting database to address phylogenetic questions across a large range of evolutionary time points for diverse groups of organisms. We also demonstrate that undetected paralogy can remain in phylogenomic “single-copy orthogroup” datasets constructed using widely accepted methods such as all vs. all BLAST searches followed by Markov Cluster Algorithm (MCL) clustering and application of automated tree pruning algorithms. Finally, we show how the PhyloFisher workflow helps detect inadvertent paralog inclusions, allowing the user to make more informed decisions regarding orthology assignments, leading to a more accurate final dataset.</p>

    <title>Introduction</title>
    <p>Molecular phylogenetic analyses have transformed our understanding of evolutionary relationships among eukaryotes. While the use of single to a few genes provided a wealth of information when the practice was in its infancy, these small datasets lacked sufficient phylogenetic signal to resolve the deepest nodes in the eukaryotic tree of life [<xref rid="pbio.3001365.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.3001365.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. In order to clarify these ancient relationships, molecular phylogenetic datasets have grown in size from single genes to hundreds of genes (i.e., tens of thousands of homologous sites) [<xref rid="pbio.3001365.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>–<xref rid="pbio.3001365.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p>
    <p>There are existing tools that reduce the intense labor and time needed by automating some or all parts of phylogenomic dataset construction (see, for example, [<xref rid="pbio.3001365.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.3001365.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]). However, as phylogenomic analyses rely on combining evolutionary signal from multiple genes into one phylogeny, it is essential to ensure that included sequences share an evolutionary history comprised only of speciation events (orthologs) rather than gene duplications (paralogs) or lateral/horizontal gene transfers (xenologs). Therefore, manual curation of orthologs is highly recommended to ensure that the dataset is free of paralogs, xenologs, or contaminants with conflicting signals that would otherwise confound phylogenetic estimation. In addition to using a high-quality set of curated orthologs, it is important that, as part of phylogenomic analyses, homogeneity of signal and potential artifacts affecting estimation is identified by exploring perturbations of the original dataset in terms of genes, sites, or taxa sampled. Despite a dramatic rise in the number of publications that include phylogenomic analyses, there is no widely accepted standard protocol for assembly of such datasets. Similarly, there are no publicly available, manually curated, starting phylogenomic databases designed for addressing deep relationships (&gt;100 million years) in the tree of eukaryotes.</p>
    <p>To address these problems, we have designed a protocol for phylogenomic dataset construction and data exploration and incorporated it into a software package, PhyloFisher. This publicly available software package (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://github.com/TheBrownLab/PhyloFisher" ext-link-type="uri">https://github.com/TheBrownLab/PhyloFisher</ext-link>) aids in the construction, maintenance, and curation of protein sequence–based phylogenomic datasets from a user-defined set of starting protein sequences. It provides tools to conduct post-dataset construction phylogenetic analyses and aids in the visualization of results. PhyloFisher also includes a manually curated starting database of 240 proteins from 304 eukaryotic taxa, representing the full breadth of known diversity in the eukaryotic tree of life (<xref rid="pbio.3001365.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>, Table A and Fig A in <xref rid="pbio.3001365.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Text</xref>). Importantly, this database also includes identified paralogs of each of the 240 proteins from all investigated taxa, which is crucial for the identification of probable orthologs in newly added taxa. Although PhyloFisher includes this pan-eukaryotic dataset, the tool is flexible and can work with any predefined dataset consisting of protein sequences derived from eukaryotes.</p>

        <p>The PhyloFisher package consists of a manually curated starting database of 240 protein-coding genes and their paralogs from 304 eukaryotic taxa; a series of tools to perform the essential steps of phylogenomic dataset construction (homolog collection, single-protein tree construction, removal of paralogs and contaminants, and matrix concatenation); and many pre- and post-construction analyses necessary for a publication-quality phylogenomic study.</p>

    <p>To demonstrate the utility of PhyloFisher and its companion starting database to address phylogenomic questions at different depths of the eukaryotic tree of life, we performed phylogenomic reconstructions of ancient relationships in the tree of eukaryotes as a whole, as well as phylogenomic analyses of the much more recently diversified Saccharomycetaceae clade of budding yeasts using 3 different gene sets. Additionally, we show the increased accuracy of the PhyloFisher workflow over widely used methods of ortholog collection and phylogenomic dataset construction.</p>

      <title>The PhyloFisher protocol</title>
      <p>The standard PhyloFisher workflow begins with the user-provided set of predicted proteins from the organism(s) they wish to add to an existing database. Alternatively, the user can create a new phylogenomic database from a set of orthologs, with or without corresponding paralogs, collected in advance prior to addition of new organisms. Users can choose between 2 fundamental protocols, one where candidate sequence selection will proceed in a novel “phylogenetically informed” way or a more traditional default manner where profile hidden Markov models (HMMs) generated from the set of orthologs in the starting database are used to collect candidate sequences from an input proteome (<xref rid="pbio.3001365.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>; Materials and methods). Our unique “phylogenetically informed” method prioritizes putative orthologs if they branch with known orthologs of closely related taxa that already exist in the database (detailed in the Materials and methods section). For each protein alignment in the starting database, a user-defined number of candidate sequences from the target taxon’s proteome that pass selection criteria (<xref rid="pbio.3001365.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>; Materials and methods) is appended to the corresponding alignment of homologs, through a ranking system. The sequence receiving the highest priority by the algorithm is demarcated as the probable ortholog, and any other surviving sequences are denoted as probable paralogs. This is followed by removal of nonhomologous sites, alignment, trimming, sequence length filtering, and phylogenetic tree reconstruction of homolog datasets. The PhyloFisher workflow forces manual inspection of all single-protein trees after the addition of candidate homologs from new data to prevent the inadvertent inclusion of paralogs and sequences derived from contaminating organisms in the final phylogenomic datasets. PhyloFisher includes a graphical user interface tool (ParaSorter) designed to ease the arduous task of manual ortholog selection in large numbers of genes. ParaSorter color-codes taxon names based on their taxonomic affiliations, highlights clades or sequences suspected to be paralogs, and appends specific sequence information to each taxon name in the phylogenetic tree. Users manually inspecting the tree can change the original designation of each sequence to either an ortholog, paralog, or “to delete” (a setting reserved for permanent removal of known contaminations) by simply clicking the corresponding box next to the sequence header (<xref rid="pbio.3001365.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>). After the removal of “to delete” sequences, final single ortholog alignments are then generated from ortholog- or paralog-curated datasets.</p>

          <p>Briefly, each predicted proteome of a new taxon to be added is processed through either a default route or a phylogenetically aware route that utilizes the manually curated orthologs from closely related taxa chosen by the user (and present in the starting database) as search queries against the proteome of the new taxon. Up to a user-defined number of collected sequences are reprioritized or eliminated based on a set of criteria designed to maximize correct demarcation of the desired ortholog and related paralogs while avoiding contaminating sequences. See <xref rid="sec018" ref-type="sec">Supporting information</xref> Materials and methods for a detailed description of the logic, third-party software, and associated parameters utilized.</p>

      </fig>
      <p>Phylogenomic studies are often accompanied by additional analyses in which users manipulate or examine their dataset in various ways to reveal potentially artifactual signals. PhyloFisher is equipped with a unique set of utilities to conduct these exploratory analyses (see <xref rid="pbio.3001365.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> for more details). These include the prediction of alternative genetic codes, removal of genes and/or taxa based on occupancy/completeness of the dataset, testing for amino acid compositional heterogeneity among sequences, removal of heterotachious and/or fast evolving sites, removal of fast evolving taxa, and supermatrix creation from randomly resampled proteins from the starting dataset. Furthermore, PhyloFisher can consolidate multiple proteomes from the same operational taxonomic unit to produce a single “most complete” final proteome. This is useful for single-cell data or to generate a single, better-sampled “hybrid taxon” representing several closely related taxa. Many of these provided utility scripts have been designed to act as “stand-alone” programs and can be used on datasets generated outside of the main PhyloFisher workflow as was done in [<xref rid="pbio.3001365.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p>

      <title>Reconstruction of the eukaryotic tree of life with PhyloFisher</title>
      <p>To demonstrate the power of PhyloFisher and its accompanying database, we performed a full phylogenomic analysis of the tree of eukaryotes in IQ-TREE [<xref rid="pbio.3001365.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] (<xref rid="pbio.3001365.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>, Figs A, I, and O–Q in <xref rid="pbio.3001365.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Text</xref>). We use only tools available in PhyloFisher (including the third-party software listed in <xref rid="pbio.3001365.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Text</xref>) and datasets composed of the orthologs in the provided starting database (see <xref rid="sec007" ref-type="sec">Materials and methods</xref> for details regarding database construction). While much of the tree of eukaryotes has been resolved over the last decade (see [<xref rid="pbio.3001365.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]), several key relationships remain undetermined, and some groups, often referred to as “orphan taxa,” remain difficult to place on the tree. Using the PhyloFisher workflow along with our post-dataset construction analyses, we have recovered deep relationships within the eukaryote tree, which are generally consistent with results of previous phylogenomic analyses. For example, our analyses recover relationships such as Obazoa + Amoebozoa + CRuMs, Metamonada + Discoba, Haptophyta + Centroheliozoa, and Ancyromonada + Malawimonada [<xref rid="pbio.3001365.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. We recover a monophyletic Archaeplasatida (traditionally Glaucophyta + Chlorophyta + Rhodophyta) that includes Rhodelphidia and Picozoa and is sister to the Cryptista, although this potential relationship lacks strong statistical support (80% IQ-TREE maximum likelihood bootstrap support [MLBS]). The inclusion of Rhodelphidia and Picozoa in Archaeplastida and the group’s potential sister relationship to the Cryptista has been shown recently in separate studies that used independent datasets for the phylogenomic analyses performed within [<xref rid="pbio.3001365.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>–<xref rid="pbio.3001365.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p>

      <p>Interestingly, our analyses also recover some novel potential relationships that deserve further investigation. For example, a clade made up of the enigmatic “orphan taxa” Telonemia and Hemimastigophora (<italic toggle="yes">Hemimastix</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">Spironema</italic>) is recovered. These 2 groups were included in phylogenomic analyses only recently, and our tree is the first to have all available data from them together in the same analysis. When the fastest evolving sites within the supermatrix are removed from the dataset using our accompanying tool <italic toggle="yes">fast_site_remover</italic>.<italic toggle="yes">py</italic>, this clade branches as sister to Stramenopiles + Alveolata + Rhizaria (SAR) with 95% MLBS, potentially comprising a monophyletic megagroup.

      <title>Reconstruction of the tree of Saccharomycetaceae budding yeasts and addition of <italic toggle="yes">Torulaspora globosa</italic> with PhyloFisher</title>
      <p>To demonstrate the utility of the PhyloFisher workflow to address questions surrounding more recent divergences in the tree of eukaryotes, we reconstructed the tree of the Saccharomycetaceae clade of budding yeasts using concatenation and coalescence-based methods. For reference, members of the Saccharomycetaceae are hypothesized to have been diverging from one another for 102 to 126 million years and exhibit a level of genetic diversity similar to that seen in flowering plants [<xref rid="pbio.3001365.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Homologs were collected from 86 budding yeast genomes, the genome of the Saccharomycetaceae <italic toggle="yes">T</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">globosa</italic>, and 12 other fungal taxa provided with PhyloFisher, generating a phylogenomic dataset derived from 208 of the 240 orthologs (pruned due to gene sampling in the Saccharomycetaceae representative, <italic toggle="yes">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>) found within PhyloFisher’s provided starting database. We also created a custom starting database constructed of a more computationally feasible subset of 128 genes from the 1292BUSCO dataset of [<xref rid="pbio.3001365.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] using tools provided in PhyloFisher. These 128 genes were selected by employing the <italic toggle="yes">rtc_binner</italic>.<italic toggle="yes">py</italic> tool from PhyloFisher to collect the top approximately 10% RTC scoring trees of the 1292BUSCO dataset of [<xref rid="pbio.3001365.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], also taking into account the taxonomic coverage within the 1292BUSCO dataset (&gt;70%), resulting in 128 genes (128BUSCO). Using the PhyloFisher workflow, we then recollected homologs of these 128 genes from the same 86 budding yeast genomes as above. We also included an additional Saccharomycetaceae taxon, <italic toggle="yes">T</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">globosa</italic>, to illustrate PhyloFisher’s ability to add new taxa to this database. During our reanalysis of the 128 genes in the 128BUSCO dataset, we discovered the inadvertent inclusion of paralogs in 6 genes (total 63 sequences) in the data analyzed in the original study of [<xref rid="pbio.3001365.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] (Figs S–X in <xref rid="pbio.3001365.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Text</xref>). Additionally, during reanalysis, we were able to increase gene sampling in the original dataset for several taxa using the PhyloFisher approach (for example, see the Saccharomycodaceae clade in Fig U in <xref rid="pbio.3001365.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Text</xref>). To explore how these inaccuracies and missing data affect the structure of the tree of Saccharomycetaceae, we created a third dataset with our new decisions regarding ortholog selection and increased data sampling. Full details describing the construction of all 3 datasets can be found in the Materials and methods section.</p>
      <p>The tree topologies for both our concatenation and coalescence analyses of the 208 ortholog subset of PhyloFisher’s provided starting database are congruent with the topologies of the original 1292BUSCO dataset of [<xref rid="pbio.3001365.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], although MLBS support for the topology is higher (100%) using the PhyloFisher 208 ortholog dataset in our concatenated analysis than the results using the 1292BUSCO dataset (53%). However, the local posterior probability (LPP) value using gene tree coalescence is lower at this node when using the 208 ortholog dataset (<xref rid="pbio.3001365.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4</xref>). Interestingly, the concatenation-based ML trees using both of the 128 ortholog datasets show an alternative topology to that of [<xref rid="pbio.3001365.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] (labeled as Shen et al. 2018—BUSCO 1292 orthologs), while the coalescence-based trees are congruent with the topology of [<xref rid="pbio.3001365.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], although again the LPP values are lower than those in the original study.</p>

    <title>Discussion</title>
    <p>To improve and ease the accurate collection of orthologs and subsequent phylogenomic dataset construction from eukaryotic proteomes, we designed PhyloFisher as a novel workflow for these purposes and provide it to the phylogenomic community in the form of the freely available open-source software package. Included is a manually curated starting set of 240 orthologs and their related paralogs from 304 eukaryotic taxa that cover known eukaryotic diversity. However, to broaden the use of the software, we provide tools to construct starting databases from alternative sets of orthologs and paralogs that can then be harvested from new taxa and processed via the remainder of the PhyloFisher workflow. To show the potential of our newly designed software package, we reconstructed the tree of eukaryotes using our provided starting database and the tree of the Saccharomycetaceae using both our starting database and a custom database created using tools provided in PhyloFisher from a 128 gene subset of 1292BUSCO dataset used in the phylogenomic analyses of [<xref rid="pbio.3001365.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p>
    <p>The phylogenomic tree reconstructed from the eukaryotic-wide dataset represents the most taxonomically comprehensive deep phylogeny of eukaryotes to date. Our results recover many previously known relationships as well as some potential groupings that are novel (<xref rid="pbio.3001365.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>, Fig A in <xref rid="pbio.3001365.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Text</xref>). Although the overall branching patterns were consistently recovered in most analyses we have conducted, many of the groups are sparsely sampled, and low bootstrap support values for deepest nodes remain. For example, because the Telonemia, Hemimastigophora, and <italic toggle="yes">Ancoracysta</italic> all represent sparsely sampled lineages on these trees that can be notoriously unstable and form artefactual groups. Thus, the foregoing relationships should be treated with caution. Notably, the exact relationships between the fully supported groups Chloroplastida + Glaucophyta, Rhodophyta + Rhodelphidia + Picozoa, and Cryptista remains unclear. Notably, the results of a recent independent study using a larger dataset [<xref rid="pbio.3001365.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] and another that includes novel data from diverse picozoans [<xref rid="pbio.3001365.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] are both congruent with our results regarding these potential relationships, although with similar or higher statistical support, respectively. Whereas the recently discovered Rhodelphidia contain a non-photosynthetic plastid and can thus fit naturally into the Archaeplastida [<xref rid="pbio.3001365.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], Picozoa seem to be devoid of a plastid [<xref rid="pbio.3001365.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.3001365.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], suggesting its secondary loss or the need to reconsider the concept of the Archaeplastida [<xref rid="pbio.3001365.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. These hypothetical relationships can be tested in the PhyloFisher framework once novel species that break these branches are eventually sampled.</p>
    <p>Our resulting yeast phylogenies using datasets derived from PhyloFisher’s provided set of genes and using a custom subset of genes derived from the 1292BUSCO dataset of [<xref rid="pbio.3001365.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] demonstrate the potential of the PhyloFisher dataset and the workflow applied to custom datasets as tools for resolving phylogenetic questions involving a particular group of eukaryotes. During our reanalysis of the custom gene dataset used in the yeast analyses, we discovered the accidental inclusion of paralogs in the original dataset. The inclusion of paralogs in the original dataset may have led to artifactual branching patterns or low resolution at internodes in the resulting phylogeny as has been shown to be the result of paralog inclusion [<xref rid="pbio.3001365.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.3001365.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. This dataset, as well as other datasets used in the original study, was constructed via well accepted and widely used methods of all versus all BLAST searches followed by MCL clustering and subsampling of the resultant orthogroups into individual sets of orthologs via an automated tree pruning strategy. Our discovery of paralog inclusions suggests that implementation of current standard workflows can lead to the inclusion of the paralogs we discovered in our small sample (approximately 10%) of the data from the 1292BUSCO dataset of [<xref rid="pbio.3001365.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Many variables exist in this standard workflow, and subsequent studies should focus on elucidating the exact causes of ortholog misidentification during these widely used strategies for phylogenomic dataset construction. We initially considered these accidental paralog inclusions to be the likely explanation for the alternative topology with regard to the internal branching order inside the Saccharomycetaceae clade that was produced by this dataset (<xref rid="pbio.3001365.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4</xref>). However, correcting these misassignments of paralogy only strengthened the support for the alternative topology (<xref rid="pbio.3001365.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4</xref>), suggesting that other factors could be driving the topology produced by the 2 datasets. Further analyses of the entire original datasets used in [<xref rid="pbio.3001365.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] will likely be needed to resolve this contentious node in the tree of the Saccharomycetaceae.</p>
    <p>We encourage others to explore these data, and, most importantly, add novel and unrepresented/under-sampled lineages to these datasets. A key feature of the PhyloFisher package is that even though the ortholog selection steps are manual, the software retains information from all previous curation steps. Thus, the orthologs versus paralog decisions are not permanent, rather, they are changeable for future researchers to explore and add new data. As phylogenomics is an ever-evolving science, PhyloFisher provides users the means to scrutinize these and add any new data generated. In time, we expect that by using our tool, a clearer picture of the deep relationships among eukaryotes will emerge.</p>
    <p>We would also like to encourage educators teaching a phylogenomics course to consider PhyloFisher as their training software of choice. It is thoroughly documented and with a single installation command is “ready out of the box” for trainees to perform all standard steps in a phylogenomic study (homolog collection, data quality control, homolog tree construction, removal of paralogs and contaminants, different data sub-setting strategies, and matrix concatenation) as well as post-dataset construction analyses to test for robustness of the initial results. These attributes make PhyloFisher an ideal training tool for introducing phylogenomic analyses and concepts even if all the exact methodologies used within it are not universally agreed upon by the phylogenomics community.</p>
    <p>In conclusion, phylogenomic analyses were historically performed by a few experts in phylogenetics and bioinformatics. More recently, phylogenomics has become a much more widely used tool in diverse biological fields as demonstrated by the rapid increase in the number of original papers that include phylogenomic trees. PhyloFisher is an easy-to-use software package, providing all the tools necessary to construct, perform quality control, and analyze large phylogenomic datasets consisting of many proteins. We show that the package and included database have the potential to help resolve deep (&gt;100 million year) divergences in the tree of eukaryotes. PhyloFisher will also permit less bioinformatically proficient scientists to perform publication-quality phylogenomic analyses of eukaryotic lineages in a few simple steps. For more advanced users, PhyloFisher provides the flexibility to use a custom starting database, alter premade decisions in the provided database regarding ortholog selection, use alternative software other than what is provided, and change graphical aesthetics to fit their preferences. Moreover, by design, PhyloFisher encourages sharing of the resulting complete datasets with the community. We hope that this tool will facilitate the widespread use of “best practices” in phylogenomic analysis and provide long-term updating/maintenance of phylogenomic datasets.</p>

      <p>Ortholog selection and paralog demarcation are performed using the Python script <italic toggle="yes">fisher</italic>.<italic toggle="yes">py</italic> that requires 2 inputs: predicted proteome(s) to be added to the starting database and an input metadata file containing key information about them (see <xref rid="pbio.3001365.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Text</xref> and the PhyloFisher manual on the GitHub repository). To remove redundancy in the input proteome (typical when proteomes are predicted in silico from transcriptomic data), <italic toggle="yes">fisher</italic>.<italic toggle="yes">py</italic> invokes CD-HIT v.4.8.1 [<xref rid="pbio.3001365.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] with the option “-c 0.98,” which clusters sequences globally at a similarity threshold of 98%. Next, hmmsearch from the software package HMMER v. 3.2.1 [<xref rid="pbio.3001365.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] is run on the input proteome using precomputed profile HMMs of each protein alignment in the starting database. Up to a user-defined number of sequences are collected (default = 5) that meet the significance threshold e-value &lt; 1e -10. If no sequence meets the significance threshold, the script moves on to the next protein. If sequences are found (up to the user-defined number), they are prioritized based on the level of significance (i.e., the sequence with the most significant hit is preliminarily denoted as the most likely putative ortholog with other included sequences preliminarily denoted as putative paralogs). From here, the algorithm proceeds in either of 2 directions, depending on information given in the input metadata file. In the 2 routes outlined below, sequences can be added to or removed from the initial sequences collected by hmmsearch, as they meet or fail to meet the outlined criteria. The prioritization of a sequence can also change within the list based on the criteria outlined below. At the end of either route, if only 1 sequence remains, it is considered the putative ortholog for the input taxon. If more than 1 remains, the sequence with the highest priority in the list is considered the putative ortholog, and the rest are considered putative paralogs. All surviving sequences are added to the corresponding single-protein alignment.</p>

      <title>Default route</title>
      <p>If no related species present in the starting database is/are listed in the “Blast Seed” column of the input metadata file to use as specific queries, each sequence collected from the hmmsearch run is used as the query in a search using DIAMOND v. 09.24 [<xref rid="pbio.3001365.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] against OrthoMCL v 5.0 [<xref rid="pbio.3001365.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] with the options “blastp -e 1e-10 --more-sensitive”. Any sequence that has a significant hit (e-value &lt; 1e -10) to a bacterial orthogroup in OrthoMCL is discarded along with any sequence that does not have a significant hit to the OrthoMCL orthogroup corresponding to the respective profile HMM used to retrieve the sequence. Retained sequences are again used as queries in a DIAMOND search using the parameters given above against the starting database. Query sequences whose best hit represents the conserved gene corresponding to the initial profile HMM that retrieved the query sequence is retained and added to the alignment. The remaining sequence that has the highest priority based on the initial hmmsearch is considered to be the putative ortholog, and any other surviving sequences are labeled putative paralogs.</p>

      <title>Phylogenetically informed route</title>
      <p>The input metadata file gives users the option to specify taxa from the starting database whose sequences will be used as queries for blast searches against the new organism’s proteome; typically, these should be closely related to the newly added taxon. Any number of species already present in the database may be chosen to serve as specific queries, but the algorithm will use them in the order provided, and, in cases outlined below, may not proceed to subsequent organisms. If organisms to be used as specific queries are listed in the input metadata file, <italic toggle="yes">fisher</italic>.<italic toggle="yes">py</italic> will initially pick the sequence representing a particular orthologous gene group (“ortholog” for simplicity) from the first organism listed, if present. If absent in the starting database, <italic toggle="yes">fisher</italic>.<italic toggle="yes">py</italic> will sequentially check for an ortholog from the remaining taxa listed. If the orthologs from 1 or more of the subsequent taxa are found, the algorithm proceeds as outlined below. If no ortholog from all listed organisms can be found, <italic toggle="yes">fisher</italic>.<italic toggle="yes">py</italic> will proceed to the default route for this particular protein. If an ortholog is present in at least 1 of the listed species, then its sequence is used as the query in a BLAST [<xref rid="pbio.3001365.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] search against the input organism’s predicted proteome. If no significant hit (e-value &lt; 1e -10) is found, <italic toggle="yes">fisher</italic>.<italic toggle="yes">py</italic> will use the ortholog of the next listed species, if one is provided. If no other species is listed or if the orthologs of all listed species do not return a significant BLAST hit, the protein is skipped for the input taxon. If significant BLAST hits are found, up to a user-defined number of those (default = 5) are collected and examined further. The sequences from the original hmmsearch are reprioritized based on the level of significance of the BLAST hit. The sequence with the most significant hit becomes the priority sequence, unless it was not also collected by the initial hmmsearch: Any sequence that produces a significant BLAST hit but was not collected in the initial hmmsearch is discarded. The retained sequences are then used as queries against OrthoMCL [<xref rid="pbio.3001365.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Any sequence that has a significant hit (e-value &lt; 1e -10) to a bacterial orthogroup in OrthoMCL is discarded along with any sequence that does not have a significant hit to the OrthoMCL orthogroup corresponding to the respective profile HMM used to retrieve the sequence. Next, all the sequences that have passed the filtering in the previous step are compared with blast against the starting database of conserved marker proteins. If the query sequence’s best blast hit (BBH) is a sequence corresponding to the profile HMM that retrieved the query sequence in the initial search, the sequence is retained. If the sequence’s BBH is a sequence from another alignment, the sequence is still retained, but is written out to the file “non-reciprocal_hits.txt” with a note on which protein from the starting database represented the BBH. Sequences are then added to the corresponding dataset from the starting database and aligned using MAFFT v.7.455 [<xref rid="pbio.3001365.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] with the parameters “--auto --reorder”, trimmed with trimAl v.1.4.rev15 [<xref rid="pbio.3001365.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] with a gap threshold of 0.2, and subjected to phylogenetic tree reconstruction via FastTree v. 2.1.11 [<xref rid="pbio.3001365.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] with default parameters. The resulting tree is examined using the Python package ETE3 [<xref rid="pbio.3001365.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Sequences that branch sister to or within a clade composed of organisms with the same assigned higher taxonomy are prioritized over sequences that do not, regardless of previous criteria; higher taxonomy for taxa is derived whether from the starting database’s metadata file or the input metadata file. All retained sequences are then added to their corresponding alignments, with the sequence that received the highest level of priority being denoted the putative ortholog and all others denoted as putative paralogs.</p>

      <title>Automated filtering, alignment, trimming, and tree construction</title>
      <p>PhyloFisher also includes a Python script <italic toggle="yes">sgt_contructor</italic>.<italic toggle="yes">py</italic> to automatically filter, align, trim, length filter, and construct phylogenetic trees from all single-protein alignments. The script takes the output files from <italic toggle="yes">fisher</italic>.<italic toggle="yes">py</italic> (original single ortholog alignments that now contain newly added sequences selected by the fisher algorithm for input taxa as well as the previously denoted paralogs from the starting database) and removes any dashes to produce an unaligned set of sequences for nonhomologous character removal via PREQUAL v. 1.02 [<xref rid="pbio.3001365.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] using the default settings. Next, a length filtering step is performed to minimize the inclusion of proteins predicted from fragments of the same gene. This is common in proteomes predicted from transcriptomes. First, sequences are aligned with the program MAFFT using the settings “--globalpair --maxiterate 1000 --unalignlevel 0.6”. This is followed by the assessment of alignment error and uncertainty by the program DIVVIER v. 1.01 [<xref rid="pbio.3001365.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] using the options “-mincol 4 -divvygap.” The resulting alignments are trimmed using BMGE v. 1.1.2 [<xref rid="pbio.3001365.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], with a gap rate cutoff of 0.3. Any sequence whose length is less than half the total alignment length, after BMGE filtering, is removed. After the removal of “short” sequences, files are prepared for single-protein phylogenetic tree construction by rerunning MAFFT and DIVVIER as above, followed by trimming with the program trimAl with a gap threshold of 0.01 [<xref rid="pbio.3001365.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Finally, single-protein tree reconstruction is performed using RAxML v. 8.2.12 [<xref rid="pbio.3001365.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], with the options “-m PROTGAMMALG4XF -f a -x 123 -N 100 -p 12345.” When single gene tree construction begins, <italic toggle="yes">sgt_constructor</italic>.<italic toggle="yes">py</italic> will check to see how many gene trees are to be built and how many threads were provided by the user. If the number of gene trees to be built is greater than the number of threads provided, <italic toggle="yes">sgt_constructor</italic>.<italic toggle="yes">py</italic> will run as many jobs as it can using a single thread each. This process will continue until all gene trees have been built. If the total number of gene trees to be built is less than the number of threads available, <italic toggle="yes">sgt_constructor</italic>.<italic toggle="yes">py</italic> will distribute all threads available as evenly as possible.</p>

      <title>PhyloFisher v. 1.0 database construction</title>
      <p>Sequence data were gathered for 304 eukaryotic taxa from various public resources. The identity of each taxon was carefully checked, resulting in numerous changes in names of the taxa (compared to the original data resource), reflecting developments in the taxonomy of the respective organisms (revisions in generic assignment, newly described species, etc.) retrieved from the literature or corrected identification of misidentified taxa. A complete list of taxa and the associated accession numbers are provided in <xref rid="pbio.3001365.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Table</xref>. When not available, predicted proteomes were obtained from transcriptome assemblies using TransDecoder-v5.5.0 (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://github.com/TransDecoder/TransDecoder/releases" ext-link-type="uri">https://github.com/TransDecoder/TransDecoder/releases</ext-link>). For many taxa, transcriptomes were de novo assembled from transcriptomic reads available in the Sequence Read Archive (SRA) database. First, sequencing errors were corrected in the raw reads using Rcorrector v. 1.0.1 [<xref rid="pbio.3001365.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] using default settings. Next, adaptor sequences and low quality bases were removed using trimmomatic v. 0.36 [<xref rid="pbio.3001365.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] with the following parameters: ILLUMINACLIP:2:30:10 SLIDINGWINDOW:4:5 LEADING:5 TRAILING:5 MINLEN:25. The corrected and trimmed reads were assembled using the de novo transcriptome assembly program Trinity v2.6.6 [<xref rid="pbio.3001365.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. The predicted proteomes of the 304 eukaryotic taxa were used as input for <italic toggle="yes">fisher</italic>.<italic toggle="yes">py</italic>, collecting up to the default number of sequences (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 5) for downstream analyses. These input proteomes can be found in the “proteomes” directory of the provided starting database that can be retrieved via wget from <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://ir.library.msstate.edu/bitstream/handle/11668/19731/Tice_etal.PhyloFisherDatabase_v1.0_Apr.11.2021.tar.gz" ext-link-type="uri">https://ir.library.msstate.edu/bitstream/handle/11668/19731/Tice_etal.PhyloFisherDatabase_v1.0_Apr.11.2021.tar.gz</ext-link>. Details about each proteome can be found in the metadata.tsv file located in this same directory. A preliminary starting database was constructed from a 240 gene subset of a previous phylogenomic dataset “BORDOR” developed in [<xref rid="pbio.3001365.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] to enable the use of sequences from diverse taxa for specific queries when appropriate. The program hmmbuild from the HMMER3 package was used to make profile HMMs for all 240 genes using the BORDOR alignments as input. Specific queries were provided for all organisms that have a well-agreed upon position in the tree of eukaryotes; otherwise, the default route in <italic toggle="yes">fisher</italic>.<italic toggle="yes">py</italic> was utilized. The most closely related organism with the most complete genome or transcriptome available was used as the specific query, followed by less complete data when available. After sequences had been collected by <italic toggle="yes">fisher</italic>.<italic toggle="yes">py</italic> for all organisms, the resulting files were subjected to the workflow described in the “Automated Filtering, Alignment, Trimming, and Single-protein Tree Construction” section. The resulting homolog trees were examined manually with the included tool “ParaSorter” to select orthologous sequences, demarcate paralogs, and remove contaminating sequences using the logic outlined in the section “Phylogenomic dataset construction and analyses” of [<xref rid="pbio.3001365.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Finally, the aligned orthologs of the 304 public taxa (<xref rid="pbio.3001365.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Table</xref>) were used to produce the final profile HMMs shipped with PhyloFisher v. 1.0 as well as the sequences of the 240 orthologs and their paralogs that comprise the starting database.</p>

      <p>RTC scores were calculated for all genes comprising the BUSCO 1292 dataset of [<xref rid="pbio.3001365.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The 10% of genes with highest RTC scores were collected and used as the starting orthologs to create a custom PhyloFisher database through the methodology implemented in the included utility <italic toggle="yes">build_database</italic>.<italic toggle="yes">py</italic>. The utility <italic toggle="yes">build_database</italic>.<italic toggle="yes">py</italic> takes any number of individual ortholog files (with an option to provide known paralogs) as input and generates the data necessary for the retrieval of the ortholog set from new taxa and subsequent analyses within the PhyloFisher workflow. The utility <italic toggle="yes">build_database</italic>.<italic toggle="yes">py</italic> aligns the provided set of orthologs using the “--auto” option of MAFFT [<xref rid="pbio.3001365.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] and creates profile HMMs for each gene alignment using the “hmmbuild” utility from the HMMER3 package [<xref rid="pbio.3001365.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], builds a DIAMOND blast database from the set of provided orthologs, and assigns an OrthoMCL orthogroup number(s) to each ortholog. OrthoMCL orthogroup numbers are assigned by using all sequences in a provided ortholog file as queries in a BLAST search against the OrthoMCL v. 5.0 database [<xref rid="pbio.3001365.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. If a user-defined percentage (default = 10%) of sequences hit an OrthoMCL orthogroup with a significance threshold of evalue &lt; 1e -10, then that orthogroup is assigned to the ortholog. More than 1 OrthoMCL orthogroup number can be assigned to ortholog. If the provided ortholog alignment is assigned “no group” or to an exclusively bacterial group in OrthoMCL, the gene cannot be used in the PhyloFisher workflow. Sequences representing putative homologs of this ortholog set were collected from all Saccharomycetaceae, Saccharomycodaceae, and Phaffomycetaceae genomes used in [<xref rid="pbio.3001365.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] as well as the recently sequenced genome of <italic toggle="yes">T</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">globosa</italic> (accession: GCF_014133895.1) via <italic toggle="yes">fisher</italic>.<italic toggle="yes">py</italic>’s phylogenetically informed route using default options. The putative homologs were processed using the remainder of PhyloFisher’s main workflow, and final ortholog/paralog/contamination decisions were applied to the custom database described above.</p>
      <p>During our analysis of the homolog trees produced, we discovered the inadvertent inclusion of paralogs in the original dataset of [<xref rid="pbio.3001365.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. To explore the effect of these misassignments of the tree of Saccharomycetaceae, we created 2 phylogenomic datasets: the first maintaining all the original ortholog assignments of [<xref rid="pbio.3001365.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] and the second with the orthologs assigned through the PhyloFisher workflow.</p>
      <p>We also collected putative homologs of the ortholog set that comprises PhyloFisher’s provided starting database from all Saccharomycetaceae, Saccharomycodaceae, and Phaffomycetaceae used in [<xref rid="pbio.3001365.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] and <italic toggle="yes">T</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">globosa</italic> via <italic toggle="yes">fisher</italic>.<italic toggle="yes">py</italic>’s phylogenetically informed route using default options. From this, a third phylogenomic dataset was created from 208/240 orthologs that were present in at least 90% of newly added taxa and fungal taxa already present in PhyloFisher’s provided database.</p>

    <p>PhyloFisher was named during a fly fishing trip on the White River in Arkansas with AKT, TP, DŽ, and MWB; we thank Patrick Brown for lending his cabin. We thank Prof. Edward Susko at Dalhousie University for allowing us to distribute the programs DIST_EST and MAMMaL with our PhyloFisher package. We would like to thank Kristina Terpis for her advice on fine-scale taxonomy of the Stramenopiles. We are also grateful to Jolien van Hooff and Nicholas Fry for acting as beta testers.</p>

    </p>
    <p>Dear Matt,</p>
    <p>Thank you very much for submitting your manuscript "PhyloFisher: A phylogenomic package for resolving deep eukaryotic relationships" for consideration as a Community Page at PLOS Biology. Your manuscript has been evaluated by the PLOS Biology editors, and by three independent reviewers.</p>
    <p>IMPORTANT: Many thanks for your patience while we discussed the reviews. We took a little extra time as we became concerned about whether a Community Page is the right format for this. I'd wondered this when you first approached us before submission, and we went back and forth between Community Page and a Methods and Resources paper. Recently we have started to refocus our Community Pages (and other "magazine section" formats) to make them shorter and of broader appeal. It is also clear from the reviewers (and especially reviewers #1 and #2) feel that the paper needs to be expanded somewhat to attend to their concerns.</p>
    <p>You'll see that reviewers #1 and #2 are pushing for the authors to demonstrate the pipeline being put through its paces on shallower trees, in order to broaden the appeal and utility of the method. Each of these reviewers had some additional, more minor concerns. Most of reviewer #3’s requests relate to their inability to test the pipeline and the paucity of documentation on Github, rather than the paper per se.</p>
    <p>We took the liberty of discussing the rationale of changing the paper to a Methods paper with an Academic Editor with relevant expertise, and they were supportive. We therefore ask that you convert your article (on re-submission) to a Methods and Resources paper (do check the article processing charges: <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://plos.org/publish/fees/" ext-link-type="uri">https://plos.org/publish/fees/</ext-link>); this would allow you to expand your proof-of-principle to address the reviewers' concerns, and you would also have the option of shunting some of the rather large Supplementary Info into the main article, giving it a more conventional structure.</p>
    <p>In light of the reviews (below), we will not be able to accept the current version of the manuscript, but we would welcome re-submission of a much-revised version that takes into account the reviewers' comments. We cannot make any decision about publication until we have seen the revised manuscript and your response to the reviewers' comments. Your revised manuscript is also likely to be sent for further evaluation by the reviewers.</p>
    <p>We expect to receive your revised manuscript within 3 months. </p>
    <p>Please email us (<email>plosbiology@plos.org</email>) if you have any questions or concerns, or would like to request an extension. At this stage, your manuscript remains formally under active consideration at our journal; please notify us by email if you do not intend to submit a revision so that we may end consideration of the manuscript at PLOS Biology.</p>
    <p>**IMPORTANT - SUBMITTING YOUR REVISION**</p>
    <p>Your revisions should address the specific points made by each reviewer. Please submit the following files along with your revised manuscript:</p>

    <p>REVIEWERS' COMMENTS:</p>
    <p>IMPORTANT:</p>
    <p>Please change your article type to "Methods and Resources" when re-submitting.</p>
    <p>Reviewer #1:</p>
    <p>The manuscript entitled "PhyloFisher: A phylogenomic package for resolving deep eukaryotic relationships" presents the software PhyloFisher that aims to facilitate phylogenomics analyses using the state of the art implementations. Such software in general comes in handy, espacially for those who are new in the field and have not their main research focus on resolving phylogenies. The software is scalable and different post-phylogeny analyses are implemented. It is helpful to combine the knowledge gained in the past years of phylogenomic, large scale analyses and make them available to a broader user spectrum. I get the feeling that this software can also be used well in teaching, which is not mentioned in the manuscript. Overall the manuscript is very well written and understandable for the broader community the software is aimed for to be used. Therfore, I support the publication of the manuscript after some changes and add-ons have been performed.</p>
    <p>My main advice is two apply PhyloFisher to a different area of the tree of life to show the full potential of the software. The single example provided is addressing a very deep node. I suggest to add an additional analysis for a much more internal node within plants, animals or such. Also, it would be good to show PhyloFishers performance on the gene selection, orthology determination of very new datasets of such internal branched. As it is known, there are many, lineage specific genes that are informative to resolve phylogenetic relationships that are not part of the curated set of genes the authors have implemented. I guess this should be possible within revision time.</p>
    <p>The main Figure 1 can be better organized. It is quite compressed, the use of fonts is not easy to grab and a better design would be more helpful. Furthermore, the colors used are not all discriminable by color-blind readers, so please use different color sets. This BTW is true for ALL figures incl. the Supplementary Material. </p>
    <p>Reviewer #2:</p>
    <p>Tice et al. describe a pipeline for building and curating large multi-gene phylogenetic datasets for inferring the phylogeny of eukaryotes. The pipeline and reference dataset are likely to be used by members of this community. The scripts are well described and feature-rich. It seems that the main purpose of the pipeline is for adding species to their database of 300 eukaryotes and 240 genes. They have used this dataset to successfully infer the tree of eukaryotes, with a focus on inferring deep splits in the tree. Researchers who wish to do this will find the approach described here very appealing. It appears that one could sequence the transcriptome or genome of a eukaryote and fairly easily place it in their tree of eukaryotes without having to master every step of performing a phylogenomic analysis, which for most people involves lots of scripting and mastering of dozens of software programs. Thus, this set of scripts appears to make this endeavor more accessible to the broader eukaryotic phylogenomics community.</p>
    <p>It is less clear to me how useful this will be for someone who works on a particular group of eukaryotes. For example, the myBaits angiosperm 353 kit has found widespread use by the flowering plant community. Could they create a database of these orthologs and have a parallel "angiosperm" version of the pipeline? Is it flexible in this way, or would that be a lot of work? Could this easily be adopted for vertebrates? Green algae? Beetles?</p>
    <p>This paper emphasizes manual curation of phylogenomic datasets, referring to manual intervention and inspection as "absolutely required" (line 64). I'm not sure I agree, but one advantage of their pipeline is that it reportedly logs the manual curation steps, which is important for reproducibility, which is a major problem in phylogenomics. Anyone who's carried out these types of analyses can recognize a Methods section where it was clear that the investigator made lots of undocumented decisions.</p>
    <p>I think this manuscript somewhat trivializes the tree-pruning algorithms of Yang and Smith (reference 6 in this manuscript). That pipeline does not have all of the features of this one, to be sure, but it semi-automates many of the same steps, and it follows fixed algorithms to identify and prune paralogs, giving orthologs for gene-tree and then species-tree inference. This was probably one of the biggest advances in the field for de novo phylogenomics. This approach differs in that it is not de novo, rather one might use the approach of Yang and Smith to obtain a set of orthologs de novo, create a database of these, then adopt parts of the pipeline described here to complete the analysis or for future studies. If I have mischaracterized this, then I apologize, but I'd encourage you to clarify the manuscript. This is not for de novo phylogenomics, correct? In a related question, how independent are the various scripts in the pipeline, i.e., could one use just the scripts for setting up their Astral run or stripping high-rate sites, or would this throw a ton of errors because they haven't used the entire pipeline from step 1? I hope it's the former because some of these scripts will be very useful.</p>
    <p>I mentioned above that I disagree somewhat that manual intervention is "absolutely required." I would also argue that (my understanding of) their description of a "phylogenetically informed/aware" approach to ortholog selection makes it sounds much more sophisticated than it actually is. "Phylogenetically informed" means that the user has identified a close relative in the reference dataset, so the HMM or BLAST searches are tailored accordingly. This is related to my friendly disagreement about manual curation as an "absolute" requirement (again, their language). In many of the papers on eukaryote phylogeny, some newly discovered or newly cultured taxon is sequenced, added to a tree, and there's a big story about it being sister to one lineage or another. These trees have dozens or hundreds of taxa, like the one in the present manuscript, so these are often deep splitting lone branches on the tree, the kind of branch that is often (and wrongfully) described as basal. So what does manual inspection of the gene trees do for you in this example? Sometimes an orthogroup includes deep-branching out-paralogs, and oftentimes single gene trees have abysmally low bootstrap (or other) support. When dealing with an organism whose phylogenetic placement is truly unknown and with hundreds of gene trees with low or variable support, is it really best practice to have the user manually selecting which sequences are orthologs and which are paralogs? I'd rather have an approach like Yang and Smith make those unbiased determinations for me. I'm not arguing here that Yang and Smith is perfect? But manual determination of paralogs for deep nodes in the eukaryotic phylogeny seems potentially fraught.</p>
    <p>This was a well-written manuscript by a group that has clearly thought about these issues and has the benefit of experience. I think the protist and eukaryote phylogeny communities are likely to adopt these pipelines for their work, making them potentially very impactful. If the answers to all of my outstanding questions turn out to have favorable answers, some or perhaps all of the scripts will find even wider use.</p>
    <p>Reviewer #3:</p>
    <p>PhyloFisher</p>
    <p>Phylofisher is a set of scripts, database and tools to generate standardised phylogenies to try and resolve interesting or unknown phylogenetic relationships in the eToL.</p>
    <p>The author's identify the need for these tools, as there are a multitude of published trees looking at similar datasets but note that they often show differening results (and interpretations) due to the differences in their curation and methods used. They go on to create a database and set of tools in order to help with this, and also test their tool on several contentious evolutionary relationships serving as a proxy to dtermine their tool use and pipeline decisions.</p>
    <p>The author's built a curated datsaet of 240 proteins from 304 diverse taxa from the eToL ("PhyloFisher_Proteome_Data.tgz" and detailed philosophically from Ln171++) - however, this is not currently located as a download in the supplementary for reviewers, and on contacting the journal editor they did not have a copy either. This is not particularly useful. It is also not part of the conda install, and not available on their github.</p>
    <p>For publication this should be made available, open and placed somwhere like figshare or another repository, versioned and archived with a DOI. It is an important part of the pipeline (unless you create your own DB, which I feel is not adequately explained either), and without it the claims surrounding phylogenetic relationships further in the paper cannot be repeated or tested. Also to be able to test the tool for review it should have been accessible. This seems to be somewhat of a missed opportunity and largely reflects the review decision in my opinion.</p>
    <p>The tools/scripts themselves are available at github, and can also be installed with modern package manager tools such as conda and pip, which is most important for a modern tool that encompasses and relies on many dependenicies - so, that is good to see. Installation for this review used miniconda on ubuntu linux, which seemed to work fine. There are a few issues with some scripts, which are noted below…</p>
    <p>The methodology of the reconstruction of the eToL and others is quite well explained but is somewhat burried in the supplementary (ln215++), it would be good to see this in a more user friendly format on the GitHub repo (e.g. as a wiki or similar) as currently there is rather little on the functioning of the scripts located there. Also a walkthrough and some example datasets of the best use cases would be extremely valuable for users who want to learn and get started quickly. A tool that is advertised as "easy-to-use" really needs something like this accompanying it. Ln 69 mentiones a "manual", but where is this? There are a great many accessory scripts included in this tool and they should be mentioned and explained with reference to their use, expected inputs and outputs. e.g. Fig 1. Although a large image with a lot of information displayed, many of the boxes/panels are represented by scripts within the phylofisher package, therfore it would be quite useful for the names of those scripts to appear in the boxes that represent them as a hint for potential users.</p>
    <p>Further, Ln90 talks about an "input metadata file" but this file and the format it expects are not detailed anywhere (what inputs are required, what format should they take). A version is included in the github repo but refers to hard coded details not present in the repo itself or values are left as "XX" without reference to what values they could take, so the example is not particularly useful as a starting point. There does not have to be a complete walkthough of how to assemble the same dataset the author's produced for the paper, although that would be excellent and reflect the open nature and quality of PloS (the genomes/transcriptomes are detailed in supplementary but perhaps they should be offered as a static tarball of assemblies etc), but a smaller and slightly contrived example with a small set of easily accessible Euk genomes would suffice - this should detail the full process, all commands needed, even those outside of the PhyloFisher package to show what is required to start...</p>
    <p>Similarly, a walkthrough on the steps to create a custome DB (if not using the one referenced in the paper) would be extremely valuable, there is some barebones of this on their github already but it is not overly clear on any prior steps, and it is also unfinished...</p>
    <p>Running "forge.py" and "fisher.py" without any arguments throws a python error, they should at least display the help menu instead.</p>
    <p>The paper also mentions a tool "ParaSorter" (e.g. Ln108) which also appears in the supplementary, but I do not see it as an installation candidate or any code within the group's github anywhere. Or at least it is non-obvious to me. It sounds cool! So, where is it? Also, I think it probably deserves more than one runaway sentence...as it could be a useful tool outside of PhyloFisher in-and-of itself. It too should be made available as part of the review and eventual publication/repository. Apologies if I have missed it, but I went through the code where I think it should be and there's nothing there.</p>
    <p>Experimentally, the methodologies employed to produce an alignment and the order of the specific tools used to then produce a phylogeny is sound and I have no concern over the methodology here. The selection of trimming tool is nicely corroborated with the use of RTC scores for genes trees per different settings across trimming programs. Indeed, many tools are tested in this manner throughout the script. Nonetheless, I think that it would help, e.g. those coming to a tool advertised as "easy to use", if the choices could have a little more of the author's thought processes/philosophy given as to why those tools, and in that order, have been chosen. Whilst I am very familiar with these tools, as are obviously the author's, if they would like their suite of tools to be adopted as a standard protocol - or at least a starting point - it might help their case to walk through the more novice users with their design choices in a more friendly format.</p>
    <p>Whilst I don't think the issues with the documentation, or lack of walktrhough examples, and missing dataset detract from the paper or the tool in and of itself, for a tool that is described as "easy to use" and aimed at including more researchers being able to produce better phylogenies (and so better test their hypotheses) via a standardised pipeline (especially those who may not have much experience in determining what they need to start with) I would expect there to be much better documentation, and for the database to be accessible immediately. The merit of the paper and the security of it rests on it being tested externally before publication. Not least for it to be considered to be published in a PloS journal. </p>

    </p>
    <p>Dear Matt,</p>
    <p>Thank you for submitting your revised Methods and Resources paper entitled "PhyloFisher: A phylogenomic package for resolving eukaryotic relationships" for publication in PLOS Biology. I've now obtained advice from the original reviewers and have discussed their comments with the Academic Editor. </p>
    <p>Based on the reviews, we will probably accept this manuscript for publication, provided you satisfactorily address the following data and other policy-related requests.</p>
    <p>IMPORTANT:</p>
    <p>a) Our IThenticate software detects a significant similarity between lines 418-427 and a BMC Biology paper (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://bmcbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12915-021-01007-2" ext-link-type="uri">https://bmcbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12915-021-01007-2</ext-link>) by a subset of your co-authors. Please could you adjust the wording of this section to minimise any copyright issues?</p>
    <p>b) Please could you attend to my Data Policy requests further down. Essentially, while it may be that some of your Figs can be generates using the software package and the database provided, it's not clear whether this applies to all of the Fig panels (especially the supplementary Figs S2, S3, S4, S5, S6, S7, S8, S10, S12, S13, S14). In each case, please can you supply the underlying data and cite its location clearly in the respective Fig legends? If the data can be generated using the Phylofisher software and the dataset then please specify this (including URLs) in each legend.</p>
    <p>As you address these items, please take this last chance to review your reference list to ensure that it is complete and correct. If you have cited papers that have been retracted, please include the rationale for doing so in the manuscript text, or remove these references and replace them with relevant current references. Any changes to the reference list should be mentioned in the cover letter that accompanies your revised manuscript.</p>
    <p>We expect to receive your revised manuscript within two weeks. </p>
    <p>To submit your revision, please go to <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://www.editorialmanager.com/pbiology/" ext-link-type="uri">https://www.editorialmanager.com/pbiology/</ext-link> and log in as an Author. Click the link labelled 'Submissions Needing Revision' to find your submission record. Your revised submission must include the following:</p>
    <p>-  a cover letter that should detail your responses to any editorial requests, if applicable, and whether changes have been made to the reference list</p>
    <p>-  a Response to Reviewers file that provides a detailed response to the reviewers' comments (if applicable)</p>
    <p>-  a track-changes file indicating any changes that you have made to the manuscript. </p>
    <p>NOTE: If Supporting Information files are included with your article, note that these are not copyedited and will be published as they are submitted. Please ensure that these files are legible and of high quality (at least 300 dpi) in an easily accessible file format. For this reason, please be aware that any references listed in an SI file will not be indexed. For more information, see our Supporting Information guidelines:</p>

    </p>
    <p>*Published Peer Review History*</p>
    <p>Please note that you may have the opportunity to make the peer review history publicly available. The record will include editor decision letters (with reviews) and your responses to reviewer comments. If eligible, we will contact you to opt in or out. Please see here for more details:</p>
    <p>
      <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://blogs.plos.org/plos/2019/05/plos-journals-now-open-for-published-peer-review/" ext-link-type="uri">https://blogs.plos.org/plos/2019/05/plos-journals-now-open-for-published-peer-review/</ext-link>
    </p>
    <p>*Early Version*</p>
    <p>Please note that an uncorrected proof of your manuscript will be published online ahead of the final version, unless you opted out when submitting your manuscript. If, for any reason, you do not want an earlier version of your manuscript published online, uncheck the box. Should you, your institution's press office or the journal office choose to press release your paper, you will automatically be opted out of early publication. We ask that you notify us as soon as possible if you or your institution is planning to press release the article.</p>
    <p>*Protocols deposition*</p>
    <p>To enhance the reproducibility of your results, we recommend that if applicable you deposit your laboratory protocols in protocols.io, where a protocol can be assigned its own identifier (DOI) such that it can be cited independently in the future. Additionally, PLOS ONE offers an option for publishing peer-reviewed Lab Protocol articles, which describe protocols hosted on protocols.io. Read more information on sharing protocols at <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://plos.org/protocols?utm_medium=editorial-email&amp;utm_source=authorletters&amp;utm_campaign=protocols" ext-link-type="uri">https://plos.org/protocols?utm_medium=editorial-email&amp;utm_source=authorletters&amp;utm_campaign=protocols</ext-link></p>
    <p>Please do not hesitate to contact me should you have any questions.</p>
    <p>Sincerely,</p>

    <p>------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
    <p>DATA POLICY:</p>
    <p>You may be aware of the PLOS Data Policy, which requires that all data be made available without restriction: <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/s/data-availability" ext-link-type="uri">http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/s/data-availability</ext-link>. For more information, please also see this editorial: <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.1001797 " ext-link-type="uri">http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.1001797 </ext-link></p>
    <p>Note that we do not require all raw data. Rather, we ask that all individual quantitative observations that underlie the data summarized in the figures and results of your paper be made available in one of the following forms:</p>
    <p>1) Supplementary files (e.g., excel). Please ensure that all data files are uploaded as 'Supporting Information' and are invariably referred to (in the manuscript, figure legends, and the Description field when uploading your files) using the following format verbatim: S1 Data, S2 Data, etc. Multiple panels of a single or even several figures can be included as multiple sheets in one excel file that is saved using exactly the following convention: S1_Data.xlsx (using an underscore).</p>
    <p>2) Deposition in a publicly available repository. Please also provide the accession code or a reviewer link so that we may view your data before publication. </p>
    <p>Regardless of the method selected, please ensure that you provide the individual numerical values that underlie the summary data displayed in the following figure panels as they are essential for readers to assess your analysis and to reproduce it: Figs S2, S3, S4, S5, S6, S7, S8, S10, S12, S13, S14.</p>
    <p>NOTE: the numerical data provided should include all replicates AND the way in which the plotted mean and errors were derived (it should not present only the mean/average values).</p>
    <p>IMPORTANT: Please also ensure that figure legends in your manuscript include information on where the underlying data can be found, and ensure your supplemental data file/s has a legend. If the data can be generated using the Phylofisher software and the dataset then please specify this (including URLs) in each legend.</p>
    <p>Please ensure that your Data Statement in the submission system accurately describes where your data can be found.</p>
    <p>------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
    <p>DATA NOT SHOWN?</p>
    <p>- Please note that per journal policy, we do not allow the mention of "data not shown", "personal communication", "manuscript in preparation" or other references to data that is not publicly available or contained within this manuscript. Please either remove mention of these data or provide figures presenting the results and the data underlying the figure(s).</p>
    <p>------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
    <p>REVIEWERS' COMMENTS:</p>
    <p>Reviewer #1:</p>
    <p>The authors have added an additional analysis of another area of the tree of life. This is adding to the applicability of the software. The authors have furthermore addressed most of the comments of the reviewers. The addition of more authors is justified.</p>
    <p>Reviewer #2:</p>
    <p>They have sufficiently addressed most of the comments and made changes that have strengthened the manuscript. While I don't necessarily agree with all of their responses, it's not imperative that I agree with everything for this to be publishable. This is a good contribution to the community who works on resolving deep relationships in the eukaryotic tree of life.</p>
    <p>Reviewer #3:</p>
    <p>Initially I was worried that the paper and accompanying tool did not do enough to allow users to get started easily, however this has been massively improved on re-submission. There is a now a very well documented manual that accompanies the set of scripts/programs outlined in the paper. The tools themselves have also been improved and the starting database is now available. These inclusions and updates remove any doubts that it will not be a useful tool for the community. Therefore I am happy to recommend the manuscript's acceptance and the author's replies subsequently I have no further recommendations and am looking forward to using the software in some analyses.</p>

    </p>
    <p>Dear Matt,</p>
    <p>On behalf of my colleagues and the Academic Editor, Andreas Hejnol, I'm pleased to say that we can in principle offer to publish your Methods and Resources paper "PhyloFisher: A phylogenomic package for resolving eukaryotic relationships" in PLOS Biology, provided you address any remaining formatting and reporting issues. These will be detailed in an email that will follow this letter and that you will usually receive within 2-3 business days, during which time no action is required from you. Please note that we will not be able to formally accept your manuscript and schedule it for publication until you have made the required changes.</p>
    <p>IMPORTANT:</p>
    <p>a) As discussed by email, please ensure that the data underlying the Figures (conveyed to me via Figshare) is available in the stipulated location (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://ir.library.msstate.edu/" ext-link-type="uri">https://ir.library.msstate.edu/</ext-link>...) by the time that the paper publishes.</p>
    <p>b) Please mention the location of the data clearly in all relevant main and supplementary Figure legends (e.g. "The data underlying this Figure may be found at <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://ir.library.msstate.edu/" ext-link-type="uri">https://ir.library.msstate.edu/</ext-link>...."). I'm aware that this will look repetitive, but it makes the Figs+legends more standalone. I'll tell my colleagues to expect this change.</p>
    <p>Please take a minute to log into Editorial Manager at <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="http://www.editorialmanager.com/pbiology/" ext-link-type="uri">http://www.editorialmanager.com/pbiology/</ext-link>, click the "Update My Information" link at the top of the page, and update your user information to ensure an efficient production process.</p>
    <p>PRESS: We frequently collaborate with press offices. If your institution or institutions have a press office, please notify them about your upcoming paper at this point, to enable them to help maximise its impact. If the press office is planning to promote your findings, we would be grateful if they could coordinate with <email>biologypress@plos.org</email>. If you have not yet opted out of the early version process, we ask that you notify us immediately of any press plans so that we may do so on your behalf.</p>
    <p>We also ask that you take this opportunity to read our Embargo Policy regarding the discussion, promotion and media coverage of work that is yet to be published by PLOS. As your manuscript is not yet published, it is bound by the conditions of our Embargo Policy. Please be aware that this policy is in place both to ensure that any press coverage of your article is fully substantiated and to provide a direct link between such coverage and the published work. For full details of our Embargo Policy, please visit <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="http://www.plos.org/about/media-inquiries/embargo-policy/" ext-link-type="uri">http://www.plos.org/about/media-inquiries/embargo-policy/</ext-link>.</p>
    <p>Thank you again for choosing PLOS Biology for publication and supporting Open Access publishing. We look forward to publishing your study. </p>
