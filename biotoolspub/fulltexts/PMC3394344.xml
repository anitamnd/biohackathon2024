    <abstract>
      <p>A computational pipeline PocketAnnotate for functional annotation of proteins at the level of binding sites has been proposed in this study. The pipeline integrates three in-house algorithms for site-based function annotation: PocketDepth, for prediction of binding sites in protein structures; PocketMatch, for rapid comparison of binding sites and PocketAlign, to obtain detailed alignment between pair of binding sites. A novel scheme has been developed to rapidly generate a database of non-redundant binding sites. For a given input protein structure, putative ligand-binding sites are identified, matched in real time against the database and the query substructure aligned with the promising hits, to obtain a set of possible ligands that the given protein could bind to. The input can be either whole protein structures or merely the substructures corresponding to possible binding sites. Structure-based function annotation at the level of binding sites thus achieved could prove very useful for cases where no obvious functional inference can be obtained based purely on sequence or fold-level analyses. An attempt has also been made to analyse proteins of no known function from Protein Data Bank. PocketAnnotate would be a valuable tool for the scientific community and contribute towards structure-based functional inference.

    <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
    <p>In the post-genomic era, the number of completely sequenced genomes has increased tremendously widening the sequence-structure gap. Various structural genomics consortia have been setup to determine the structures of those unique sequences to bridge this sequence-structure gap. As an obvious outcome, there is significant increase in the number of proteins whose functions have not been determined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks421-B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks421-B2">2</xref>). Annotation can be of several types—from a crude association of a biological process to detailed mechanistic view of the underlying biological reaction. Typically for homologous proteins, sequence-to-function models suffice in obtaining broad associations, based on the premise that when two sequences are similar to each other, their structures and hence function is also likely to be similar. In cases where structure may be conserved but sequences are not homologous, structure to function models are used, as it is well understood that two proteins, that share no significant sequence similarities, could still adopt the same fold and hence exhibit the same function. Although useful in many cases, fold-level descriptions are not always sufficient as structures having the same fold can exhibit different functions and vice versa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks421-B3 gks421-B4 gks421-B5">3–5</xref>).</p>
    <p>The rationale behind the biological function of any protein molecule is its ability to specifically recognize the ligand. The binding site(s) of protein must, therefore, necessarily hold clues about the function of the protein. Algorithms such as CE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks421-B6">6</xref>), DALI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks421-B7">7</xref>), VAST (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks421-B8">8</xref>), SSM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks421-B9">9</xref>) and STAMP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks421-B10">10</xref>) capture the similarity in overall structure of the protein and also detect remote homologs that can lead to functional inference but fail to detect functional equivalence between proteins of different fold. The local structure-based methods with varying scope such as FFF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks421-B11">11</xref>), SPASM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks421-B12">12</xref>), Cavbase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks421-B13">13</xref>), ASSAM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks421-B14">14</xref>), PINTS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks421-B15">15</xref>), JESS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks421-B16">16</xref>), ef-Site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks421-B17">17</xref>), Query3d (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks421-B18">18</xref>), SATABSEARCH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks421-B19">19</xref>), CMASA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks421-B20">20</xref>) and ProBis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks421-B21">21</xref>) can in some cases capture functional similarities that are missed by global structure comparisons. 3D-Ligandsite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks421-B22">22</xref>), I-tasser (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks421-B23">23</xref>) and firestar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks421-B24">24</xref>) are examples of tools that use both sequence and fold-level analyses to identify important residues that could take part in catalysis or ligand binding. To our knowledge, there is no explicit tool to aid in annotation of a protein’s function based on identification of binding sites and the ligands that they could bind to. In this study, we report PocketAnnotate web server that integrates three algorithms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks421-B25 gks421-B26 gks421-B27">25–27</xref>) to guide the user through an interactive web interface during each step of the annotation process from choosing the substructure, to a database search and finally detailed alignment, visual inspection and identification of possible ligands.</p>
  </sec>
  <sec>
    <title>WORKFLOW</title>
    <p>PocketAnnotate workflow consists of three different algorithms that are integrated together to form a pipeline. The workflow of PocketAnnotate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gks421-F1">Figure 1</xref>) is as follows:
<list list-type="roman-lower"><list-item><p>The user input protein structure is first subjected to PocketDepth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks421-B25">25</xref>), a geometry-based algorithm to detect the putative binding sites in the given protein structure through a depth-based clustering algorithm. The predicted pockets are ranked using various schemes such as polarity, size, surface atom count, depth factor and hydrophobicity. The user can interactively analyse the output produced on the web server through a <italic>jmol</italic> applet and select an appropriate pocket.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The selected pocket is then analysed by PocketMatch algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks421-B26">26</xref>) to extract the distance elements between all atoms and compared against a database of known binding sites. The algorithm reports two scores PMS<sub>MIN</sub> (local similarity score) and PMS<sub>MAX</sub> (global similarity score) for all the binding sites compared in the database.</p></list-item><list-item><p>This step involves selection of a pair of high-scoring pockets by the user to analyse the similarities using PocketAlign (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks421-B27">27</xref>) that gives a detailed alignment including residue correspondences. PocketAlign produces alignment according to four different schemes, and each of them can be visualized on the web server using <italic>jmol</italic> applet.</p></list-item></list>

    <title>DATABASE OF BINDING SITES</title>
    <p>The reliability of the hits and time taken for comparison against the database is directly dependent on the quality of the database used. A non-redundant binding site database of biologically relevant ligands was derived out of Protein Data Bank (PDB) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks421-B28">28</xref>). The detailed description of various steps followed in creation of database is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gks421-F2">Figure 2</xref>. Approximately 49 866 protein–ligand complexes (excluding deoxyribonucleic acid/ribonucleic acid and only X-ray crystal structures as on 24 October 2011) were downloaded from PDB. The set of residues whose atoms lie within 4 Å radius of any ligand atom is considered as the binding site. The binding sites of metal ions, covalently bound ligands and crystallization components were excluded (list provided on the web server). Modified residues were also filtered out, as these would sometimes be represented as HETATM in the PDB. Altogether there were around 311 ligands removed including 67 metal ions and 485 modified residues. A distance cutoff of 2 Å between protein atom and ligand atom was used to identify and exclude covalently bound ligands in the data set through ligand protein contact (LPC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks421-B29">29</xref>).
<fig id="gks421-F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>Non-redundant binding site database. All the steps involved in generation of non-redundant binding sites based on SCOP association has been illustrated.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gks421f2"/></fig></p>
    <p>Non-redundancy of the binding sites is essential to speed up the process of database comparison. To generate a non-redundant set of binding sites, a novel scheme of associating a site with fold information in terms of structural classification of proteins (SCOP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks421-B30">30</xref>) identifiers of its constituent chain(s) has been proposed. The SCOP code consists of four fields, each representing a unique Class, Fold, Superfamily and Family, respectively. All the SCOP identifiers at the zone of binding sites are considered as strings in alphabetical order and concatenated to result in BScID’s, a unique structural identifier for the binding site. For example, the BScID for adenosine triphosphate (ATP) bound to PDB:1A49 is b.58.1.1–c.1.12.1, implying that the residues contributing to the binding site comes from two different folds—Pyruvate kinase (PK) β-barrel domain-like (b.58) and Triosephosphate isomerase (TIM) β/α barrel (c.1). In PDB, there are 12 such binding sites of ATP, all with the same BScID. To remove redundancy, only one best site per BScID is chosen by considering the resolution of the structures. In this case, the ATP binding site of PDB: 1A49 was considered because of its lowest resolution of 2.1 Å, among the 12. In a similar way, for each ligand type (defined by three-letter HETATM codes), one highest resolution site per BScID is chosen. Although there is a possibility of ligand orientation being slightly different even when the fold is the same, we observed that high similarity exists in significant portions of the corresponding pockets, as judged by a thorough analysis of comparison of all the binding sites belonging to same BScID. It resulted in average PMAX score of 0.59 and PMIN score of 0.63 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://proline.biochem.iisc.ernet.in/pocketannotate/info/Cluster_similarity.htm">http://proline.biochem.iisc.ernet.in/pocketannotate/info/Cluster_similarity.htm</ext-link>). The results of the comparison are available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://proline.biochem.iisc.ernet.in/pocketannotate/info/cluster_results/">http://proline.biochem.iisc.ernet.in/pocketannotate/info/cluster_results/</ext-link>. Thus, the method used by us to pick non-redundant sites seems reasonable, even when ligand orientation differs within the same fold. As not all PDB entries of the protein–ligand complex have the SCOP codes associated with it, consensus of superfamily assignment and 3D-BLAST (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks421-B31">31</xref>) were used to assign SCOP identifiers to the chain. Approximately 9438 structures were assigned SCOP through this method. For the remaining structures that could not be associated with any SCOP, unique binding site per entity (unique chain) in the structure was chosen. Finally, 18 895 binding sites corresponding to 9036 unique ligands were derived to form the non-redundant binding site database.</p>
    <p>Analysis of the database indicates that heme (HEM) ranked as the ligand with most number of different binding sites in the database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gks421/DC1">Supplementary Figure S1</ext-link>), which was followed by other biologically important co-factors such as ADP, ATP, ANP (Phosphoaminophosphonic acid-adenylate ester), Flavin-adenine dinucleotide (FAD) and S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine (SAH). The fold that shows the highest number of unique ligand associations was found to be TIM beta/alpha barrel, which was followed by Protein-kinase like, Acid proteases, Trypsin-like serine protease and Rossmann-fold. The database of binding sites is available for download from the website (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gks421/DC1">Supplementary Figure S2</ext-link>).</p>

  <sec>
    <title>WEB SERVER IMPLEMENTATION</title>
    <p>The entire web server has been implemented using Hypertext Preprocessor (PHP). The algorithms used, PocketDepth, PocketMatch and PocketAlign, have been coded in ‘C’ and bash. A typical database comparison for a query-binding site of 23 residues (ADP) takes ∼3 min to search the entire database of 18 895 sites using PocketMatch on Intel 2.83 GHz quad-core system running 32 bit Linux vs2 2.6.31-19-generic (Ubuntu). A comprehensible help section is added to help the user understand each of the steps involved and infer the output of the results produced in the workflow. A screen video is also provided as tutorial.</p>
    <sec>
      <title>Input</title>
      <p>The input required is a protein structure in PDB format. Three types of query can be provided as input to PocketAnnotate. An apo protein structure in PDB format can either be uploaded or the PDB code along with chain ID can be entered. The second type of query is supported by an option of uploading or entering PDB code of protein bound with a ligand. In such a scenario, all the residues within 4 Å radius of any atom of the ligand are extracted as the binding site, which can then be queried against the database, to identify similar binding sites with known ligands. The third type of query type would allow user to submit his/her own sub-structure (any zone of continuous/discontinuous residues in structure) for comparison.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec>
      <title>Output</title>
      <p>The results produced by all three algorithms are displayed on separate html pages during the pipeline (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gks421/DC1">Supplementary Figure S3</ext-link>), wherein the user can interactively analyse the results. PocketDepth predicts the putative binding sites, which can be visualized on the server through a <italic>jmol</italic> applet. There are various ranking schemes for the predicted clusters/pockets and the user can visualize the pockets through all the ranking schemes and choose the appropriate one. PocketMatch results are displayed in a scroll bar along with the scores in a separate html page, wherein the user can select the high-scoring pockets for PocketAlign. PocketAlign results are displayed in a separate interactive window, with both the selected sites superposed and report the correspondences between the residues in the pair aligned with RMSD scores.</p>
    </sec>
  </sec>
  <sec>
    <title>VALIDATION</title>
    <p>PocketAnnotate pipeline uses three different algorithms; a brief description of validation protocols that were used for each of the algorithms is listed on the web server in the validation section. PocketAnnotate was validated for three different data sets (i) protein–ligand complexes across different folds, (ii) apo-holo structures and (iii) homologous pairs of ligand bound protein structures.</p>
    <p>A set of 537 protein–ligand complexes such that it contained one ligand per fold type was prepared from our database. The correct pocket was detected in 409 of such cases automatically with default parameters when compared with the crystallographically determined pockets in the corresponding structures. In others, a part of the site was often identified, as with the case of most site prediction algorithms. A total of 329 of the predicted sites gave significant hits against its native ligand-binding sites with PMAX &gt; 0.25, PMIN &gt; 0.4 and at least 200 matching distance elements (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://proline.biochem.iisc.ernet.in/pocketannotate/php/Across_different_structures.htm">http://proline.biochem.iisc.ernet.in/pocketannotate/php/Across_different_structures.htm</ext-link>). Similar analysis was carried out on a data set of 124 pairs of apo-holo structures that identified correct hits in 75 cases (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://proline.biochem.iisc.ernet.in/pocketannotate/info/apo_holo.htm">http://proline.biochem.iisc.ernet.in/pocketannotate/info/apo_holo.htm</ext-link>) and 6166 pairs of homologous apo-holo protein structures that identified 4400 pairs with correct ligand having &lt;60% identity obtained through BUDDY-system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks421-B32">32</xref>) and BindingDB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks421-B33">33</xref>) database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://proline.biochem.iisc.ernet.in/pocketannotate/info/homologous_pairs.htm">http://proline.biochem.iisc.ernet.in/pocketannotate/info/homologous_pairs.htm</ext-link>). With a careful examination of the matches and with altered cutoffs or manual inspection, many of the remaining sites could also be annotated in all the data sets.</p>
  </sec>
  <sec>
    <title>STATISTICAL SIGNIFICANCE</title>
    <sec>
      <title>P value</title>
      <p>The database of binding sites obtained as described earlier was non-redundant in terms of ligand association, but to evaluate statistical significance for PocketMatch scores, we needed a database of non-redundant pockets (irrespective of ligand association). An all versus all comparison of the pockets in our database of 18 895 sites was performed using PocketMatch and later filtered to obtain unique binding sites by neglecting the pairs that gave a perfect score of 1. The distribution of scores (∼178 million) thus obtained (both PMIN and PMAX) was carefully analysed. The distribution was continuous and supported on a bounded interval between 0 and 1 as PocketMatch scores are reported with this range. The probability density function (pdf) and cumulative distribution function (cdf) are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gks421-F3">Figure 3</xref>. Cullen and Frey analysis performed on the scores suggested that it follows β distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gks421-F4">Figure 4</xref>a and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gks421/DC1">Supplementary Figure S4</ext-link>). The distribution of both PMIN and PMAX scores could then be represented in the mathematical form <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="gks421i1.jpg"/></inline-formula> -(pdf) and (cdf)-<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="gks421i2.jpg"/></inline-formula>, where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="gks421i3.jpg"/></inline-formula> is the gamma function, <italic>x</italic> is the pocketmatch score, <italic>B</italic> is the beta function, <italic>I<sub>x</sub></italic>(<italic>α</italic>, <italic>β</italic>) is regularized incomplete beta function for <italic>α</italic> and <italic>β</italic>, which are the shape parameters that should be estimated from the distribution. Matching moment method was used to estimate the shape parameter, and the goodness of fit is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gks421-F4">Figure 4</xref>b. The goodness of fit was also evaluated by Kolmogorov-Smirnov test that converged with the statistical nearness value of 0.017, resulting in almost the same value for shape parameters. In this scenario, our null hypothesis would state that a score reported is from random match (from the unique binding site database match), and the <italic>P</italic> value can be evaluated as the area under the curve (AUC) given by 1 − cdf. A <italic>P</italic> &gt; 0.01 would mean acceptance of the null hypothesis of random match. The score of 0.4 has been reported to be significant earlier by the analysis performed on pockets obtained from same SCOP fold that corresponds to statistical <italic>P</italic> value of 4 × 10<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup>. Thus, a <italic>P</italic> &lt; 4 × 10<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> obtained for a comparison of binding sites can be considered to be significant.

      <p>The data set of protein–ligand complexes (98 complexes) that had representative binding sites in our database was obtained from the apo-holo data set used earlier for the validation in the same study. An all versus all comparison of the binding sites was performed using PocketMatch. This data set included diverse (completely different binding sites) and analogues or inhibitors (same binding site) of the ligands, and hence, a classifier (0 for different site and 1 for same site) was manually generated to test the specificity and sensitivity of the PMS<sub>M</sub><sub>AX</sub> scores obtained (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://proline.biochem.iisc.ernet.in/pocketannotate/info/classifier.htm">http://proline.biochem.iisc.ernet.in/pocketannotate/info/classifier.htm</ext-link>). The ROC curve (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gks421-F5">Figure 5</xref>a) was obtained (AUC = 0.983) with maximum threshold at 0.4. Accuracy calculated at this threshold resulted in sensitivity of 93% and specificity of 95%. Each of the ligand-binding sites obtained were compared with the binding sites in database, and true positives (TP), true negatives (TN), false positives (FP) and false negatives (FN) were analysed for each prediction to understand the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) space occupied by them. Obtaining the right definitions of these terms was a non-trivial task. An assumption of similar ligands binding to similar pockets was made for the sake of simplicity. Tanimoto scores (Lig score) obtained between the ligands through FP2 fingerprint was used to assess the ligand similarity. A comparison was considered to be TP if the PMS<sub>MAX</sub> &gt; 0.4 and Lig score &gt; 0.9, TN if PMS<sub>M</sub><sub>AX</sub> &lt;0.4 and Lig score &lt; 0.9, FP if PMS<sub>MAX</sub> &gt; 0.4 and Lig score &lt; 0.9 and FN if PMS<sub>M</sub><sub>AX</sub> &lt; 0.4 and Lig score &gt; 0.9. Although there is a possibility of same ligand binding to dissimilar sites and different ligands binding to same pocket, however rare, only FP’s and FN’s would change under this assumption, leading to underestimation of performance rather than an overestimation. The ROC space indicates good predictions for sites obtained directly from protein–ligand complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gks421-F5">Figure 5</xref>b) but not for predicted pockets from corresponding apo-forms of the protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gks421-F5">Figure 5</xref>c). This would be expected because of the boundaries of the pockets not being defined exactly, which is a general limitation with any binding-site prediction tool. However, the ROC space improves significantly when PMS<sub>M</sub><sub>IN</sub> scores are considered, because, in most cases the actual pocket is a subset of the predicted pocket (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gks421-F5">Figure 5</xref>d). We have, therefore, included an additional ranking scheme based on PMS<sub>MIN</sub> scores along with PMS<sub>MAX</sub>.

    <title>EXAMPLES</title>
    <p>PocketAnnotate pipeline can prove to be extremely useful in cases where one has to explore alternate binding sites on the protein surface. As an example, phosphofructokinase (PFK) enzyme was explored to probe into regulatory sites along with the catalytic site using PocketAnnotate pipeline. PFK is a major enzyme that takes part in glycolysis by converting fructose-6-phosphate to fructose-1,6-biphosphate. PFK is known to be regulated by many small molecules such as ATP, ADP, AMP, citrate and fructose-6-bisphosphate. Prokaryotic PFK (PDB:1MTO), known to be a homotetramer in its biologically functional form, was subjected to PocketDepth analysis (only protein query), as the regulatory sites could also be found at the interfaces. The pipeline correctly predicted all the active sites of the individual monomers and the regulatory sites through which ADP modulates the function at the interface of the subunits also. One such predicted regulatory site known to bind to ADP along with active site was correctly identified is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gks421-F6">Figure 6</xref>(a). Pyruvate kinase (PDB:1ZJH, unbound form) was also analysed for the presence of any allosteric sites, and the pipeline identified the right allosteric site modulated by fructose-bi-phosphate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gks421-F6">Figure 6</xref>b). The details of both the examples can be obtained from the example section of the web server.

    <p>An attempt was also made to analyse the protein structure with unknown function. An advance text word search of ‘unknown function’ in PDB yielded ∼3333 (as of November 2011) structures. A filter of 70% identity cutoff was used, and only the unique entities from each PDB resulting in 2155 chains were subjected to PocketAnnotate workflow till PocketMatch stage. Approximately 1837 proteins were found to have significant hits with the cutoff mentioned earlier (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://proline.biochem.iisc.ernet.in/pocketannotate/info/unknown_function.htm">http://proline.biochem.iisc.ernet.in/pocketannotate/info/unknown_function.htm</ext-link>). Selected examples are included in the example section of the web server. The results of this analysis are also available on the website. Few of the positive hits from each of the data set mentioned earlier and validation are made available for visualization in the example section of web server.</p>

    <title>CONCLUSIONS</title>
    <p>In this study, we present a pipeline for site-based function annotation of a protein structure through in-house algorithms. We believe that such a pipeline would allow us to explore protein–ligand interaction space. Such binding site-based structure annotation can also be used for genome scale structure annotations to gain useful information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gks421-B34">34</xref>). With general advances in site prediction and scoring methods, as well as an increase in the experimental protein–ligand structures, we expect that this approach will become more accurate and grow in its scope for functional annotation of proteins.</p>
