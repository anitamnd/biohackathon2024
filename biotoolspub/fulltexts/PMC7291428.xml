        <title>Background</title>
        <p id="Par1">Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) studies are used to interpret the function of disease-associated genetic risk factors. To date, most eQTL analyses have been conducted in bulk tissues, such as whole blood and tissue biopsies, which are likely to mask the cell type-context of the eQTL regulatory effects. Although this context can be investigated by generating transcriptional profiles from purified cell subpopulations, current methods to do this are labor-intensive and expensive. We introduce a new method, <italic>Decon2,</italic> as a framework for estimating cell proportions using expression profiles from bulk blood samples (Decon-cell) followed by deconvolution of cell type eQTLs (Decon-eQTL).</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>Results</title>
        <p id="Par2">The estimated cell proportions from Decon-cell agree with experimental measurements across cohorts (R ≥ 0.77). Using Decon-cell, we could predict the proportions of 34 circulating cell types for 3194 samples from a population-based cohort. Next, we identified 16,362 whole-blood eQTLs and deconvoluted cell type interaction (CTi) eQTLs using the predicted cell proportions from Decon-cell. CTi eQTLs show excellent allelic directional concordance with eQTL (≥ 96–100%) and chromatin mark QTL (≥87–92%) studies that used either purified cell subpopulations or single-cell RNA-seq, outperforming the conventional interaction effect.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>Conclusions</title>
        <p id="Par3">Decon2 provides a method to detect cell type interaction effects from bulk blood eQTLs that is useful for pinpointing the most relevant cell type for a given complex disease. Decon2 is available as an R package and Java application (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/molgenis/systemsgenetics/tree/master/Decon2">https://github.com/molgenis/systemsgenetics/tree/master/Decon2</ext-link>) and as a web tool (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.molgenis.org/deconvolution">www.molgenis.org/deconvolution</ext-link>).</p>

    <title>Background</title>
    <p id="Par11">For many of the genetic risk factors that have been associated to immune diseases by genome-wide association studies (GWAS), the molecular mechanism leading to disease remains unknown [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Most of these genetic risk variants are located in the non-coding regions of the genome, implying that they play a role in gene regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) analysis provides a way to characterize the regulatory effect of these risk factors in humans, and many eQTL studies have now been carried out using bulk tissues, for example, whole blood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. However, bulk tissues comprise many different cell types, and gene regulation is known to vary across cell types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. In recent years, efforts to describe eQTL effects in purified cell subpopulations have been carried out in specific cell types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Unfortunately, the length and cost of the study protocols have limited these studies to small sample sizes and only a few cell types. Current developments on single cell (sc) RNASeq technologies have given rise to sc-eQTLs, an approach that, although promising, is still bound to a limited number of individuals, which thereby limits the number of detectable cell type interaction (CTi) eQTLs. Nevertheless, the ability to pinpoint the CT in which a risk factor exerts an eQTL effect could help us to understand its role in disease.</p>
    <p id="Par12">Statistical approaches to detect CT effects using tissue expression profiles have mainly been developed to evaluate gene by environment interaction (GxE) terms, for example to detect CT eQTLs for myeloid and lymphoid lineages using only whole blood gene expression and by evaluating the interaction between genotype and cell proportions for neutrophils and lymphocytes in whole blood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. A second study linked eQTL genes to proxy genes through correlation; these proxy genes were then associated with intrinsic or extrinsic factors such as cell proportions or inflammation markers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. However, these efforts focused on exploiting only one GxE term, or on indirectly linking the CT proportions to given eQTL, rather than directly ascertaining the interaction between all the main cell proportions comprising the bulk tissue and genotype. Unfortunately, quantifying cell proportions, in particular rare subpopulations (total abundance ≤3% in circulating white blood cells), is expensive and time-consuming. Hence, quantifying immune cell proportions in large functional genomics cohorts is not common practice.</p>
    <p id="Par13">Here we present and validate Decon2, a computational and statistical framework that can (1) predict the proportions of known circulating immune cell subpopulations (Decon-cell), and (2) combine these predicted proportions with whole blood gene expression and genotype information to assign bulk eQTL effects into CTi eQTLs (Decon-eQTL). Our two-step framework provides an improvement over previously published methods. Unlike earlier methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], Decon-cell does not rely on any prior information about transcriptome profiles from purified cell subpopulations. It only requires quantification of the cell proportions comprising the bulk tissue, in this case whole blood. Decon-cell identifies signature genes that correlate with cell proportions in a bulk tissue. Secondly, Decon-eQTL is the first approach in which all major cell proportions (the major cell types for which the sum of proportions per sample is approximately 100%) of bulk blood tissue are incorporated into an eQTL model simultaneously. Decon-eQTL can then be used to systematically test for any significant interaction between each CT and genotype, while also controlling for the effect on expression of the other cell types.</p>
    <p id="Par14">We generated the Decon-cell predictive models using data from the 500FG cohort [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], where quantification of immune cell types was carried out using FACS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] and RNA-Seq-based bulk whole blood transcriptome profiles were available for 89 samples [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. By using a cross-validation approach, we were able to accurately predict 34 out of 73 cell subtypes using only whole blood gene expression. For validation, we applied Decon-cell to three independent cohorts (Lifelines Deep [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], <italic>n</italic> = 627; Leiden Longevity cohort [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], <italic>n</italic> = 660 and the Rotterdam Study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], <italic>n</italic> = 773) for which both blood RNA-seq and measured cell proportion data are available (neutrophils, lymphocytes and CD14+ monocytes and granulocytes). Additionally, we benchmarked Decon-cell prediction performance against two other existing methods that quantify immune cell composition using gene expression profiles from whole blood on these three independent cohorts. After showing that we can accurately predict circulating immune cell proportions, we applied Decon-cell to estimate cell proportions in 3194 individuals from the BIOS cohort [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] for whom both whole blood RNA-seq and genotypes were available. The BIOS cohort is a valuable resource for functional genomics studies where extensive characterization of the genetic component on gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] and epigenetics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] have been performed. We integrated whole blood expression and genotype information and predicted cell proportion with Decon-eQTL to deconvolute 16,362 significant whole blood <italic>cis</italic>-eQTLs top effects into CT interacting eQTLs (CTi eQTLs). These deconvoluted CTi eQTL results were comprehensively validated using transcriptome profiles from purified cell subpopulations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], eQTLs and chromatin mark QTLs from purified cell types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] and eQTLs from single-cell experiments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. We also systematically compared the performance of Decon-eQTL against the most used method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] that detect cell type eQTL effects using whole blood expression profiles.</p>

      <title>Decon-cell accurately predicts the proportions of known immune cell types</title>
      <p id="Par15">In order to assign the cell types from which an overall eQTL effect from a bulk tissue sample (e.g. whole blood) arise, we need three types of information: genotype data, tissue expression data and cell type proportions (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Here we propose a computational method that predicts the cell proportions of known immune cell types using gene signatures in whole blood expression data using a machine-learning approach. Decon-cell employs the regularized regression method elastic net [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] to define sets of signature genes for each cell type. In other words, these signatures were selected as having the best prediction power for individual cell proportions.
<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Workflow of application of Decon2 to predict cell counts followed by deconvolution of whole blood eQTLs. Using whole blood expression and FACS data of 500FG samples, Decon-cell predicts cell proportions with selected marker genes of circulating immune cell subpopulations. Validations of Decon-cell were carried out on three independent cohorts for which measurements of neutrophils/granulocytes, lymphocytes and monocytes CD14+ were available along with expression profiles of whole blood. Benchmarking of Decon-cell was performed against CIBERSORT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] and xCell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Decon-cell was applied to an independent cohort (BIOS) to predict cell counts using whole blood RNA-seq. Decon-eQTL subsequently integrates genotype and tissue expression data together with predicted cell proportions for samples in BIOS to detect cell type eQTLs. We validated Decon-eQTL using multiple independent sources, including expression profiles of purified cell subpopulations, eQTLs and chromatin mark QTLs (cmQTLs) from purified neutrophils, monocytes CD14+ and CD4+ T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], and single-cell eQTL results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Benchmarking of Decon-eQTL was carried out for comparison with a previously reported methods that detected cell type–eQTL effects using whole blood expression data, i.e. the Westra et al.

      <p id="Par16">There are 89 samples in the 500FG cohort with both whole blood RNA-seq and quantification of 73 immune cell subpopulations by FACS. This data was used to build the prediction models for estimating cell subpopulations by Decon-cell. First, we determined which of the 73 cell subpopulations could be reliably predicted by Decon-cell. A within-cohort cross-validation strategy was employed by randomly dividing 89 samples (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) into training and test sets (70 and 30% of the samples, respectively). After generating a model using each training set, we applied the prediction models of each cell type to the samples in the test sets. We compared the predicted and measured cell proportion for each cell type using Spearman correlation coefficients to evaluate the prediction performance. We repeated this process 100 times and then used the mean of the correlation coefficient in all 100 iterations to evaluate the prediction performance. We were able to predict 34 out of 73 cell subpopulations using whole blood gene expression data at a threshold of mean R ≥ 0.5 across all 100 iterations (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a, Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>, Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">1</xref>). The number of signature genes selected in our models for predicting cell proportions varied across the cell types, ranging from 2 to 217 signature genes (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>A, Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">1</xref>), and they were independent of the average abundance of these cell types in whole blood (R = 0.02, Spearman correlation coefficient, Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>A). In particular, cell types that are abundant in whole blood (granulocytes-neutrophils, CD4+ T-cells and CD14+ monocytes) were predicted with high confidence (correlation between predicted and measured values, R ≥ 0.73). Remarkably, we were also able to predict a number of less abundant cell subpopulations, including NK cells, CD8+ T-cells, non-NK T-cells (CD3- CD56-), CD4+ central memory, CD4+ effector memory T-cells and regulatory T-cells (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>A), as determined by FACS. Cell types with a low prediction performance (R &lt; 0.5) are those that have few signature genes with expression levels that correlate sufficiently (i.e. absolute R &lt; 0.3) with the measured cell proportions in whole blood (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>B-C). For each of the 34 predictable cell types, we used Decon-cell to build models for predicting their cell counts using all 89 samples from the 500FG cohort. These models were applied to 3194 samples in an independent cohort (BIOS cohort) to predict cell proportions of circulating immune cell types for the subsequent deconvolution of eQTL effects.

      <p id="Par17">In addition to within-cohort validation, we tested our cell proportion models using three independent cohorts (LLDeep, <italic>n</italic> = 627; LLS, <italic>n</italic> = 660; RS, <italic>n</italic> = 773) in which cell type abundances were quantified using a Coulter counter for neutrophils (granulocytes for RS), lymphocytes and CD14+ monocytes (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b, Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>A-B). In LLDeep, we were able to accurately predict these three cell types with Spearman correlation coefficients of R = 0.73, R = 0.89 and R = 0.73, respectively. For LLS and RS, the prediction performance was similarly accurate for neutrophils and lymphocytes (R = 0.76 for neutrophils, R = 0.84 for lymphocytes), but less so for monocytes (R = 0.50 for CD14+ monocytes and proportions in LLS and R = 0.74 for granulocytes, R = 0.83 for lymphocytes and R = 0.28 for CD14+ monocytes in RS).</p>
      <p id="Par18">Next, in order to benchmark Decon-cell, we compared its prediction performance against two other existing tools that quantify the abundance of known immune cell types using bulk whole blood expression profiles: CIBERSORT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] and xCell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. We obtained the predicted proportions by CIBERSORT and enrichment scores of circulating immune cells by xCell for the samples in three different cohorts: LLDeep, LLS and RS (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref>A-B). For each cell type, Decon-cell outperforms CIBERSORT and xCell (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>B). The scatterplots of predicted vs measured values (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref> A, Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref> A-B) further demonstrate that the better performance of Decon-cell is not due to cell proportion outliers.</p>
      <p id="Par19">Finally, we evaluated whether the signature genes showed CT expression in their relevant purified cell types using BLUEPRINT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] RNA-seq data from the purified cell subpopulations. Here we focused on cell types with more than three samples measured, which included neutrophils, CD14+ monocytes, CD4+ T-cells and B-cells. The signature genes showed overall higher expression in their relevant cell subpopulations compared to other cell subpopulations. Interestingly, the signature genes were also able to cluster the samples of the relevant CT using unsupervised hierarchical clustering (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5</xref>A-D). Together, our results demonstrate that the gene signatures identified by Decon-cell using only whole blood gene expression data are predictive for the proportions of circulating immune cell subpopulations.</p>
      <p id="Par20">To facilitate the cell proportion prediction of new samples using whole blood RNA-seq, we have made the Decon-cell prediction models and gene signatures available in an R package (Decon-cell) and as a web tool (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.molgenis.org/deconvolution">www.molgenis.org/deconvolution</ext-link>). These two implementations allow users to pre-process their RNA-seq expression counts and estimate cell proportions using the pre-established models for 34 cell types in whole blood. In addition, the Decon-cell R package allows users to generate Decon-cell-like gene signatures to predict their own cell proportions, which requires the input of bulk expression profiles and cell proportions to generate new Decon-cell predictive models.</p>

    <sec id="Sec4">
      <title>Decon-eQTL identifies which cell types contribute to the whole blood eQTL effect</title>
      <p id="Par21">As we know, eQTL analysis using whole blood bulk expression data fails to distinguish between a general eQTL present in all cell types and an effect mainly found in a subset of the cell types. We therefore propose a new approach, called Decon-eQTL, that assigns the overall bulk eQTL into CT effects. Using the cell proportions in whole blood, it is possible to formally test if the genetic effect is interacting with the cell proportions. More explicitly, we include both the genotype and all major CT proportions of interest in a linear model, and systematically test if there is a significant interaction effect between genotype and each of the cell proportions in the variation of gene expression in whole blood. At the same time, the model used by Decon-eQTL controls for the effects of the remaining cell types on gene expression. In this way, whole blood expression data, genotypes and (predicted) cell proportions can be integrated to assign a CTi effect from a bulk eQTL (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).</p>
      <p id="Par22">We applied Decon-eQTL to 3198 samples (BIOS cohort) with transcriptome levels (RNA-seq), genotype information and cell proportions predicted by Decon-cell. Whole blood <italic>cis</italic>-eQTL mapping yielded 16,362 whole blood eQTLs (false discovery rate (FDR) ≤ 0.05). For each of these whole blood <italic>cis</italic>-eQTLs, we applied Decon-eQTL with a focus on 6 major cell subpopulations: granulocytes, CD14+ monocytes, CD4+ T-cells, CD8+ T-cells, B-cells and NK cells. These cell types were selected because the sum of their relative percentages was close to 100% and none of these cell type pairs had an absolute correlation coefficient R ≥ 0.75. Decon-eQTL computationally assigned 4139 CTi eQTLs from these subpopulations, reflecting 3812 genes and 3650 SNPs. 25% of the whole blood eQTLs have a significant (FDR ≤ 0.05) CTi eQTL effect given Decon-eQTL. The majority (31%) of the total CTi eQTL effects detected were found to be associated to granulocyte proportions, possibly because granulocytes comprise ~ 70% of circulating white blood cells (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a). The majority (74%) of CTi eQTLs detected by our method were assigned to a single cell type (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6</xref>A). Similarly, we find almost no sharing between cell types in single-cell eQTLs from 112 individuals. However, it should be noted that these eQTLs are likely not exclusively present for this particular cell type in biology, but that the statistical power given our sample size was sufficient to detect the interaction effects that we describe as CTi eQTL in this particular cell type. Decon-eQTL was only able to find a few cases of sharing of CTi eQTLs between cell types, likely due to a lack of power of the interaction model. An example of such a shared CTi eQTLs can be seen for the <italic>NOD2 gene</italic>, where Decon-eQTL detected a strong granulocyte-eQTL effect alongside a smaller opposite effect in CD14+ monocytes. This opposite effect has also been previously described in eQTL studies on purified CD14+ monocytes and neutrophils [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. These results demonstrate that the effects of cell proportions on gene expression should be taken into account when interpreting eQTLs derived from bulk tissues.

      <title>Decon-eQTL prioritizes genes to relevant cell types</title>
      <p id="Par23">CTi eQTL genes are expected to have higher expression levels in their relevant cell types, and their expression in whole blood should therefore be correlated with the proportions of these relevant cell types. To test this, we evaluated if the expression levels of the CTi eQTL genes detected in the BIOS cohort were correlated with their relevant cell proportions, and compared this to the correlation with non-relevant cell types. We calculated the Spearman correlation coefficients between the expression of the identified CTi eQTL genes and the measured cell proportions in the 500FG cohort (<italic>n</italic> = 89). We then compared the correlation coefficients we obtained here with those between expression and the remaining cell proportions. For each of the six cell subpopulations we evaluated in Decon-eQTL, their CTi eQTL genes had a significantly higher correlation with their relevant cell subpopulation than with other cell types (T-test, <italic>p</italic>-value &lt; 0.05) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>b). As such, this result shows a significant association between CTi eQTL genes and the proportion of their relevant CT in an independent cohort.</p>
      <p id="Par24">Next, we evaluated whether the significant CTi eQTL genes were over-expressed in their relevant cell subpopulation compared to eQTL genes that were found to be non-significant CTi eQTLs for the same cell type. For this purpose, we made use of the purified neutrophil, CD14+ monocyte, CD4+ T-cell and B-cell RNA-seq data from the BLUEPRINT dataset. We include these cell types because they were the only ones with more than three samples measured. For each of the four cell types, we observed that the expression of CT eQTL genes detected by Decon-eQTL was significantly higher (T-test, <italic>p</italic>-value ≤0.05) than the expression of non-significant Decon-eQTL genes (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>a). We also observed that the deconvoluted eQTL genes from granulocytes showed a relatively wider range of variation than the CT eQTL genes from the other three subpopulations. We hypothesized that this could be explained by the fact that granulocytes comprise ~ 70% of the cell composition in whole blood, thus giving us the power to detect eQTL for lowly expressed genes in granulocytes. This is partly supported by the observation that the variation of expression in whole blood of granulocyte CTi eQTL genes was significantly greater than for those CTi eQTL genes deconvoluted to the other five cell subpopulations (F-test, p-value ≤0.05, Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">7</xref>).

      <p id="Par25">Furthermore, by using publicly available transcriptome profiles (GSE78840 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]) of purified NK cells and CD4+ T cells, we assessed if the differentially expressed genes across the two cell types were enriched for eGenes of deconvoluted CT eQTLs.

      <title>CT eQTLs identified by Decon-eQTL in whole blood are replicated in purified cell eQTL datasets</title>
      <p id="Par27">To validate the CT eQTLs defined by Decon-eQTL, we utilized eQTLs identified from purified neutrophils, CD4+ T-cells and CD14+ monocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. We first compared the absolute effect sizes of eQTLs from purified cells that are also significantly deconvoluted CTi eQTLs to the effect sizes of eQTLs from purified cells that are also non-significant deconvoluted CTi eQTLs for this cell type. For all three cell populations, effect sizes in our deconvoluted CTi eQTLs were significantly higher than the effect sizes of eQTLs without a significant CTi eQTL (Wilcoxon test, p-value ≤0.05, Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>c). Next, we assessed the specificity of our deconvoluted CTi eQTLs by evaluating CTi eQTL effect sizes in non-relevant cell subpopulations. For example, we compared the effect sizes of deconvoluted granulocyte CTi eQTLs against those with non-significant deconvoluted granulocyte CTi eQTLs using the effect sizes of purified CD4+ T-cell eQTLs. Notably, we observed no statistically significant differences using effect sizes from non-relevant cell subpopulations (see off-diagonal comparisons in Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">8</xref>), which further supports the biological relevance of our deconvoluted CTi eQTLs. However, when comparing the effect sizes in the purified eQTLs of only the CTi eQTLs that were significant across all three available cell subpopulations, we were not able to find significant differences (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>d). For example, the effect size of neutrophil CTi eQTLs is the same across neutrophils, monocytes CD14+ and CD4+ T cells<italic>.</italic></p>
      <p id="Par28">To further demonstrate that the CTi eQTLs assigned by Decon-eQTL are biologically meaningful, we made use of the K27AC and K4ME1 epigenetic QTLs characterized in purified neutrophils, CD4+ T-cells and monocytes CD14+ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. In a similar fashion to the above comparison of effect sizes with purified eQTLs, we compared the absolute effect sizes from both K27AC and K4ME1 QTLs from eQTLs for which Decon-eQTL detects a significant CTi effect to the effect sizes of the other whole blood eQTLs. Here we observed that for corresponding cell types, e.g. evaluating granulocyte CT eQTLs in K27AC QTLs from purified neutrophils, the distribution of the absolute effect sizes is significantly higher for the chromatin mark QTLs (cmQTLs) than for non-significant CT eQTLs, which provides epigenetic evidence that our method is able to correctly assign cell type eQTL effects, as shown in the diagonal comparisons for both K27AC QTLS (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">9</xref>) and K4ME1 QTLs (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">10</xref>). Notably, for the non-relevant cell subpopulations, we observed that only one comparison (granulocytes vs. CD14+ monocytes) shows statistically significant higher effect sizes for K27AC QTLs and K4ME1 QTLs. For the rest of the non-relevant comparisons (shown in the off-diagonal of both Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">9</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">10</xref>), there are no statistically significant differences. Comparing the eQTL effect sizes in purified KC27AC and K4ME1 QTLs of only the significant CTi eQTLs across all three available cell subpopulations shows that the effect sizes from the relevant cell type are significantly stronger for all pairings except those between granulocytes and CD14+ monocytes (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">11</xref>).</p>
      <p id="Par29">In addition to the comparison of effect sizes, we compared the allelic concordance between deconvoluted eQTLs and eQTLs from purified cell subtypes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. For each available cell type (neutrophils, CD14+ monocytes, and CD4+ T cells), we evaluated whether the direction of the eQTL effect on deconvoluted CT eQTLs was the same as the one observed from purified cell subpopulations. The allelic concordance between the deconvoluted eQTLs and purified eQTLs was high across cell types: 99% for granulocyte eQTLs (compared to neutrophil eQTLs), 96% for CD14+ monocytes eQTLs and 99% for CD4+ T cells (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>a). These rates of allelic concordance are significantly higher for granulocyte and CD4+ T-cell CTi eQTLs compared to those between whole blood eQTLs and eQTLs from purified cell subpopulations (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>b; Neutrophils, Fisher exact <italic>p</italic>-value = 3.91 × 10<sup>6</sup>; CD4+ T cells Fisher exact p-value = 0.005), whereas the allelic concordance for deconvoluted CD14+ monocyte eQTLs is the same as for whole blood eQTLs and purified CD14+ monocyte eQTLs (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>b). We also compared the allelic concordance of deconvoluted CTi eQTLs of specific cell types against the eQTLs of non-relevant purified subpopulations. Interestingly, the allelic concordance across non-relevant cell subtypes is consistently lower (off-diagonal Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">12</xref>, Bonferroni-corrected Fisher exact p-value &lt; 0.0001 for all comparisons). Higher allelic concordance across cell types was seen between deconvoluted granulocyte eQTLs and CD14+ monocyte eQTLs with a 95% allelic concordance, which shows that the direction of effect is often shared between related cell types.

These concordance rates are significantly higher than the ones between the whole blood eQTLs and K27AC QTLs from purified cell subpopulations (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">14</xref>) for neutrophils (Fisher exact test p-value = 9.06 × 10<sup>− 14</sup>), CD14+ monocytes (Fisher exact test p-value = 3.33 × 10<sup>− 4</sup>), CD4+ T cells (Fisher exact test p-value = 8.64 × 10<sup>− 9</sup>). Moreover, we noticed a consistent decrease in allelic concordance rates when assessing the concordance of CT eQTLs in K27AC QTLs of non-relevant cell subpopulations (off-diagonal comparisons, Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">13</xref>).

      <title>Decon-QTL outperforms conventional interaction method</title>
      <p id="Par32">To our knowledge, our approach is the first to model the effect of multiple components of bulk blood RNA-seq simultaneously in an attempt to fully deconvolute gene expression levels into more precise cell type x genotype effects. Previous studies have used an interaction effect between genotype and cell proportions of one specific cell type to detect cell type eQTL effects using whole blood gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], or used the correlation of the eQTL effect with cell type proxy genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p>
      <p id="Par33">The Westra <italic>et al</italic> method has often been used to detect cell type eQTL effects using bulk expression data and cell proportions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. In brief, it focuses on the effect of the GxE interaction (where E represents cell proportions) to explain the variation in gene expression and only incorporates one cell type at a time. To properly compare Decon-eQTL with the ‘Westra method’, we applied both methods to the BIOS cohort and detected CT eQTLs for the six cell subpopulations. Replication of CT eQTLs identified by the Westra method was done as described above for Decon-eQTL. Here we observed that the eGenes (i.e. genes with eQTLs) detected by the Westra method show significantly higher expression for granulocytes (<italic>p</italic> = 3.0 × 10<sup>− 12</sup>, observed in purified neutrophils) and CD4+ T cells (<italic>p</italic> = 5.0 × 10<sup>− 13</sup>) and B cells (<italic>p</italic> = 5.1 × 10<sup>− 11</sup>), but not for CD14+ monocytes (<italic>p</italic> = 1, see Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">15</xref>A). Next, we found that the distribution of effect sizes in eQTLs from purified cells is significantly higher for the CT eQTLs detected using the Westra method when compared to the rest of the whole blood eQTLs (<italic>p</italic> = 2.2 × 10<sup>− 47</sup>, <italic>p</italic> = 9.6 × 10<sup>− 08</sup> and p = 1 × 10<sup>− 47</sup> for neutrophils, CD14+ monocytes and CD4+ T cells, respectively; boxed-diagonal comparisons in Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">15</xref>B), showing similar results to the ones from Decon-eQTL (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">8</xref>).</p>
      <p id="Par34">When we compared the allelic concordance rates between the direction of effects given by the interaction term from the Westra method to those found in eQTLs from purified cell subpopulations, we observed that the allelic concordances for granulocytes eQTLs (99%, evaluated in neutrophils, <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05) and CD4+ T cells 93% (p &gt; 0.05) (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">16</xref>) are comparable to those observed for Decon-eQTL (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>a). Conversely, the allelic concordance rate for CD14+ monocytes is only 62%, significantly lower than the results from Decon-eQTL (96%, <italic>p</italic> = 0.001). Finally, for granulocytes, CD4+ T cell eQTLs and monocytes, we overlapped the results from Westra method and Decon-eQTL with the eQTLs from purified cell types (Chen et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]) (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">17</xref>). For all three cell types, we found that Decon-eQTL is able to detect a larger number of eQTLs. For neutrophils, the Westra method has a higher replication rate (Fisher <italic>p</italic>-value = 0.002). For CD14+ monocytes, both methods had the same replication rate (Fisher p-value = 0.737). For CD4+ T-cells, Decon-eQTL had a better replication rate (p-value = 7.47 × 10<sup>− 12</sup>).</p>
      <p id="Par35">Finally, we compared the difference in allelic concordance with sc-eQTLs. The overall allelic concordance of Decon-eQTL CTi QTLs with sc-eQTLs (96.42%, Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>a) is higher than that achieved by the Westra model (<italic>p</italic> = 1.235 × 10<sup>− 08</sup>), where we observed an overall allelic concordance of 84.67% (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>b). For both non-classical monocytes (Fisher p-value = 0.045) and CD4+ T-cells (Fisher p-value = 7.896 × 10<sup>− 07</sup>), Decon-eQTL has a significantly better allelic concordance. For CD8+ T-cells (Fisher p-value = 0.230), classical monocytes (Fisher p-value = 0.0513), B-cells (Fisher p-value = 0.055) and NK cells (Fisher p-value = 0.242), there is no significant difference. Nevertheless, Decon-eQTL shows a higher allelic concordance for NK cells, classical monocytes, and CD8+ T cells (93.8% vs 83.9, 96.2% vs 89.2, and 100% vs 93.5% respectively), while for B cells it has lower concordance (33% vs 100%).</p>
      <p id="Par36">Overall, these results demonstrate that Decon-eQTL is able to detect more CTi eQTLs that can be replicated in purified eQTL dataset than previously reported methods, especially in less abundant cell types such as CD14+ monocytes. However, the detection of interaction effects between genotype and cell proportions in order to dissect bulk (in this case whole blood) expression data and CTi eQTLs remains an area of great opportunity that could still be explored, particularly given the constantly increasing number of samples present in functional genomic cohorts and the growing numbers of purified and sc-eQTL datasets that can be used for validation.</p>

    <title>Discussion</title>
    <p id="Par37">We have developed a novel statistical framework, Decon2, that predicts the proportions of known immune cell subtypes using gene expression levels from whole blood (Decon-cell). These predicted cell proportions can then be used together with genotype information and expression data to deconvolute a whole-blood eQTL effect into cell type interacting effects (Decon-eQTL). Using a set of samples with both whole blood RNA-seq data and cell frequencies of 73 cell subpopulations, we demonstrated that Decon-cell was able to predict 34 independent cell subpopulations. The performance of Decon-cell has been validated in multiple independent cohorts and benchmarked with existing methods. The Decon-cell models were then applied to a cohort of 3189 samples for which whole blood RNA-seq data was available, resulting in predicted cell counts for these samples. By integrating bulk expression data, genotype and predicted cell counts of the BIOS cohort, Decon-eQTL was able to dissect whole blood eQTL effect into CTi eQTLs without purifying immune cell subpopulations. The results of Decon-eQTL were then validated again using several independent data types: 1) eQTLs from purified cell subpopulations, 2) chromatin QTLs of purified cells, 3) gene expression from purified cell types and 4) eQTLs derived from single-cell protocols. Compared with existing methods, Decon-eQTL consistently shows superior performance. To sum up, the proposed framework is useful for (re)-analyzing both existing and new bulk blood tissue datasets in order to detect CTi eQTL effects and can be applied and tested on other tissues once cell count proportions become available. Cataloging and further interpreting the role of CTi eQTLs will improve our understanding of the functional role of the SNPs associated with complex diseases at the level of specific cell subtypes.</p>
    <p id="Par38">The main advantage of our Decon-cell method for predicting cell proportions is that it does not rely on the gene expression measured in purified cell subtypes when defining signature gene sets. Moreover, our method does not require the definition of marker genes based on their differential expression compared to other cell subpopulations, unlike previously reported methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The signature genes defined by Decon-cell are determined using a completely unsupervised approach that applies regularized regression to select the optimal combination of genes to accurately predict a certain circulating cell proportion. The majority of these marker genes are differentially expressed across purified cell subpopulations, but not all. Nevertheless, these signature gene sets are still correlated to the cell proportions in whole blood. In summary, we have shown that Decon-cell can accurately predict the proportions of circulating immune cell subpopulations in three independent cohorts and that it out-performs previously reported methods within these cohorts.</p>
    <p id="Par39">Our Decon-eQTL method for detecting a CTi eQTL effect with bulk blood tissue expression data is, to our knowledge, the first attempt to simultaneously model whole blood gene expression profiles into its major components. In contrast to a previous method where single cell type (G x E) effects were evaluated one at a time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>], Decon-eQTL incorporates all the major cell proportions simultaneously to better dissect the overall genetic effect of gene expression signal into cell subpopulation effects. We have shown that CTi eQTL genes found with Decon-eQTL have higher expression and higher effect sizes in purified neutrophils, CD14+ monocytes and CD4+ T-cells than do non-CTi genes, and we find significantly higher allelic concordance for two out of four tested cell types with sc-eQTLs than with a conventional interaction model (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>a and b). Moreover, we have also shown the biological relevance of the deconvoluted CTi eQTLs by validating our results on cmQTLs where CTi eQTLs have significantly higher effect sizes and allelic concordance rates are significantly higher than those of whole blood eQTLs. Finally, we have also demonstrated that Decon-eQTL can replicate sc-eQTLs derived from scRNA-seq data, showing a higher allelic concordance with sc-eQTLs than when using only whole-blood eQTL effects.</p>
    <p id="Par40">There are also limitations to our method. The CTi eQTLs detected by Decon-eQTL tend to be eQTL exclusive for the specific CT, suggesting that the CT with the strongest eQTL effect was selected by Decon-eQTL. This is likely due to the partial collinearity present between the CT proportions included in the model (as shown by their correlation structure in Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">18</xref>A-B). Thus, the genetic effect of one cell type might be masked by another CT with a correlated cell proportion. The highest correlation coefficient among cell types included in the model was 0.75 (between granulocytes and B cells). Therefore, deconvoluting CTi eQTLs for partially correlated cell proportions could lead to false negative results for cell types with relatively weaker eQTL effects.</p>
    <p id="Par41">In our model, we included the six major blood cell types, but there are many more cell types available for which our method is not able to detect a CTi eQTL estimate. Furthermore, we only tested Decon-eQTL using genome-wide whole blood cis-eQTLs main effects. Such eQTL effects are very likely shared across multiple cell types, however we are only able to detect its interaction with only one cell type due to statistical power and co-linearity (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6</xref>A), which is also seen in the sc-eQTLs with limited (112) samples (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6</xref>B). Nevertheless, this does not imply that the CTi eQTL are exclusive for, or only present in, that specific cell type, as we observe in Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>d, where the effect sizes of the significant CTi eQTLs in purified subpopulations are not significantly different across all three purified cell subpopulations. Yet this difference in the effect-size of CTi eQTLs between relevant and non-relevant cell types can be seen in histone modification QTLs (as shown in Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">11</xref>), likely due to the cell type-specificity of epigenetic marks. Lastly, Decon2 has only been tested in whole blood, where large numbers of samples are available, and therefore it is not known how it will perform in other tissues.</p>
    <p id="Par42">The proposed framework of Decon2 is generic for predicting cell subpopulations in bulk tissues (Decon-cell) and re-distributing the overall eQTL effect into cell types (Decon-eQTL). Both methods have been implemented in freely available software. In both the R package and the user interface-based webtool, we provide the models for predicting cell subpopulation in whole blood that were constructed and validated in this work so that interested users can estimate immune cell subpopulations in whole blood in healthy people of western European ethnicity, as our models were built using a Dutch cohort (500FG).</p>

  <sec id="Sec10">
    <title>Conclusion</title>
    <p id="Par43">In summary, Decon2 is a computational method that can accurately assign CT effects in whole blood functional genomic cohorts. It can be applied to any dataset for which genotypes and expression data is available and could potentially aid in understanding the molecular effects of genetic risk factors associated with complex diseases at the cell-subpopulation level. Our method makes it possible to create CT gene regulatory networks that could explain the different effects that each CT has on a complex disease in a cost-efficient way. Since Decon2 only requires gene expression and genotype information to deconvolute bulk blood eQTLs into CTi eQTLs, it is possible to re-analyze existing bulk blood RNA-seq data for which genotypes are also available. In this scenario, we would use Decon-cell to predict cell proportions in whole blood and obtain CT information on many more eQTLs through an increase in sample size. In addition to whole blood, the methods behind Decon2 can potentially be generalized to use transcriptional profiles derived from any other type of bulk tissue, such as biopsies from tumors or other solid tissues implicated in complex disease etiology. However, the method has not yet been tested in other tissues. Our methods can hence aid in the detection of genetic effects on gene expression in rare cell subpopulations in bulk tissues.</p>

      <p id="Par54">Decon2 is a statistical framework for estimating cell counts using molecular profiling such as expression data from heterogeneous samples (Decon-cell) and consecutive deconvolution of expression quantitative trait loci (Decon-eQTL) into each cell subpopulation. To predict cell proportion levels using Decon-cell built in models, it’s only input is a matrix As input Decon-cell takes a table of normalized gene expression counts, with samples as columns and genes as rows, and outputs a table of predicted cell count proportions for cell types that were included in the training model.. Decon-cell also enables the user to generate its own custom models, for which it requires a matrix of gene expression to train the model and a matrix of measured cell proportions; this will output a list with one specific model for each of the cell types included. A matrixtable of normalized gene expression levelscounts, a matrixtable of predicted or measured cell count proportions, and a matrixtable of genotype dosages (0 for homozygous reference, 1 for heterozygous, and 2 of homozygous alternative), lastlyand a table with the SNP + gene combinations to test, are used as input for Decon-eQTL, and this outputs for each SNP + gene combination the beta and p-value of the cell-type dependent eQTL effect.

Since we are assuming a linear relationship between total gene expression and the levels of expression generated by each of the cell types composing a bulk tissue, the cell proportions are scaled to sum to 100% such that the sum of the effect of the cell types equals the effect in whole blood. Here we assume that the true sum of the cell counts should be very close to 100% of the total PBMC count, which is why we include the 6 cell types that together form the top hierarchy given the gating strategy used to quantify the cell subpopulations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The genotype main effect is not included in the model because the sum of the genotype effect per cell type should approximate the main effect.</p>
      <p id="Par63">Because the contribution of each of the cell types to expression level <italic>y</italic> cannot be negative, we constrain the terms of the model to be positive using Non-Negative Least Squares [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>] to fit the parameters to the measured expression levels. However, if the allele that has a negative effect on gene expression is coded as 2, the best fit would have a negative interaction term, which would be set to 0. To address this, we want the allele that causes a positive effect on gene expression to always be coded as 2. However, the effect of an allele can be different per cell type, therefore the coding of the SNP should also be different per cell type. We therefore run the model multiple times, swapping the genotype encoding for one of the interaction terms each time. The encoding that gives the lowest R-squared is then chosen as the optimal genotype encoding. For the encoding, we limit the number of genotypes that have an opposite genotypic encoding to a maximum of one interaction term, as we have observed that this leads to no significant difference when compared to using all possible configurations and limits the number of models that have to be run from k<sup>2</sup> to (2*k) + 2.</p>

              <p><bold>Additional file 1 : Supplementary Figure 1:</bold> Prediction performance of Decon-cell within 500FG: The Y-axis represents the 73 immune cell types quantified by FACS in the 500FG cohort. The bar plot on the left panel shows the mean Prediction Performance (Spearman correlation coefficient between predicted and measured cells across 100-fold cross validations). On the right panel, box plots represent the distribution of the Prediction Performance within 100 iterations of the cross validations. A cutoff of mean Prediction Performance ≥0.5 was applied to define predictable cell types (green). <bold>Supplementary Figure 2.</bold> Signature genes selected for prediction of cell proportions by Decon-cell: <bold>(A)</bold> Total number of marker genes (genes selected in ≥80% of all models in the 100 iterations) per predictable cell type. Different colors indicate different subpopulations. <bold>(B)</bold> The number of genes significantly correlated with cell counts (Spearman correlation, adjusted <italic>P</italic> ≤ 0.05) (y-axis) shows the total number of significantly correlated genes, while the x-axis shows the prediction performance (x-axis). <bold>(C)</bold> Distributions of the total number of “strongly” correlated genes (absolute Spearman correlation ≥0.3) between predictable and unpredictable cell subpopulations. <bold>Supplementary Figure 3.</bold> Comparison of prediction performance between Decon-cell and other existing methods. (A) Performance of Decon-cell: the measured (x axis) and predicted cell proportions (y-axis) were compared for neutrophils (given by granulocytes in 500FG), lymphocytes and monocytes CD14+ and granulocytes in three independent cohorts (shown by row, from top to bottom: LLDeep (<italic>n</italic> = 627); LLS (<italic>n</italic> = 660); RS (<italic>n</italic> = 773)). (B) Comparison of prediction performance for Decon-cell, CIBERSORT and xCell in three independent cohorts for a total of 4 major immune subpopulations. <bold>Supplementary Figure 4</bold>. Prediction performance of xCell and CIBERSORT in three independent Dutch populations (LLDeep, n = 627; LLS, n = 660; RS, n = 773)<bold>.</bold> (A) Scatter plots showing the measured cell proportions of circulating immune cells on the x-axis and the xCell enrichment score on the y-axis. (B) Scatter plots showing the measured cell proportions of circulating immune cells on the x-axis and the predicted cell proportions given by CIBERSORT) on the y-axis. <bold>Supplementary Figure 5.</bold> Expression of marker genes selected by Decon-cell. Expression levels (scaled, log2(TPM + 1)) of signature genes in the data in three purified cell subpopulations: CD4+ T cells <bold>(A)</bold>, neutrophils/granulocytes <bold>(B)</bold> and monocytes <bold>(C)</bold> in the data from BLUEPRINT. Cell subpopulations are indicated in different colors by columns. Correlation of each of the signature genes and the cell subpopulation percentage in the 500FG cohort is shown on by the green bar at the left-hand side of heatmap figure, i.e. darker green corresponds to higher correlations. <bold>Supplementary Figure 6.</bold> Many of the CTi eQTL are cell type exclusive. Colored bar plot on the left shows the total number of significant CTi eQTLs in whole blood eQTLs (as also shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a). Gray bar plot shows the total number of eQTLs shared across the possible combinations of the six cell subpopulations under study. <bold>Supplementary Figure 7.</bold> Variation of gene expression across samples for deconvoluted cell-type eQTLs genes in whole blood. Granulocyte eQTL genes show significantly higher variance across the BIOS samples (F test <italic>p</italic>-value ≤0.05) compared to those from monocytes, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, B cells and NK cells. <bold>Supplementary Figure 8</bold>. Validation of CTi eQTLs using effect sizes of eQTLs from purified cells. CTi eQTLs (FDR ≤ 0.05) from the BIOS cohort show a significantly bigger effect size in purified cell eQTLs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] from their relevant cell subtype as compared to other whole blood eQTLs (diagonal boxed comparisons). The off-diagonal comparisons show that these eQTL genes are specific to a cell subpopulation because the differences in effect sizes are non-significant in all but one case (CD4+ T cell eQTL genes in monocyte-derived eQTLs). <bold>Supplementary Figure 9</bold>. Validation of CTi eQTLs using effect sizes of K27AC QTLs from purified cells. CTi eQTLs (FDR ≤ 0.05) show a significantly bigger effect size for K27AC QTLs that have peaks located in the promoter region of the eGenes from their relevant cell subtype compared to the rest of the significant whole blood eQTLs (diagonal boxed comparisons). The off-diagonal comparisons show that these eQTL genes are specific to a cell subtype because the differences in effect sizes are non-significant in all but the comparisons across Neutrophils and Monocytes (CD14+). <bold>Supplementary Figure 10</bold>. Validation of CTi eQTLs using effect sizes of K4ME1 QTLs from purified cells. CTi eQTLs (FDR ≤ 0.05) show a significantly bigger effect size for K4ME1 QTLs (where the eGenes is the closest gene tagging the K4ME1 QTLs peak) from their relevant cell subtype compared to the rest of the significant whole blood eQTLs (diagonal boxed comparisons). The off-diagonal comparisons show that these eQTL genes are specific to a cell subtype because the differences in effect sizes are non-significant in all but the comparisons between neutrophils and monocytes (CD14+). <bold>Supplementary Figure 11</bold>. Validation of CTi eQTLs using allelic concordance with eQTLs results from purified cells. CTi eQTLs (FDR ≤ 0.05) show high allelic concordance with their respective purified cell eQTLs. Top row shows allelic concordance of deconvoluted granulocyte eQTLs (all in green) against neutrophils, monocytes and CD4+ T cells. Second row shows deconvoluted monocyte eQTLs against purified cell eQTLs in the same order as the top row. Bottom row shows the same comparisons as for deconvoluted CD4+ eQTLs. Allelic concordance of the off-diagonal (comparing CTi eQLTs with non-relevant cell types) show a consistent decrease in allelic concordance. <italic>P</italic>-values are Bonferroni-corrected Fisher exact tests between groups. <bold>Supplementary Figure 12</bold>. Validation of CTi eQTLs using allelic concordance with K27AC results from purified cells. CTi eQTLs (FDR ≤ 0.05) show a high allelic concordance in their respective purified cell K27AC QTLs. Top row shows allelic concordance of deconvoluted granulocyte eQTLs (all in green) against neutrophils, monocytes and CD4+ T cells derived from K27AC QTLs. Second row shows deconvoluted monocyte eQTLs (all in orange) against purified cell K27AC QTLs in the same order as top row. Bottom row shows the same comparisons as for deconvoluted CD4+ eQTLs (all in purple). Allelic concordance of the off-diagonal (comparing deconvoluted eQTLs with non-relevant cell types) show a consistent decrease in allelic concordance when compared to the relevant cell type comparisons. P-values are Bonferroni-corrected Fisher exact tests between groups. <bold>Supplementary Figure 13</bold>. Allelic concordance between whole blood eQTLs and K27AC QTLs for purified neutrophils, CD14+ monocytes and CD4+ T cells. <bold>Supplementary Figure 14.</bold> Comparison of whole blood eQTLs with eQTLs from single cell RNA-seq Whole blood eQTLs show 89% allelic concordance for significant eQTLs derived from scRNA-seq data, comprising monocytes CD14+, B cells, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells and NK cells. <bold>Supplementary Figure</bold> 15 Validation of cell type eQTLs detected in the BIOS cohort using the Westra et al method: (A) Expression of eGenes in purified cell subpopulations from BLUEPRINT (green for granulocyte eQTL genes showing expression for purified neutrophils; orange for monocytes; purple for CD4+ T cells; pink for B cells). (B) CT eQTLs detected by the Westra method show a significantly larger effect size in purified cell eQTLs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] as compared to the rest of the whole blood eQTLs. Boxed-diagonal shows the comparisons with relevant cell types where the effect differences are stronger. <bold>Supplementary Figure</bold> 16 Allelic concordance rates of cell type eQTLs detected using the Westra et al method and eQTLs from purified cells. Top row shows allelic concordance of granulocyte CT eQTLs against neutrophils, monocytes and CD4+ T cells. Second row shows CT monocyte eQTLs against purified cell eQTLs in the same order as top row. Bottom row shows the same comparisons for CT CD4+ eQTLs. <bold>Supplementary Figure</bold> 17 Comparison of Decon-eQTL with Westra et al method. Overlap of CT eQTLs detected with Decon-eQTL and the Westra et al method and those found to be significant in purified cell subpopulations for granulocyte QTLs (A), CD4+ T cells (B), and monocytes (C). <bold>Supplementary Figure 18</bold> Distribution and correlation among circulating cell proportions. (A) Scatter plots show the correlations between different cell subpopulations in 89 samples from 500FG. Blue line indicates a fitted linear model. Diagonal plots depict the overall density distribution per cell type. Upper right triangle shows the Pearson correlation coefficient for each pairwise comparison. (B) Correlations between different cell subpopulations in the BIOS cohort obtained by prediction using Decon-cell. <bold>Supplementary Figure 19.</bold>General overview of the Decon2 method. (A) Gene expression can be used to predict cell count percentages of cell counts that are already trained in the Decon-Cell model. Additionally, the model can be trained on different cell types if expression data and cell count proportions are available. (B) Decon-eQTL models the cell type dependent eQTL effect using expression, genotype, and measured cell count proportions or, if unavailable, predicted cell count proportions.</p>
