      <title>Abstract</title>
      <p>DNA methylation is widespread amongst eukaryotes and prokaryotes to modulate gene expression and confer viral resistance. 5-Methylcytosine (m5C) methylation has been described in genomes of a large fraction of bacterial species as part of restriction-modification systems, each composed of a methyltransferase and cognate restriction enzyme. Methylases are site-specific and target sequences vary across organisms. High-throughput methods, such as bisulfite-sequencing can identify m5C at base resolution but require specialized library preparations and single molecule, real-time (SMRT) sequencing usually misses m5C. Here, we present a new method called RIMS-seq (rapid identification of methylase specificity) to simultaneously sequence bacterial genomes and determine m5C methylase specificities using a simple experimental protocol that closely resembles the DNA-seq protocol for Illumina. Importantly, the resulting sequencing quality is identical to DNA-seq, enabling RIMS-seq to substitute standard sequencing of bacterial genomes. Applied to bacteria and synthetic mixed communities, RIMS-seq reveals new methylase specificities, supporting routine study of m5C methylation while sequencing new genomes.</p>

    <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
    <p>DNA modifications catalysed by DNA methyltransferases are considered to be the most abundant form of epigenetic modification in genomes of both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. In prokaryotes, DNA methylation has been mainly described as part of the sequence-specific restriction modification system (RM), a bacterial immune system to resist invasion of foreign DNA (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). As such, profiling methylation patterns gives insight into the selective pressures driving evolution of their genomes.</p>
    <p>Around 90% of bacterial genomes contain at least one of the three common forms of DNA methylation: 5-methylcytosine (m5C), N4-methylcytosine (m4C) and N6-methyladenine (m6A)) (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Contrary to eukaryotes where the position of the m5C methylation is variable and subject to epigenetic states, bacterial methylations tend to be constitutively present at specific sites across the genome. These sites are defined by the methylase specificity and, in the case of RM systems, tend to be fully methylated to avoid cuts by the cognate restriction enzyme. The methylase recognition specificities typically vary from four to eight nucleotides and are often, but not always, palindromic (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>).</p>
    <p>PacBio single molecule, real-time (SMRT) sequencing has been instrumental in the identification of methylase specificity largely because, in addition to providing long read sequencing of bacterial genomes, m6A and m4C can easily be detected using the characteristic interpulse duration (IPD) of those modified bases (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Thus, a single run on PacBio allows for both the sequencing and assembly of unknown bacterial genomes and the determination of m6A and m4C methylase specificities. However, because the signal associated with m5C bases is weaker than for m6A or m4C, the IPD ratio of m5C is very similar to the IPD of unmodified cytosine. Thus, PacBio sequencing misses the m5C methylase activities (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>) unless the 5-methylcytosine detection is enhanced by treating the library with Ten-eleven translocation enzyme (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). A recent study uses a holistic kinetic model to identify m5C using PacBio reads (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Nonetheless, methylation can only be identified in CpG context, restricting the use of this approach to organisms such as human, for which methylation is almost exclusively in CpG sites.</p>
    <p>Consequently, the identification of m5C requires specialized methods such as bisulfite sequencing, enzyme-based techniques such as EM-seq (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>) or hybrid techniques such as TAPS-seq (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Recently, MFRE-Seq has been developed to identify m5C methylase specificities in bacteria (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). MFRE-Seq uses a modification-dependent endonuclease that generates a double-stranded DNA break at methylated sites, allowing the identification of m5C for the subset of sites conforming to the recognition sites of the MFRE enzymes. Unlike PacBio sequencing, these specialized methods do not provide the dual original sequence and methylation readouts from a single experiment.</p>
    <p>Recently, m5C in the CpG context has been identified (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>) and a signal for methylation can be observed at known methylated sites in bacteria using Nanopore sequencing (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). So far no technique permits, from a single experiment, the dual sequencing of genomes and the <italic toggle="yes">de novo</italic> determination of m5C methylase specificity for the non-CpG contexts typically found in bacteria.</p>
    <p>Herein, we describe a novel approach called RIMS-seq to simultaneously sequence bacterial genomes and globally profile m5C methylase specificity using a protocol that closely resembles the standard Illumina DNA-seq with a single, additional step. RIMS-seq shows comparable sequencing quality as DNA-seq and accurately identifies methylase specificities. Applied to characterized strains or novel isolates, RIMS-seq <italic toggle="yes">de novo</italic> identifies novel activities without the need for a reference genome and permits the assembly of the bacterial genome at metrics comparable to standard shotgun sequencing.</p>

      <title>Principle of RIMS-seq</title>
      <p>Spontaneous deamination of cytosine (C) leading to uracil (U) and of m5C leading to thymine (T) are examples of common damage found in DNA. <italic toggle="yes">In-vitro</italic>, this damage is often undesirable as it can interfere with sequencing. The type of interference during sequencing depends on whether the deamination occurs on C or m5C. U blocks the passage of high-fidelity polymerases typically used in library preparation protocols, preventing the amplification and sequencing of U-containing DNA fragments. Conversely, DNA harboring T derived from m5C deamination can be normally amplified but results in C to T errors (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). This distinction between blocking and mutagenic damage forms the basis of the RIMS-seq method, allowing the identification of methylase specificity based on an elevated number of reads containing C to T transitions specifically at methylated sites (Figure <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">1A</xref>). To increase the rate of m5C deamination, the DNA is subjected to a heat-alkaline treatment which has been previously demonstrated to elevate the rate of both C and m5C deamination with m5C having a 1.5–3 times higher deamination rate than for C (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). This treatment is aimed at inducing a level of deamination large enough to detect the m5C methylase specificity without affecting the sequencing quality. For this reason, the deamination levels typically obtained with RIMS-seq does not permit the quantitative measurement of methylation at each genomic site but rather provides a global methylation signal characteristic of the methylase specificity.</p>

          <p>(<bold>A</bold>) Principle of RIMS-seq. Deamination of cytidine leads to a blocking damage while deamination of m5C leads to a mutagenic C to T damage only present on the first read (R1) of paired-end reads in standard Illumina sequencing. Thus, an increase of C to T errors in R1 in specific contexts is indicative of m5C. (<bold>B</bold>) The workflow of RIMS-seq is equivalent to a regular library preparation for Illumina DNA-seq with an extra step of limited alkaline deamination at 60°C. This step can be done immediately after adaptor ligation and does not require additional cleaning steps.

The C to T imbalance between R1 and R2 is indicative of deamination of m5C and increases with heat-alkaline treatment time.

      </fig>
      <p>Illumina paired-end sequencing allows both ends of a DNA fragment to be sequenced, generating a forward read (R1) and reverse read (R2). Resulting from m5C deamination, R1 has the C to T read variants while R2 has the reverse-complement G to A variant. This difference leads to an overall imbalance of C to T variants between R1 and R2 (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>) (see also <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S1</xref> for explanation). Thus, sequence contexts for which the C to T read variants are imbalanced in R1 compared to R2 correspond to m5C methylase specificity(ies). Because of the limited deamination rate, RIMS-seq takes advantage of the collective signal at all sites to define methylase specificity. Because C to T imbalance can be observed at nucleotide resolution, RIMS-seq identifies at base resolution which of the cytosine within the motif is methylated.</p>
      <p>The experimental steps for RIMS-seq essentially follow the standard library preparation for Illumina sequencing with an extra deamination step. Briefly, the bacterial genomic DNA is fragmented, and adaptors are ligated to the ends of DNA fragments (Figure <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">1B</xref> and Materials and Methods). Between the ligation step and the amplification step, an alkaline heat treatment step is added to increase the rate of deamination. Only un-deaminated DNA or DNA containing deaminated m5C can be amplified and sequenced.</p>

      <title>Validation of RIMS-seq</title>
      <sec id="SEC3-2-1">
        <title>Optimization of the heat alkaline deamination step</title>
        <p>We first evaluated the conditions to maximize the deamination of m5C while minimizing other DNA damage. For this we used bacteriophage Xp12 genomic DNA that contains exclusively m5C instead of C (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>) to measure the m5C deamination rates in various contexts.</p>
        <p>To estimate the overall deamination rate of m5C, we quantified the imbalance of C to T read variants between R1 and R2 for 0, 10 and 30 min, 1 h, 2 h, 3 h, 5 h and 14 h of heat alkaline treatment (Figure <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">1C</xref>). We observed an imbalance as early as 10 min with a 3.7-fold increase of C to T read variants in R1 compared to R2. The increase is linear with time with a maximum of 212-fold increase of C to T read variants in R1 compared to R2 after 14 h of heat alkaline treatment (Figure <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">1D</xref>). Next, we quantified the deamination rate at all Nm5CN sequence contexts with N being A, T, C or G and show an increase of C to T variants in R1 in all contexts (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S2A</xref>). Together, these results show that a measurable deamination rate can be achieved in as soon as 10 min of heat alkaline deamination and that deamination efficiency is similar in all sequence contexts.</p>
        <p>To estimate the non-specific damage to the DNA leading to unwanted sequencing errors, we quantified possible imbalances for other variant types (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S2B</xref>). We found that G to T variants show imbalance in all the conditions investigated, likely the result of oxidative damage resulting from sonication, a common step in library preparation between RIMS-seq and DNA-seq (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Interestingly, the imbalance is reduced in RIMS-seq, disappearing almost completely after 14 h of heat alkaline treatment (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S2B</xref>). This result suggests that this treatment either converts 8-oxoG back to G or to another modification that ultimately blocks the polymerase from amplifying 8-oxoG-containing fragments. To properly address the disappearance of G to T variants due to oxidative damage in RIMS-seq, we designed an oligonucleotide containing a single 8-oxoG. Using LC–MS intact mass, we identified a strand break directly 5′ and 3′ of the 8-oxoG that is specific to oxidized G under heat alkaline treatments (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary text 1</xref> and <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S3</xref>). Thus, the heat-alkaline treatment performed in RIMS-seq induced strand breaks at oxidative damage sites, preventing the amplification of 8-oxoG-containing fragments and de-facto decreasing the frequency of G to T in the RIMS-seq libraries.</p>
        <p>A slight elevation of G to C and T to C read variants can be observed in RIMS-seq compared to DNA-seq but this damage is of low frequency and therefore is not expected to notably affect the sequencing performance QC of RIMS-seq.</p>
        <p>We performed QC metrics and assemblies of Xp12 for all the alkaline-heat treatment conditions, including a control DNA-seq. The overall sequencing performances were assessed in terms of insert size, GC bias and genome coverage. Similar results were observed between RIMS-seq and the DNA-seq control at all treatment times, indicating that the RIMS-seq heat-alkaline treatment does not affect the quality of the libraries (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S4</xref>).</p>
        <p>We also evaluated the quality of the assemblies compared to the Xp12 reference genome and found that all conditions lead to a single contig corresponding to essentially the entire genome with very few mismatches (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table S1</xref>). These results suggest that the heat-alkaline treatment does not affect the assembly quality, raising the possibility of using RIMS-seq for simultaneous <italic toggle="yes">de novo</italic> genome assembly and methylase specificity identification. We found that a 3-h treatment provides a good compromise between the deamination rate (resulting in ∼0.3% of m5C showing C to T transition) and duration of the experiment. We found that longer incubation times (up to 14 h) increased the deamination rate by up to 1% and decided this is a slight sensitivity increase compared to the additional experimental time required.</p>

        <title>RIMS-seq is able to distinguish methylated versus unmethylated motifs in <italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic></title>
        <p>To validate the application of RIMS-seq to bacterial genomes, we sequenced dcm+ (K12) and dcm- (BL21) <italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic> strains. In K12, the DNA cytosine methyltransferase <italic toggle="yes">dcm</italic> methylates cytosine at C<underline>C</underline>WGG sites (<underline>C</underline> = m5C, W = A or T) and is responsible for all m5C methylation in this strain (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). <italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic> BL21 has no known m5C methylation. Heat/alkaline treatments were performed at three time points (10 min, 1 h and 3 h). In addition, we performed a control experiment corresponding to the standard DNA-seq. Resulting libraries were paired-end sequenced using Illumina and mapped to their corresponding genomes (Methods).</p>
        <p>For comparison, all datasets were downsampled to 5 million reads corresponding to 200× coverage of the <italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic> genome and instances of high confidence C to T variants (<italic toggle="yes">Q</italic> score &gt; 35) on either R1 or R2 were identified. As expected, control DNA-seq experiments show comparable numbers of C to T read variants between R1 and R2, indicating true C to T variants or errors during amplification and sequencing (Figure <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2A</xref>). On the other hand, the overall number of C to T read variants in R1 is progressively elevated for 10 min, 1 h and 3 h of heat-alkaline treatment of the <italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic> K12 samples with an overall 4-fold increase after 3 htreatment compared to no treatment; heat-alkaline treatments did not increase the rate of C to T read variants in R2 (Figure <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2A</xref>). We anticipate that the elevation of the <italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic> K12 C to T read variants in R1 is due to deamination of m5C. In this case, the elevation should be specifically found in Cs in the context of C<underline>C</underline>WGG (with the underlined C corresponding to the base under consideration). To demonstrate this, we calculated the fraction of C to T read variants in C<underline>C</underline>WGG compared to other contexts. We observed a large elevation of the C to T read variants in the C<underline>C</underline>AGG and C<underline>C</underline>TGG contexts for K12 (Figure <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2B</xref>).

Thus, this C to T read variant elevation is specific to the <italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic> K12 strain subjected to heat-alkaline treatments, consistent with deamination detectable only on methylated sites.

        <p>Next, we assessed whether the difference in the C to T read variant context between R1 and R2 at the C<underline>C</underline>WGG motif provides a strong enough signal to be discernible over the background noise. For this, we calculated the fraction of C to T read variants in C<underline>C</underline>WGG and <underline>C</underline>CWGG compared to all the other N<underline>C</underline>NNN and <underline>C</underline>NNNN contexts, respectively. After 3 h of heat-alkaline treatment, the fraction of C to T read variants in a C<underline>C</underline>WGG context increased, rising from only 1.9% in regular DNA-seq to ∼25% of all the C to T variants. This increase is only observable in R1 of the K12 strain (Figure <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2C</xref>). Conversely, no increase can be observed in a <underline>C</underline>CWGG context for which the C to T variant rate at the first C is assessed (Figure <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2C</xref>). Thus, RIMS-seq identified the second C as the one bearing the methylation, consistent with the well described dcm methylation of <italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic> K12 (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>) (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>), highlighting the ability of RIMS-seq to identify m5C methylation at base resolution within the methylated motif.</p>

We found a signal consistent with the dcm methylase specificity in K12 RIMS-seq samples at 1 and 3 h of heat alkaline treatment (Figure <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2D</xref>) demonstrating that it is possible to identify methylase specificities in genomic sequence subject to as little as 1 h of alkaline treatment.

        <p>In order for RIMS-seq to identify methylase specificities <italic toggle="yes">de novo</italic>, we devised an analysis pipeline based on MoSDi (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>) to find sequence motif(s) that are over-represented around C to T transitions in R1 reads (Figure <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3A</xref>, analysis pipeline available at <ext-link xlink:href="https://github.com/Ettwiller/RIMS-seq" ext-link-type="uri">https://github.com/Ettwiller/RIMS-seq</ext-link>). In brief, the pipeline extracts the sequence context at each C to T read variant in R1 (foreground) and R2 (background). MoSDi identifies the highest over-represented motif in the foreground sequences compared to the background sequences. To accommodate the presence of multiple methylases in the same host, the first motif is subsequently masked in both the foreground and background sequences and the pipeline is run again to find the second highest over-represented motif and so on until no significant motifs can be found (see Materials and Methods for details).

More specifically, we evaluated if the reads generated using RIMS-seq can be used for both identifying methylase specificities and generating an assembly of comparable quality to DNA-seq.</p>
        <p>For this, we performed RIMS-seq on <italic toggle="yes">A. calcoaceticus</italic> ATCC 49823 genomic DNA as described above as well as a control DNA-seq experiment for which the alkaline treatment was replaced by 3 h incubation in TE (DNA-seq(+3H)). We compared the <italic toggle="yes">de novo</italic> assembly obtained from the reads generated by the DNA-seq(+3H) and the <italic toggle="yes">de novo</italic> assembly obtained from the reads generated by RIMS-seq (see Materials and Methods). In brief, the alkaline treatment did not alter the important metrics for assembly quality such as the rate of mismatches and N50 demonstrating that the elevated C to T variant rate at methylated sites is not high enough to cause assembly errors (Figure <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3B</xref>).</p>
        <p>We then proceeded to map the RIMS-seq reads to the assembly and motifs were identified using the RIMS-seq <italic toggle="yes">de novo</italic> motif discovery pipeline.

      <title>RIMS-seq can be applied to a variety of RM systems</title>
      <p>Methylases targets are usually palindromic sequences between 4 nt and 8 nt, and a single bacterium often possesses several, distinct MTase activities (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). Next, we tested the general applicability of RIMS-seq and the <italic toggle="yes">de novo</italic> motif discovery pipeline using bacterial genomic DNA from our in-house collections of strains.</p>
      <p>For some bacterial strains, the methylase recognition specificities have been previously experimentally characterized. In all of those strains, RIMS-seq confirms the specificities and identifies the methylated cytosine at base resolution (Table <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). We have tested the identification of 4-mers motifs such as GAT<underline>C</underline>, <underline>C</underline>GCG (<italic toggle="yes">Acinetobacter calcoaceticus</italic>) and G<underline>C</underline>GC (<italic toggle="yes">Haemophilus parahaemolyticus</italic>) up to 8-mers motifs such as AC<underline>C</underline>GCACT and AGTG<underline>C</underline>GGT (<italic toggle="yes">Haemophilus influenzae</italic>). Motifs can be palindromic or non-palindromic (Table <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">1</xref> and <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table S3</xref>). In the latter case, RIMS-seq defines non-palindromic motifs at strand resolution. For example, RIMS-seq identifies methylation at two non-palindromic motifs A<underline>C</underline>CTGC as well as its reverse complement G<underline>C</underline>AGGT in the <italic toggle="yes">Bacillus fusiformis</italic> strain (Table <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).</p>
      <p>A number of RM systems have been expressed in other hosts such as <italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic> for biotechnological applications. For the methylase M.HhaI recognizing G<underline>C</underline>GC (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>), we performed RIMS-seq and a control DNA-seq(+3H) on both the native strain (<italic toggle="yes">Haemophilus parahaemolyticus</italic> ATCC 10014) and in <italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic> K12 expressing the recombinant version of M.HhaI. Interestingly, we found that the <italic toggle="yes">de novo</italic> RIMS-seq analysis algorithm identifies R<underline>C</underline>GC (with R being either A or G) for the recombinant strain and G<underline>C</underline>GC for the native strain (Figure <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">4A</xref>). Conversely, no notable elevation of C to T read variants are observed at ACGC for the native strain (Figure <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">4B</xref>), confirming the <italic toggle="yes">de novo</italic> motif discovery results from the analysis pipeline. Collectively, these results suggest that the recombinant methylase shows star activity, notably in the context of A<underline>C</underline>GC, that is not found in the native strain. We hypothesize that the star activity is the result of the over-expression of the methylase in <italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic> K12. Interestingly, A<underline>C</underline>GC is not a palindrome motif and consequently the star activity results in hemi-methylation of the A<underline>C</underline>GC sites and not the GCGT motif.</p>

      <title>RIMS-seq can be applied to microbial communities</title>
      <p>We assessed whether RIMS-seq can be applied to mixed microbial communities using synthetic gut and skin microbiomes from ATCC containing 12 and 6 bacterial species, respectively. We also complemented the RIMS-seq experiment with the control experiment DNA-seq(+3H) and a bisulfite treatment to validate the RIMS-seq findings. Reads were mapped to their respective microbiome reference genomes (Materials and Methods). For the gut microbiome we found a mapping rate (properly paired only) of 95.79%, 95.77% and 66.2% for RIMS-seq, DNA-seq and bisulfite-seq respectively. Concerning the skin microbiome, 85.89%, 85.35% and 54.9% of reads were mapped for RIMS-seq, DNA-seq and bisulfite-seq respectively. The low mapping rate for bisulfite-seq is a known challenge as the reduction of the alphabet to A, G, T generates ambiguous mapping (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>).</p>
      <p>To use RIMS-seq as an equivalent to DNA-seq for mixed community applications, RIMS-seq should produce sequencing quality metrics that are similar to standard DNA-seq, especially on the estimation of species relative abundances. We therefore compared RIMS-seq sequencing performances with DNA-seq(+3H) and bisulfite sequencing. We found that bisulfite sequencing elevates abundances of AT-rich species such as <italic toggle="yes">Clostridioides difficile</italic> (71% AT), <italic toggle="yes">Enterococcus faecalis</italic> (63% AT) and <italic toggle="yes">Fusobacterium nucleatum</italic> (73% AT) (Figure <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">5A</xref>, <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S5</xref>).

This over-estimation of an AT rich genome by bisulfite is a known bias of bisulfite sequencing and relates to damage at cytosine bases (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). Conversely, we found that the species abundances are similar between DNA-seq(+3H) and RIMS-seq (abundance ratios between 0.8 and 1.2) indicating that RIMS-seq can be used to quantitatively estimate microbial composition.</p>

        <title>RIMS-seq identifies known and novel methylase specificities in synthetic microbial communities</title>
        <p>Overall, we found motifs for 6 out of the 12 gut microbiome species and five out of the six skin microbiome species (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table S3</xref>). The motifs range from four to eight nucleotides long and 70% are palindromic. Interestingly, we found an unknown palindromic motif GG<underline>C</underline>SGCC (with S being either C or G) from <italic toggle="yes">Micrococcus luteus</italic> (NC_012803.1) in the skin community. To our knowledge, this is the first time this 7nt motif is identified, showing the potential of RIMS-seq to identify new methylase specificities. Results obtained with RIMS-seq were also validated using bisulfite sequencing. RIMS-seq identified two motifs in <italic toggle="yes">Helicobacter pylori</italic> from the ATCC synthetic gut microbiome: G<underline>C</underline>GC as well as an additional non-palindromic motif <underline>C</underline>CTC that was identified by the bisulfite analysis pipeline as <underline>C</underline>YTC with Y being either C or T. The <underline>C</underline>CTC motif is very common in <italic toggle="yes">Helicobacter pylori</italic>s species, it has been described to be modified at m5C on one strand, while modified at m6A on the other strand (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). In order to confirm the RIMS-seq motif, we investigated the bisulfite-seq data and compared the methylation level in cytosines present in the <underline>C</underline>CTC context versus cytosines in any other context. We see a methylation level above 90% at the cytosines in the <underline>C</underline>CTC context confirming the existence of this methylated motif in <italic toggle="yes">Helicobacter pylori</italic> (Figure <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">5D</xref>). Interestingly, m4C methylation in <italic toggle="yes">Helicobacter pylori</italic> has been shown to also occur at T<underline>C</underline>TTC (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>), resulting in the composite motif CYTC (T<underline>C</underline>TTC and N<underline>C</underline>CTC) found in the bisulfite data. Contrary to bisulfite, RIMS-seq does not identify m4C methylation (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>), hence the identification of the <underline>C</underline>CTC motif instead.</p>
        <p>Also, interestingly, bisulfite-seq results indicate that the A<underline>C</underline>GT motif in <italic toggle="yes">Acinetobacter johnsonii</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">Streptococcus mitis</italic> from the ATCC synthetic skin microbiome are not fully methylated (Figure <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">5B</xref>). Most of the sites in <italic toggle="yes">Acinetobacter johnsonii</italic> show a methylation of about 10% while in <italic toggle="yes">Streptococcus mitis</italic>, the average methylation per site is 23% (Figure <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">5C</xref>). These results highlight that despite the low methylation levels, RIMS-seq is able to detect the A<underline>C</underline>GT motif at high significance (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic>-value &lt; 1e<sup>−100</sup>). We took advantage of the fact that Streptococcus mitis has two methylated motifs, ACGT and GCNGC with an average methylation per site at 23% and 91% respectively (Figure <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">5C</xref>) to evaluate the sequencing depth required for RIMS-seq to <italic toggle="yes">de-novo</italic> identify both motifs. As expected, the fully methylated G<underline>C</underline>NGC motif is found using 4 times fewer sequencing reads than the A<underline>C</underline>GT motif, with a required 1 million and 4 million mapped reads respectively (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S6A and B</xref>).</p>

    <title>DISCUSSION</title>
    <p>In this study, we developed RIMS-seq, a sequencing method to simultaneously obtain high quality genomic sequences and discover m5C methylase specificity(ies) in bacteria using a single library preparation. The simplicity of the procedure makes RIMS-seq a cost effective and time saving method with only an additional 3 h sodium hydroxide incubation and an additional column-based cleaning step. Theoretically, the cleaning step can be avoided if a small volume of the library is used for the amplification step, but we have not tested this procedure. By increasing the sodium hydroxide concentration to 0.5M or even 1M, the incubation time can be reduced to 30 min.</p>
    <p>Due to the limited deamination rate, RIMS-seq is equivalent to short read DNA-seq in terms of sequencing quality. Sequencing QC metrics such as coverage, GC content and mapping rate are similar for RIMS-seq and DNA-seq. Thus, RIMS-seq can be used for applications such as, but not limited to, shotgun sequencing, genome assembly and estimation of species composition of complex microbial communities. This dual aspect of RIMS-seq is analogous to SMRT sequencing for which methylation is inferred from the IPD ratio. We showed that both PacBio and RIMS-seq can be complementary with the ability to obtain a complete methylome: m6A and m4C methylase specificities can be obtained from SMRT sequencing while m5C methylase specificity can be obtained from RIMS-seq. Combining both sequencing technologies also allows for a hybrid assembly strategy resulting in closed reference genomes of high sequencing accuracy.</p>
    <p>We applied RIMS-seq to several bacteria and identified a variety of methylation motifs, ranging from 4 nt to 8 nt long, palindromic and non-palindromic. Some of these motifs were identified for the first time, demonstrating the potential of the technology to discover new methylase specificities, from known as well as from unknown genomes. We also validated that RIMS-seq can identify multiple methylase specificities from a synthetic microbial community and estimate species abundances. However, RIMS-seq has caveats similar to metagenomics sequencing when applied to study natural microbial communities. Closely related species are likely to co-exist and assigning the motif to the correct species can be challenging. Furthermore, single nucleotide polymorphisms found in microbial communities may confound the identification of the C to T deamination, increasing the background noise for the detection of motifs. Finally, species in microbiomes are unevenly represented which can cause RIMS-seq to identify motifs only in the most abundant species.</p>
    <p>Because RIMS-seq is based on a limited deamination, it requires the combined signal over many reads to be large enough to effectively identify methylase specificity. For the vast majority of the methylases in RM systems, methylation is present at enough sites across the genome for RIMS-seq to determine their specificities. Nonetheless, bacterial methylases can be involved in other processes such as, but not limited to, DNA mismatch repair (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>), gene regulation (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>) and sporulation (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>) and the recognition sites may not necessarily be fully methylated. Partially methylated sites can be found using RIMS-seq but more analysis needs to be done to evaluate how pervasive methylation needs to be to provide a RIMS-seq signal. In other cases, methylated motifs are too specific or under purifying selection, resulting in just a handful of sites in the genome. In these cases, RIMS-seq signals can only be obtained with enough read coverage to compensate for the scarcity of those sites. While the methylase specificities are of great interest in bacteria due to their diversity in recognition sequences, applying RIMS-seq to humans would lead to the identification of the already well-described CpG context. In this case, other technologies such as EM-seq or bisulfite-seq are more appropriate as they enable the precise genomic location to be obtained.</p>
    <p>In summary, RIMS-seq is a new technology allowing the simultaneous investigation of both the genomic sequence and the methylation in prokaryotes. Because this technique is easy to implement and shows similar sequencing metrics to DNA-seq, RIMS-seq has the potential to substitute DNA-seq for microbial studies.</p>
