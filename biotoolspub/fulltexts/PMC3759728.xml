    <abstract>
      <p>DNA methylation plays key roles in diverse biological processes such as X chromosome inactivation, transposable element repression, genomic imprinting, and tissue-specific gene expression. Sequencing-based DNA methylation profiling provides an unprecedented opportunity to map and compare complete DNA methylomes. This includes one of the most widely applied technologies for measuring DNA methylation: methylated DNA immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (MeDIP-seq), coupled with a complementary method, methylation-sensitive restriction enzyme sequencing (MRE-seq). A computational approach that integrates data from these two different but complementary assays and predicts methylation differences between samples has been unavailable. Here, we present a novel integrative statistical framework M&amp;M (for integration of MeDIP-seq and MRE-seq) that dynamically scales, normalizes, and combines MeDIP-seq and MRE-seq data to detect differentially methylated regions. Using sample-matched whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) as a gold standard, we demonstrate superior accuracy and reproducibility of M&amp;M compared to existing analytical methods for MeDIP-seq data alone. M&amp;M leverages the complementary nature of MeDIP-seq and MRE-seq data to allow rapid comparative analysis between whole methylomes at a fraction of the cost of WGBS. Comprehensive analysis of nineteen human DNA methylomes with M&amp;M reveals distinct DNA methylation patterns among different tissue types, cell types, and individuals, potentially underscoring divergent epigenetic regulation at different scales of phenotypic diversity. We find that differential DNA methylation at enhancer elements, with concurrent changes in histone modifications and transcription factor binding, is common at the cell, tissue, and individual levels, whereas promoter methylation is more prominent in reinforcing fundamental tissue identities.</p>

  <p>The haploid human genome contains ∼28 million CpGs that exist in methylated, hydroxymethylated, or unmethylated states. The methylation status of cytosines in CpGs influences protein–DNA interactions and chromatin structure and stability, and consequently plays a vital role in the regulation of biological processes such as transcription, X chromosome inactivation, genomic imprinting, host defense against endogenous parasitic sequences, and embryonic development, as well as possibly playing a role in learning and memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B89">Watt and Molloy 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">Boyes and Bird 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">Khulan et al. 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B83">Suzuki and Bird 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">Laird 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">Day and Sweatt 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">Jones 2012</xref>). Recent genome-wide studies revealed that DNA methylation patterns in mammals are tissue-specific (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">Eckhardt et al. 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">Khulan et al. 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">Kitamura et al. 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">Illingworth et al. 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">Maunakea et al. 2010</xref>), as has been reported for individual genes. However, our current understanding of the regulatory role of tissue-specific DNA methylation remains incomplete. Until recently, this has been limited by our ability to comprehensively and accurately assess the genomic distribution of tissue-specific DNA methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">Laird 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">Bock 2012</xref>) and by the lack of methylome maps of many human tissues and primary cell types.</p>
  <p>Sequencing-based DNA methylation profiling methods provide an opportunity to map complete DNA methylomes. These technologies include whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS, MethylC-seq [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">Cokus et al. 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">Lister et al. 2009</xref>] or BS-seq [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">Laurent et al. 2010</xref>]), reduced-representation bisulfite-sequencing (RRBS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">Meissner et al. 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">2008</xref>), enrichment-based methods (MeDIP-seq [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B90">Weber et al. 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">Maunakea et al. 2010</xref>], MBD-seq [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B76">Serre et al. 2009</xref>]), and methylation-sensitive restriction enzyme based methods (HELP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B84">Suzuki and Greally 2010</xref>], MRE-seq [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">Maunakea et al. 2010</xref>]). These methods yield largely concordant results but differ significantly in the extent of genomic CpG coverage, resolution, quantitative accuracy, and cost (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">Bock et al. 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">Harris et al. 2010</xref>). For example, WGBS-based methods produce the most comprehensive and high-resolution DNA methylome maps, but typically require sequencing to 30× coverage which is still expensive for the routine analysis of many samples, particularly those with a large methylome (e.g., human). Additionally, bisulfite-based methods, including WGBS and RRBS, conflate methylcytosine (mC) and hydroxymethylcytosine (hmC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">Huang et al. 2010</xref>) unless combined with additional experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">Booth et al. 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B98">Yu et al. 2012</xref>).</p>
  <p>Because MeDIP-seq generates cost-effective and whole-genome methylation data, it is currently a widely used sequencing-based method for whole-methylome analysis. MeDIP-seq relies on an anti-methylcytidine antibody to immunoprecipitate methylcytosine-containing randomly sheared genomic DNA fragments. Therefore, MeDIP-seq read density is proportional to the DNA methylation level in a given region. The anti-methylcytidine antibody used in MeDIP does not bind hmC, although DNA fragments with both mC and hmC could be immunoprecipitated in this protocol. Importantly, local methylated CpG density also influences MeDIP enrichment and must be accounted for in analyzing MeDIP data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B67">Pelizzola et al. 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">Laird 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B73">Robinson et al. 2010</xref>). Several computational tools have been developed for analyzing MeDIP data using a CpG coupling factor to normalize MeDIP signal across regions with differing mCpG densities. These include Batman (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">Down et al. 2008</xref>), which implements a Bayesian deconvolution strategy, and MEDIPS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">Chavez et al. 2010</xref>), which produces similar results as Batman but with higher computational efficiency.</p>
  <p>MRE-seq is a complementary approach to MeDIP-seq that identifies unmethylated CpG sites in the restriction sites for multiple methylation-sensitive restriction enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">Harris et al. 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">Maunakea et al. 2010</xref>). By using simple heuristics, we demonstrated that the combination of these two methods showed promise in identifying differentially methylated regions (DMRs) as well as intermediate or monoallelic methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">Harris et al. 2010</xref>). Here, we further explore and leverage the complementary nature of MeDIP-seq and MRE-seq by integrating them in a statistical framework. Our approach is based on the principle that all observed genome-wide measurements (MeDIP-seq, MRE-seq, WGBS, etc.) are derived from methylation states of the sample. We infer methylation states from the observed data, which are sequencing reads aligned to the reference genome. However, all current approaches to assessing DNA methylation have their own inherent errors and biases. Because MeDIP-seq and MRE-seq are independent, complementary measurements of the same methylation states, our confidence in inferring methylation states should increase when results from these two methods are integrated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B105">(Stevens et al. 2013)</xref>. For example, a decrease of MeDIP-seq signal could reflect a biological event (we infer that this region is demethylated) or could be a methodological artifact; but if it is corroborated by an increase of MRE-seq signal, then the inference of demethylation is much more likely to be accurate. Thus, integrating MeDIP-seq and MRE-seq is expected to improve our ability to detect DMRs accurately.</p>
  <p>Here, we describe a novel statistical framework which we call “M&amp;M” (for integration of MeDIP-seq and MRE-seq) that detects DMRs. M&amp;M explicitly models the relationship between DNA methylation level, CpG content, and expected MeDIP and MRE reads in any given genomic context. By analyzing WGBS, MeDIP-seq, and MRE-seq data for the same DNA samples, we show that M&amp;M outperforms MEDIPS in detecting DMRs. We applied M&amp;M to 19 human samples representing nine cell types from four tissues (embryonic stem cells, breast, blood, and brain) which we assayed with MeDIP-seq and MRE-seq. Our results revealed a large, definitive panel of known and mostly novel tissue type-, cell type-, and individual-specific DNA methylation differences. Consistent with expectations, we identified enrichment of DMRs in promoter regions of genes with tissue-specific functions. Importantly, we identified a large number of DMRs that were undermethylated in tissues where the same local region also harbored enhancer chromatin signatures. These enhancer-marked DMRs comprised 30% of the tissue-specific DMRs, &gt;70% of the cell type-specific DMRs, and &gt;40% of the individual-specific DMR landscape.</p>

      <title>Summary of the M&amp;M algorithm</title>
      <p>Differentially methylated regions (DMRs) are defined as any genomic region where the overall CpG methylation levels are statistically significantly different between cell populations of two samples being compared. The M&amp;M algorithm identifies DMRs by computing a probability score for the difference in DNA methylation for any given genomic region based on observed MeDIP-seq and MRE-seq measurements. We made several simple assumptions and definitions. First, we only considered CpG methylation and made the reasonable assumption that all signals obtained from MeDIP-seq and MRE-seq are the result of CpG methylation. We note that methylation of cytosines in the non-CpG context (i.e., CHG and CHH) is rare in somatic cells but is more common in embryonic stem cells, albeit at low levels at any given site, and is associated with highly methylated CpGs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">Lister et al. 2009</xref>). The biological significance of CHG and CHH methylation in mammalian cells is yet to be determined. Our statistical model is general enough to incorporate non-CpG cytosine methylation, but to facilitate comparisons with existing tools, we only considered CpG methylation in this study. Second, we assumed that MeDIP-seq signal is proportional to the number of methylated CpGs in any given region. This assumption was made by previously published tools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B67">Pelizzola et al. 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">Chavez et al. 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">Maunakea et al. 2010</xref>), and we confirmed that the rule, in general, holds (Supplemental Fig. S1A). Third, we assumed that MRE-seq signal is proportional to the number of unmethylated CpGs at the enzyme recognition sites (defined as MRE sites) (Supplemental Fig. S1B). We further assumed that, within the same region of interest, methylation levels of CpGs in MRE sites reflect levels of nearby CpGs that are not within the MRE sites. Finally, we defined methylation level (μ) as the proportion of methylated CpGs versus total CpGs in a given region. Thus, observed MeDIP-seq and MRE-seq data become a function of methylation level, CpG content, and MRE site content of a given genomic region. MeDIP-seq signal and MRE-seq signal are related by the methylation level, μ, of the region, with their expectations proportional to μ and (1−μ), respectively. When comparing two samples in the same genomic region, we are testing the null hypothesis that methylation levels are the same between the samples. This hypothesis is conditioned on the observed MeDIP-seq and MRE-seq data, given the CpG content and MRE-site content; CpG and MRE-site content are fixed for any specific genomic region when SNP, mutation, or copy number differences are not considered. When genetic variation data is available for the sample, corrections can be made to reflect known variation. To better formulate the problem, we illustrate the algorithm by taking a window-based approach and partitioning the reference genome into <italic>B</italic> equally spaced, nonoverlapping windows (typically 500 bp in size). We only considered windows that contain CpG sites. For the <italic>i</italic>th <inline-formula id="inf1"><inline-graphic xlink:href="1522inf1.jpg"/></inline-formula> window, let <italic>m<sub>i</sub></italic> denote the number of CpGs and <italic>k<sub>i</sub></italic> denote the number of CpGs in MRE sites. Let <italic>X</italic><sub>1<italic>i</italic></sub> and <italic>X</italic><sub>2<italic>i</italic></sub> denote the MeDIP-seq read counts of the two samples being compared. Since many CpGs are not in MRE sites, MRE-seq read counts are not on the same scale as MeDIP-seq read counts. To integrate the two signals into the same framework, we normalized the raw MRE-seq read counts by multiplying a scaling factor <inline-formula id="inf2"><inline-graphic xlink:href="1522inf2.jpg"/></inline-formula>, and call the normalized MRE-seq read counts <italic>Y</italic><sub>1<italic>i</italic></sub> and <italic>Y</italic><sub>2<italic>i</italic></sub>. We then assumed that <italic>X</italic><sub>1<italic>i</italic></sub>, <italic>X</italic><sub>2<italic>i</italic></sub>, <italic>Y</italic><sub>1<italic>i</italic></sub>, and <italic>Y</italic><sub>2<italic>i</italic></sub> are mutually independent Poisson random variables with expected values <inline-formula id="inf3"><inline-graphic xlink:href="1522inf3.jpg"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula id="inf4"><inline-graphic xlink:href="1522inf4.jpg"/></inline-formula>, where <inline-formula id="inf5"><inline-graphic xlink:href="1522inf5.jpg"/></inline-formula> refers to the two samples being compared. Let <inline-formula id="inf6"><inline-graphic xlink:href="1522inf6.jpg"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula id="inf7"><inline-graphic xlink:href="1522inf7.jpg"/></inline-formula>. We then modeled the expected values of <italic>X<sub>ji</sub></italic> and <italic>Y<sub>ji</sub></italic> as<disp-formula id="DE1"><graphic xlink:href="1522equ1"/></disp-formula>where <inline-formula id="inf8"><inline-graphic xlink:href="1522inf8.jpg"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula id="inf9"><inline-graphic xlink:href="1522inf9.jpg"/></inline-formula>, and <italic>μ</italic><sub>1<italic>i</italic></sub> and <italic>μ</italic><sub>2<italic>i</italic></sub> are the unknown methylation levels of the two samples in the <italic>i</italic>th window.</p>
      <p>Under this model, we detected DMRs by testing for all <inline-formula id="inf10"><inline-graphic xlink:href="1522inf10.jpg"/></inline-formula>,<disp-formula id="DE2"><graphic xlink:href="1522equ2"/></disp-formula>which is equivalent to testing<disp-formula id="DE3"><graphic xlink:href="1522equ3"/></disp-formula>From Equation 1, we can rewrite Equation 3 as<disp-formula id="DE4"><graphic xlink:href="1522equ4"/></disp-formula>where <inline-formula id="inf11"><inline-graphic xlink:href="1522inf11.jpg"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula id="inf12"><inline-graphic xlink:href="1522inf12.jpg"/></inline-formula> can be estimated from the data. Note that <italic>L<sub>j</sub></italic><sub>1</sub> and <italic>L<sub>j</sub></italic><sub>2</sub> can be estimated from the observed read counts, whereas <italic>S<sub>j</sub></italic><sub>1</sub> and <italic>S<sub>j</sub></italic><sub>2</sub> cannot be directly estimated, but their ratio can. We then used a conditional test based on the test statistic:<disp-formula><graphic xlink:href="1522equ6"/></disp-formula>Let <italic>n<sub>i</sub></italic> be the sum of the observed MeDIP-seq and MRE-seq read counts in the <italic>i</italic>th bin.

For windows in which only MeDIP-seq data are available, let <inline-formula id="inf13"><inline-graphic xlink:href="1522inf13.jpg"/></inline-formula>. Then, the <italic>P</italic>-value is given by <inline-formula id="inf14"><inline-graphic xlink:href="1522inf14.jpg"/></inline-formula> with <inline-formula id="inf15"><inline-graphic xlink:href="1522inf15.jpg"/></inline-formula> being the observed value of <inline-formula id="inf16"><inline-graphic xlink:href="1522inf16.jpg"/></inline-formula>. In this case, our method reduces to the SAGE test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B72">Robinson and Oshlack 2010</xref>).

      <p>Finally, since we applied M&amp;M to genomic windows genome-wide, the genome-wide false discovery rate (FDR) was controlled using the group Benjamini-Hochberg method previously described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">Hu et al. (2010)</xref>.</p>

      <title>Benchmarking M&amp;M’s performance</title>
      <p>Because M&amp;M implements a novel test statistic, we evaluated its sensitivity, specificity, and reproducibility on multiple DNA methylomes from human tissues and populations of cells strongly enriched for individual cell types. We tested the performance of M&amp;M against MEDIPS.</p>
      <p>We generated complete DNA methylome data for 19 human samples (Supplemental Table 1) as a part of the NIH Roadmap Epigenomics project (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">Bernstein et al. 2010</xref>). Tissue and primary cell types included embryonic stem cells (H1 ESCs), fetal brain tissue, neural stem cells (neurosphere cultured cells, ganglionic eminence derived), adult breast epithelial cells (luminal epithelial cells, myoepithelial cells, and a stem cell-enriched population), unfractionated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), and adult immune cells (CD4+ naive and memory and CD8+ naive cells). All samples were assayed by both MeDIP-seq and MRE-seq. For H1 ESC, two biological replicates were obtained. In addition, we obtained WGBS data for H1 ESCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">Lister et al. 2009</xref>). We also generated a second WGBS data set for short-term cultured human fetal neural stem cells (HuFNSC02, neurosphere cultured cells [NSCs], ganglionic eminence derived, fetal age of 21 wk) for which we also generated MeDIP-seq and MRE-seq data. We compared M&amp;M’s performance against that of MEDIPS by applying M&amp;M and MEDIPS (which uses MeDIP-seq data only) for pairwise comparisons between the two H1 ESC replicates and between H1 ESCs and fetal NSCs. All tests were performed on 500-bp-sized, nonoverlapping windows genome-wide (a total of 5,313,352 windows; windows without CpGs in the hg19 build of the human genome were not considered). In each pairwise comparison, M&amp;M and MEDIPS generated a <italic>P</italic>-value for each window, which was used to determine if the region within the window exhibited differential methylation between the two samples. In addition, for each DMR, the relative methylation status for the two samples was also determined, i.e., which sample was relatively hypermethylated and which sample was relatively hypomethylated.</p>
      <p>We then examined the distribution of <italic>P</italic>-values across the different comparisons. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>, we plotted histograms of all <italic>P</italic>-values generated by M&amp;M when comparing the two H1 ESC biological replicates and when comparing H1 ESCs and fetal NSCs. The <italic>x</italic>-axis denotes negative log<sub>10</sub> transformed <italic>P</italic>-values, and the <italic>y</italic>-axis denotes the log<sub>10</sub> transformed number of DMRs at each <italic>P</italic>-value cutoff. Similarly, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>, we plotted <italic>P</italic>-values from the same comparisons made by MEDIPS. At any reasonable cutoff, M&amp;M and MEDIPS both predicted more DMRs between H1 ESCs and fetal NSCs than between the two H1 ESC replicates, consistent with our expectations. Because the H1 ESC samples are biological replicates, this comparison can be used to estimate the number of false positives at any <italic>P</italic>-value cutoff. At a <italic>P</italic>-value less than 1 × 10<sup>−10</sup>, M&amp;M reported 70 DMRs, while MEDIPS reported 2066 DMRs. Thus, the false positives rate was 0.43% for M&amp;M and 18.51% for MEDIPS. Using the same <italic>P</italic>-value cutoff for the comparison between two different cell types, i.e., H1 ESCs and fetal NSCs, M&amp;M reported 16,398 DMRs, while MEDIPS reported 11,162; only about 70 DMRs called by M&amp;M from the H1 vs. fetal NSC comparison were expected to be false positives, while about 2066 of the DMRs called by MEDIPS could be false positives. These numbers suggest that M&amp;M has higher specificity compared to MEDIPS.</p>

        <graphic xlink:href="1522fig1"/>
      </fig>
      <p>To compare the sensitivities of the methods, we examined the enrichment of individual CpGs with significantly different methylation levels within the predicted DMRs. We focused again on the comparison between H1 ESC and fetal NSC samples because WGBS was available for both samples from which we could derive methylation levels at single CpG resolution. In this pairwise comparison, we used M&amp;M or MEDIPS to define any DMR in which fetal NSCs had a higher methylation level than H1 ESC as a hypermethylated DMR, and any DMR in which fetal NSCs had a lower methylation level than H1 ESC as a hypomethylated DMR. Based on ranked <italic>P</italic>-values, we used the top 1000 predicted hypermethylated DMRs and top 1000 hypomethylated DMRs for this comparison. Using the WGBS data, we derived methylation levels for individual CpGs located within the predicted DMRs. We then calculated methylation level differences by subtracting the individual CpG methylation values in H1 ESCs from their values in fetal NSCs. The histograms of individual CpG methylation level differences were plotted for both hypermethylated DMRs and hypomethylated DMRs, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1, C and D</xref> for M&amp;M and MEDIPS, respectively. Compared to the background methylation level differences between the two cell types, the top 2000 DMRs predicted by M&amp;M were enriched for differentially methylated CpGs. While MEDIPS also enriched for differentially methylated CpGs, it did so to a much lesser degree than M&amp;M. The trend remained the same when we compared differing numbers of top predicted DMRs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1E,F</xref>).</p>
      <p>We then analyzed the concordance between these DMR predictions with the WGBS data. For any predicted DMR, we defined it as concordant if it was predicted as a hypermethylated (or hypomethylated) DMR by M&amp;M or MEDIPS and the averaged differences of WGBS methylation values across all CpGs in the DMR were greater than 0.1 (or less than −0.1; fetal NSC WGBS values minus H1 ESC WGBS values). Otherwise, the predicted DMR was called a discordant prediction. The rates of concordance for both M&amp;M and MEDIPS were plotted for the top DMRs generated at increasingly relaxed statistical cutoffs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1G</xref>). The high concordance between M&amp;M’s prediction and actual CpG methylation differences inferred from WGBS data was robust regardless of the <italic>P</italic>-value used. Furthermore, M&amp;M’s concordance rate was higher than that of MEDIPS.</p>
      <p>We also examined the reproducibility of DMR predictions between biological replicates. We performed comparisons using the same two cell types isolated from two different individuals—breast luminal epithelial cell samples (RM066BreLum and RM070BreLum) and breast myoepithelial cell samples (RM066BreMyo and RM070BreMyo). The comparison between two cell types from one individual should enrich for DMRs underlying cell type specificity, and these DMRs should be identified again in the comparison between the same two cell types of another individual. We examined reproducibility by intersecting the DMRs from both individuals at multiple <italic>P</italic>-value cutoffs. M&amp;M had three- to fourfold higher reproducibility than MEDIPS in this analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1H</xref>).</p>
      <p>In addition to these evaluations, we also examined the agreement among DMRs detected by M&amp;M, MEDIPS, and by WGBS, between H1 ESC and fetal NSC (Methods). Of the top 10,000 DMRs predicted by each method, M&amp;M and WGBS overlapped by 4224, while MEDIPS and WGBS overlapped by 2979 (Supplemental Fig. S3A). As expected, the average DNA methylation difference (calculated by using WGBS data) was the greatest for the DMRs predicted by two methods; interestingly, DMRs predicted by M&amp;M only and DMRs predicted by WGBS only had almost identical average DNA methylation differences, while those predicted by MEDIPS only had smaller DNA methylation differences (Supplemental Fig. S3B).</p>
      <p>Overall, we conclude that M&amp;M has high specificity, sensitivity, and reproducibility, and exhibits superior performance in terms of these metrics when compared to a recently published MeDIP-seq analysis method, MEDIPS. We hypothesize that the improved prediction of DMRs when using the M&amp;M algorithm likely results from the integration of complementary measurements of the underlying methylation state. We note that the comparison between M&amp;M and MEDIPS was on different grounds. Adding MRE-seq data to MEDIPS did not further improve MEDIPS’ performance (Supplemental Notes; Supplemental Fig. S4); however, MEDIPS was not designed to work on MRE-seq data. M&amp;M’s superior performance is likely due to both having complementary data sets and a new statistical model designed specifically for this scenario.</p>

      <title>Detecting tissue-specific DMRs across four tissue types</title>
      <p>We applied M&amp;M to understand how DNA methylation underlies identity at three levels: tissue types, different cell types within tissues, and matched cell types from different individuals. We generated 19 methylomes from embryonic stem cells, adult blood cells, adult breast cells, and fetal brain cells, representing four tissue types. We plotted the <italic>P</italic>-value distributions generated by each pairwise, genome-wide M&amp;M comparison on 500-bp-sized windows (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>; Supplemental Fig. S5). These distributions suggested that methylation differences between tissues outnumber differences between cell types of the same tissue or between the same cell types from two individuals, at least in the context of the current study.</p>

      <p>We used a subset of the above pairwise comparisons to define known and novel tissue-specific DMRs. We identified genomic windows in which DNA methylation levels were similar between cell types from the same tissue but different from all cell types from the three other tissues. We required a window to have a <italic>Q</italic>-value of less than 1 × 10<sup>−5</sup> in all comparisons between any cell type of one tissue to all cell types in the three other tissues but to have a <italic>Q</italic>-value of greater than 1 × 10<sup>−5</sup> in all intra-tissue cell-type comparisons. Based on these criteria, a total of 2775 DMRs were defined as tissue-specific DMRs (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>; supporting website <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://epigenome.wustl.edu/MnM/">http://epigenome.wustl.edu/MnM/</ext-link>).

      <p>We hypothesized that these tissue-specific DMRs underlie important tissue-specific functions. Therefore, we examined their genomic distribution, chromatin patterns, and the functional enrichment of genes near or containing these DMRs. Of the 721 H1 ESC-specific DMRs, &gt;80% were hypermethylated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>). Forty-eight percent of these overlapped CpG islands, and 23% overlapped gene promoters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>). By our definition, H1 ESC hypermethylated DMRs were hypomethylated in blood, breast, and fetal brain samples. Intriguingly, when we examined the histone modification profiles at H1 ESC-hypermethylated DMRs in blood, breast, and brain samples, we found that &gt;50% were enriched for H3K4me3 signal (a promoter-associated histone modification), while only a small fraction (5%) was enriched for H3K4me1 signal (an enhancer-associated histone modification) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). This suggested that many H1 ESC hypermethylated DMRs were associated with genes that were expressed in differentiated cells but repressed in H1 ESC cells. The apparent gain of H3K4me3, in the absence of gain of H3K4me1, in differentiated cells suggested that the up-regulation of expression of these genes relies on a key mechanism that is promoter-, rather than enhancer-, dependent. These DMRs represent a class of DNA-methylation-silenced promoters that are not marked by bivalent domains in H1 ESC. Genes associated with H1 ESC-specific hypermethylated DMRs enriched for zinc finger DNA binding proteins based on GREAT analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">McLean et al. 2010</xref>), while H1 ESC-specific hypomethylated DMRs enriched for “target of Nanog” (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref>) and enriched for H3K4me3 in ESC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>). Some of the H1 ESC-specific hypermethylated genes may encode general differentiation factors (Supplemental Fig. S6). Interestingly, H1 ESC-specific hypermethylated DMRs displayed a moderate level of H3K4me1 enrichment, which may correlate with a transcriptionally poised state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>).</p>

      <p>In contrast to ESCs, the majority of tissue-specific DMRs identified in blood, breast, and fetal NSC samples were hypomethylated (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>). Analysis of histone modification profiles for these regions revealed enrichment of H3K4me3 and H3K4me1 in the corresponding samples. GREAT analysis revealed that genes associated with tissue-specific DMRs strongly enriched for functions relevant to each tissue type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref>). For example, fetal brain hypomethylated DMRs enriched for “neural tube patterning” (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 1 × 10<sup>−14</sup>) and “spinal cord development” (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 1 × 10<sup>−14</sup>), whereas breast hypomethylated DMRs enriched for “mammary gland epithelium development” (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 1 × 10<sup>−14</sup>) and blood hypomethylated DMRs enriched for “immune response” (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 1 × 10<sup>−19</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref>). Interestingly, blood hypermethylated DMRs displayed enrichment of H3K4me3 and H3K4me1 signals in ESC, breast, and fetal brain samples, suggesting that these DMRs were regulatory regions that were specifically turned off in blood cells but were active or permissive for activity in other cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>). Representative genes included <italic>HOXA5</italic> and <italic>ISYNA1</italic> (Supplemental Fig. S7).</p>
      <p>These data suggested a strong connection between tissue-specific DNA methylation and tissue-specific gene activity. When hypomethylated, DMRs were almost always associated with tissue-specific gene regulatory elements. As expected, many DMRs in tissue-specific genes occurred at promoters, while others appeared to be associated with enhancers. The majority of tissue-specific DMRs were hypermethylated in embryonic stem cells. They became unmethylated in differentiated cell types, and 41% acquired a promoter-associated histone mark (H3K4me3), while 30% acquired an enhancer-associated histone mark (H3K4me1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>). These epigenetic changes underscored the importance of DNA methylation in tissue differentiation.</p>
      <p>This result was further supported by chromatin state annotation of genomic sequences predicted to be tissue-specific DMRs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>). We obtained chromatin state transition maps generated by chromHMM using nine cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">Ernst et al. 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">Ernst and Kellis 2012</xref>; Methods). Almost all tissue-specific DMRs across ESC, fetal brain, breast, and blood were annotated as regulatory elements, including promoters, enhancers, and insulators. The only exception was fetal brain-specific hypomethylated DMRs—while most of these were marked by H3K4me1 in fetal brain samples, 60% did not have chromHMM annotation. This may be explained by the lack of a neural cell type among the nine cell lines used to produce the chromatin state map (Methods). Interestingly, promoters were more enriched in hypermethylated DMRs, while epigenetically defined enhancers dominated the hypomethylated DMR list (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>).</p>
      <p>Finally, gene expression data also supports a strong association between tissue-specific DNA methylation and tissue-specific gene activity. By using RNA-seq, we profiled transcriptomes of a subset of the samples. Expression levels of genes near tissue-specific DMRs were significantly higher in samples that were hypomethylated at these DMRs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref>).</p>

      <title>Tissue-specific DMRs that span large chromosomal domains</title>
      <p>The majority of the tissue-specific DMRs we identified were relatively small in size, reflecting discrete regulatory elements such as enhancers. We also observed large domains of DNA methylation changes, some of which spanned over 75 kb in length. These distinct DMR patterns suggested that different underlying mechanisms could generate tissue-specific DMRs. We have summarized these large DMR domains in Supplemental Table 2. We describe two such examples below, with another four examples presented in Supplemental Figs. S8 and S9.</p>
      <p>We discovered 18 breast-specific DMRs clustered in a 75-kb region on chromosome 22. This large region was hypomethylated in all breast-cell samples analyzed, as evidenced by decreased MeDIP-seq signal and increased MRE-seq signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig.5A</xref>; Supplemental Fig. S10A for bisulfite validation). This region spanned six CpG islands and five noncoding genes, including two long noncoding RNA genes, <italic>LINC00899</italic> and <italic>LOC150381</italic>, a putative coding gene <italic>C22orf26</italic>, and two isoforms of the tumor-suppressor miRNA <italic>MIRLET7</italic>, <italic>MIRLET7A3</italic>, and <italic>MIRLET7B.</italic> The <italic>MIRLET7</italic> family was discovered in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> and is functionally conserved from worm to human. The human <italic>MIRLET7</italic> family includes 13 isoforms located on nine different chromosomes. Silencing of <italic>MIRLET7</italic> plays an important role in breast cancer progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B97">Yu et al. 2007</xref>), as reduced <italic>MIRLET7</italic> expression promotes cancer cell invasiveness and metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B70">Qian et al. 2011</xref>). We also examined the methylation state of this large region by WGBS from breast cancer cell line HCC1954 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref>). Compared to normal human mammary epithelial cells (HMECs), this region was dramatically more methylated in the HCC1954 cancer cell line. This epigenetic event may reflect silencing of the pri-miRNA gene, <italic>MIRLET7BHG</italic>, that hosts the <italic>MIRLET7</italic> genes and potentially contribute to the invasiveness and increased proliferation previously reported in breast cancer cells.</p>

      <p>A 740-kb region on chromosome 5 containing three Protocadherin (<italic>PCDH</italic>) gene families provided another interesting example where large domain changes consisted of many smaller, local changes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5B</xref>; Supplemental Fig. S10B for bisulfite validation). Seventy-five of the 83 CpG islands in this region were specifically hypermethylated in H1 ESC. However, in differentiated tissues, these CpG islands gained a strong unmethylated signal, while maintaining a strong methylated signal (i.e., simultaneous high MeDIP-seq signal and high MRE-signal), indicating the CpG islands carry an intermediate methylation level. The <italic>PCDH</italic> gene family members belong to the cadherin superfamily and are present in all vertebrate genomes and highly conserved in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B92">Wu and Maniatis 1999</xref>). Most <italic>PCDH</italic> family members are clustered in three loci on chromosome 5, and share one highly conserved motif in their promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B94">Wu et al. 2001</xref>). <italic>PCDH</italic> genes are known to play important roles in neuronal cell differentiation and brain development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B68">Prasad et al. 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">Garrett and Weiner 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">Lin et al. 2010</xref>). Previous studies suggest that the expression of each <italic>PCDH</italic> member is monoallelic and regulated independently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">Esumi et al. 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">Kaneko et al. 2006</xref>), an observation that is consistent with our data, since an intermediate methylation level is a signature of monoallelic methylated sites. De novo methylation of the <italic>PCDH</italic> gene cluster is also associated with tumorigenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">Novak et al. 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">Dallosso et al. 2009</xref>), raising the possibility that establishing monoallelic methylation constitutes an important event in maintaining differentiated states. In contrast, promoters of the <italic>PCDH</italic> family are highly methylated in cells of all three germ layers differentiated from mouse ES cells but not in ES cells themselves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B78">Singer 1988</xref>). Whether the acquisition by differentiated cells of intermediate DNA methylation patterning in this region is specific to humans and how this phenomenon evolved awaits further investigation.</p>

      <title>Cell type-specific DMRs underlie enhancers associated with relevant pathways</title>
      <p>Our data set includes three breast cell types (a breast stem cell-enriched population, luminal epithelial cells, and myoepithelial cells) and three blood T cell types (naive CD4+ T cells, memory CD4+ T cells, and naive CD8+ T cells). This presented a unique opportunity to discover cell type-specific DMRs and to compare their epigenomic signature to that of tissue-specific DMRs. To define such cell type-specific DMRs, we required a genomic window to have a <italic>Q</italic>-value of less than 1 × 10<sup>−5</sup> in all comparisons between two cell types of the same tissue in two independent biological replicates. This analysis revealed that the most striking feature of cell type-specific DMRs is the enrichment of an enhancer chromatin signature. We use the following example to illustrate this discovery.</p>
      <p>We examined DNA methylation changes that were associated with maturation of naive CD4+ T cells into memory CD4+ T cells in the immune system. In addition to producing cytokines and chemokines, CD4+ T cells also act as mediators for other lymphocytes via cell-cell contact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B85">Swain et al. 2006</xref>). During responses to antigens, most CD4+ T cells die within a few days after receiving antigen stimulation, while only a small fraction survives. This small population corresponds to mature memory CD4+ T cells that contribute to later adaptive immune responses and reproduce rapidly upon restimulation of the same antigen. We compared the DNA methylomes of naive CD4+ T cells (CD4N) and memory CD4+ T cells (CD4M) from two individuals to identify cell type-specific DMRs (intra-CD4 DMRs). Compared to CD4N, CD4M cells showed hypomethylation in 349 genomic regions and hypermethylation in 287 regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6A</xref>). We detected enrichment of H3K4me1 signal in the majority of intra-CD4 hypomethylated DMRs in the samples where the DMRs are hypomethylated (62%), while a small fraction of DMRs displayed H3K4me3 signal (11%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6B</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>). The frequent overlap of intra-CD4 hypomethylated DMRs with enhancers was further supported by chromHMM annotation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6D</xref>). Histone modification profiling supported that many of the intra-CD4 DMRs are regulatory sites. This is further supported by data from ENCODE, in that 88% of these DMRs directly overlapped DNase I hypersensitivity sites, and 17% directly overlapped EP300 binding sites in at least one of the cell lines assayed by ENCODE (Supplemental Fig. S11; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">The ENCODE Project Consortium et al. 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B86">Thurman et al. 2012</xref>). Therefore, we reasoned that the intra-CD4 DMRs would harbor binding sites of relevant transcription factors. Indeed, by examining integrated ENCODE TFBS data, we found significant enrichment of many transcription factor-binding sites in these DMRs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig.6E</xref>). Binding of transcription factors to genomic DNA motifs is associated with changes in the local epigenetic landscape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">Asp et al. 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B82">Stadler et al. 2011</xref>). Our data further support this type of association at DMRs that define different cell types within breast tissue.</p>

      <p>Functional enrichment analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6C</xref>) of CD4N hypomethylated DMRs identified genes enriched for functions including lymphocyte differentiation and T cell receptor V(D)J recombination. These regions became methylated during the process of CD4+ T cell maturation. Increased CD4M DNA methylation was also observed in genes involved in apoptosis and cellular response to interleukin-4 (IL4). These DNA methylation events were consistent with transitions in cellular function during the maturation process. In contrast, DNA hypomethylation in CD4M was detected in the vicinity of genes involved in the immune system process and activation, and protein synthesis, including protein translation and elongation. Interestingly, some hypomethylated DMRs in CD4M were found to be close to genes that regulate the production of the Th2 cytokine interleukin-4, including the 5′ region of the <italic>IL4</italic> gene (Supplemental Fig. S12). As a key factor during CD4+ T cell maturation, IL4 induces long-term proliferation of neonatal T cells and stimulates production of other cytokines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B93">Wu et al. 1994</xref>). Some memory CD4+ T cells produce IL4 and perform important immune regulatory functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">Cosmi et al. 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B96">Xu et al. 2011</xref>).</p>

These hypomethylated DMRs also gained H3K4me1 signal in CD4M (Supplemental Fig. S12). Therefore, epigenetic regulation of expression of these CD4+ T cell type-specific genes is likely to involve enhancers rather than promoters. Taken together, our data highlight that a majority of cell type-specific DMRs likely correspond to cell type-specific enhancer elements, while tissue-specific DMRs enrich primarily for gene promoters.</p>

      <title>DMRs between individuals overlap with gene regulatory elements</title>
      <p>Epigenetic polymorphisms, including DNA methylation differences between individuals, are increasingly associated with phenotypic diversity and disease susceptibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B87">Tost et al. 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">Baranzini et al. 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">Coolen et al. 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">Eichten et al. 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">Gertz et al. 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">Gervin et al. 2011</xref>). Unlike genetic polymorphisms such as SNPs and copy number variation, epigenetic polymorphisms can be influenced by both genetic and environmental determinants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">Anway et al. 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">Li et al. 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">Crews et al. 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B80">Skinner et al. 2012</xref>). In our study, we obtained biological replicates from two individuals for the breast, fetal brain, and blood data sets. We did not address the association between genotype and epigenotype in the current study. Rather, we sought to identify regions of the genome that are hotspots for individual-specific differential methylation by comparing DNA methylomes of the same cell types between different individuals (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>).</p>

      <p>The remaining 643 DMRs, when considered together, did not seem to associate with genes that enrich for any particular function. Nevertheless, more than half of these DMRs were annotated by chromHMM as regulatory elements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7B</xref>). Interestingly, &gt;40% of the inter-individual DMRs identified using the fetal brain samples (inter-brain DMRs) from two monozygotic twins displayed individual-specific H3K4me1 marks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7C,D</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>).

Taken together, we hypothesize that at least some of the inter-individual DMRs might influence gene expression in an individual-specific manner and therefore influence particular traits. For example, we found potentially regulatory DMRs in the introns of <italic>CYP2D6</italic> and <italic>CYP2E1</italic>, both of which belong to the cytochrome P450 family and are implicated in metabolizing precarcinogens, drugs, and solvents to reactive metabolites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">Agundez 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">Bozina et al. 2009</xref>).

    <p>DNA methylation plays important roles in cells, including the regulation of genes during development and disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B71">Robertson 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">Lister et al. 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">Deaton et al. 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">Jones 2012</xref>). It has been increasingly associated with tissue-specific gene activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">Kitamura et al. 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">Illingworth et al. 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">Maunakea et al. 2010</xref>). The technology is now available for studying DNA methylation genome-wide, at high resolution and in a large number of samples, presenting an unprecedented opportunity to map DNA methylation differences between tissues and cells in healthy and diseased states and during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">Bock 2012</xref>).</p>
    <p>Here, we introduce a novel statistical framework, “M&amp;M,” to detect differentially methylated regions by integrating two next-generation sequencing-based technologies—MeDIP-seq and MRE-seq. MeDIP-seq, or methylated DNA immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing, uses an antibody that recognizes 5-methylcytosines in the genome. Because the MeDIP-seq protocol is straightforward and generates unbiased, cost-effective, and full-genome methylation levels, it is widely used for whole-genome DNA methylation analysis. Several computational tools, including Batman (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">Down et al. 2008</xref>), MEDIPS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">Chavez et al. 2010</xref>), and MeQA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">Huang et al. 2012</xref>), were developed to process and analyze MeDIP-seq data. MRE-seq was recently developed as a complementary technique to MeDIP-seq, such that it utilizes methylation-sensitive restriction enzymes to digest genomic DNA and generate DNA fragments where the free ends contain single unmethylated CpGs. Previously, we showed that by combining MeDIP-seq and MRE-seq we can generate genome-wide DNA methylation maps of very high coverage and can identify intermediate and/or monoallelic methylated regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">Harris et al. 2010</xref>). We now show that utilizing M&amp;M to combine data from MeDIP-seq and MRE-seq in a statistically rigorous manner provides improved prediction of differentially methylated regions. Since these two methods assay for opposing methylation states, an increase in the signal when using one method is expected to be accompanied by a decrease in the signal when using the other method. The M&amp;M algorithm models the expected MeDIP-seq and MRE-seq values in relation to the numbers of methylated and unmethylated CpGs in any given genomic interval, and unifies these two complementary data types by the relative methylation levels. M&amp;M then detects DMRs by testing for the null hypothesis that the methylation levels of two samples are the same, given the observed MeDIP-seq and MRE-seq data. The complete M&amp;M package is now part of Bioconductor under the name of “methylMnM.”</p>
    <p>To benchmark the performance of M&amp;M, we selected two samples (H1 ESC and fetal NSC) for which we had characterized genome-wide DNA methylation profiles using WGBS, MeDIP-seq, and MRE-seq. We applied M&amp;M to discover DMRs between H1 ESC and fetal NSC and compared the results with those obtained by applying MEDIPS, one of the leading software tools currently used for analyzing MeDIP-seq data, on our MeDIP-seq data. M&amp;M displayed superior sensitivity, specificity, and reproducibility as highlighted by a much higher concordance for methylation level differences when compared to those determined by WGBS data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C–E</xref>). The addition of MRE-seq data provided independent information about methylation state, which M&amp;M takes advantage of by integrating MeDIP-seq and MRE-seq under the same statistical framework for more accurate DMR detection. It should be noted that the statistical framework can be generalized and can potentially integrate other types of DNA methylation data.</p>
    <p>As part of the Roadmap Epigenomics Initiative, we produced a large collection of DNA methylomes using MeDIP-seq and MRE-seq, representing multiple tissue and cell types from multiple individuals. By applying M&amp;M to selected data sets, we were able to create comprehensive lists of DMRs that are either tissue type-, cell type-, or individual-specific. This resource is publicly available through the Wash U Human Epigenome Browser (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B100">Zhou et al. 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B101">2013</xref>) and the UCSC Genome Browsers (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://VizHub.wustl.edu">http://VizHub.wustl.edu</ext-link>).</p>
    <p>DNA methylation has been investigated for its role in specifying tissue-specific gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B81">Song et al. 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B77">Shen et al. 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">Irizarry et al. 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">Laurent et al. 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">Maunakea et al. 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">Liang et al. 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">Andersen et al. 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">Davies et al. 2012</xref>). It has long been appreciated that DNA methylation of non-CpG island gene promoters is a durable mechanism that results in repression of genes in specific tissues during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">Lamson and Stockdale 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">Luo et al. 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B91">Winders et al. 2004</xref>). Cancer cells also exploit a similar mechanism to turn off tumor suppressor genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">Momparler and Bovenzi 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B71">Robertson 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">Daniel et al. 2011</xref>). Promoters and CpG islands have been, therefore, the primary focus of DNA methylation studies. Recently, cell type-specific “lowly methylated regions” (LMRs) distal to genes have been discovered in the mouse genome. These LMRs are created by binding of DNA binding factors outside of promoter regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B82">Stadler et al. 2011</xref>), highlighting the importance of comprehensive comparisons of DNA methylomes and DMR discovery beyond promoters and CpG islands.</p>
    <p>Our analysis revealed distinct histone modification and gene regulatory signatures underlying tissue-, cell type-, and individual-specific DMRs. Consistent with our expectations, DNA methylation differences were strongly associated with gene regulatory elements. The majority of the DNA methylation differences were accompanied by differences in the active chromatin marks H3K4me3 and H3K4me1, suggesting that these DMRs overlap promoters and/or enhancers. Genes associated with DMRs strongly enriched for functions relevant to the tissue or cell types in any given comparison. Surprisingly, the proportions of promoter-like DMRs and enhancer-like DMRs were quite different between tissue-specific DMRs and cell type-specific DMRs—about 40% of tissue-specific DMRs were annotated as promoters, while &gt;70% of cell type-specific DMRs were annotated as enhancers (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Tables 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). This signature suggests that different mechanisms may establish and maintain DNA methylation patterns during development and differentiation, resulting in different phenotypic consequences. DNA methylation of promoters likely has a strong impact on gene expression, equivalent to an on/off switch that keeps genes in an active state or shuts down gene expression completely. Thus, methylation of gene promoters can be a mechanism for major cell lineage determination. Our most significant finding was that many differentially methylated regions associate with tissue- and cell type-specific enhancers, as determined by histone modifications and chromHMM annotations (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Tables 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4 F6 F7">Figs. 4, 6B,C, 7B,E</xref>). DNA methylation in enhancers may vary with binding of specific transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B82">Stadler et al. 2011</xref>) and also influences transcription factor binding and modulates gene expression. Methylation of enhancers, thus, could provide a mechanism that allows cells to fine-tune gene activity and make a final lineage commitment or maintain a distinct cell fate.</p>
    <p>We also identified 307 individual-specific DMRs when comparing the same tissue type (fetal brain tissue) between two monozygotic twins. Interestingly, these DMRs also enriched for strong, individual-specific H3K4me1 enhancer signal, highlighting the potential functional impact of epigenetic variation between genetically identical individuals. Epigenetic polymorphism has attracted enormous interest in recent years. Several recent studies investigating the connection between genetic variation and epigenetic variation revealed that epigenetic polymorphisms are likely the result of a complex interplay between genetic and environmental factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">Anway et al. 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">Li et al. 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">Crews et al. 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B80">Skinner et al. 2012</xref>). Our finding provides additional support for the potential functional impact of epigenetic polymorphisms.</p>
    <p>Leveraging new sequencing-based DNA methylome mapping technologies and a novel, integrative statistical framework, we mapped DNA methylation differences across multiple tissues and cell types from multiple individuals at the whole-genome level. Differences in DNA methylation can be tightly associated with gene regulation, impacting regulatory elements such as promoters and enhancers, and defining the cellular epigenetic landscape. Interestingly, the DMRs identified in our study were enriched for evolutionarily conserved sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8</xref>). Many of the functional elements in the human genome have been identified by comparative genomic approaches based on evolutionary principles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">Lindblad-Toh et al. 2011</xref>). Sequence conservation correlates with conservation of some epigenetic marks, including DNA methylation, between species. Furthermore, conserved localization of epigenetic marks can be used to define regulatory DNA elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">Maunakea et al. 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B95">Xiao et al. 2012</xref>). Enrichment of conserved sequences in DMRs suggests that these sequences may be under purifying selection and that their regulatory functions may be evolutionarily selected. It would be exciting to examine whether the same principle applies to tissue-, cell type-, and individual-specific DNA methylation for other species.</p>

      <title>Bisulfite treatment and library construction for WGBS</title>
      <p>One to 5 μg gDNA was sonicated to an approximate size range of 200–400 bp. Size selection was achieved by PAGE gel and yielded DNA fragments of 200–300 bp. DNA was quantified by fluorescent incorporation (Qubit, Invitrogen). The library preparation included end-repair and phosphorylation with NEBNextTM or Illumina Sample Prep Kit reagents and addition of an ‘A’ base to the 3′ end of the DNA fragments. Methylated adapters were ligated and size selection was performed to remove excess free adaptors. The ligated DNA was quantified by Qubit, and ∼100 ng DNA was used for bisulfite conversion. Methylated-adaptor ligated to unmethylated lambda-phage DNA (NEB) was used as an internal control for assessing the rate of bisulfite conversion. The ratio of target library to Lambda was 1600:1. Bisulfite conversion of the methylated adapter-ligated DNA fragments followed the FFPE Tissue Samples Protocol from Qiagen’s Epitect Bisulfite Kit. Cleanup of the bisulfite-converted DNA was performed, and a second round of conversion was applied. Enrichment of adaptor-ligated DNA fragments was accomplished by dividing the template into five aliquots followed by eight cycles of PCR with adaptor primers. Post-PCR size-selection of the PCR products from the five reactions was achieved by PAGE gel. Following 100-bp paired-end sequencing on a HiSeq2000, sequence reads were aligned and processed through the Bismark pipeline.</p>

        <title>Breast</title>
        <p>Breast tissues were obtained from disease-free, premenopausal women undergoing reduction mammoplasty in accordance with institutionally approved IRB protocol # 10-01563 (previously CHR # 8759-34462-01). All tissues were obtained as de-identified samples and linked only with a minimal data set (age, ethnicity, and in some cases, parity/gravidity). Tissue was dissociated mechanically and enzymatically, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B74">Romanov et al. 2001</xref>). Briefly, tissue was minced and dissociated in RPMI 1640 with L-glutamine and 25 mm HEPES (Fisher, cat. # MT10041CV) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (JR Scientific, Inc., cat. # 43603), 100 U/mL penicillin, 100 μg/mL streptomycin sulfate, 0.25 μg/mL fungizone, gentamycin (Lonza, cat. # CC4081G), 200 U/mL collagenase 2 (Worthington, cat. # CLS-2), and 100 U/mL hyaluronidase (Sigma-Aldrich, cat. # H3506-SG) at 37°C for 16 h. The cell suspension was centrifuged at 1400 rpm for 10 min, followed by a wash with RPMI 1640/10% FBS. Clusters enriched in epithelial cells (referred to as organoids) were recovered after serial filtration through a 150-μm nylon mesh (Fisher, cat. # NC9445658), and a 40-μm nylon mesh (Fisher, cat. # NC9860187). The final filtrate contained primarily mammary stromal cells (fibroblasts, immune cells, and endothelial cells) and some single epithelial cells. Following centrifugation at 1200 rpm for 5 min, the epithelial organoids and filtrate were frozen for long-term storage. The day of cell sorting, epithelial organoids were thawed out and further digested with 0.5 g/L 0.05% trypsin-EDTA and dispase-DNase I (STEMCELL Technologies, cat. # 7913 and # 7900, respectively). Generation of single-cell suspensions was monitored visually. Single-cell suspensions were filtered through a 40-μm cell strainer (Fisher, cat. # 087711), spun down, and allowed to “regenerate” in MEGM medium (Lonza) supplemented with 2% fetal calf serum for 60–90 min at 37°C. This “regeneration” step enables quenching of trypsin and re-expression of the cell surface markers prior to staining, as their extracellular domain had been cleaved by trypsin.</p>
        <p>The single-cell suspension obtained as described above was stained for cell sorting with three human-specific primary antibodies, anti-CD10 labeled with PE-Cy7 (BD Biosciences, cat. # 341092) to isolate myoepithelial cells, anti-CD227/MUC1 labeled with FITC (BD Biosciences, cat. # 559774) to isolate luminal epithelial cells, or anti-CD73 labeled with PE (BD Biosciences, cat. # 550257) to isolate a stem cell-enriched cell population, and with biotinylated antibodies for lineage markers, anti-CD2, CD3, CD16, CD64 (BD Biosciences, cat. # 555325, 555338, 555405, and 555526), CD31 (Invitrogen, cat. # MHCD3115), CD45, CD140b (BioLegend, cat. # 304003 and 323604) to specifically remove hematopoietic, endothelial, and leukocyte lineage cells, respectively, by negative selection. Sequential incubation with primary antibodies was performed for 20 min at room temperature in PBS with 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA), followed by washing in PBS with 1% BSA. Biotinylated primary antibodies were revealed with an anti-human secondary antibody labeled with streptavidin-Pacific Blue conjugate (Invitrogen, cat. # S11222). After incubation, cells were washed once in PBS with 1% BSA, and cell sorting was performed using a FACSAria II cell sorter (BD Biosciences).</p>

The tissues were minced and dissociated by combination of mechanical agitation (gentleMACS device) during enzymatic treatment with papain, according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Miltenyi Biotec, neural tissue dissociation kit #130-092-628). Cell suspensions were then washed twice in DMEM and plated at low density in human NeuroCult NS-A media (Stem Cell Technology, # 05751) supplemented with heparin, EGF (20 ng/mL) and FGF (10 ng/mL) in ultralow attachment cell culture flasks (Corning, #3814).</p>
