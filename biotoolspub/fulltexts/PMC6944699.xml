      <p id="Par1">Drug resistance limits the therapeutic efficacy in cancers and leads to tumor recurrence through ill-defined mechanisms. Glioblastoma (GBM) are the deadliest brain tumors in adults. GBM, at diagnosis or after treatment, are resistant to temozolomide (TMZ), the standard chemotherapy. To better understand the acquisition of this resistance, we performed a longitudinal study, using a combination of mathematical models, RNA sequencing, single cell analyses, functional and drug assays in a human glioma cell line (U251). After an initial response characterized by cell death induction, cells entered a transient state defined by slow growth, a distinct morphology and a shift of metabolism. Specific genes expression associated to this population revealed chromatin remodeling. Indeed, the histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin (TSA), specifically eliminated this population and thus prevented the appearance of fast growing TMZ-resistant cells. In conclusion, we have identified in glioblastoma a population with tolerant-like features, which could constitute a therapeutic target.</p>

    <title>Introduction</title>
    <p id="Par2">Glioblastoma (GBM) is the major and deadliest form of brain cancers in adult. Temozolomide (TMZ) is the standard of care for chemotherapy in patients with GBM. The resistance to this drug is modulated by DNA repair systems and in particular by the expression of O<sup>6</sup>-methylguanine-DNA methyl transferase (MGMT)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. The expression of MGMT is silenced by promoter methylation in approximately half of GBM tumors, and clinical studies have shown that elevated MGMT protein levels or lack of MGMT promoter methylation is associated with TMZ resistance in GBM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. However, almost invariably GBM recur even after an aggressive TMZ/irradiation regimen and recurrent tumors are highly resistant to treatments and often express MGMT even if absent in the original tumor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>.</p>
    <p id="Par3">Resistance can however occur through multiple pathways that may be found independently or simultaneously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Indeed the evolution of tumor cells under therapy can be viewed as a Darwinian process with replacement of sensitive clones by resistant clones<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. This model is supported by the contention that tumors are composed of a large number of clones and that treatment could change the normal course of cancer evolution as dominant clones at diagnosis could be replaced by others, present within the cell population, because of the selective pressure of therapy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Alternatively, the cancer stem cell hypothesis postulates a hierarchical organization of tumors, in which only a proportion of cells is tumorigenic and exhibits intrinsic resistance to most treatments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Both models can account for tumor resistance and heterogeneity. Specific mutations have been shown in some cancers to be the major drivers of tumor resistance and growth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Yet, specific inhibitors targeting these mutations almost always showed short-term success but did not preclude the development of resistance independent of the primary mutation. This is probably linked to the fact that differential drug responses can be observed even between cells that are genetically and epigenetically related<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>.</p>
    <p id="Par4">Drug resistance to treatments in cancer cells can thus either be intrinsic or adaptive and are governed by many mechanisms. Recently, persisters/tolerant cells, which were first observed in microorganism resistance to antibiotics, have been identified in tumors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. These cells have been shown, in lung cancer and melanoma cell lines, to precede and accompany resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. However, little information on the role of tolerant populations in response to other drugs such as DNA-damaging agents is available.</p>
    <p id="Par5">We then studied, in vitro, in vivo, and in silico, the development of resistance to TMZ in a glioma cell line using a combination of phenotypic, metabolic, genomic, and single cell analyses. We identified an intermediate cell population crucial to the acquisition of resistance to the drug similar to tolerant/persisters population. We show that histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDI), eliminate specifically this population and prevent resistance to TMZ.</p>

      <title>Timeline of the acquisition of resistance to temozolomide by the U251 cells</title>
      <p id="Par24">U251 cells were treated every 3 days for up to 3 weeks with 50 μM TMZ (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>), a dose relevant to the clinical condition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. A maximum of cell death (i.e., measured by caspase activity) was observed after 3 days of exposure to TMZ as described previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. Cell cycle arrest (G2/M blockade) was observed between day 3 (D3) and D9 before U251 resumed their cell cycle G0/G1 (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">1</xref>). Morphologically (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">2</xref>), U251 cells exhibited a reproducible pattern of adaptation to the drug: in a first phase, cells exhibited a flattened cell body with few cellular extensions (D6–D9); in a second phase cells started to grow as colonies (D9–D12); in a third phase (i.e., after D12) cells recolonized the dish (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">2</xref>). The resistance to TMZ, measured by cell viability, was monitored on cells obtained after 16 days with or without treatment (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). We named U251<sup>S</sup> (S for sensitive), the untreated cells and U251<sup>R</sup> (R for resistant) cells treated with 50 μM TMZ for 16 days. As shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>, the two cell lines exhibited different sensitivities to TMZ concentration up to 100 μM. U251 treated for 3 or 6 days with TMZ were then left untreated until D16 to generate U251<sup>R3</sup> and U251<sup>R6</sup>, respectively. The resistance of these cells to TMZ was intermediate to that observed in U251<sup>S</sup> and U251<sup>R</sup> (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). On the other hand, U251<sup>R</sup> left untreated for 3 months (U251<sup>R</sup> wash out, U251<sup>R/WO</sup>) remained resistant to TMZ although to a lesser degree (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). However, after a brief exposure to 50 µM TMZ, U251<sup>R/WO</sup> cells were again fully resistant. We analyzed the clonogenic survival of U251 cells during the course of TMZ treatment. As shown in Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">3A</xref>, U251 cells treated with TMZ between D3 and D6 present a very low colony forming efficiency and U251<sup>R</sup> (D16) exhibited limited clonogenicity compared to U251<sup>S</sup> (D0).</p>
      <p id="Par25">Mitochondria and especially oxidative phosphorylation has recently been linked to treatment resistance in several cancers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. We thus analyzed the mitochondrial metabolism during the TMZ treatment using the Seahorse technology as previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. U251<sup>S</sup> and U251<sup>R</sup> cells have a comparable glycolytic metabolism while during the acquisition of resistance the ratio OCR/ECAR increased (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>) due from day 6 to day 12 to the predominance of oxidative phosphorylation over glycolysis (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">3B, C</xref>).</p>
      <p id="Par26">Thus, TMZ-treated cells that transit from D3 to D12 have distinct metabolic properties, proliferation rates and morphologies and we called these cells U251<sup>TR</sup> (TR for transient state). To evaluate and compare the tumorigenic properties of U251<sup>S</sup>, U251<sup>TR</sup>, and U251<sup>R</sup> as well as the influence of the microenvironment, we implanted these cells in an orthotopic NSG mice model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. The survival of mice injected with U251<sup>TR-D9</sup> cells (cells treated 9 days with TMZ 50 µM in vitro) was significantly increased over mice injected with U251<sup>S</sup> or U251<sup>R</sup> (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref>). The gross morphological aspects of the tumors derived from these cells did not show major difference at the time of death of the mice (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media">4</xref>).</p>

      <title>Mathematical modeling of the acquisition of resistance to TMZ in U251 cells</title>
      <p id="Par27">The expression of MGMT has been associated with resistance to TMZ in GBM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup> and in particular in U251 cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. Therefore we measured MGMT in our cell line during the time of treatment by TMZ. MGMT was not present in U251<sup>S</sup> cells but MGMT RNAs were significantly present after 9 days of exposure to TMZ and this expression increased continuously afterwards to reach a plateau at D16 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1e</xref> left). At the protein level, the expression of MGMT was unambiguously detected only at D16 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1e</xref> right). The resistance observed after D16 could be due to the selection of a preexisting clone or to an acquired program by some cells. We thus developed two different mathematical models corresponding to the two frameworks based on the proliferation properties of U251 cells with the expression of MGMT as the read out for resistance (see Supplementary Information <xref rid="MOESM7" ref-type="media">2</xref>).</p>
      <p id="Par28">In the clonal selection model, a subpopulation with high levels of resistance is supposed to pre-exist in the original population (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>) and will become the dominant clone upon the selection induced by TMZ. We used a system of two differential equations in combination with the standard least squares method to estimate the kinetic parameters, fitted to the experimental data. A large number of possible combinations for the initial fraction of resistant cells and the proliferation rate could fit the experimental data (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>) and the initial proportion of resistant cells, i.e., U251<sup>R</sup>, would vary from 0.02 to 6.97% of the initial population. One parameter (<italic>α</italic>) was used to account for the MGMT expression ratio of resistant cells with respect to the basal values of the sensitive cells. In the early stages (first 6 days), the MGMT expression kinetics fits with the experimental results (insets in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1e</xref>). In contrast, at later times (days 12–16), it was not possible to fit the large variability observed in the MGMT expression (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>), thereby indicating that a purely selection mechanism did not agree with our experimental results (see Supplementary Information <xref rid="MOESM7" ref-type="media">2</xref>).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><title>Mathematic model of resistance acquisition.</title><p><bold>a</bold> Scheme and basic dynamics of the clonal selection framework: (left) Schematic representation of the theory; (right) mathematical simulation of cell proliferation in the presence of TMZ (see Supporting information <xref rid="MOESM7" ref-type="media">2</xref>). <bold>b</bold> Data fittings according to the clonal selection interpretation. <bold>c</bold> MGMT variability within the clonal selection mode according to the 4 fits in b. <bold>d</bold> Scheme and basic dynamics of the acquired resistance model: (left) Schematic representation of the theory; (right) mathematical simulation of cell proliferation in the presence of TMZ (see Supporting information <xref rid="MOESM7" ref-type="media">2</xref>). <bold>e</bold> Data fittings according to the acquired resistance/transient population model. <bold>f</bold> MGMT variability within the acquired resistance model according to the 4 fits in e.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="41419_2019_2200_Fig2_HTML" id="d29e1036"/></fig></p>
      <p id="Par29">According to the adaptive model, cells would evolve from a sensitive to a resistant phenotype through the acquisition of new expression of genes. Based on previous observations with TKI inhibitors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>, this mechanism would not be direct, and will lead to a transient state, during which cells do not proliferate and do not undergo apoptosis. Thus, in addition to the sensitive and resistant populations, an intermediate population, similar to U251<sup>TR</sup>, was incorporated in the mathematical model (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref>). Our mathematical model incorporated the age-structure displayed by the nascent “TR” population (see Supplementary Information <xref rid="MOESM7" ref-type="media">2</xref>). Different parameter combinations were able to explain the cell numbers (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2e</xref>), now assuming a zero initial resistant population. Of note and in contrast with the previous model, using the MGMT expression, it was possible to find values and different parameter combinations that fit with all the experimental time points (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2f</xref>).</p>

      <title>RNA sequencing analyses of U251 cells following TMZ treatment</title>
      <p id="Par30">The distinct features observed in the U251<sup>S</sup>, U251<sup>TR</sup>, and U251<sup>R</sup> and our mathematical models suggested a profound change in gene expression with TMZ treatment. We use RNA sequencing to validate these changes at D0, D4, D9, D12, and D16 after TMZ exposure. U251<sup>S</sup> and U251<sup>R</sup> did not appear significantly different regarding the pathways implicated in proliferation and DNA repair (i.e., activation of ATR). However, in the U251<sup>TR</sup> most basal metabolisms were dysregulated (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>). Principal component analysis (PCA) and hierarchical clustering analysis (HCA) of the normalized RNA sequencing data confirmed the three separate stages corresponding to U251<sup>S</sup>, U251<sup>TR</sup>, and U251<sup>R</sup> (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>). In addition, PCA indicated two groups, one containing the U251<sup>TR</sup> population and the other one containing U251<sup>S</sup> and U251<sup>R</sup>. Interestingly, U251<sup>R</sup> exhibited a higher order of heterogeneity (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>). Epithelial to mesenchymal-like transition (EMT), resistance to apoptosis and presence of cancer stem cells have been associated with treatment resistance in many cancers. We analyzed key genes implicated in EMT, apoptosis and stemness (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>) in the different populations of the kinetic study. We found no differences between U251<sup>S</sup>, U251<sup>TR</sup>, and U251<sup>R</sup> except for the expression of p21 in U251<sup>TR</sup> (which could be related to cell cycle arrest) and fibronectin in U251<sup>R</sup> (which could be related to cell migration/invasion). We used the STRING interactive network program to analyze pathways over-represented in U251<sup>TR</sup> and we found one major molecular interaction network that centered on the histone pathway (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3d</xref>). We also analyzed the amount of mutations following the TMZ treatment and as shown in (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM8" ref-type="media">5A</xref>) the mutation rates increased significantly between D0 and D4 and become stabilized thereafter.

The transient expression of these 4 genes over the course of acquisition of resistance to TMZ is shown on Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>. HB-EGF and CHI3L1 had a similar kinetic at the protein level. (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM8" ref-type="media">5B, C</xref>). We treated three other glioma cell lines having different MGMT status (U87, LN18, and A172 cells) with TMZ at various concentrations (250, 350, and 50 µM, respectively) and analyzed the expression of the four genes. As shown in Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM9" ref-type="media">6A</xref>, these genes appeared to be also regulated by TMZ although to a lesser extent.

Violin plot representation (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5b</xref>) indicated that the distribution of most genes is unimodal during the TMZ treatment while a few genes appear to evolve from a unimodal to a bimodal distribution from U251<sup>S</sup> to U251<sup>TR</sup> and return to the unimodal stage in U251<sup>R</sup> (i.e., Bcl-2, USP9X, EGFR, TGF α, ADAM10, ADAM17, and ANPG). Quite interestingly, most of these genes are associated with cell survival and/or were implicated in TMZ resistance in the literature. Next, we studied the expression cell by cell of KLK5, FAT2, CHI3L1, HB-EGF, and MGMT. The expression of MGMT appeared at D9, at first in a few cells and in most but not all cells after D12. On the other hand, the expressions of KLK5, FAT, CHI3L1 and HB-EGF were random among the cells at D4–D9. They were even co-expressed with MGMT in some cells at later stages (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5c</xref>). The expression of the four genes appeared to be independent. This suggested that the “TR” state does not necessarily correspond to a homogeneous population such as a single clone.<fig id="Fig5"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption><title>Single cell analyses.</title><p><bold>a</bold> PCA resulting from single cell analysis of untreated U251 cells, or U251 cells treated for 4, 9, 12, and 16 days with 50 µM TMZ. <bold>b</bold> Violin plot of gene expression. <italic>Y</italic>-axis represent (Threshold-Ct), meaning that the expression level is correlated to the y value. <bold>c</bold> Expression in U251 single cell of KLK5, FAT2, MGMT, HB-EGF and CHI3L1 over the course of treatment with 50 µM TMZ.

      <title>Epigenetic targeting of U251<sup>TR</sup> prevents the rise of U251<sup>R</sup> in vitro and in vivo</title>
      <p id="Par34">Since U251<sup>TR</sup> seemed to preferentially use mitochondrial oxidative-ATP-synthesis (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>), we hypothesized that it could be more sensitive to Metformin (Met), a NADH dehydrogenase (complex I) inhibitor of mitochondrial respiration. Treatment with Met, in U251<sup>S</sup>, U251<sup>TR</sup>, and U251<sup>R</sup> did not significantly affect the viability of U251<sup>S</sup> or U251<sup>TR</sup> cells, alone or in combination with TMZ but had a small effect on U251<sup>R</sup> (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6a</xref> left). The expression of MGMT is related to the DNA methylation status of its promoter in glioma<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. Thus, we treated the different U251 populations with the DNMT inhibitor 5-azacytidine, to decrease overall methylation. However, 5-Aza had no specific effect on U251<sup>S</sup> and similar effects were seen in U251<sup>R</sup> and U251<sup>TR-D3</sup> (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6a</xref> center). As we had identified an upregulation of a histone cluster in the U251<sup>TR</sup>, Trichostatin A (TSA), an inhibitor of histone deacetylase (HDI) was tested on the different cell types. TSA had no significant effect on U251<sup>S</sup>, but specifically and significantly affected U251<sup>TR-D3</sup> and to a lesser extent U251<sup>R</sup> (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6a</xref>, right). To address the impact of a specific targeting of U251<sup>TR</sup>, we designed an experimental treatment in which U251 cells were treated by TMZ for 72 h (to generate U251<sup>TR</sup>) and then treated with TSA in combination with TMZ (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6b</xref> top). As shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6b</xref> (bottom), this treatment sequence efficiently eradicates U251<sup>TR</sup> cells and prevents the onset of U251<sup>R</sup> cells in vitro. The in vivo implantation of U251<sup>S</sup>, U251<sup>TR-D9</sup>, or U251<sup>R</sup> cells treated or not with TSA confirmed that this treatment was efficient to reduce the growth of U251<sup>TR-D9</sup> but did not affect that of U251<sup>S</sup> and U251<sup>R</sup> (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6c</xref>).<fig id="Fig6"><label>Fig. 6</label><caption><title>Drug sensitivity of U251<sup>S</sup>, U251<sup>TR-D3</sup>, and U251<sup>R</sup> cells.</title><p><bold>a</bold> Cell viability after 72 h exposure of U251<sup>S</sup>, U251<sup>TR-D3</sup>, and U251<sup>R</sup> to different drug combinations: (left) Metformin (4 mM), an inhibitor of mitochondrial respiration, (center) 5-aza (5 µM), a DNA demethylation agent and (right) TSA (250 nM), <bold>a</bold> histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDI).

    <title>Discussion</title>
    <p id="Par35">Recently, small populations of cancer cells, referred to as “cancer stem cells” or “drug tolerant cells”, have been identified in some cancers as being in a specific cellular state (slow cycling, low cell death, epigenetic alterations…) that allows them to survive drug treatment and to give rise of resistant and highly proliferative cancer cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. Drug tolerant cells have been identified mainly in melanoma or lung cancer-derived cell lines treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) and identified as potential therapeutic targets to prevent resistance/relapse of cancers. In GBM, TKI induced a rapid and reversible state in cancer stem cells that was epigenetically regulated and associated with the expression of neurodevelopmental and quiescent signatures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>.</p>
    <p id="Par36">We used a glioma cell line, as a model to explore the acquisition of resistance to TMZ, the current chemotherapy in GBM. This cell line did not express the DNA repair enzyme, MGMT. We found that resistance was accompanied by epigenetic changes with MGMT re-expression as a marker. Indeed, our previous results showed that promoting DNA methylation in GBM increased response to TMZ in association with the down regulation of different sets of genes including MGMT<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. With the mathematical modelisation, although the clonal selection hypothesis could not completely be discarded when looking only at the cell number dynamics, if both the cell number curves and the MGMT expression results were considered, then the hypothesis that there was a transient state from sensitive to resistant cells appeared to provide a better underlying explanation of the experimental results.</p>
    <p id="Par37">Deep sequencing of control and TMZ-treated U251 cell-lines allowed us to identify new genes that are transiently over-expressed after TMZ treatment. Analysis of gene expression reveals that both qualitatively and quantitatively, the level of genomic heterogeneity appears to be reduced in treated cells during a transient period (i.e., D4–D12) before increasing at D16. A PCA based on RNAseq data reveal that sensitive cells (i.e., Day 0) form a cluster that is closer to resistant cells (i.e., day 16) than to the transient resistance state (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>). From this study we selected four genes, which are implicated in cell survival and can be used as markers to define this state (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). We performed, in control and TMZ-treated cells, single cell analyses of the expression of 88 genes including the four markers and others implicated in the cell death program and survival mechanisms (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). This study showed that the transient state was not due to a subpopulation of cells but rather to a random distribution in the transient resistance state in the surviving cells. Analysis of the pathways over-expressed in U251<sup>TR</sup> cells revealed that histones could undergo important modifications. Targeting of histone acetylation by TSA, indeed proved to efficiently eradicate these cells and thus to prevent the appearance of highly resistant and proliferative cells both in vitro and in vivo (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>).</p>
    <p id="Par38">Our results, coupling phenotypic analyses in cell death and proliferation rates to RNAseq techniques, show that the cell line upon TMZ treatment undergoes an initial rapid selection process. This step constitutes a “bottleneck” during which the cells rely on a few survival mechanisms and have a reduced heterogeneity. Next, the cells expand to become “fit and resistant” through many different mechanisms rendering these cells difficult to target. This hypothesis fits partially with the “drug-tolerant population” recently observed and described by several groups<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup> upon selection with TKI. However, few marked differences can be pointed out: our results are in favor of the acquisition of MGMT expression by a specific process during TMZ treatment rather than selection of a pre-existing clone<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. The expression is not reversible when selective pressure by TMZ is removed, in contrast with other tumors, such as in non-small-cell lung carcinoma cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup> where reversibility to a former sensitive state was observed.</p>
    <p id="Par39">Taken together, our results show that the cells gradually acquire an irreversible resistance to TMZ and reveal a transient state with a reduced proliferation rate, G2/M arrest, distinctive mitochondrial metabolism and reduced aggressivity in vivo. The U251<sup>TR</sup> population observed between D4 and D12 is not a uniform one as the four genes used as markers are not equally distributed along the cells. This result suggests that these genes are expressed in particular cells that cooperate together to create a transient state through their effect on cell survival. From this population and upon epigenetic remodeling the resistant population can thus emerge.</p>
    <p id="Par40">Our work provide a new rationale in the anti-GBM therapy with the use of HDI immediately after TMZ to ensure eradication of the tolerant population before the development of highly resistant fast growing tumors. This work has to be completed in primary cultures both in vitro and in vivo in mice.</p>
