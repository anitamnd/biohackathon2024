      <p>Data-independent
acquisition-mass spectrometry (DIA-MS) is the
method of choice for deep, consistent, and accurate single-shot profiling
in bottom-up proteomics. While classic workflows for targeted quantification
from DIA-MS data require auxiliary data-dependent acquisition (DDA)
MS analysis of subject samples to derive prior-knowledge spectral
libraries, library-free approaches based on <italic>in silico</italic> prediction promise deep DIA-MS profiling with reduced experimental
effort and cost. Coverage and sensitivity in such analyses are however
limited, in part, by the large library size and persistent deviations
from the experimental data. We present MSLibrarian, a new workflow
and tool to obtain optimized predicted spectral libraries by the integrated
usage of spectrum-centric DIA data interpretation via the DIA-Umpire
approach to inform and calibrate the <italic>in silico</italic> predicted
library and analysis approach. Predicted-vs-observed comparisons enabled
optimization of intensity prediction parameters, calibration of retention
time prediction for deviating chromatographic setups, and optimization
of the library scope and sample representativeness. Benchmarking via
a dedicated ground-truth-embedded experiment of species-mixed proteins
and quantitative ratio-validation confirmed gains of up to 13% on
peptide and 8% on protein level at equivalent FDR control and validation
criteria. MSLibrarian is made available as an open-source R software
package, including step-by-step user instructions, at <uri xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://github.com/MarcIsak/MSLibrarian">https://github.com/MarcIsak/MSLibrarian</uri>.</p>

    <title>Introduction</title>
    <p>Mass spectrometry-based
proteomics allows for the quantification
of thousands of proteins in a single sample.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref></sup> Especially, data-independent acquisition (DIA) of mass spectra allows
for reproducible protein quantification with few missing values.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref></sup> In classical, targeted peptide-centric DIA analysis,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref></sup> a spectral library is required to identify peptides from the highly
convoluted DIA-MS data. Such a spectral library is commonly built
from data-dependent acquisition (DDA) runs of prefractionated experiment-specific
samples.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref></sup> Despite the benefits of building a sample-specific
and deep library, this approach requires an additional sample amount,
preparation, and MS run time. Also, as the semistochastic DDA method
selects the most abundant precursors for sequencing, precursors of
low abundant proteins might go undetected. As an alternative to experimental
DDA spectral libraries, two classes of library-free approaches to
the interpretation of DIA-MS data have been devised. First, spectrum-centric
conversion approaches such as DIA-Umpire and Spectronaut directDIA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref></sup> convert the DIA- to a pseudo-DDA data structure for compatibility
with classic spectrum-centric analysis workflows, based on grouping
precursor and fragment ion signals from coelution and XIC signal correlation
along the chromatographic dimension. While reaching high levels of
proteomic coverage, conversion approaches so far do not reach the
level of quantitative accuracy or proteomic depth achievable with
dedicated, sample-specific libraries generated by DDA-MS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref></sup> In contrast, recent applications of deep learning to predict MS/MS
spectra and retention times now enable accurate <italic>in silico</italic> prediction of spectral libraries to support targeted, peptide-centric
queries of virtually any peptide or precursor, extending DIA capabilities
to previously uncharacterized proteomes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>−<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref></sup> Similar to
spectrum-centric-conversion approaches, predicted spectral libraries
provide deep profiling in peptide-centric mining of DIA data sets,
albeit not at the depth of dedicated and fractionated project-specific
libraries. The prediction framework and Web server Prosit provides
easy-to-use access to accurately predicted spectral libraries for
DIA queries.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref></sup> In order to adapt and optimize
fragmentation predictions to user’s MS instruments, users need
to determine the optimal prediction parameter (normalized collision
energy, CE) through provision of a set of identified DDA-MS spectra
acquired with the same MS instrument and fragmentation parameters
as the DIA data to be analyzed using the Prosit-predicted spectral
library. The Prosit framework does currently not allow users to calibrate
the retention time predictions to user-observed values. Three factors
which limit the sensitivity of DIA-MS analyses via such <italic>in
silico</italic> predicted libraries are (i) the prevailing inaccuracies
of predicted spectra and/or stochasticity of observed fragmentation
patterns, (ii) inaccuracies in expected retention times, as caused, <italic>e.g.</italic>, by the use of different chromatographic equipment
or laboratory-to-laboratory variability, as well as (iii) the sheer
library and search space size, resulting in a large number of tests
and need for strict multiple hypothesis testing correction in statistical
validation and FDR control.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref></sup></p>
    <p>Here we present MSLibrarian, a workflow building on the Prosit,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref></sup> DIA-Umpire,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref></sup> and
DeepLC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref></sup> frameworks, allowing one to obtain
optimized predicted spectral libraries for DIA proteomics. This is
related to existing predicted spectral library refinement strategies
that rely on gas-phase fractionated, narrow isolation window DIA measurements
and chromatogram libraries<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref></sup> or which reuse
empirically observed retention times and fragmentation patterns in
multipass analyses.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref></sup> In contrast to these,
MSLibrarian leverages a spectrum-centric conversion and analysis approach
to optimize parameters for the prediction of both fragmentation patterns
as well as chromatographic retention time directly based on the DIA
data set being analyzed. In addition, MSLibrarian employs variable
FDR multipass analysis to constrain the target protein set and thereby
improve the library representativeness, as well as library size optimization
by fragment ion selection. We quantified the improvements for predicted
library-based DIA-MS data analysis incurred by MSLibrarian calibration
based on a dedicated ground-truth-embedded species mixture experiment
and additional data sets and tools. The MSLibrarian R package, with
step-by-step user instructions, is available at <uri xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://github.com/MarcIsak/MSLibrarian">https://github.com/MarcIsak/MSLibrarian</uri>.</p>

      <title>Generation of a Ground-Truth Mixed Species
Proteome Data Set</title>
      <p>To benchmark prospective improvements for
quantitative DIA-MS data
analyses via MSLibrarian library calibrations, we generated a simplistic
two-species mixture data set composed of tryptic peptides derived
from mouse spleen and yeast full proteomes. Mouse spleens were harvested
from 12-week-old female C57BL/6J mice and then homogenized in PBS
(Gibco) using a bead-beater (MP-Biomedicals). Proteins were extracted
and denatured with 8 M urea in 0.1 mM ammonium bicarbonate (Sigma-Aldrich),
and debris was remove by centrifugation at 14,000 <italic>g</italic> for 5 min. Cysteines were reduced using 50 mM tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine
(Sigma-Aldrich) and then alkylated with 100 mM iodoacetamide (Sigma-Aldrich).
Protein concentration was determined with the bicinchoninic acid assay
(Thermo Scientific). Protein extract (50 μg) was digested with
1 μg of sequencing grade modified trypsin (Promega). The resulting
peptides were desalted with C18 reversed-phase chromatography (ultramicrospin-columns)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Harvard Apparatus).
The mouse peptides were dried down with a vacuum concentrator (Savant).
Yeast tryptic peptides, from <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> whole-cell protein extract, were purchased from Promega (Promega
catalog no. V7461). Mouse and yeast peptides were resuspended in 0.1%
formic acid, 2% acetonitrile in water at a concentration of 1 μg/μL
and mixed at a ratio of 6:1 v/v mouse–yeast for samples of
condition A and 1:6 v/v mouse–yeast of condition B. A volume
of 1 μg of the mouse–yeast hybrid proteomes were analyzed
with DIA-MS in technical reinjection triplicates per each of the two
conditions A and B.</p>

      <title>Data-Independent Acquisition MS Analysis
of Mouse–Yeast
Hybrid Samples</title>
      <p>All peptide analyses were performed on a Q
Exactive HF-X mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) connected
to an EASY-nLC 1200 ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography system
(Thermo Fisher Scientific). Peptides were trapped on the precolumn
(PepMap100 C18 3 μm; 75 μm × 2 cm, Thermo Fisher
Scientific) and separated on an EASY-Spray column (ES803, column temperature
45 °C, Thermo Fisher Scientific). Equilibrations of columns and
sample loading were performed per manufacturer’s guidelines.
Solvent A was 0.1% formic acid, and solvent B (0.1% formic acid, 80%
acetonitrile) was used to run a linear gradient from 5 to 38% over
120 min at a flow rate of 350 nL/min. The mass range for MS1 was 350–1 650 <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> with a resolution of 120,000 and a
resolution of 30,000 for MS/MS with stepped normalized collision energies
(NCE) of 25.5, 27, and 30. The data-independent acquisition (DIA)
method was derived from Bruderer <italic>et al.</italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>)). The 44 variably sized MS/MS windows were 350–371,
370–387, 386–403, 402–416, 415–427, 426–439,
438–451, 450–462, 461–472, 471–483, 482–494,
493–505, 504–515, 514–525, 524–537, 536–548,

734–753, 752–771, 770–790, 789–811, 810–832,
831–857, 856–884, 883–916, 915–955, 954–997,
996–1057, 1 056–1 135 and 1 134–1 650 <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic>, resulting in a total cycle time of
∼3.3 s and 6–8 sampling points per chromatographic peak
on average.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec2.3">
      <title>Data-Dependent Acquisition MS Analysis</title>
      <p>A representative
sample of the mouse spleen proteome was analyzed by DDA mass spectrometry
to generate identification results to calibrate the Prosit prediction
model with a fixed CE value along the canonical workflow for Prosit
predictions.</p>
      <p>For data dependent acquisition, one full MS scan
(resolution 60,000 at 200 <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic>; mass
range 350–1650 <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic>) was followed
by MS/MS scans (resolution 15,000 at 200 <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic>) of the 20 most abundant ion signals. The precursor ions
were isolated with a 1.6 <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> width
and fragmented using higher-energy collisional-induced dissociation
at a normalized collision energy of 27. Charge state screening was
enabled and unassigned or singly charged ions were rejected. The dynamic
exclusion window was set to 15 s. Only MS precursors that exceeded
a threshold of 8 × 10<sup>3</sup> were allowed to trigger MS/MS
scans. The ion accumulation time (IT) was set to 100 ms (MS) and 30
ms (MS/MS) using an automatic gain control (AGC) target setting of
2 × 10<sup>5</sup> (MS and MS/MS).</p>

      <title>Determination of CE for
Spectral Library Predictions with the
Prosit Online Tool</title>
      <p>The acquired DDA-MS file, as described
in the previous section, was imported into RecalOffline (Build No.
3.0.0.19, Thermo Fisher) and sliced to only include the first 100
min of the LC gradient. The slicing was made to acquire a file smaller
than 2 GB, a restriction imposed by the Prosit CE calibration online
tool. Subsequently, the sliced DDA-MS file was loaded into MaxQuant
(v.1.6.1.0) to be searched with trypsin as the enzyme, LFQ disabled,
no modifications except carbamidomethyl (C) set as a fixed modification.
A protein sequence FASTA, created from the canonical mouse proteome
(<italic>Mus musculus</italic>, UniProt/Swiss-Prot release 2021_03),
was configured as a sequence database. Identification settings were
left at the default, with an FDR = 1% on PSM and protein level, and
the second peptide search was disabled. Once the MaxQuant search was
finished, the resulting msms.txt file and the sliced DDA-MS file were
uploaded to the Prosit server according to the instructions for the
online CE calibration tool. Similarly, a representative DDA-MS file
was sliced in RecalOffline and used to determine an optimal CE value
spectral library predictions for the external mixed species data set
(PXD005573). MaxQuant parameters were the same as for the sliced DDA-MS
file for the mouse-spleen sample described above. A merged protein
sequence FASTA, created from the individual FASTA files of the canonical
proteomes for human, yeast, <italic>C. elegans</italic>, <italic>E.
coli</italic> strain K12 (UniProt release 2021_03, canonical sequences,
UP000005640, UP000002311, UP000001940, and UP000000625), was used

      <title>Spectrum-Centric DIA-MS Data Analysis</title>
      <p>As an integral
part of the MSLibrarian workflow, DIA-MS data were first analyzed
via the DIA-Umpire workflow to convert DIA data structures to pseudo-DDA
(pDDA) spectra (MSconvert, ProteoWizard release 3.0.20365) via the
implemented DIA-Umpire signal extraction module, operated with standard
parameters). pDDA spectra were then searched against the respective
protein sequence database via MSFragger (v3.2) where the default parameter
file (*.params) for closed searches was used as a template with trypsin
as the enzyme, precursor charges of 2 and 3, and peptide lengths from
7 to 30 AA allowed. Carbamidomethylation on cysteines was set as the
fixed modification but no variable modifications. The MSFragger output
pep.xml-files were imported into PeptideProphet (TPP v.5.2.0) for
PSM validation using the nonparametric model with decoys modeling
the negative PSM distribution. The retention time model and accurate
mass binning options of PeptideProphet were enabled. The resulting
*pep.xml files were then imported into iProphet (TPP v.5.2.0) for
further PSM validation. Only PSMs having a posterior error probability
(local FDR) ≤ 0.01 were used for consensus spectral library
creation with Spectrast (TPP v.5.2.0) to ensure high spectral quality.
A set of 11 iRT peptides with known iRT values (Biognosys, iRT kit)
were used by Spectrast to convert RT in seconds to iRT values. OpenSwathAssayGenerator
(OpenMS v2.5.0) was then used to convert the consensus.splib library
format into the MSLibrarian-compatible OpenSwath (.TSV) format to
be used as a latter calibration library, ready for comparisons to
the predicted spectra per each matched peptide precursor ion. Spectrum-centric
search and assembly of results into the calibration library are accessible

length- and charge-dependent, variable collision energies (CE-LZ).
Further processing steps are executed via the function mod.spectral.lib

predictions, (ii) protein group subsetting to a list of proteins from
first-pass DIA-NN analysis with relaxed FDR criterion (5% protein-level

      <title>Peptide-Centric
DIA-MS Data Analysis</title>
      <p>For peptide-centric
analyses of the DIA data sets, leveraging either of the compared spectral
libraries as prior information for the analysis, DIA-NN (v1.8)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref></sup> and EncyclopeDIA (v1.2.2)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref></sup> tools were employed. DIA-NN operated directly on the Thermo.raw
files, whereas EncyclopeDIA analysis commenced from .mzML format upon
conversion via MSconvert (Centroiding the MS1 level via the peak picking
option, ProteoWizard release 3.0.20365). DIA-NN was run with fixed
MS1 accuracies (4.92 and 3.93 ppm for the mouse-yeast data set and
external mixed species data set, respectively) based on recommended
MS1 values by DIA-NN from first pass analysis of the samples with
automated determination of optimal mass accuracies. The MS/MS accuracy
was automatically determined by DIA-NN as a consequence of the set
fixed MS1 accuracies (MS/MS accuracy = 2 × 10<sup>–5</sup>, <italic>i.e.</italic>, 20 ppm, for both data sets). The retention
time extraction window was determined individually for all MS runs
analyzed via the automated optimization procedure implemented in DIA-NN.
Protein inference was enabled, and the quantification strategy was
set to Robust LC = High Accuracy. The precursor-level FDR was set
to 1%. The flag report-lib-info was set in order to report fragment-level
intensities for quantification in the R package iq.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref></sup> Output main DIA-NN reports were filtered with a global
FDR = 0.01 on both the precursor level and protein group level. Quantitative
matrices on the peptide and protein group and gene level were extracted
from the main DIA-NN reports using the diann-rpackage (<uri xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://github.com/vdemichev/diann-rpackage">https://github.com/vdemichev/diann-rpackage</uri>). For fragment-level MaxLFQ analysis via iq,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref></sup> fragment ion information associated with each entry in
the main DIA-NN reports (intensities from column <italic>Fragment.Quant.Corrected</italic>) was extracted and concatenated to its precursor, protein group,
and MS run. Note that for the mouse-yeast data set, where raw intensities
in the absence of further processing were of interest, values from
column <italic>Fragment.Quant.Raw</italic> were used. Fragment ions
with a log2-intensity ≤ 0 were removed. Median normalization
in iq was applied to the external mixed species data set, while no
normalization was applied to the mouse-yeast data set. MaxLFQ-based
pairwise ratio estimation between common fragment ions for the same
precursors of each protein group was performed. In the last step,
a full quantitative intensity matrix with protein groups as row headers
and MS-runs as column headers was written out. Similarly, a quantitative
matrix for stripped peptide sequences was generated, where fragment
ions and precursors were grouped based on peptide sequences.</p>
      <p>For the EncyclopeDIA analyses, all generated spectral libraries were
first converted from the Spectronaut format (.CSV) to the DLIB-format.
Following library conversions, DIA-MS files were analyzed sequentially
for each library using default settings and with HCD as fragmentation.
A global EncyclopeDIA analysis was then carried out to retrieve quantitative
matrices for peptides and protein groups identified with a FDR ≤
0.01. Median normalization was applied to the quantitative matrices
using the R-package NormalyzerDE.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref></sup></p>

      <title>Guiding
Principles of the MSLibrarian Workflow</title>
      <p>The
MSLibrarian workflow builds on Prosit <italic>in silico</italic> predicted
spectral libraries and refines these for improved performance in downstream
targeted, peptide-centric DIA analyses. Refinement and optimization
via MSLibrarian is based on three key principles:<list id="list1" list-type="simple"><list-item><label>(I)</label><p>Peptide fragmentation
is subject to
instrument- and run-by-run variability and differs in narrow isolation-window
DDA when compared to wide-isolation-window DIA operation of the mass
spectrometer. MSLibrarian optimizes the Prosit CE prediction parameter
directly comparing against the DIA data to be analyzed using the library,
and in a peptide charge state- and -length-dependent manner and using
the dot product as a metric. To this end, rather than trying different
prediction parameters “on the fly”, MSLibrarian relies
on fragment ion intensities predicted across a range of collision
energy parameter settings <italic>a priori</italic>, efficiently stored
in a ‘spectral warehouse’.sql database and available
for multiple species (see <xref rid="sec2" ref-type="other">Materials and Methods</xref> section).</p></list-item><list-item><label>(II)</label><p>Peptide
retention time and accuracy
of its prediction depend on training data and LC equipment, such as
bead pore size and chemistry, used in each laboratory. MSLibrarian
negotiates prediction of more accurate retention times, calibrating
retention time prediction based on observed values in the DIA data
set and an underlying liquid chromatography setup. Notably, a conservative
and deliberate decision not to (re-) use the empirically observed
retention time values of DIA-Umpire-identified precursors in subsequent
peptide-centric analyses was made. We reason that this choice is conservative
as it counteracts potential leakage of false positive spectrum-centric
identifications into the peptide-centric analysis results because
of artificially low retention time offsets for a subset of target
peptides where spectrum-centric evidence is available.</p></list-item><list-item><label>(III)</label><p>Single-shot DIA measurements with
a gradient time below 2 h likely do not contain more than 100,000
detectable precursor signals due to technological constraints, such
as limited intrascan dynamic range.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref></sup> Thus,
querying millions of predictable precursors per proteome unnecessarily
escalates the need for multiple testing correction in statistical
FDR control and, thereby, limits the sensitivity and coverage of such
analyses. It is thus beneficial to trim the library to a more relevant
set of precursors containing those detectable in the DIA-MS record
while not compromising discovery by removing relevant ones.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref></sup> To this end, MSLibrarian implements a two-tiered
library representativeness optimization approach based on multipass
variable FDR analysis and transition filtering.</p></list-item></list></p>

      <p>In the first step, predicted spectra are obtained
using the Prosit
Web server (see <xref rid="sec2" ref-type="other">Materials and Methods</xref>). Note
that for frequently studied proteomes (<italic>H. sapiens</italic>, <italic>M. musculus</italic>, <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, <italic>C. elegans</italic>, <italic>E. coli</italic>, and <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>), precomputed spectral warehouse databases can be downloaded from <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://Zenodo.org">Zenodo.org</ext-link> from within MSLibrarian
(<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref></xref>A, left).</p>
      <p>In the second step, DIA-MS data are converted to pseudo-DDA (pDDA)
spectra which are then identified by a spectrum-centric search against
the protein sequence database (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref></xref>A, left).</p>
      <p>In the third step, the identified spectra
are then compared to
the set of spectra predicted for this precursor across the range of
CE prediction parameter values (stored in the spectral warehouse database)
using the dot product score. Comparisons are binned by peptide length
and precursor charge state, producing dot product distributions as
exemplified in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref></xref>B for typically ∼100–1200 precursors per comparison
bin (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref></xref>C). For
each length and charge bin, spectra predicted with collision energies
resulting in maximal similarity, as measured by the dot product score,
are selected for inclusion into the MSLibrarian library (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref></xref>D and <xref rid="sec2" ref-type="other">Materials and Methods</xref>).</p>
      <p>In the fourth step, peptide
retention times are predicted via the
DeepLC tool, with calibration based on the retention times of peptides
identified via spectrum-centric analysis, effectively adjusting parameters
for deviating chromatographic setups (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref></xref>E).</p>
      <p>In the fifth step, the set of detectable
proteins is estimated
by a reduced stringency peptide-centric analysis of the DIA data with
the MSLibrarian library in its current state using DIA-NN, noting
all target protein groups identified at an increased FDR threshold
of 5% on the protein level. In addition, the product library is trimmed,
retaining only the 6–14 most-intense fragment ion signals of
a given spectrum (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref></xref>A, center). The workflow produces as output a refined version

      <title>Benchmarking DIA-Guided Library Calibration
via MSLibrarian</title>
      <p>To validate the impact of library refinements
through MSLibrarian
and to ensure these were not noise from false positive identifications,
we generated a simple two-proteome species mixture proteomic data
set with a known ground truth embedded as defined proteome mixing
ratios, along the LFQbench rationale.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref></sup> Specifically,
we acquired DIA data of a mouse-yeast tryptic peptide mixture with
a stable amount of mouse and yeast tryptic peptides mixed to obtain
a ratio of 6:1 for mouse peptides and 1:6 for yeast peptides in the
comparison of sample A to sample B (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>A and <xref rid="sec2" ref-type="other">Materials and Methods</xref>). Considering only identifications that were validated by conformance
of the observed quantitative ratio with the true mixing ratio allowed
us to compare the libraries’ proteomic profiling efficiency,
with auxiliary confidence in the correctness of the assigned signals
and validity of observed gains. As a reference baseline of the comparison,
the canonical Prosit-derived library workflow was applied, obtaining
a full proteome predicted library with a fixed collision energy setting,
calibrated based on a side-by-side DDA-MS raw file and accompanying
MaxQuant search results (Fixed CE = 30, “STD-Prosit”
Library, <xref rid="sec2" ref-type="other">Materials and Methods</xref>). In order
to assess the impact of the individual library refinement steps applied
by MSLibrarian, partially optimized libraries gradually including
more refinement steps toward the full MSLibrarian-calibrated library
were included. Specifically, library CE-LZ included only collision
energy parameter optimizations affecting fragment intensities; library
CE-30_RT included only retention time prediction recalibration via
DeepLC; library CE-LZ_RT combined both variable collision energy parameter
optimization and retention time prediction recalibration; library
CE-LZ_LC_Pr added protein set confinement; and the final, fully MSLibrarian-calibrated
library CE-LZ_RT_Pr_Tr added fragment selection (schematized in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>A, bottom panel).
The libraries were then searched against the DIA-MS data by peptide-centric
analysis via DIA-NN and peptides and proteins quantified via the iq
package<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref></sup> that implements the MaxLFQ approach
to calculate the relative protein group and peptide quantities for
all samples. Cross-sample ratios were calculated on both the peptide
and protein levels separately, and identifications with quantitative
ratios conforming with the known mixing ratio within the ±20%
tolerance were considered valid in the primary benchmark (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>B, <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.jproteome.1c00796/suppl_file/pr1c00796_si_002.xlsx">Table S1</ext-link>, and <xref rid="sec2" ref-type="other">Materials and Methods</xref>). At the peptide level, up to 8% improvement was observed, with
library modifications ranking by decreasing benefit for peptide-level
performance as follows: protein set confinement &gt; LC calibration
&gt;
transition selection (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>C). Variable CE selection, in this data set, was detrimental
to peptide-level performance, whereas this was not the case on the
protein level. On the protein level, a similar improvement of up to
7.7% additional protein groups (henceforth also referred to as proteins)
detectable with valid quantitative ratios was observed, albeit only
in the absence of transition filtering that had a detrimental impact
on the fidelity of protein quantities in this data set (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>D). Having confirmed that more
ratio-conformant, valid quantifications were produced when employing
refined libraries in peptide-centric processing, we moved on to compare
the total identification numbers reported at equivalent FDR control
per analysis (global protein and precursor level FDR 1%). Overall,
up to 7% more peptides and 3% more proteins (9534 vs 9287) were identified
using the MSLibrarian-calibrated library relative to the standard
Prosit library (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>E). Overall, MSLibrarian-based calibration of predicted libraries,
in our hands, led to noticeable improvements in peptide-centric DIA-MS
analyses. Notably, library improvements resulted primarily in improved
quantification as observed by ratio validation analysis, with more
modest gains in total identification numbers irrespective of quantitative
conformance criteria (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>E). An overview of observed species ratios and ratio distributions

      <title>Performance with External Data Set and Alternative Analysis
Tool</title>
      <p>Next, we explored whether the benefits of DIA-based
calibration of predicted spectral libraries observed in our internal
benchmark experiment could also be replicated on an external data
set using an alternative software framework for targeted, peptide-centric
analysis with these libraries as prior knowledge. We selected a high
complexity data set generated by Bruderer <italic>et al.</italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>) with a similar multispecies mixture setup, containing
a total of four proteomes with only small mixing ratio differences
between the two sample sets comprising the “low ratio”
LFQbench data set in the study. We then analyzed this data set via
the standard Prosit workflow, calibrating the CE parameter based on
the side-by-side DDA-MS measurement and MaxQuant search results to
obtain the standard Prosit library. As described above, we comparatively
processed the data set with the MSLibrarian workflow, in part and
in full, to generate the partially processed as well as fully processed
DIA-calibrated library (compare scheme in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>A, bottom panel). The DIA data were then
analyzed by peptide-centric analysis by DIA-NN as above as well as
using EncyclopeDIA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref></sup> as an alternative
software (For parameters, see the <xref rid="sec2" ref-type="other">Materials and Methods</xref>). Identifications per species were then categorized based on validity
of their quantitative ratios, relative to the true mixing ratio with
±20% tolerance, equivalent to the benchmark used for the internal
data set presented above (exemplified in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref></xref>A).</p>

    <sec id="sec3.5">
      <title>Simplified Workflow with Fixed Collision Energy Setting</title>
      <p>Based on the observation that variable CE calibration was beneficial
for library performance exclusively in the Bruderer <italic>et al.</italic> data set, we explored the impact of library optimizations on raw
scores in peptide-centric analysis and evaluated the performance of
an abbreviated MSLibrarian workflow that omits variable CE calibration.
Based on the analyses via EncyclopeDIA, raw score distributions for
both the internal mouse-yeast data set and the external Bruderer <italic>et al.</italic> data set were compared (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.jproteome.1c00796/suppl_file/pr1c00796_si_001.pdf">Figure S5A,B</ext-link>). Retention time recalibration via DeepLC leads to sharper
delta.RT score distributions and significantly lower absolute delta.RT
readings consistently across replicates and both data sets (unpaired
t.test <italic>p</italic> &lt; 10 × 10<sup>–4</sup> in
all three replicates of both data sets, <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.jproteome.1c00796/suppl_file/pr1c00796_si_001.pdf">Figure S5A</ext-link>). Variable CE selection, comparing the library CE-LZ versus
the respective standard, fixed CE library, leads to significantly
higher Spectrum.Similarity scores in analysis of the Bruderer <italic>et al.</italic> data set, consistently across replicates (unpaired
t.test <italic>p</italic> &lt; 10 × 10<sup>–4</sup> in
all three replicates, <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.jproteome.1c00796/suppl_file/pr1c00796_si_001.pdf">Figure S5B</ext-link>). In the
mouse-yeast data set, however, Spectrum.Similarity is reduced in two
out of three replicates and is insignificantly higher in the third
replicate (unpaired t.test <italic>p</italic> &lt; 10 × 10<sup>–4</sup> for reduced similarity in the first two replicates, <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.jproteome.1c00796/suppl_file/pr1c00796_si_001.pdf">Figure S5B</ext-link>). These observations indicate that
the improvements by retention time recalibration more consistently
benefit library quality than is the case for variable CE selection,
which shows mixed results and therefore needs to be evaluated on a
case-by-case basis.</p>
      <p>Therefore, we assessed the performance of
a workflow based on single, fixed CE, in combination with downstream
optimization modules of MSLibrarian. Specifically, we generated libraries
(fixed CE_Pr and fixed CE Pr_Tr) per each data set and compared their
performance with the corresponding variable CE libraries (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.jproteome.1c00796/suppl_file/pr1c00796_si_001.pdf">Figure S4</ext-link> and see <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.jproteome.1c00796/suppl_file/pr1c00796_si_001.pdf">scheme in panel B</ext-link>). Indeed, fixed CE libraries, in combination with
the MSLibrarian downstream processing (RT, Pr, Tr) exhibit good performance
as judged by ratio-valid identifications along the benchmarking criteria
introduced above (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.jproteome.1c00796/suppl_file/pr1c00796_si_001.pdf">Figure S4A</ext-link>). On the peptide
level, performance was indistinguishable from variable CE libraries
in the mouse-yeast data set (maximal gain, 8.3% in both cases) and
similar in the Bruderer <italic>et al.</italic> data set (11.8% vs
13.4% maximal gain with fixed vs variable CE calibration libraries,
respectively) (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.jproteome.1c00796/suppl_file/pr1c00796_si_001.pdf">Figure S4A</ext-link>). Protein level
performance remained in most cases optimal when going the extra mile
of variable CE selection (6.9% vs 7.7% maximal gain in mouse-yeast
and 7.2% vs 7.8% maximal gain in the Bruderer <italic>et al.</italic> data set with fixed vs variable CE, respectively, <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.jproteome.1c00796/suppl_file/pr1c00796_si_001.pdf">Figure S4A</ext-link>). Total identifications remained essentially unchanged
(<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.jproteome.1c00796/suppl_file/pr1c00796_si_001.pdf">Figure S4C</ext-link>). The shortened workflow based
on fixed CE prediction, along the standard workflow or via a fixed
CE approach in MSLibrarian directly on the DIA data, provided a viable
entry point to optimization using the downstream modules of MSLibrarian
with performance levels comparable to those of the full workflow with
variable CE calibration.</p>

      <title>Impact of Library Optimization on Quantification
Quality Metrics</title>
      <p>To further explore the impact of MSLibrarian-based
library optimization
and the protein quantification strategy employed on the goodness of
quantification, we used additional quality metrics relating to accuracy,
precision, and variation of quantification in the external data set
from Bruderer <italic>et al.</italic> Specifically, we measured (i)
the precision of quantification based on the cumulative interquartile
range of log2 fold change distributions observed across all species;
(ii) the accuracy of quantification based on the cumulative absolute
offsets of the observed log2 fold change distributions (represented
by the most frequently observed value, <italic>mode</italic>) from
the theoretical centers as per the known mixing ratios. In addition,
offsets of % intensity change in linear space, equivalent to the analysis
presented by Bruderer <italic>et al.</italic>,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref></sup> were employed as metrics for quantitative accuracy. Further,
(iii) the coefficient of variation of protein group quantities within
experimental replicates of the same biological condition was assessed.</p>
      <p>First, we compared downstream protein quantification on precursor
level (MaxLFQ, as implemented in DIA-NN) against quantification with
ratio maximization on the fragment ion level (fragment-level MaxLFQ,
as implemented in the R package iq), based on the analysis with the
fully MSLibrarian-optimized library CE-LZ_RT_Pr_Tr. Both, log2 fold-change
ratio distributions as well as % change distributions on a linear
scale indicated higher accuracy of <italic>E. coli</italic> ratios
and % change values (lower offset to theoretical value) when employing
fragment-level ratio normalization via the iq package (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref></xref>A, lower panels). When simplified
via the interquartile ranges, precision appeared similar between the
two methods, with a small advantage of the fragment-level procedure
via iq (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref></xref>B,
left). However, quantification via iq clearly showed the benefits
on the level of quantitative accuracy, indicated by lower overall
offsets of the distributions from the theoretical ratios (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref></xref>B, right).</p>

      </fig>
      <p>Second, upon selection
of the fragment-level ratio maximization
strategy, we explored the impact of MSLibarian processing on the coefficient
of variation of protein quantification across the different spectral
libraries under investigation. Protein-level variation across libraries
essentially remained stable, with only libraries CE-LZ, CE-39_RT,
and CE-LZ_RT showing statistically significant reductions of observed
CVs relative to the STD (CE-39) library (unpaired t.test <italic>p</italic>-values of 8 × 10<sup>–16</sup>, 5.1 × 10<sup>–3</sup>, and 6 × 10<sup>–3</sup>, respectively, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref></xref>C). The further processed libraries
including protein set optimization, CE-LZ_RT_Pr and CE-LZ_Pr_Tr, did
not show significant changes of CV values (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref></xref>C).</p>
      <p>Third, we explored the precision
and accuracy of quantification
across the different libraries using the metrics as described above
(<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref></xref>D). Precision
of quantification remained essentially stable, with a minor negative
impact of library processing (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref></xref>D, left), whereas accuracy of quantification did improve
with library processing (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref></xref>D, right), suggesting that primarily improved accuracy,
rather than precision, contributes to the observed gains of correctly
quantified proteins upon MSLibrarian optimization.</p>

    <title>Conclusions</title>
    <p>Predicted spectral libraries promise deep mining of DIA data sets
independent of side-by-side DDA-MS analyses, yet with limited sensitivity
of such analyses due to residual differences between predictions and
the signals in the DIA data and large library search space.</p>
    <p>Here, we present an approach to calibrate predicted spectral libraries
directly based on the DIA-MS data set under analysis, realizing synergies
between the two conceptually different approaches to library-free
DIA analysis, spectrum-centric conversion via, e.g., DIA-Umpire<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref></sup> and <italic>in silico</italic> prediction via, <italic>e.g.</italic>, Prosit.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref></sup></p>
    <p>We implemented
this approach in an R package, MSLibrarian, that
supplements the Prosit framework to generate DIA-refined and trimmed
spectral libraries with up to 13% improved performance as demonstrated
using internal and external ground truth data sets and across two
popular tools for DIA-MS data analysis. We demonstrated that library
optimizations transcend into improved peptide-centric DIA-MS analysis
results on the levels of both, identification sensitivity (absolute
numbers of identified analytes at matched <italic>q</italic>-value
cutoff), as well as improved quantification as assessed by multiple
quality metrics. Selection of variable CE parameters for spectrum
prediction proved beneficial only in one of the two data sets. As
an alternative route, we demonstrated the utility and performance
of a simplified workflow employing spectra predicted with static CE
parameters in combination with the downstream optimization modules.
Although MSLibrarian has been tested for DIA-MS data sets generated
via nanoflow liquid chromatography and high-resolution Orbitrap mass
spectrometry, we expect these benefits to extend to other DIA-enabled
LC-MS instrumentation and software not covered in our evaluations.
MSLibrarian leverages synergies between spectrum-centric and prediction-based
library-free analysis approaches to facilitate deeper and more accurate
mining of DIA-MS data maps and should find wide application in the
field of DIA-based proteomics. It is implemented in the popular R
framework for easy usage and extensibility by the DIA proteomics community
