      <sec id="gix032s1">
        <title>Background:</title>
        <p>Recent large-scale undertakings such as ENCODE and Roadmap Epigenomics have generated experimental data mapped to the human reference genome (as genomic tracks) representing a variety of functional elements across a large number of cell types. Despite the high potential value of these publicly available data for a broad variety of investigations, little attention has been given to the analytical methodology necessary for their widespread utilisation.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="gix032s2">
        <title>Findings:</title>
        <p>We here present a first principled treatment of the analysis of collections of genomic tracks. We have developed novel computational and statistical methodology to permit comparative and confirmatory analyses across multiple and disparate data sources. We delineate a set of generic questions that are useful across a broad range of investigations and discuss the implications of choosing different statistical measures and null models. Examples include contrasting analyses across different tissues or diseases. The methodology has been implemented in a comprehensive open-source software system, the GSuite HyperBrowser. To make the functionality accessible to biologists, and to facilitate reproducible analysis, we have also developed a web-based interface providing an expertly guided and customizable way of utilizing the methodology. With this system, many novel biological questions can flexibly be posed and rapidly answered.</p>

      <sec id="gix032s3">
        <title>Conclusions:</title>
        <p>Through a combination of streamlined data acquisition, interoperable representation of dataset collections, and customizable statistical analysis with guided setup and interpretation, the GSuite HyperBrowser represents a first comprehensive solution for integrative analysis of track collections across the genome and epigenome.

    <title>Background</title>
    <p>Improvements in sequencing technologies in recent decades have enabled the determination of the DNA sequences of many large genomes as well as their functional interrogation. Genome-wide profiles for a variety of biological features are being systematically generated for a wide range of cell types, often via concentrated efforts by dedicated consortia. The Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) [<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] project marked a substantial leap in this respect by making available to the human genomics community a broad collection of cell line–specific data on DNA accessibility and transcription factor binding. The NIH Roadmap Epigenomics Mapping Consortium further contributed a significant amount of additional tissue- and cell-type–specific data to the public domain, including DNA methylation and histone modification profiles for a large number of primary cells. Kundaje et al. [<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] refer to the combined collection of ENCODE and Roadmap data as 127 human reference epigenomes. Most of these datasets are in the form of genomic tracks, i.e., sets of elements anchored to locations in a reference genome, which provide a good foundation for the integration of data representing disparate genomic features.</p>
    <p>The widespread utilization of these immense amounts of available data is hampered by a lack of tools providing automatic data integration and sound statistical analysis of large collections of diverse datasets. Frameworks and toolkits such as Bioconductor (R) [<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], bedtools (command line) [<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], Galaxy [<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], and HyperBrowser (web interface) [<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] have enabled the robust processing and analysis of genomic tracks with reduced development effort using a variety of interfaces. However, these tools are essentially limited to analyses involving either a single track or a pair of tracks, with no support for the analysis of track collections beyond the trivial concatenation of results per track. For investigations aiming to exploit larger data collections through comparative analyses across epigenomes or across genomic features, no general solutions are available (on any platform). Dedicated solutions do exist for specific applications (e.g., assessing a cell type–specific accessibility of a set of single nucleotide polymorphisms [SNPs] [<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] or annotating genomic variants [<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>–<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]), for specific analytical scenarios (e.g., enrichment analysis of one track against a collection [<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]), and for specific basic operations (e.g., calculating the number of base pairs covered by all tracks in a collection [<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] or computing the intersection of a collection of tracks with the elements of a single query track [<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]). Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">1</xref> presents these different frameworks and dedicated solutions in context. The lack of comprehensive methodologies leads to ad hoc development of analytical solutions in attempts to answer novel questions that draw on the power of large public or in-house data collections. This may severely limit exploitation of the full potential of current experimental technologies and public data repositories, particularly by research groups with limited bioinformatics resources. Furthermore, the prevalence of ad hoc solutions has a negative impact on reproducibility. A new layer of computational methodology is thus needed to directly approach generic questions formulated in the domain of track collections.</p>

        <p>The GSuite HyperBrowser in the context of existing tools and frameworks for genomic track analysis. The codebases of frameworks such as bedtools [<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], BioPython [<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], Bioconductor [<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], Galaxy [<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], and the Genomic HyperBrowser [<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] add a domain-specific layer on top of general programming languages, providing generic constructs for representing genomic track data and core operations on tracks (including some minimal support for analyzing multiple tracks). The GSuite HyperBrowser codebase is the first general platform to add a new layer of constructs for directly representing collections of tracks and providing core operations (analyses) to be applied to such track collections. Although the functionality of this codebase is provided through a web interface, the codebase is open source, and the same constructs may be used by any other relevant Python-based platform. Also, the underlying approach is general and could be correspondingly implemented in other programming languages. In addition to such general purpose framework, there are a variety of purpose-specific tools for track data. GenometriCorr [<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], deepTools2 [<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], and GREAT [<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] are examples of tools that operate on single/pairs of tracks and support specific analyses or domains. Furthermore, several tools implicitly make use of collections of genomic tracks for analyses in specific domains (e.g., FORGE [<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], GREGOR [<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], and CISTROME [<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]) or for specific types of analyses (e.g., EpiGraph [<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], MULTOVL [<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], EpiExplorer [<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], and LOLA [<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]).</p>

    <p>Here, we present GSuite HyperBrowser, the first comprehensive solution for the analysis of track collections across the genome and epigenome. GSuite HyperBrowser is an open-source, web-based system that enables analysis of a broad array of both hypothesis-driven and data-driven questions that may be posed using large collections of genomic tracks. We focus on questions of a comparative nature, where a track is contrasted to (or analyzed in the context of) other tracks. The intended input is one or more carefully assembled collections of tracks, with the tracks of a collection typically varying along a single dimension of interest. The input could be a collection of tracks for the same histone modification across cell types or a collection of tracks representing different histone modifications in the same cell type. The system uses a formalized representation of track collections and includes tools for compiling new collections from local files or public repositories. Analytical questions may relate to which tracks stand out from such a collection, which tracks of a collection are the most similar to a separate (query) track, or how the occurrence or co-occurrence of elements from individual tracks in the collection varies along the genome. Included within the system is guidance on how these generic questions can be meaningfully interpreted with respect to a specific genomic feature.</p>

      <title>Overview</title>
      <p>The present work is concerned with sets of information elements anchored to specific coordinates in a reference genome, which we refer to as genomic tracks (short form: tracks). A genomic track may consist of, e.g., the genome-wide set of experimentally determined locations of DNA methylation or DNA binding by a transcription factor. Often, an investigation may involve a carefully selected collection of tracks representing either different genomic features for a single cell type or a single feature for multiple cell types. We refer to a collection of tracks selected for a particular analytical purpose as a suite of tracks (short: suite).</p>
      <p>We define a simple and intuitive tabular format, GSuite, to represent suites of tracks. The GSuite format can represent data at a local or remote server, can include metadata, and can be seamlessly exchanged between individual tools in an analysis workflow. To allow efficient compilation of track suites from a variety of public repositories (like ENCODE and Roadmap Epigenomics) and thus enable integration of disparate data sources, we propose that rather than downloading and reorganizing tracks according to a unified structure, a concept akin to database views is preferable; tracks can be browsed and selected in a unified manner but are retrieved from their respective sources only when a user assembles a track suite.</p>
      <p>Even for a pair of tracks, many different questions can be asked regarding their relations [<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. In principle, the number of possible relations that can be queried for multiple tracks grows exponentially with the number of tracks involved. Also, the complexity of defining and interpreting analyses involving multiple heterogeneous tracks is very high. A particularly useful type of question is the comparative assessment of tracks in a suite, where the tracks may be contrasted based on their relation to one another, to a particular separate track, or to tracks of another suite. We delineate a set of generic questions that are useful across a broad range of investigations, explore their characteristics, and present a statistical methodology for their resolution. Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">1</xref> lists five of the main questions, along with associated descriptive statistics and hypothesis tests (details provided in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Additional File 1</xref>). The descriptive statistics can be based on different measures of similarity, and the hypothesis tests can be based on different null models [<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. A schematic view of the statistical analysis related to one of these questions is provided in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>.</p>

      <title>Illustrative example</title>
      <p>As an illustrative example, consider the exploration of how binding sites for a given transcription factor (TF) co-occur with binding sites of other TFs and with various epigenomic marks. Because TF binding varies between cell types, such an exploration should be conducted in a cell type–specific context. Here, we describe a process for determining the co-occurrence of ChIP-seq peaks for the GATA1 TF versus other TFs and functional epigenomic elements in K562 cells, an established cell line for which abundant experimental data are available. All analysis steps are performed using tools within the GSuite HyperBrowser system. Further details of the analysis and biological interpretations are discussed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Additional File 2</xref>.</p>
      <p>The first step is to browse available experimental datasets for K562 cells in the ENCODE repository, compile a GSuite file referring all K562 ENCODE tracks, and download these to the server (318 tracks). Using tools for GSuite customization, we isolated a single GATA1 track and compiled a suite of the 317 remaining tracks.</p>
      <p>We then determined which tracks (in the suite) exhibit the strongest similarity (in terms of peak co-occurrence) with the GATA1 track. The most critical aspect of such an analysis is the precise specification of the measure of similarity (co-occurrence). By selecting the tetrachoric correlation [<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>–<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] as similarity measure, we obtain a ranking of tracks that is not too dominated by the strongly varying number of elements per track. The tetrachoric correlation, ρ, is defined by assuming that the two tracks are generated by thresholding an underlying continuous, bivariate normally distributed variable, where ρ is then defined as the correlation in the underlying bivariate normal. The tetrachoric correlation ρ can be easily estimated from given tracks, e.g., using maximum likelihood techniques; we have used the R-package polycor [<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] to estimate ρ. Using this measure, the transcription factors SMARCA4, TAL1, EP300, and STAT5A were identified as high ranking. These TFs have all been previously reported as relevant for GATA1 (see the discussion in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Additional File 2</xref>).</p>
      <p>Because we did not filter out any K562 tracks included in the suite, the ranking includes experimental replicates for GATA1 as well as non-TF datasets such as histone modifications and DNase I accessibility. This provides a broad view of co-occurrence, including indications for TF cooperation, consistency across experimental replicates for the same TF, and the association of GATA1 with different chromatin states. As a confirmatory extension of the analysis, one can examine whether the high-ranked tracks are significantly more similar to GATA1 than the average for all tracks in the suite. This question can be answered by a hypothesis test available in the same tool used to produce the ranking; it uses a test statistic comparing the similarity of each track to the average of the suite. Different null models may be reasonable; e.g., a null model may assume that the data in the whole suite are fixed, whereas the peak locations in the separate track (GATA1) are assumed to be stochastic according to a distribution that preserves the empirical distribution of lengths and distances between the peaks [<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Because an average across the suite forms part of this test statistic, data for the whole suite are required to compute each single measure, meaning that the analysis is at the integrative multiplicity level (as defined in the “Classes of multiplicity for analyses of track suites” section).</p>

      <title>Representing suites of genomic tracks: the GSuite format</title>
      <p>Fundamentally, a collection of datasets is fully defined by a set of references to its constituents. For convenience, a plain text file of Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) for the contained datasets should be valid as a representation of a dataset collection. To further support relevant analyses, the format should permit inclusion of metadata defining important attributes of each individual dataset.</p>
      <p>We have defined a simple format that meets these requirements: GSuite. A plain text file of one URL per line is a valid GSuite instance. The format further allows the definition of headers that, among other functions, declare whether the included datasets are available locally or remotely. A tool that downloads datasets referred to by a collection can then iterate through the source GSuite, download each referred file, and replace the URLs with paths to the locally stored files. In addition to the URLs of the tracks, a GSuite file may include tab-separated columns representing metadata values for each dataset. A full definition of the GSuite format is provided in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Additional File 3</xref>.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec2-4">
      <title>Compiling suites from public repositories</title>
      <p>Although repositories such as ENCODE and Roadmap Epigenomics provide free access to large amounts of data, they are not designed for the extraction of large numbers of datasets according to shared characteristics, e.g., extracting large suites of tracks tailored toward a particular analysis. Furthermore, the different repositories do not use a common nomenclature, hindering the integration of related data from several repositories.</p>
      <p>A common solution to the integration of data from multiple repositories is to download all data from their respective sources and construct a meta-repository structured according to a common terminology (e.g., [<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]). However, such manual curation and organization is laborious, susceptible to errors or misunderstanding, and can easily become outdated. We therefore adopted a different approach to integrate tracks from multiple sources. Rather than downloading and re-organizing genomic tracks, we use a concept akin to database views; users can browse and select remotely located tracks based on metadata, resulting in a list of URLs of the chosen tracks (GSuite). The GSuite can be further modified and shared as a simple text file. The underlying genomic tracks are only downloaded when a user explicitly asks to create a local copy of the data.</p>
      <p>As a low-level access point, we provide a single interface for accessing different repositories according to their original (repository-specific) metadata terminology. This interface avoids the loss or misrepresentation of the exact metadata provided by the individual repositories.</p>
      <p>We also provide a high-level access point that sacrifices some degree of metadata precision to permit selection of related tracks across sources according to a unified vocabulary (e.g., all tracks for a particular histone modification across repositories). The high-level access point builds on the low-level access point and is based on a curated transformation of individual repository-level vocabularies into the unified vocabulary.</p>
      <p>The low-level and high-level access points currently support ENCODE [<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], Roadmap Epigenomics [<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], the International Cancer Genome Consortium data portal [<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], and the NHGRI-EBI GWAS Catalog [<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p>

      <title>Classes of multiplicity for analyses of track suites</title>
      <p>The analysis of multiple track ranges from simple repetition of the same computation on each track to analyses in which the tracks are highly intertwined in the computations and interpretations.</p>
      <p>To better delineate the different levels of integration associated with various analyses, we define the following classes of multiplicity for track suite analyses:</p>
      <sec id="sec2-5-1">
        <title>Trivial multiplicity</title>
        <p>A statistic is computed for each track in a suite, but the computed values are neither compared nor integrated across tracks in the suite of interest (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>A). This resulting list of values per track can be convenient for obtaining an overview of a suite. Because it is merely a repetition of computations, it does not introduce any challenges related to multiplicity. An example of trivial multiplicity is to count the number of peaks for each track for transcription factor binding sites in a given cell type.</p>

      <sec id="sec2-5-2">
        <title>Contrasting multiplicity</title>
        <p>A statistic is computed separately for each track of a suite, possibly in relation to reference tracks (outside the suite), with an aim of contrasting (typically ranking) the values computed for each track from the suite (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>B). Co-occurrence is typically of main interest. Although the computations are performed separately (as for trivial multiplicity), the aim of comparing the computed values puts additional requirements on the statistics used. As discussed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Additional File 2</xref>, measures designed to capture the similarity/co-occurrence of tracks may be inappropriately affected by the number of elements in each track. An example of contrasting multiplicity is evaluating the co-occurrence of binding sites of a selected transcription factor (TF) against each track from a suite of transcription factor ChIP-seq peak tracks (as in “Exploring transcription factor co-occurrence using two alternative measures of similarity,” one of the complex example analyses on the GSuite HyperBrower website, which is also briefly presented in the “Illustrative example” section above). In this example, using the Jaccard index [<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] as the similarity measure produced a ranking that appeared severely affected by the overall number of peaks in each track from the suite. The severity of this effect is also shown on simulated data (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Additional File 2</xref>). Use of the Forbes coefficient [<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] or tetrachoric correlation [<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>–<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] did not show such an effect and resulted in a markedly different ranking. Especially the use of the tetrachoric correlation resulted in a biologically very reasonable ranking of potentially cooperating TFs. Since track size has such a strong influence on the Jaccard index, we generally don’t recommend its use in situations where tracks are to be ranked.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec2-5-3">
        <title>Integrative multiplicity</title>
        <p>A statistic is computed based on pairwise measures across all tracks in a suite (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>C). The statistic may be a single value representing the suite as a whole, or it may be in the form of one value per track from the suite. For descriptive statistics computed per track, integrative multiplicity implies that the value of a given track will depend on the context of other tracks included in the suite. An example of integrative multiplicity is the computation of how typical each track in a suite is with respect to the suite, i.e., its average co-occurrence with other tracks in the suite. A computational challenge associated with the integrative multiplicity class is that the data for each track are typically used in several parts of the computations. A simple algorithm would thus either need to read the same data repeatedly from physical storage or simultaneously store the data for all tracks in memory. More advanced algorithms based on map-reduce and memoization of intermediate computations would therefore generally be preferable (and are applied in GSuite HyperBrowser).</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec2-5-4">
        <title>Higher-order multiplicity</title>
        <p>A statistic is defined based on higher-order relations (beyond pairwise) between the tracks in a suite, implying that a computation must work on elements from many or all tracks from a particular genomic region simultaneously (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>D). Then, the statistic cannot be subdivided into multiple pairwise across-track computations. An example is the computation of how many base pairs across the genome are associated with open chromatin in more than half of a set of considered cell types (covered by more than half of the genomic tracks of a suite).</p>
      </sec>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec2-6">
      <title>Hypothesis testing</title>
      <p>A hypothesis test for multiple tracks investigates whether the aspect of interest for the track or tracks in question is present in the data more/less than what is expected by chance. For all questions in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">1</xref>, we have defined an associated statistical test that can facilitate the assessment of the robustness of the effects observed from the descriptive statistics (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Additional File 1</xref>).</p>
      <p>Statistical tests can be based on parametric distributions or Monte Carlo simulations. Due to the complex structure of a genome, genomic data sets are often not well described by simple parametric distributions. For this reason, simulation has been the preferred choice even for relations involving only a pair of tracks [<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. We have further demonstrated that the simplifying assumptions that are typically required to allow parametric testing on genomic track data will often increase the risk of false-positive findings [<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Based on such considerations, we find that for the questions of Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">1</xref>, the limitations and simplifying assumptions required for parametric testing make Monte Carlo-based simulation a more promising direction.</p>
      <p>The following are the main elements of a Monte Carlo–based statistical test:
<list list-type="order" id="lst1"><list-item><p>a test statistic: a measure that describes the aspect of interest;</p></list-item><list-item><p>a null model: a model that tracks would follow if generated by chance;</p></list-item><list-item><p>a null distribution: the distribution of the test statistic when data follow the null model; and</p></list-item><list-item><p>a <italic>P</italic> value: the proportion of the null distribution that is more extreme than the value of the test statistic on the observed (real) data.</p></list-item></list></p>
      <p>For statistical testing to be meaningful, a test statistic must be specified that precisely matches a particular aspect (question) of interest and assumes a realistic (relevant) null model.</p>
      <p>Our approach follows [<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]: we argue that good, robust results can be obtained by preserving some structure from the tracks while performing the randomization algorithm. After specifying what we consider relevant null model assumptions, we derive algorithms for sampling tracks from a particular null model and computing the test statistic for each simulated track. We observe that the relevant null models (and thus the associated simulation algorithms) are mostly shared between questions and can be divided into the following three categories (described in terms of simulation algorithms):
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Sampling algorithms that treat each track separately. Any sampling algorithm for single tracks can be extended in this manner to suites, e.g., those presented in [<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p></list-item><list-item><p>Sampling algorithms that sample elements across tracks from a suite. Track segments (pairs of reference genome coordinates) can be placed in a single pool shared across tracks and sample segments for each track with or without replacements from this pool and with or without preserving the variation of frequency and length of segments across the tracks. A particular challenge with this sampling approach is how to handle intra-track overlap of segments without introducing sampling biases. Further details on alternative sampling algorithms are provided in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Additional File 1</xref>.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Sampling algorithms sampling across suites. These fall into the following two types: one type that pools track elements across both tracks and suites, and thus represents a (slight) further complication of the previous category, and a second type that permutes entire tracks between suites. Further details are provided in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Additional File 1</xref>.</p></list-item></list></p>
      <p>There is a crucial difference in the interpretation between hypothesis tests at the contrasting and integrative multiplicity levels. A statistical test that uses a pairwise track similarity measure as a test statistic and a sampling algorithm that treats each track separately will result in P values at the contrasting multiplicity level (P values relate to the null hypothesis for each track from a suite in isolation). Such P values do not provide information about how a particular track is differentiated from other tracks in a collection, but the P values of different tracks can be compared to assess the relative confidence. By contrast, if either the test statistic is defined across tracks from the suite or the sampling algorithm draws elements across tracks, the resulting P values will be at the integrative multiplicity level. Such P values may represent null hypotheses related to whole suites or how a given track is differentiated from the remaining tracks in the suite.</p>

      <title>The basic mode as an interactive tutorial of the system</title>
      <p>To accommodate a broad range of usage scenarios, the main tools in the GSuite HyperBrowser are defined in a generic and highly customizable manner. Generality of tools and a rich palette of parameter options are often indispensable for appropriate handling of data during the course of an actual project (and often have important consequences for the interpretation of results) but might mean unnecessary complexity for new users who wish to first familiarize themselves with the system. The system therefore includes a dedicated tutorial version of the tool interface, which simplifies the definitions of basic analyses and streamlines the learning experience. This, basic mode” of the system offers a simplified view of a tool’s parameter list, hiding options that are typically sufficiently represented by the default values during initial exploratory test runs by users. Perhaps most importantly, the entry point of the basic mode is a set of interactive analysis examples that illustrate the typical usage of the GSuite tools within particular domains (e.g., the study of genome variation or the study of transcription factor binding). Each example includes detailed instructions for performing a simple integrative analysis and provides relevant datasets necessary for its execution. The examples also offer information regarding generalization of the presented analyses and guidance for utilizing one’s own datasets. Entering and leaving the tutorial mode is possible at any time, which will, respectively, hide or reveal the full set of parameters defined for each tool.

      <title>Examples of biological investigations using the system</title>
      <p>While the interactive tutorial illustrates core analytical approaches for a breadth of biological questions, a full investigation will usually involve its own specific steps for data preparation and supporting analysis. To provide an impression of the variety of aspects that may be involved, we include a set of transparent and reproducible examples of biological investigations using the system. The investigation examples are available under the “Examples” tab on the system front page and include an example that reproduces individual findings from the literature (relationship between mutations in a given cancer and cell-specific open chromatin), an example of novel investigations (whether SNPs associated with various diseases are located in miRNA genes), an example of studying experimental biases/artifacts (clustering of tracks associated with different cell types and experimental setups), and an example of studying computational biases (how the exact formula used to measure track similarity has a decisive impact on the results and interpretations).</p>

    <title>Discussion and Conclusions</title>
    <p>Reference genomes have allowed a broad range of genomic features to be represented in a uniform manner, which facilitates data integration and the discovery of relations and interplay between various features. With recent initiatives to unravel data from multiple epigenomes (cell-type–specific data for a variety of epigenetic marks), a new layer of computational methodology is needed. Similar to the previous generation of computational tools that allowed a question regarding a genome-scale data set to be resolved through a single operation, the next generation of tools (or an updated version of existing tools) should directly approach questions formulated in the domain of collections of genomic tracks.</p>
    <p>The most trivial level of functionality for analyzing data collections, based on iterative, single, or pairwise analysis of genomic tracks, is already available on various platforms for genomic track analysis. More complex solutions regarding track collections have been provided only for specific questions by means of dedicated tools (e.g., LOLA [<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]). The analysis of track collections (e.g., analysis across a set of functional elements or cell types) has received little attention in the literature. We present here a first step in this direction.</p>
    <p>The present work includes three distinct contributions: (i) a computational and statistical methodology for compiling and analyzing collections of genomic tracks; (ii) an implementation of the proposed methodology in the form of a large open-source, integrated software system; and (iii) a web-based interface to the developed functionality. The user interface enables meaningful analysis customization by providing expert guidance.</p>
    <p>The main approach for the integration of data in the bioinformatics field has been to download data from multiple sources and restructure it according to a uniform hierarchy [<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Here, we adopted a different approach by developing solutions to allow users to retrieve data from databases when a specific collection of tracks is needed (instead of downloading and re-organizing data in a general manner in advance). This approach has advantages and disadvantages. Downloading and integrating track collections as needed introduces a delay for users at the time of compilation compared to relying on pre-collected data. This delay is to some degree rectified by a scheme for locally caching data previously downloaded (by any user). The advantage of the chosen approach is that as long as the repositories continue to release their data according to the same protocol, the tool will continuously provide access to all available data in their latest versions. Another strong advantage is the transparency of the approach—users can directly view the URLs at which data were retrieved and the exact time the data were retrieved from a given repository. The currently supported repositories all contain data for the human genome, but the methodology can be readily applied to data connected to any reference genome.</p>
    <p>Due to the size and heterogeneity of the genomes of higher organisms, even analyses of single genomic tracks can be complex. Integrative analyses across multiple tracks (typically across cell types or features) add a further layer of complexity. To cope with this complexity, highly customizable tools and extensive user guidance are essential. By developing an integrated software system with a set of robust components for data handling and statistical analysis at the core, we have enabled a range of sophisticated analyses to be performed with limited effort. The developed methodology is accessible to a broad user base via the system’s web interface, which provides inbuilt tool guidance and offers an interactive tutorial with a rich list of domain-specific analysis suggestions. Transparency and reproducibility of analyses are ensured by integration with the Galaxy framework, where data, tool, and parameter choices are automatically tracked in the background and any step in the analysis can be repeated with the option of changing the original data or parameters.</p>
    <p>The Galaxy system also includes a native way of representing multiple datasets, termed dataset lists/collections, which we consider mostly complementary to GSuite. A strong aspect of dataset lists is their tight integration with Galaxy tool execution, which allows any standard Galaxy tool to be executed iteratively on each dataset of a collection. Through its representation as a tabular text file, GSuite is interoperable across systems and can be easily manipulated using any tool or software that operates on tabular datasets, inside or outside the Galaxy system. Furthermore, GSuite supports the specification of custom metadata for each dataset in a collection, which is exploited extensively in our tools and example analyses. We believe a general integration of the GSuite format within the Galaxy system, including functionality for converting between GSuite and dataset lists, could improve the usability of both the GSuite HyperBrowser and the standard Galaxy platform.</p>
    <p>The methodology presented here does not cover the full spectrum of analyses that can be envisioned for collections of genomic tracks. First, the current statistics and null models only relate to pure location data (Point and Segment tracks [<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]). Extending the work to handle <italic>Valued Points</italic> and <italic>Segments</italic> (e.g., genes with expression values and tracks from case versus control elements) as well as <italic>Function</italic> tracks (e.g., signal tracks with ChIP-seq intensities) would clearly broaden the range of supported biological investigations. Second, the present methodology is primarily focused on questions that can be reduced to pairwise track relations. Analysis of higher-order relations between functional elements is a very interesting challenge but requires methodological development beyond what is described here. Third, even for the class of analyses considered here, there are many further questions for which statistical methodology would be useful. Fourth, although data from any source can be uploaded to the system, a consistent terminology for track metadata would enable better unified access to track data sources and their content. We believe that the development of a widely accepted ontology for describing biological and experimental characteristics of tracks should be given high priority to ease data integration and avoid misinterpretation of results achieved when employing public data for research. Ideally, this should be organized as a community effort to ensure international uptake. Fifth, experimental data at the single-cell level are rapidly becoming a powerful tool in biomedical research [<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Although the methodology presented here can be used directly on single-cell data, these data may give rise to a range of additional questions beyond what is considered in the present work. Through a principled methodological approach and implementation based on generic core components, the open-source GSuite HyperBrowser system is prepared for future extensions in a variety of dimensions.</p>
    <p>In conclusion, we believe the GSuite HyperBrowser would permit robust and reproducible solutions to a breadth of cases for which ad hoc development is the only current possibility.</p>

    <title>Methods</title>
    <sec id="sec4-1">
      <title>System implementation</title>
      <p>The GSuite HyperBrowser is an integrated software system written mainly in Python, with extensive use of the NumPy library for efficient data handling, as well as some supporting code in R and Javascript (in total, 170 000 lines of code). The GSuite HyperBrowser makes use of code components from the Genomic HyperBrowser [<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] to represent individual tracks and to analyze single tracks and pairwise relations between tracks. The user interface are based on the Galaxy system [<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], which ensures robust user and dataset management, and includes features supporting reproducible research. To provide users with a more dynamic user interface, the tools in GSuite HyperBrowser are based upon Galaxy ProTo (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/elixir-no-nels/proto">https://github.com/elixir-no-nels/proto</ext-link>), an alternative tool definition API for the Galaxy framework. To ensure computational efficiency, track data are preprocessed into an indexed, binary format based upon arrays written consecutively to disk [<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], while analysis computations are based on a map-reduce scheme that limits memory requirements and a scheme for memoizing intermediate computations [<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec4-2">
      <title>GSuite representation</title>
      <p>Collections of tracks are represented as lists of references (URLs) with corresponding metadata in the GSuite tabular text format. The system includes robust functionality for composing, modifying, and validating collections in this format. The system also includes functionality for crawling and for searching and retrieving data from public repositories. The crawling functionality works similarly to a web crawler, accessing metadata from supported repositories to generate a database of the available datasets in the form of URLs along with metadata accompanying each dataset. This database can then be queried on metadata contents, resulting in a novel GSuite file containing Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs) to original, remotely stored datasets. Before analysis, remote datasets of a GSuite file can be retrieved and stored locally on the web server in hidden Galaxy history elements, resulting in a transformed GSuite file with custom Galaxy URIs that point to such storage. A caching scheme is also implemented, making sure that the dataset for each unique URI that refers to stable content is only retrieved once. The caching simply stores the Galaxy URI for the first retrieval in a register and makes sure that consecutive retrievals result in the same URI.</p>

      <title>Descriptive statistics and null models</title>
      <p>The test statistic needs to be custom-tailored to a particular question. It will thus vary between different questions involving suites of tracks, and will also vary according to slight variations of each question. Still, we find that test statistics for the whole range of questions we have studied can be defined based on a shared hierarchy:
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Pairwise track statistic (T): computes a measure of co-occurrence between a pair of tracks, e.g., the Forbes measure (<inline-formula><tex-math id="M1">\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

This can be a final per-track result in itself (at the contrasting multiplicity level) or part of a higher–order computation.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Integrative statistic (Q): combines values of T for multiple track pairs. This operates on a structure of track pairs (and corresponding T values), e.g., a single track paired with each other track of a suite. The combination of T values can, e.g., be the average, max, or min of values of T (e.g., <inline-formula><tex-math id="M2">\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

Analyses based on a Q statistic are by definition at the integrative or higher-order multiplicity levels.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Suite statistic (R): statistic that describes an entire suite. It may combine multiple values of Q. Each Q value will typically represent a one-to-many computation between tracks in a suite, with the R value typically representing a many-to-many combination of tracks in a suite. The combination of Q values can, e.g., be the average, max, or min of values of Q (e.g., <inline-formula><tex-math id="M3">\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

Analyses based on an R statistic are by definition at the integrative multiplicity level.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Pairwise suite statistic (S): statistic that describe, the relationship between two suites. Also this statistic may combine multiple values of Q in the same manner as the R statistic. Analyses based on an S statistic are by definition at the integrative or higher-order multiplicity level.</p></list-item></list></p>
      <p>Most hypothesis tests in the system are based on Monte Carlo evaluation of P-values, where a particular simulation algorithm produces explicit tracks for the null model and a particular test statistic is used to generate values for the null distribution. Several alternative simulation algorithms are proposed, preserving distinct properties within the scope of individual tracks or across the collection.</p>
