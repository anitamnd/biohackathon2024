      <p id="Par1">Differences in immune function and responses contribute to health- and life-span disparities between sexes. However, the role of sex in immune system aging is not well understood. Here, we characterize peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 172 healthy adults 22–93 years of age using ATAC-seq, RNA-seq, and flow cytometry. These data reveal a shared epigenomic signature of aging including declining naïve T cell and increasing monocyte and cytotoxic cell functions. These changes are greater in magnitude in men and accompanied by a male-specific decline in B-cell specific loci. Age-related epigenomic changes first spike around late-thirties with similar timing and magnitude between sexes, whereas the second spike is earlier and stronger in men. Unexpectedly, genomic differences between sexes increase after age 65, with men having higher innate and pro-inflammatory activity and lower adaptive activity. Impact of age and sex on immune phenotypes can be visualized at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://immune-aging.jax.org">https://immune-aging.jax.org</ext-link> to provide insights into future studies.</p>

    <title>Introduction</title>
    <p id="Par3">Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) undergo both cell-intrinsic and cell-compositional changes (i.e., cell frequencies) with age, where certain immune functions are impaired and others are remodeled<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Analyses of human blood samples uncovered significant aging-related changes in gene expression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup> and DNA methylation levels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Recent studies revealed that chromatin accessibility of purified immune cells, especially CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, change significantly with aging, impacting the activity of important receptor molecules, signaling pathways, and transcription factors (TF)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Together, these changes likely contribute to aging-related immunodeficiency and ultimately to increased frequency of morbidity and mortality among older adults. However, it is unclear to what extent these aging-associated changes are shared between men and women.</p>
    <p id="Par4">Immune systems of men and women function and respond to infections and vaccination differently<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. For example, 80% of autoimmune diseases occur in women, who typically show stronger immune responses than males<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Stronger responses in women produce faster pathogen clearance and better vaccine responsiveness, but also contribute to increased susceptibility to inflammatory and auto-immune diseases. Although not systematically described, these differences likely stem from differences in both cell frequencies and cell-intrinsic programs. For example, a study in young individuals showed that women have more B cells (percentage and absolute cell counts) in their blood than men<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Moreover, hundreds of genes are differentially expressed between young men and young women in sorted B cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Recently, sex-biased transcripts have been comprehensively described in purified immune cells (<italic>n</italic> = 1800), the majority of which are autosomal<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Furthermore, age- and sex-dependent differences in immune responses to stimuli have been observed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Despite the importance of sex and age in shaping immune cell functions and responses, it is not known whether men’s and women’s immune systems go through similar changes throughout their lifespan, and whether these changes occur at the same time and at the same rate.</p>
    <p id="Par5">To study this, we profiled PBMCs of healthy adults by carefully matching the ages of male and female donors. Computational pipelines for functional enrichments, trajectory and breakpoint analyses revealed immune system aging signatures including longitudinal genomic trends. These findings uncovered in which ways aging differentially affects the immune systems of men and women. These results are shared <italic>via</italic> a searchable R Shiny application (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://immune-aging.jax.org/">https://immune-aging.jax.org/</ext-link>).</p>

      <title>Profiling PBMCs of healthy adults</title>
      <p id="Par6">We recruited 172 community-dwelling healthy volunteers (91 women, 81 men) whose ages span 22–93 years old (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>, Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">1</xref>): 54 young (ages 22–40: 23 men, 31 women), 59 middle-aged (ages 41–64: 31 men, 28 women), and 59 older subjects (65+: 27 men, 32 women). No significant differences were detected between sexes in their frailty scores or age distributions (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1g</xref>, Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">1</xref>). PBMCs were profiled using ATAC-seq (54 men, 66 women), RNA-seq (41 men, 34 women), and flow cytometry (62 men, 67 women). Male and female samples for each assay were comparable in terms of frailty scores, BMI, and age except for young samples profiled with flow cytometry; young women were slightly older than men (~32.3 vs. ~28.35) (<italic>t</italic>-test <italic>p</italic>-value = 0.05) (Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">1</xref>). We took this difference into consideration while interpreting the flow cytometry data.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><title>Age is the main driver of variation in PBMC genomic data.</title><p><bold>a</bold> Schematic summary of study design: PBMCs were isolated from blood samples of 172 healthy community-dwelling individuals (ages 22–93), from which ATAC-seq, RNA-seq and flow-cytometry data were generated. <bold>b</bold> Principal component 1 scores (PC1) were calculated for each individual from ATAC-seq (left) and RNA-seq (right) principal component analyses (PCA) results.

      <title>Aging is the main driver of variation in PBMC ATAC-seq and RNA-seq data</title>
      <p id="Par7">To identify major sources of variation in genomics data, we conducted principal component analyses (PCA) using open chromatin regions (OCRs; <italic>n</italic> = 78,167) and expressed genes (<italic>n</italic> = 12,350) from high-quality samples (100 ATAC-seq, 74 RNA-seq) (Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">2</xref>). The first principal component (PC1) captured 15% of the variation in ATAC-seq and 18.6% in RNA-seq data and associated to age groups (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>, Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1a, b</xref>, Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>). PC1 differences between young and old samples were more significant in men (ATAC-seq: <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05 vs. <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001, RNA-seq: <italic>p</italic> = N.S. vs. <italic>p</italic> = 0.03, Wilcoxon rank-sum test) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). Annotation of PC1-related genes using immune modules<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup> revealed genomic declines associated with the ‘T cell’ module and gains associated with ‘myeloid lineage’ and ‘inflammation’ (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>), confirmed by enrichment analyses based on single-cell RNA-seq data (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1c</xref>). Together, these results suggest that aging is the main driver of variation in PBMC epigenomes/transcriptomes, where age-related variation is negatively associated with naive T cells and positively associated with myeloid lineage and inflammation, in agreement with the signatures of immunosenescence including impaired responsiveness of adaptive immunity and increases in low-grade and systemic inflammation (i.e., inflamm-aging) with age, which together contribute to aging diseases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>.</p>

      <title>Aging-related changes in PBMC cell compositions</title>
      <p id="Par8">We quantified the frequencies of CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, CD19<sup>+</sup> B cells, and CD14<sup>+</sup> monocytes in PBMCs (67 women, 62 men) (Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">4</xref>, Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2a</xref>). Among these, the proportions of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells were the most significantly affected with age (<italic>p</italic> = 8.2e<sup>−07</sup> for men, <italic>p</italic> = 0.0069 for women, Wilcoxon) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref>). Similarly, CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell frequencies declined both in men (Wilcoxon <italic>p</italic> = 0.01) and women (Wilcoxon <italic>p</italic> = 0.0026). However, we detected a male-specific decline in B cell proportions after age 65 (Wilcoxon <italic>p</italic> = 1.6e<sup>−05</sup>), resulting in a significant difference in B cell proportions between older men and older women (Wilcoxon <italic>p</italic> = 0.0032) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref>, Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">4</xref>). We did not detect significant aging- or sex-related changes in CD14<sup>+</sup> monocytes (Kruskal–Wallis <italic>p</italic>-value = 0.32) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref>). These four cell types constitute the majority of PBMCs. However, PBMCs also include NK cells (5%), DCs (1–2%), CD16<sup>+</sup> monocytes (1%), ILCs (&lt;1%)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Among these, the abundance of CD16<sup>+</sup> monocytes have been reported to increase with age, whereas ILC and DC subsets and CD56<sup>+</sup> NK cells decrease with age<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Furthermore, CD69<sup>+</sup> CD16<sup>+</sup> NK cells were more abundant in men, whereas subsets of T cells and ILCs showed more abundance in women.</p>
      <p id="Par9">We studied subsets of CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in a subgroup of young and older individuals (<italic>n</italic> = 80): naive (CD45RA<sup>+</sup>, CCR7<sup>+</sup>), central memory (CD45RA<sup>−</sup>, CCR7<sup>+</sup>), effector memory (CD45RA<sup>−</sup>, CCR7<sup>−</sup>), and effector memory RA (CD45RA<sup>+</sup>, CCR7<sup>-</sup>). Expectedly, naive T cell frequencies decreased with age, particularly in CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1d, e</xref>). As previously reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>, women had more naive T cells compared to men. For example, ~13.2% of PBMCs were naive CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in young women, compared to ~7.8% in young men (Wilcoxon <italic>p</italic> = 0.00057) despite the cohort of young women being slightly older (Supplementary Tables <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">1</xref>, <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">4</xref>). Women have elevated thymic function compared to men at all ages<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>, potentially explaining observed sex-differences in naive T cells. Sex- and age-related changes in other T cell subsets were not as significant and as consistent as the changes in naive T cells (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1d, e</xref>).</p>
      <p id="Par10">Using generalized linear models (GLM), we studied the relationship between age and sex of individuals and the variation in their PBMC compositions, which confirmed that age is most strongly associated with CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell proportions, especially for naive cells (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1f</xref>). Whereas sex is most strongly associated with naive CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells; women have higher proportions compared to men (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1d, f</xref>). Finally, we observed that B cell proportions are associated with joint effects of sex and age (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1f</xref>), due to the male-specific decline in B cell proportions after age 65 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref>).

      <p id="Par12">To identify immune cells/functions affected by aging, we studied changes at cell-specific loci (i.e., loci active in one cell type) (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2c</xref>). In both sexes, opening peaks were associated with monocyte-, NK, and memory CD8<sup>+</sup> cell-specific loci, whereas closing peaks were associated with naive T cell-specific loci (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>, Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2e, f</xref>). Despite these similarities, a greater number of cell-specific loci were affected with aging in men. Notably, 960 monocyte-specific peaks significantly gained accessibility with aging in men, whereas only 64 such loci were detected in women. Only B cells showed the opposite changes between sexes, where B cell-specific loci were more likely to be among opening peaks in women and among closing peaks in men (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>). Fold change distributions and enrichment analyses confirmed these results. Interestingly, closing peaks were enriched in B cell-specific loci only in men (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2e, f</xref>). Immune module<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup> and WikiPathways enrichment analyses uncovered that inflammation-related modules/pathways were associated to chromatin opening in both sexes (Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM7" ref-type="media">6</xref>) (e.g., MyD88 cascade (WP2801) pathway).

Similar to the ATAC-seq data (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>), aging-related gene expression changes in the B cell compartment were sex dimorphic.

      <title>PBMCs go through rapid epigenomic changes at two discrete periods during adult lifespan</title>
      <p id="Par19">To study whether temporal epigenomic changes are acquired gradually over lifespan or more rapidly at certain ages, we detected age brackets during which abrupt changes take place, referred to as breakpoints. Within each temporal cluster (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>), we compared epigenomic profiles observed at ages immediately preceding and succeeding a given age (e.g., 5 years before/after) and calculated a <italic>p</italic>-value for differences between the windows. By using a moving window approach with varying window sizes, we ensured robustness to outliers, sample sparsity at certain ages, and temporal fluctuations (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6c</xref>). Finally, for each age, we calculated a combined <italic>p</italic>-value from different windows, where a smaller <italic>p</italic>-value indicates rapid epigenomic changes at that age. Due to RNA-seq sample sparsity, these analyses were restricted to ATAC-seq samples.</p>
      <p id="Par20">These analyses revealed two periods in adult lifespan during which rapid changes occur: (i) a timepoint in late-thirties/early-forties, and (ii) a later timepoint after 65 years of age (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4e</xref>, Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6c</xref>). The earlier breakpoint was detected between ages 38–41 in women across three clusters and ages 40–42 in men in cluster1 and cluster3. Magnitude (breakpoint <italic>p</italic>-values, Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4e</xref>) and timing of changes for this breakpoint were similar between sexes. Together with Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>, this timepoint matched the start of aging-related epigenomic changes, i.e., the start of chromatin accessibility losses in cluster1 and gains in cluster2/3. The later breakpoint was detected between ages 66–71 in women across three clusters (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4e</xref>, Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6c</xref>). Interestingly, in men, this breakpoint was observed earlier (ages 62–64). The magnitude of changes for the second breakpoint was more pronounced in men than in women. Combined with Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>, this breakpoint coincided with the acceleration of epigenomic changes, such as a faster loss of chromatin accessibility in cluster1. In summary, breakpoint analyses revealed that although aging-related changes accumulate gradually, there are at least two periods in the adult lifespan during which the immune system undergoes more abrupt epigenomic changes. The first breakpoint manifests itself in both sexes similarly, whereas the second latter breakpoint affects men more strongly and earlier than women. Timing of breakpoints were comparable across clusters, suggesting that cellular interactions might modulate these temporal trends.</p>

Cluster1 captured a downward trend in both datasets and was associated with naive T cells (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5b</xref>, Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">7b</xref>). Similarly, cluster3 exhibited an upward trend and was associated to monocytes and NK cells.

      <p id="Par22">Further inspection of clusters identified temporal changes for important molecules. Cluster1 included T cell development and signaling genes, e.g., co-stimulatory molecule <italic>CD27</italic> and <italic>TCF7</italic>—a key TF in T cell development (Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM10" ref-type="media">9</xref>). Expression of both molecules decreased with age, the decrease was faster in men (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">7d</xref>). In contrast, cluster2 exhibited contrasting temporal patterns between sexes and was associated to B and plasma cells, in both ATAC-seq and RNA-seq (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5b</xref>, Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">7b</xref>). These included the E-protein <italic>TCF4</italic> (E2.2) that control various aspects of B cell development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup> and <italic>ORAI2</italic> in the B cell receptor-signaling pathway; expression levels of both genes increased in women and decreased in men. Changes in cluster3 included upregulation of <italic>JAG2</italic> in both sexes, which is expressed specifically in NK cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup> and plays critical roles in DC-mediated NK cell cytotoxicity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup> (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">7d</xref>).</p>
      <p id="Par23">To uncover potential regulators of epigenomic changes, we identified TF motifs enriched in temporal peaks using 1,388 motifs for 681 TFs grouped into 278 families. Fifty of these families were significantly enriched across three clusters (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a</xref>). These included families that were enriched across all clusters (e.g., a bHLH family motifs for TCF3, TCF4, TAL1) and enriched in a single cluster (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5d</xref>, Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM11" ref-type="media">10</xref>, see Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">7e</xref> for sex-specific analyses). TFs associated to naive T cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup> were enriched in cluster1 (e.g., NPAS2, TCF7, SOX12, FOXO1). Among these, TCF7 is a potential ‘pioneer factor’ and can impact the chromatin accessibility levels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. Expression levels of these TFs also decreased with age (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5e</xref>). Cluster3 was enriched for motifs for MAFB, CEBPA, CREB5, and NFE2, which are highly expressed in monocytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup> and were upregulated with age in PBMCs (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5f</xref>). TF enrichments for cluster2 were not as significant due to the size of this cluster. Combined analyses of temporal trends in men/women uncovered shared changes: (i) downward genomic trends in naive T cell genes/TFs, including the pioneer factor TCF7; (ii) upward trends for genes/TFs active in monocytes and cytotoxic cells. These analyses further highlighted the stark differences between sexes regarding aging of the B cell compartment.</p>

      <title>PBMCs of men and women diverge with age</title>
      <p id="Par24">We compared ATAC-seq and RNA-seq maps of men and women to describe sex-bias in human PBMCs at different age groups. In young and middle-aged subjects, very few differences were detected between sexes. Interestingly, differences between sexes increased after the age of 65, where 1011 differential peaks and 548 differential genes were detected (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6a, b</xref>). Functional annotations of sex-differences were conserved between the two assays, revealing a bias towards myeloid lineage particularly for monocytes in older men and a bias towards adaptive cells (B, T) in older women (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6c</xref>, Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">8a</xref>, Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM12" ref-type="media">11</xref>). Epigenomic enrichments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup> (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">8b, c</xref>) confirmed that male-biased peaks were enriched in monocyte-specific loci and female-biased peaks were enriched in B/T cell-specific loci, including important signaling molecules (<italic>JAK3, STAT5B</italic>) (Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM12" ref-type="media">11</xref>). Furthermore, IL-7 signaling and other B/T cell signaling pathways were more active in PBMCs of older women compared to older men (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6d</xref>, Supplementary Tables <xref rid="MOESM13" ref-type="media">12</xref>, <xref rid="MOESM14" ref-type="media">13</xref>). Given that this pathway is downregulated with age in both sexes (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6d</xref>, right table), the difference between older subjects suggest that the age-related decline in T cells is greater in men. In contrast, older men had higher activity for inflammation-related modules compared to older women, including the pro-inflammatory cytokine <italic>IL18</italic>. Chromatin accessibility levels for inflammation-related genes/loci increases with age in both sexes (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6d</xref>, right table), suggesting that although inflammation increases with age in both sexes, the magnitude is greater in men. In agreement, serum protein measurements from the 500 Human Functional Genomics consortium<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup> (<italic>n</italic> = 267) revealed that older men have higher levels of pro-inflammatory proteins (IL18, IL6) and their receptor antagonists (IL18BP, IL1RA) compared to older women. IL18BP and IL6 levels increased with age in both sexes, however, the increase was greater in men leading to differences between older adults. In contrast, serum IL1RA levels increased specifically in men, also leading to a significant difference (Wilcoxon <italic>p</italic> = 0.0065) between older men and women (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6e</xref>).<fig id="Fig6"><label>Fig. 6</label><caption><title>Genomic differences between sexes at different age groups.</title><p>MA plots representing mean log2 fold change (male-female) vs. average log2 read counts per million reads (logCPM) for ATAC-seq (<bold>a</bold>) and RNA-seq (<bold>b</bold>) data at three age groups using 78,167 peaks (12,199 genes) at autosomal chromosomes.

      <p id="Par25">These data suggest that older men show a bias towards innate immunity whereas older women towards adaptive immunity. This partially stems from the elevated activation of monocyte related genes/loci with age in men (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>, Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4c</xref>). Fifteen times more monocyte-specific loci were activated in men with age (960 vs. 64 peaks). (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2f</xref>). However, we did not detect significant sex differences in CD14<sup>+</sup> and CD16<sup>+</sup> monocyte cell numbers (counts and frequencies) in flow cytometry data from Milieu Intérieur Consortium<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup> (<italic>n</italic> = 892) (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">8d</xref>) or from our cohort (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref>). Even though the number of CD16<sup>+</sup> monocytes increase with age in both sexes (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">8e</xref>), this increase was similar between sexes (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">8d, e</xref>). In contrast, the female-bias in adaptive immunity partially stemmed from male-specific genomic declines in B cell-associated loci (Figs. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>c, <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4d</xref>) and B cell percentages within PBMCs (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref>). This trend was also observed in the Milieu Intérieur cohort for different B cell subsets (i.e., naive, transitional, founder) (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">8d, e</xref>). Interestingly, mass-cytometry data from a third cohort<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup> (<italic>n</italic> = 190 Caucasians) also revealed significant age-related declines in B cell percentages (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">8f</xref>). However, these declines were observed in both sexes. Further studies are needed to uncover whether B cell-related differences among cohorts can be due to clinical and/or environmental factors.</p>

    <title>Discussion</title>
    <p id="Par26">Despite well-characterized sex differences in immune responses, disease susceptibility, and lifespan, it is unclear whether aging differentially affects peripheral blood cells of men and women. To fill this gap, we generated ATAC-seq, RNA-seq, and flow cytometry data in PBMCs from 172 age-matched healthy adults. Using novel systems immunology pipelines, we discovered a genomic signature of aging that is shared between sexes including (1) declines in T cell functions, (2) increases in cytotoxic (NK, memory CD8<sup>+</sup> T) and monocyte cell functions. This signature is in alignment with known age-related changes in the immune system including declining adaptive responses and increased systemic inflammation with age<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. Despite these similarities, male PBMCs went through greater changes that are not attributable to clinical differences. Notably, 15 times more monocyte-specific loci were activated in men compared to women. Previous studies in whole blood showed that DNA methylomes age faster in men compared to women<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. Here, we uncovered an accelerated aging phenotype for men in ATAC-seq data and uncovered cell types, cellular functions, and molecules that differentially age between sexes. In addition, our data revealed for the first time that aging has opposing effects on the B cells of men and women, where B cell-specific loci/genes were modestly activated in women but significantly inactivated in men, which might contribute to sex-differences in auto-immunity and humoral responses.</p>
    <p id="Par27">We studied middle-aged individuals to capture chronological changes and the timing of changes, which is essential in distinguishing age-related changes from those resulting from maturation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. Chronological patterns in ATAC-seq and RNA-seq data were correlated and included increasing accessibility/expression for cytotoxic cells and monocytes, and decreasing accessibility/expression for T cells in both sexes. Temporal patterns from men and women further highlighted the differential aging of the B cell-related loci. Breakpoint analyses uncovered that although aging-related epigenomic changes accumulate gradually throughout adult life, there are two periods in the human lifespan during which the immune system undergoes abrupt changes. The first breakpoint was similar between sexes, however the second breakpoint was detected 5–6 years earlier in men, which is comparable to the life-span differences: 76.9 for men and 81.6 for women in USA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. In both sexes, the second breakpoint was associated with accelerated epigenomic changes and occurred ~12–15 years before the end of the average lifespan. The differences in the timing of age-related changes can be helpful in clinical decisions regarding when to start interventions/therapies.</p>
    <p id="Par28">PBMCs of men and women significantly differed after the age of 65, contrary to our expectations due to declining sex hormones. Annotation of sex-biased loci revealed that older women have higher genomic activity for adaptive cells and older men have higher activity for monocytes and inflammation. Some of these differences, but not all, are attributable to changes in cell compositions, e.g., the decline of B cell frequencies in older men (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref>), which is confirmed in a second cohort<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup> (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">8d</xref>) and has been reported in a Japanese cohort<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. This concordance across cohorts suggests that sex-specific aging signatures described here might be conserved across ethnicities/populations, which requires further investigation. Age-related increases were associated with inflammatory pathways/genes more significantly in men, suggesting an accelerated inflamm-aging signature for men. Data from an independent cohort<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup> supported this, where older men had higher levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL6, IL18) in their serum compared to older women (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6e</xref>). Interestingly, we did not detect significant differences between older men and older women in CD14<sup>+</sup> and CD16<sup>+</sup> monocyte cell numbers/frequencies neither in this cohort nor in a separate bigger cohort<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup> (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">8e</xref>). Therefore, age-related activation and sex-differences in monocytes potentially stems from cell-intrinsic changes. Future studies are needed to explore reasons behind sex differences in inflammaging, including the role of sex hormones and differential activation of DAMPs/PAMPs or transposable elements<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>.</p>
    <p id="Par29">Age-related changes in DNA methylation levels are predictive of ages across tissues and conditions, most notably the Horvarth’s clock including 353 CpG sites<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. A total of 187 (53%) of these CpG sites overlapped PBMC ATAC-seq peaks (86,145). The missing overlap likely stems from differences in technologies: CpG arrays vs. sequencing-based ATAC-seq assay that genome-wide capture active regulatory elements<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. Only a few CpGs in the clock overlapped opening/closing peaks (Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM17" ref-type="media">16</xref>), suggesting that ATAC-seq and DNA methylation arrays capture distinct epigenomic information and aging signatures. ATAC-seq captures age-related changes in regulatory element activity in a cell-specific manner. Although the mechanism underlying the CpG clocks are not established with certainty, they are proposed to represent widespread entropic decay of the DNA methylation landscape<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>.</p>
    <p id="Par30">Using a systems immunology approach in human PBMCs, this study uncovered cell types and immune functions that are differentially affected by aging between men and women. Changes in bulk PBMCs were annotated using cell-specific regulatory element loci inferred from reference epigenomic datasets<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. Although this approach was effective in annotating the aging signatures, it is prone to biases in references, e.g., differences in data quality and limitation to use cell types available in references. Future studies are needed to describe these sex differences at single-cell resolution and in sorted cells and to establish their functional implications. Moreover, future studies are needed to study important molecules identified here (<italic>IL7R, LEF1</italic>, <italic>TCF7</italic>, <italic>IL8, IL18</italic>) as sex-specific biomarkers of immune system aging. Taken together, these findings indicate that sex plays a critical role in human immune system aging and should be taken into consideration while searching for molecular targets and time frames for interventions/therapies to target aging and age-related diseases.</p>

Subjects were carefully screened in order to exclude potentially confounding diseases and medications, as well as frailty. Individuals who reported chronic or recent (i.e., within two weeks) infections were also excluded. Subjects were deemed ineligible if they reported a history of diseases such as congestive heart failure, ischemic heart disease, myocarditis, congenital abnormalities, Paget’s disease, kidney disease, diabetes requiring insulin, chronic obstructive lung disease, emphysema, and asthma. Subjects were also excluded if undergoing active cancer treatment, prednisone above 10 mg day, other immunosuppressive drugs, any medications for rheumatoid arthritis other than NSAIDs or if they had received antibiotics in the previous 6 months. Beyond these steps to exclude specific chronic conditions we also undertook further additional efforts to exclude older adults with any significant frailty. Since declines in self-reported physical performance are highly predictive of frailty, subsequent disability and mortality<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>, all subjects were also questioned as to their ability to walk ¼ mile (or 2–3 city blocks). For those who self-reported an inability to walk ¼ mile<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>, the “Timed Up and Go” (TUG) test was performed and measured as the time taken to stand up from the sitting position, walk 10 feet and return to sitting in the chair<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. Scoring TUG &gt; 10 s was considered an indication of increased frailty and resulted in exclusion from the study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>. Information on medications in Table <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">S1</xref> illustrates that as expected medication usage did increase with age. Nevertheless, these medications all reflected their use for common and controlled chronic conditions unlikely to influence our findings such as hypertension, hyperlipidemia, hypothyroidism, degenerative joint disease, seasonal allergies, headaches, atrial fibrillation, depression, anxiety, or ADHD (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder). Finally, smoking history data are not typically collected in these studies—including ours—since smoking is a rare habit among older adults.</p>

We further filtered consensus peaks to avoid likely false positives by only including those peaks overlapping more than 20 short reads in at least one sample, and peaks for which the maximum read count did not exceed 500 counts per million (cpm) to account for regions that are potential artifacts. Finally, we excluded peaks overlapping ENCODE blacklisted regions downloaded from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenpath/hg19/encodeDCC/wgEncodeMapability/">http://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenpath/hg19/encodeDCC/wgEncodeMapability/</ext-link>. An additional quality-control step was developed to filter out samples with a consistently poor signal, consisting of an algorithm to discover and characterize a series of relatively invariant benchmark peaks, defined as a set of peaks expected to be called in all samples. Samples that consistently miss calls for a significant portion of these benchmark peaks are flagged as having poor quality. A benchmark peak is defined based on three criteria, namely (1) that it remains approximately invariant between the two groups of interest (i.e., young and old samples), (2) that it captures a substantial number of reads, and (3) that it is called in most samples. For each peak, the absolute value of the log of the ratio of healthy old to healthy young mean normalized read counts (log fold change, logFC) was used to assess the first criteria, whereas the maximum read count over all samples (maxCt) is used to assess the second one. In this study, a peak was considered apt for benchmarking when (1) its absolute logFC was in the bottom quartile of the distribution over all peaks, (2) its maxCt was in the top decile of the distribution over all peaks, and (3) the peak was called in at least 90% of the samples. Using these parameters, 640 (out of 86,300) peaks were selected as benchmark; only samples for which at least 92.5% of these peaks were called were selected for analyses, which excluded 8 samples from further analyses. We examined the effects of each of these parameter choices and found that the same samples were consistently chosen as poor quality for a range of values chosen to assess the benchmark criteria. After re-applying the peak selection criteria to the remaining 100 samples, we arrived at a peak count of 86,145 peaks. Among the samples that passed the QC step, we studied the distribution of FRIP scores, depth of sequencing, and peak numbers (that are correlated measures), which revealed a wide range of values. Neither of these measures were correlated significantly with age in linear regression models (FRIP: Pearson <italic>r</italic> = 0.11, <italic>p</italic> = 0.29; Depth: Pearson <italic>r</italic> = 0.081, <italic>p</italic> = 0.42; Peak number: Pearson <italic>r</italic> = 0.1, <italic>p</italic> = 0.32). However, on the average samples from men had higher values compared to samples from women (FRIP: 0.218 vs. 0.178; Depth: 103 M vs. 72 M; Peak number: 37,046 vs. 29,170). To account for these differences, prior to statistical analyses, ATAC-seq read counts were normalized to each sample’s effective library size (i.e., the sum of reads overlapping peaks) using the trimmed mean of M-values normalization method (TMM)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>. In addition, we used the effective library size and significant surrogate variables as co-variates in differential analyses (see Differential analyses for details). Accordingly, we noted that SV1 in these analyses correlate significantly with library depth (Pearson <italic>r</italic> = −0.68 <italic>p</italic> = 6.8e−15) and number of peaks (Pearson correlation <italic>r</italic> = −0.31, <italic>p</italic> = 0.0016) in old-young comparisons and with library depth (Pearson <italic>r</italic> = −0.56, <italic>p</italic> = 1.7e−09) and FRIP score (Pearson <italic>r</italic> = 0.2, <italic>p</italic> = 0.044) in men-women comparisons.</p>

During RNA isolation, DNase I treatment was additionally performed using the RNase-free DNase set (Qiagen). RNA quality was checked using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer instrument, together with the 2100 Expert software and Bioanalyzer RNA 6000 pico assay (Agilent Technologies). RNA quality was reported as a score from 1 to 10, samples falling below threshold of 8.0 being omitted from the study. cDNA libraries were prepared using either the TruSeq Stranded Total RNA LT Sample Prep Kit with Ribo-Zero Gold (Illumina) or KAPA Stranded mRNA-Seq Library Prep kit (KAPA Biosytems) according to the manufacturer’s instructions using 100 ng or 500 ng of total RNA. Final libraries were analyzed on a Bioanalyzer DNA 1000 chip (Agilent Technologies).

      <title>Differential analysis</title>
      <p id="Par36">To identify differentially open chromatin regions from ATAC-seq and differentially expressed genes from RNA-seq data, the R package edgeR was used to fit a GLM to test for the effect of aging between healthy young and healthy old samples by sex, as well as the effect of sex by age group. In addition to sex and age group (old vs. young), our models included the base-2 log of effective library size to ensure peakwise normalization. We isolated a batch effect correlated to time period whereby samples were collected and libraries were prepared, and used ComBat to adjust the data for this effect. Finally, we used surrogate variable analysis (SVA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup>) to capture unknown sources of variation (e.g., localized batch effects, subject-level heterogeneity, variation in library preparation techniques) statistically independent from age group assignments. SVA decomposes the variation that is not accounted for by known factors like age group or sex, into orthogonal vectors that can then be used as additional covariates when fitting a model to test for differential accessibility or expression. Using the built-in permutation-based procedure in the R package sva, we choose to retain one SV to include as covariate in the GLM model for PBMC ATAC-seq and none for RNA-seq data analyses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup>. GLM models where implemented using a negative binomial link function, including both genome-wide and peak-specific dispersion parameters, estimated using edgeR’s “common,” “trended,” and “tagwise” dispersion components, calculated using a robust estimation option. Benjamini-Hochberg <italic>p</italic>-value correction was used to select differentially open peaks at a false discovery rate (FDR) of 5%. To generate a set of model-adjusted peak estimates of chromatin accessibility (i.e., batch-, and SV-adjusted) for downstream analyses and visualization, we used edgeR to fit a “null” model excluding the sex and age group factor, and then subtracted the resulting fitted values from this model from the original TMM-normalized reads.</p>

      <title>Peak annotation and downstream analyses</title>
      <p id="Par37">Multiple data sources were used to annotate ATAC-seq peaks with regard to functional and positional information. HOMER<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup> was used to annotate peaks as “promoter” (i.e., within 2 kb of known TSS), “intergenic”, “intronic”, and other positional categories. For functional annotation of peaks, we used a simplified scheme integrating public chromatin states calculated for major PBMC subpopulations with ChromHMM from Roadmap Epigenomics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>, Blueprint Epigenome, and a third reference data<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref></sup>: First, we intersected the chromHMM-generated states with our set of consensus peaks, and solved conflicting cases where multiple chromatin states overlap the same ATAC-seq peak so that each peak was assigned a single annotation, according to the following priority rules: if a peak overlaps both an active TSS and enhancer region, which state takes priority depends on whether the peak is proximal (i.e., within 1000 bp of the nearest TSS), in which case it is annotated as a promoter, or distal (distance to nearest TSS greater than 1000 bp), when it is annotated as an enhancer instead. For all other states, rules apply as follows: Active Enhancer &gt; Genic Enhancer &gt; Bivalent TSS &gt; Weak Enhancer &gt; Bivalent Enhancer &gt; PolyComb repressed &gt; TSS Flanking &gt; Transcription &gt; ZNF Genes and repeats &gt; Heterochromatin &gt; Quiescent/Low signal. Then, to facilitate interpretation and visualization, we simplified the original sets of chromatin states to a scheme with 6 pooled meta-states, namely (1) TSS, collecting active, flanking, and bivalent TSS states; (2) Enhancer, pooling active, weak and bivalent enhancer states; (3) Repressed PolyComb, combining both weak and strong PolyComb states; (4) Transcription, including both weak and strong transcription states, (5) the quiescent chromHMM state; and (6) other states (ZNF, heterochromatin) combined together. To annotate peaks as cell-specific for a given subset obtained from one of the three datasets listed above, we determined for each peak whether it was annotated as an active promoter or an active enhancer in a single-cell population or lineage, and in such cases labeled the peak accordingly as cell- or lineage specific. For example, if a peak is annotated as an active enhancer in both naive and memory CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells but as another state (e.g., repressed) in every other subset, then the peak would be considered CD4<sup>+</sup> T-specific. For gene-based analyses, HOMER was used to assign each ATAC-seq peak to the nearest TSS, as measured from the peak center. To improve confidence on these annotations, gene-based analyses were further restricted to include only peaks located within 100 kb of their corresponding TSS. ATAC-seq peaks were also annotated using gene sets provided by curated immune function-related co-expression modules<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. These gene sets comprise 28 modules defined from multiple compiled transcriptomic data sets, which were originally annotated based on expert knowledge of representative functions of the gene ensemble in each module. In this study, we have preserved and used these annotations to test for enrichment of these modules in gene sets of interest, such as the set of genes associated to chromatin peaks gaining or losing accessibility with aging. We assessed enrichment using the hypergeometric test followed by Benjamini-Hochberg FDR adjustment for P-values. Further functional enrichment analyses were carried out using Wikipathways pathways<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref></sup>, immune modules<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>, gene sets from DICE database<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup> and single-cell RNA-seq data in PBMCs. Gene sets from PBMC scRNA-seq data is driven from one-vs-all cell cluster comparisons. First, we identified 17 clusters from PBMC scRNA-seq data (<italic>n</italic> = 26 samples) using the Louvain clustering in the ScanPy toolkit<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref></sup>. These clusters were manually inspected and assigned to different cell types by studying the expression of known marker genes. For each cluster, differentially expressed genes were identified using one-vs-all approach based on T-test followed by FDR. Marker genes for a cluster (or cell population) were found by using FDR ≤ 5% and logFC &gt; log2(1.25) using differential analyses results. Similarly, marker genes from the DICE database are obtained using their differential analyses results and the same cutoffs for cell-specific genes (FDR ≤ 5% and logFC &gt; log2(1.25)). Gene sets used in our differential analyses are provided as a supplementary table (Table <xref rid="MOESM15" ref-type="media">S14</xref><bold>)</bold>. Similarly, peak sets from ChromHMM states used in the enrichment analyses are provided as a supplementary table (Table <xref rid="MOESM16" ref-type="media">S15</xref>). For each gene set, we tested for enrichment using the hypergeometric test, against a background defined by the set of genes that are expressed, as determined by RNA-seq data, or potentially expressed, as given by promoter accessibility, in PBMCs. We used the Benjamini-Hochberg FDR multiple test correction to assess significance of hypergeometric <italic>p</italic>-values.</p>

Genes for which at least three normalized reads per million were obtained in at least two samples were considered as expressed, all others removed prior to analysis. This resulted in a total estimate of 14,157 expressed genes in PBMCs. We built a data set comprising paired ATAC-seq and RNA-seq samples by matching promoter peaks to nearest gene (TSS) annotations, defining promoters as the regions within 1000 bp flanks of each TSS. Whenever multiple expressed genes were matched to the same promoter peak, the peak with the maximum fold change was chosen for visualization.</p>

      <title>Inferring chronological aging trends</title>
      <p id="Par39">We used ARIMA models as implemented in R on age-ordered normalized chromatin accessibility and expression data separately for each sex, to select genomic features (ATAC-seq peaks or mRNA-seq transcripts) to uncover significant chronological trends, as opposed to unstructured “noise” fluctuations undistinguishable from stationary data. Input data from all subjects in the study (see Table <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">S1</xref>) were normalized as described above in “Differential Analyses”, i.e., corrected for known batch effects using ComBat, and model-adjusted to correct for library size and unknown batch effects (i.e., surrogate variables) using EdgeR. Thus, ARIMA-modeled data contains variation due to age, sex, and error variance unaccounted for by batch and library size effects. For model fitting, genomic features were converted into z-ordered objects (using R package zoo) after averaging values obtained for the same sex and chronological age (in years), and into time series objects. Formatted time series were then analyzed using auto.arima (from the forecast R package), using stepwise search and Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) to select the best model. This algorithm scans a wide range of possible ARIMA models and selects the one that satisfies the optimality criterion, i.e., the smallest AIC. Only non-seasonal models with a maximum difference (<italic>D</italic>) of 2 were considered in this study, such that a non-stationary trend the data can be modeled after integrating a stationary series once or twice. Overall, best-fitting ARIMA models based on chromatin accessibility or gene expression data included models with 0–7 AR, 0–5 MA, and 0–7 AR + MA parameters for accessibility and 0–4 AR, 0–3 MA, and 0–4 AR + MA parameters for expression. From these models, we chose for inspection only the ones carrying a “significant” trend, defined as those where (1) the difference order from stationary was higher than zero, and (2) at least one AR or MA coefficient was included in the model (i.e., <italic>D</italic> &gt; 0 ∩ AR + MA &gt; 0). These criteria allow sampling a wide variety of trend patterns if they were present in the data. For accessibility data, 14,594 (18.7%) and 13,591 (17.4%) peak models had <italic>D</italic> = 1 (none had <italic>D</italic> = 2) in females and males respectively, out of which 13,297 (17%) and 13,295 (17%), respectively, also were estimated to have AR + MA &gt; 0, and hence chosen for further analyses. Out of the chosen peaks, 12,941 and 11,566 had only MA (9082 in females, 8696 in males) or AR (2,562 in females, 2574 in males) coefficients, whereas only 4196 (31.6%) and 4,181 (31.4%) were estimated to have two or more non-zero (AR + MA) coefficients in females and males, respectively. A total of 3197 (4.1%) peaks were chosen in both sexes, whereas the remaining peaks were treated as sex-specific. For expression data, 1367 (11.1%) and 1665 (13.5%) models had <italic>D</italic> = 1 (none had <italic>D</italic> = 2) in females and males respectively, out of which 1068 (8.6%) and 1471 (11.9%), respectively, also were estimated to have AR + MA &gt; 0, and hence used in further analyses. Out of these, 1359 and 832 had only MA (511 in females, 903 in males) or AR (480 in females, 372 in males) coefficients, whereas only 503 (36.8%) and 554 (33.3%) were estimated to have two or more non-zero (AR + MA) coefficients in females and males, respectively.

      <title>Temporal peak/gene analyses</title>
      <p id="Par40">After selecting genomic features with a significant trend, we used their estimated parameters to fit the original data to reduce noise and facilitate the discovery of common trend patterns across multiple features. Fitted values were computed at the same chronological ages observed in the data for each sex, converted to <italic>z</italic>-scores for comparability, and then submitted to <italic>k</italic>-means clustering for aggregation into <italic>k</italic> sets of similar chronological aging patterns. Chosen features for each sex were clustered separately, and additionally features chosen as common to both sexes were concatenated as a single sequence of two age-ordered ages prior to normalization. This concatenation approach was designed to facilitate the detection of features with consistent chronological patterns across sexes. For clustering, we used the R-stats version of the <italic>k</italic>-means algorithm (kmeans), starting from nstart = 1000 random sets of <italic>k</italic> cluster centers and running each for max.iter = 100 iterations. To choose <italic>k</italic>, we opted for a biologically informed criterion as opposed to a purely statistical one, after noting that criteria such as maximization of within- vs. between-cluster variance tended to select a large (&gt;20) number of slightly different clusters, likely emphasizing small differences in ARIMA model parameters with little biological significance. Instead, we computed optimal clusters for values of <italic>k</italic> between 2 and 15 and calculated enrichment statistics for cell-specific features (i.e., cell-specific chromatin states for ATAC-seq, and cell-specific expressed genes for RNA-seq data) for each cluster relative to all trending features, and asked whether adding clusters to the <italic>k</italic> = 2 cluster case resulted in a gain of information demonstrated by cluster enrichment patterns qualitatively different from the patterns observed in absence of the extra clusters. In some cases, finding a cluster configuration satisfying this condition of biological discrimination required applying hierarchical clustering to collapse distinct <italic>k</italic>-means clusters with the same biological signal. For chromatin accessibility, conservative application of these criteria led to the selection of <italic>k</italic> = 5 and <italic>k</italic> = 6 clusters for females and males, respectively, which were collapsed into three clusters in both cases (one closing, two opening with aging), and <italic>k</italic> = 3 for peaks trending in both sexes (one closing and one opening in both sexes, plus one opening in females while closing in males). The same numbers of final clusters were defined based on gene expression.</p>

We used the software HOMER<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup> to both detect de novo motifs and to test for enrichment of 1388 motifs obtained from JASPAR CORE 2018 database<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref></sup> and from Jolma et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref></sup> SELEX-derived position weight matrices (PWMs), corresponding to 680 distinct TFs. We used HOMER to assign a TF to each de novo motif found, based on sequence similarity to the 1388 known motifs. From the pooled set of known and de novo motifs tested for each cluster, we used Benjamini-Hochberg method on enrichment <italic>p</italic>-values to estimate FDR, and applied a 5% FDR significance threshold to select for the final set of enriched motifs. Since some motifs have similar consensus sequences and PWMs, prior to visualization of these results we grouped motifs into “families” defined as sets of motifs with nearly identical sequences, as determined by pairwise comparison of all 1388 motif using MEME/TOMTOM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref></sup>, which tests whether two motif sequences are more different than expected by chance. Using stringent 0.001% <italic>q</italic>-value and 5 E-value cutoffs, we identified 429 motif families with extremely similar consensus sequences, 319 of which were singletons (maximum family size = 226 motifs).</p>

      <title>Breakpoint analyses</title>
      <p id="Par42">We investigated systemic chronological signatures in temporal peaks by testing, in each cluster, for the existence of “breakpoints,” i.e., short age intervals characterized by significant differences in accessibility in the intervals preceding and following the age interval. For each age <italic>t</italic> in the sampled age interval from <italic>t</italic><sub>min</sub> to <italic>t</italic><sub>max</sub>, we tested for mean difference in accessibility between subjects with ages in the intervals <italic>t</italic><sub>min</sub>-<italic>w</italic> vs. <italic>t</italic><sub>min</sub> + <italic>w</italic>, where <italic>w</italic> represents a variable window span parameter, and plotted the observed <italic>p</italic>-values (i.e., −log10 P, or <italic>loginvp</italic>) as a function of age (<italic>t</italic>) to identify maxima that suggested the presence of discrete breakpoints. These tests were carried out on normalized and model-adjusted accessibility data corresponding to the ATAC-seq peaks associated to each sex-specific and common cluster identified as trending by ARIMA as described above. Since there were many more peaks than subjects for any given comparison, we used PCA to reduce the dimensionality of each cluster to <italic>n</italic> = 3 PCs, and used MANOVA on these three dimensions to compute <italic>p</italic>-values at each tested value of <italic>t</italic>. For any given value of <italic>w</italic>, offset values for <italic>t</italic><sub>min</sub> and <italic>t</italic><sub>max</sub> were adjusted to match the age of available samples in the study. For example, a window span of 5 years required a <italic>t</italic><sub>min</sub> = 27 if the youngest available subject was 22 years old, and a <italic>t</italic><sub>max</sub> = 83 if the oldest available subject was 90 years old. For a given value of <italic>w</italic>, results from tests contrasting younger vs. older intervals would vary depending on sample size volume and imbalance, with statistical power increasing with the size of the window span. To take advantage of this effect, we deployed a multi-scale algorithm where we carried out tests using <italic>w</italic> values ranging from 10 to 20 years in order to identify breakpoints that were maximally supported under multiple window spans. Due to sample sparsity and variation, however, tests carried out under varying values of <italic>w</italic> may be unevenly affected by edge effects and influencing outlier points, which may result in strong significance of a comparison because of the presence of outliers and the partial overlap of a sampled interval with a breakpoint, limiting the ability of the method to precisely discover where such breakpoints may lie. To limit these effects and increase the robustness of the tests, we smoothed the <italic>loginvp</italic> distributions by fitting LOESS regressions to each comparison (i.e., each set of tests with the same <italic>w</italic> value) under a range of smoothing bandwidth parameters (i.e., bw = 0.25, 0.30, …, 0.70, 0.75). We combined the resulting 11 <italic>p</italic>-values at every sampled age using the Fisher’s method, reapplied LOESS smoothing to the resulting distribution, and used numerical differentiation to determine whether each age was predicted to be minimum or a maximum. Finally, we marked every maximum as a significant breakpoint candidate if it satisfied both a parametric criterion, i.e. significance of the Fisher method-combined <italic>p</italic>-values (<italic>χ</italic><sup>2</sup> test), and a heuristic criterion, namely whether the distance between this local maximum and the nearest minimum equaled or exceeded 25% of the value of the global maximum. The procedure described above results in a smoothed <italic>loginvp</italic> distribution for each <italic>w</italic> value, each comprising a series of points including maxima and minima, such that slightly different maxima can be estimated for different w values. Finally, we used Gaussian mixture modeling on the distribution of these maxima, as implemented in R-Mclust package, to group <italic>loginvp</italic> maxima obtained from different window spans into cohesive breakpoint intervals, whose medians and ranges we report herein for each cluster. Since breakpoints are independently calculated for each cluster, observed overlaps are likely the result of aging-related events with a genome-wide impact.</p>
