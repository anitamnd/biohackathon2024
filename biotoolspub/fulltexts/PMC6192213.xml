        <title>Motivation</title>
        <p>High-throughput sequencing has transformed the study of gene expression levels through
RNA-seq, a technique that is now routinely used by various fields, such as genetic
research or diagnostics. The advent of third generation sequencing technologies
providing significantly longer reads opens up new possibilities. However, the high error
rates common to these technologies set new bioinformatics challenges for the gapped
alignment of reads to their genomic origin. In this study, we have explored how
currently available RNA-seq splice-aware alignment tools cope with increased read
lengths and error rates. All tested tools were initially developed for short NGS reads,
but some have claimed support for long Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) or even Oxford
Nanopore Technologies (ONT) MinION reads.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="s2">
        <title>Results</title>
        <p>The tools were tested on synthetic and real datasets from two technologies (PacBio and
ONT MinION). Alignment quality and resource usage were compared across different
aligners. The effect of error correction of long reads was explored, both using
self-correction and correction with an external short reads dataset. A tool was
developed for evaluating RNA-seq alignment results. This tool can be used to compare the
alignment of simulated reads to their genomic origin, or to compare the alignment of
real reads to a set of annotated transcripts. Our tests show that while some RNA-seq
aligners were unable to cope with long error-prone reads, others produced overall good
results. We further show that alignment accuracy can be improved using error-corrected
reads.</p>

    <title>1 Introduction</title>
    <p>Over the past 10 years, the use of next generation sequencing (NGS) platforms, in
particular Illumina, has expanded to dominate the genome and transcriptome sequencing
market. Their sequencing-by-synthesis approach is indeed much cheaper and faster than the
previously used Sanger sequencing. Recently, two new sequencing technologies—the so-called
‘third generation sequencing technologies’—have emerged, that produce longer reads and hold
numerous promises for genomic and transcriptomic studies.</p>
    <p>First, the single-molecule sequencing technology unveiled in 2010 by Pacific Biosciences
(PacBio), produces reads up to a few tens of thousands of base pairs long. However, raw
reads (‘subreads’) display significantly higher error rate (∼10–20%) than reads from the
Illumina technology (∼1%) (<xref rid="btx668-B16" ref-type="bibr">Schirmer <italic>et
al.</italic>, 2015</xref>; <xref rid="btx668-B15" ref-type="bibr">Ross <italic>et
al.</italic>, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="btx668-B9" ref-type="bibr">Glenn, 2011</xref>). To
reduce error rates, circularized fragments are sequenced multiple times and the subreads
produced can be reconciled to produce higher-quality consensus ‘Reads of Insert’ (ROIs,
previously called Circular Consensus Reads). However, there is a trade-off between the ROIs
length and accuracy because longer fragments accumulate fewer sequencing passes.</p>
    <p>Second, the portable MinION sequencer presented in 2014 by Oxford Nanopore Technologies
(ONT), produces even longer reads (up to a few hundreds of thousand base pairs long), but
with even higher error rates. Using the R7.3 chemistry, raw reads (‘1 D’ reads) had an
error-rate of &gt;25%, while consensus ‘2 D’ reads (where template and complement of
double-stranded fragments are successively sequenced and reconciled) displayed 12–20% error
rate (<xref rid="btx668-B13" ref-type="bibr">Laver <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>;
<xref rid="btx668-B17" ref-type="bibr">Sović <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>). It is
likely that improvement in the chemistries (notably the recently released R9 and R9.4) has
reduced error rates (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://lab.loman.net/2016/07/30/nanopore-r9-data-release">http://lab.loman.net/2016/07/30/nanopore-r9-data-release</ext-link>).</p>
    <p>For transcriptomic studies, long reads of these third generation sequencing technologies
should be very helpful in the challenging task of identifying isoforms, and estimating
reliably and precisely their abundances (<xref rid="btx668-B8" ref-type="bibr">Garber
<italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="btx668-B12" ref-type="bibr">Łabaj
<italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>). It is unclear though whether high error rates
will allow precise identification of exon-exon junctions required for proper discrimination
of isoforms that are very similar in sequence (e.g. NAGNAG splicing).</p>
    <p>The aim of this work was to determine whether currently available RNA-seq splice-aware
aligners could handle third generation sequencing data, namely much longer read length and
significantly higher error rate. Such a benchmark of RNA-seq alignment tools and pipelines,
previously performed on both real and synthetic Illumina reads (<xref rid="btx668-B6" ref-type="bibr">Engström <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>) proved to be very helpful
for the community of end-users. Another benchmark of RNA-seq alignment tools was performed
on synthetic data of varying error rate and complexity (<xref rid="btx668-B2" ref-type="bibr">Baruzzo <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>). However, to the best of our
knowledge, no tests were performed on third generation sequencing data.</p>
    <p>Splice-aware RNA-seq alignment tools can be divided into two groups. First, guided
splice-aware aligners, use the genome sequence and known gene annotations to calculate gene
or transcript abundance, but cannot be used to identify new splice junctions. Second, de
novo splice-aware aligners can align RNA-seq reads to a reference genomic sequence without
prior information on gene annotations.</p>
    <p>BBMap is to our knowledge the only tool explicitly claiming support of both PacBio and ONT
reads (<xref rid="btx668-B4" ref-type="bibr">Bushnell <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>).
It uses short k-mers to align reads directly to the genome, spanning introns to find novel
isoforms. It uses a custom affine-transform matrix to generate alignment scores.</p>
    <p>A tutorial, developed by the PacBio team (available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/PacificBiosciences/cDNA_primer/wiki/Aligner-tutorial:-GMAP,-STAR,-BLAT,-and-BLASR">https://github.com/PacificBiosciences/cDNA_primer/wiki/Aligner-tutorial:-GMAP,-STAR,-BLAT,-and-BLASR</ext-link>)
recommends modified sets of parameters for the alignment of PacBio reads with STAR and GMAP,
based on in-house testing. STAR (<xref rid="btx668-B5" ref-type="bibr">Dobin <italic>et
al.</italic>, 2013</xref>) employs sequential maximum mappable seed search in
uncompressed suffix arrays followed by seed clustering and stitching procedure. It detects
novel canonical, non-canonical splices junctions and chimeric-fusion sequences. GMAP (<xref rid="btx668-B19" ref-type="bibr">Wu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>) is a part of
GMAP/GSNAP package and uses diagonalization to find exon regions, oligomer chaining of short
k-mers to refine them, and dynamic programming at the nucleotide level to resolve
mismatches, indels and intron boundaries.</p>
    <p>In our tests we included TopHat2 (<xref rid="btx668-B11" ref-type="bibr">Kim <italic>et
al.</italic>, 2013</xref>), the most popular aligner for Illumina reads. TopHat2
implements a two-step approach where initial read alignments are first analyzed to discover
exon-exon junctions, which are then used in the second step to determine the final
alignment. HISAT2, the successor of Tophat2, was also included. It uses a global FM-index,
as well as a large set of small FM-indexes (called local indexes) that collectively cover
the whole genome. This strategy enables effective alignment of RNA-seq reads spanning
multiple exons (<xref rid="btx668-B10" ref-type="bibr">Kim <italic>et al.</italic>,
2015</xref>).</p>
    <p>In the event that aligners are unable to cope with high error rates in the reads, we tested
if the addition of an error-correction step before the mapping step could be useful. Recent
tools have been developed that allow error correction of reads from third generation
sequencing technologies, taking advantage of the redundancy within each dataset, or
combining them with second generation sequencing datasets (<xref rid="btx668-B3" ref-type="bibr">Bradley <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). The latter (so-called
‘hybrid’) approach has already been used to obtain a comprehensive characterization of the
transcriptome of the human embryonic stem cell (<xref rid="btx668-B1" ref-type="bibr">Au
<italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). In this study, we applied both approaches and
quickly discuss their merits.</p>
  </sec>
  <sec>
    <title>2 Materials and methods</title>
    <p>Since the actual origin of reads in real datasets is unknown and can only be estimated
through the alignment process, real datasets are not best suited to assess the performance
of alignment tools. The accuracy and precision of aligners can be assessed on synthetic
data, but in return simulators fail to mimic every aspect of real-life datasets, potentially
biasing the benchmark results. In this study, we thus decided to use both simulated and real
datasets.</p>
    <p>All real datasets consist of RNA converted to cDNA and amplified prior to sequencing. For
simulation, we have used the PacBio reads simulator PBSIM (<xref rid="btx668-B14" ref-type="bibr">Ono <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). Several datasets were
simulated with different parameters, and using the annotated transcriptome of different
organisms (the baker’s yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, the fruit fly
<italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, and human chromosome 19; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Material</xref>).</p>
    <p>To more precisely explore subpar performance of some mappers tested in this study, we
simulated a dataset with long reads containing very few errors. This allows us to estimate
whether a mapper performs poorly because of longer reads or because of higher error
rate.</p>
    <p>The focus in our tests was on PacBio technology, for which we had a large amount of real
data and a dedicated simulator (PBSIM). However, we also included one real ONT dataset. For
comparison, one ONT MinION dataset was also simulated on <italic>Drosophila
melanogaster</italic> using PBSIM, setting the parameters according to the statistics of
ONT MinION R9 real data. While a PacBio simulator is not entirely appropriate for ONT MinION
data, we felt that mimicking their read length and error profile (frequency of insertions,
deletions and mismatches) should provide some useful insight. At the time of our simulation
experiments, we were unaware of a dedicated MinION reads simulator. Since then, we became
aware of NanoSim (<xref rid="btx668-B20" ref-type="bibr">Yang <italic>et al.</italic>,
2017</xref>), but due to time constraints decided not include it in our benchmark.</p>
    <p>Additional synthetic ONT MinION dataset was simulated using human chromosome 19. Results
are like those achieved on the first ONT MinION simulated dataset and are presented in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Note</xref> S4.</p>
    <p>In order to explore the effect of read error correction on alignment, the highest quality
real PacBio dataset was error corrected using the recent consensus tool Racon (<xref rid="btx668-B18" ref-type="bibr">Vaser <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>). Both
correction using external Illumina reads and self-correction were explored.</p>
    <p>The description of simulated datasets generation can be found in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Material</xref>. <xref rid="btx668-T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> shows relevant statistics of test
datasets. As can be seen from the table, datasets vary in size and complexity. For example,
datasets 2 and 4 have similar size because they were generated using the same approximation
of the gene coverage histogram, however, since MinION ONT reads are on average longer than
PacBio reads, dataset 2 contains more reads than dataset 4. <table-wrap id="btx668-T1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><p>Test dataset statistics</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col valign="top" align="left" span="1"/><col valign="top" align="left" span="1"/><col valign="top" align="left" span="1"/><col valign="top" align="left" span="1"/><col valign="top" align="left" span="1"/><col valign="top" align="left" span="1"/><col valign="top" align="char" char="." span="1"/><col valign="top" align="left" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Data set</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Type</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Organism</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Technology</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Size</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">No. genes</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">No. reads</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">% AS genes</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">A</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Real</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Illumina</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">1 GB</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">NA</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">4,000,000</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">NA</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">B</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Synthetic</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Long read low error</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.4 GB</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">7,000</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">410,000</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">10</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">1</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Synthetic</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">PacBio ROI</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">400 MB</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">6,000</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">185,000</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">2</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Synthetic</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">PacBio ROI</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.4 GB</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">7,000</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">412,000</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">10</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">3</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Synthetic</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>Homo sapiens, chr. 19</italic></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">PacBio ROI</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">200 MB</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">1,520</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">84,000</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">60</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">4</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Synthetic</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">ONT R9 2D</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.4 GB</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">7,000</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">342,000</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">10</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">5</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Real</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">PacBio ROI</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">1 GB</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">NA</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">192,000</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">NA</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">6</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Real</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">PacBio ROI error-corrected</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">500 MB</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">NA</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">192,000</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">NA</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">7</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Real</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">PacBio Subreads</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">1 GB</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">NA</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">243,000</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">NA</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">8</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Real</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">ONT R9 2D</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">120 MB</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">NA</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">40,000</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">NA</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p>

      <title>2.1 Datasets</title>
      <p>To generate simulated datasets, we used PBSIM version 1.0.3, downloaded from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://code.google.com/archive/p/pbsim/">https://code.google.com/archive/p/pbsim/</ext-link>.</p>
      <p>Synthetic datasets were created from the following organisms: <list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p><italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> S288 (baker’s yeast)</p></list-item><list-item><p><italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> r6 (fruit fly)</p></list-item><list-item><p><italic>Homo Sapiens</italic> GRCh38.p7 (human)</p></list-item></list>Reference genomes for all organisms were downloaded from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov</ext-link>.</p>
      <p>PBSIM is intended to be used as a genomic reads simulator, taking as input a reference
sequence and a set of simulation parameters (e.g. coverage, read length, error profile).
To generate RNA-seq reads, PBSIM was applied to a set of transcripts generated from a
particular genome using the gene annotations downloaded from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgTables">https://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgTables</ext-link>. To make the datasets as realistic
as possible, real datasets were analyzed and used to determine simulation parameters. Real
gene expression datasets were used to select a set of transcripts for simulation
(downloaded from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net/recount/">http://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net/recount/</ext-link><underline>;</underline> core
(human), nagalakshmi (yeast) and modencodefly (fruit fly) datasets were used) (<xref rid="btx668-B7" ref-type="bibr">Frazee <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>).</p>

      <p>Real RNA-seq datasets used in this benchmark were generated from <italic>D.
melanogaster</italic>. Technical replicates of the same sample were sequenced with three
different technologies: Illumina HiSeq, PacBio RSII and ONT MinION. Illumina data were
used for baseline comparison of all tested tools and for error correction of PacBio reads.
PacBio and MinION data were used to assess the aligners’ performances and to determine
error profiles that were then used for simulation of synthetic data. In total, we used:
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>1GB of Illumina reads, subsampled randomly from a larger size dataset. Reads were
of size 101 bp. Illumina data was included just as a baseline, to show that all

      <title>2.2 Error correction</title>
      <p>To test if the alignment results could be improved using error correction, the highest
quality PacBio dataset (containing ROIs) was corrected. Error correction was performed
using Racon (<xref rid="btx668-B18" ref-type="bibr">Vaser <italic>et al.</italic>,
2017</xref>). Correction using Illumina reads, and self-correction were tested. Since
self-corrected dataset proved to have better error profile, only this dataset was retained
for the benchmark (Dataset statistics is given in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>).</p>

      <title>2.4 RNAseqEval tool</title>
      <p>Three of the five RNA-seq aligners were evaluated on resource usage and alignment
quality. CPU and memory consumption were evaluated using a fork of the Cgmemtime tool
(<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/isovic/cgmemtime.git">https://github.com/isovic/cgmemtime.git</ext-link>).</p>
      <p>To evaluate the quality of each aligner, we developed RNAseqEval (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/kkrizanovic/RNAseqEval">https://github.com/kkrizanovic/RNAseqEval</ext-link>), meant to be a general tool for
evaluating RNA-seq alignments. It is written in Python and contains two main scripts, one
for evaluating data simulated using PBSIM and the other for evaluating real data or data
whose origin is unknown. Both scripts require aligner output in SAM format which they
compare to gene annotations and, in case of simulated data, alignment files in MAF format
describing the origin of each simulated read.</p>
      <sec>
        <title><italic>2.4.1 </italic>Evaluating synthetic data</title>
        <p>The script for evaluating synthetic or simulated data currently works only on data
simulated with PBSIM, but could be expanded in the future to support other simulators.
Aside from aligner output in SAM format and gene annotations in GTF or BED format, the
script takes a folder containing files generated by PBSIM. The folder containing PBSIM
data needs to have a specific structure and follow a specific naming convention, as
described in the program documentation.</p>
        <p>For each read from aligner output, the script will use PBSIM generated MAF files and
gene annotations to find its origin on the reference genome and will compare it to the
alignment calculated by the aligner. The start and end position of an alignment and of
read origin are compared, and an error of five nucleotides is tolerated. The script
outputs summary information on how many reads were accurately aligned to their
chromosome, strand and position of origin.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title><italic>2.4.2</italic> Evaluating real data</title>
        <p>The script for evaluating real data takes only aligner output in SAM format and gene
annotation in GTF or BED format as its input. Because the origin of a read is unknown,
the script will check annotations for genes with which the read overlaps, and then
evaluate how well a read alignment matches exons and introns of that gene.</p>
        <p>When matching beginning and end of an alignment to each exon in an annotation, an error
of five nucleotides is tolerated. Similarly, an overlap between an alignment and an exon
annotation needs to be at least five base-pairs to be considered valid. We tested
different values for allowed error (and minimum overlap) and increasing it above five
base-pairs did not noticeably improve the results.</p>

      <p>On datasets that include longer and more erroneous reads however (dataset 1 to dataset
8), there were large discrepancies across tools. In particular, Tophat2 and Hisat2, with
default parameters, aligned &lt;7% of the reads for all long-read datasets. To be fair, it
has to be stated they do not claim to work with long-reads and were included in the test
for the sake of completeness. Therefore, we did not consider these two tools in further
analyses, and we focused on the remaining three aligners: BBMap, GMAP and STAR.</p>
      <p>If we look at the results dataset B (long reads with low error), we can see that Tophat2
and Hisat2 fail to align almost any reads using default parameters (the number in the
table are rounded down). We can conclude that Tophat2 and Hisat2 are tailored for short
NGS reads and are not able to handle longer read lengths.</p>
      <p>Based on the percentage of reads aligned, the best results were achieved by GMAP, which
aligned &gt;85% of reads across the all tested datasets.</p>
      <p>BBMap performed slightly better on Illumina (dataset A) and on synthetic <italic>S.
cerevisiae</italic> PacBio dataset (dataset 1, which contains very few multi-exon
transcripts), but the fraction of reads aligned fell behind GMAP on more complex synthetic
datasets and on real datasets (e.g. only 43% of the synthetic <italic>H. sapiens</italic>
PacBio reads of dataset 4 were aligned).</p>
      <p>STAR managed to align a large percentage of Illumina reads (96.8%), but its performance
was uneven across third generation sequencing datasets, aligning from 0.1% to 67.2% of the
reads, and often aligning less than half of the reads. STAR was seemingly affected by
increased complexity of the datasets, as well as by increased error rates (Illumina and
error-corrected PacBio datasets achieving the best performance). Since STAR managed to
align a significant portion of dataset B (long reads low error), we can conclude that it
can handle long reads, but has trouble with higher error rates especially on more complex
datasets.</p>
      <p>Across all tools, error correction improved alignment rates, as can be seen from the
comparison of dataset 5 and dataset 7.</p>
      <p>In summary, for some aligners the percentage of alignment for third generation sequencing
technologies reads was similar to what is achieved for Illumina reads. However, looking
only at the number of the reads each tool managed to align to a genome is not a reliable
measure of general alignment quality. For example, a tool could align most of the reads,
but only on only a portion of their length, or it could align them at incorrect location
on the genome.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec>
      <title>3.2 Synthetic datasets</title>
      <p>To get more insights into the quality of the alignments, we evaluated the aligners on
four synthetic datasets generated from transcriptomes of varying complexity using the
PBSIM tool (Materials and methods), and supposed to reflect characteristics of the PacBio
(datasets 1–3) and ONT MinION technologies (dataset 4). In these datasets, the precise
origin of each read is known, allowing to assess the alignment quality by examining how
well the alignment location matches the origin location in the genome. The alignment
results for those datasets were evaluated using the RNAseqEval tool, as summarized in
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="btx668-F1">Figure 1</xref>. </p>

        </caption>
        <graphic xlink:href="btx668f1"/>
      </fig>
      <p>All results are displayed as the percentage of all reads in the dataset. The percentages
of reads that were aligned is shown (without assessing the accuracy), the match rate of
aligned reads, percentage of reads for which the beginning, the end and inner exon
boundaries are accurately placed within five base-pairs (Correct), percentage of reads
that overlap all exons of the read origin (Hit all) and percentage of reads that overlap
at least one exon of the read origin (Hit one). Match rate is calculated as a percentage
of aligned bases that are equal to the corresponding bases on the reference. Overlaps of
hit one and hit all statistics need to be at least five bases.</p>
      <p>Results of the evaluation on all synthetic reads are shown in <xref rid="btx668-T3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. The evaluation on the subset of split reads (i.e. reads
aligned to multiple non-contiguous locations on the reference genome) is also shown. Split
reads, if aligned correctly, should overlap at least one exon-exon junction in the
transcript of origin, and thus cover two or more exons. Percentages of reads shown in
<xref rid="btx668-T3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> are relative to the number of

      <p>Overall, the most accurate alignments were given by GMAP, followed by BBMap and with STAR
being worse than the other two. The exception is dataset 1, on which BBMap proved slightly
better than GMAP. On datasets 2, 3 and 4 GMAP surpasses other two tools in both mapping
reads to correct general genomic location (Hit all and Hit one) and in correctly
determining their exact position of origin (Correct).</p>
      <p>Reads aligned by STAR mostly aligned to correct general genomic locations (hit all and
hit one), and displayed very good match rates, however, the low fraction of reads overall
aligned (<xref rid="btx668-T3" ref-type="table">Tables 3</xref> and <xref rid="btx668-T4" ref-type="table">4</xref>) did not allow this tool to compare favorably to GMAP and
BBmap. Moreover, STAR did not perform particularly well at correctly aligning the
beginning and end of reads. <table-wrap id="btx668-T4" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 4.</label><caption><p>Aligner evaluation on real datasets</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col valign="top" align="left" span="1"/><col valign="top" align="left" span="1"/><col valign="top" align="left" span="1"/><col valign="top" align="left" span="1"/><col valign="top" align="left" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">Dataset</th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">STAR</th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">BBMap</th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">GMAP</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td rowspan="5" colspan="1">5</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Aligned (%)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">46.1</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">74.5</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>85.4</bold></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Match rate (%)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>92</bold></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">71</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">88</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">No. expressed genes</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">8884</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">9536</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>11034</bold></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Exon hit (%)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">45.7</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">73.4</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>83.3</bold></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Contiguous alignment (%)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">33.1</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">48.4</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>54.2</bold></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="5" colspan="1">6</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Aligned (%)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">67.2</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">82.8</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>88.5</bold></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Match rate (%)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>93</bold></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">72</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">92</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">No. expressed genes</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">8515</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">9724</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>10641</bold></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Exon hit (%)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">65.1</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">81.8</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>87.0</bold></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Contiguous alignment (%)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">35.0</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">55.6</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>65.1</bold></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="5" colspan="1">7</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Aligned (%)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.1</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">72.8</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>90.1</bold></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Match rate (%)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">81</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">68</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>82</bold></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">No. expressed genes</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">183</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">9013</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>11046</bold></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Exon hit (%)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.1</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">72.4</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>86.0</bold></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Contiguous alignment (%)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.0</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">35.7</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>41.6</bold></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="5" colspan="1">8</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Aligned (%)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">16.8</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">88.0</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>98.3</bold></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Match rate (%)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>83</bold></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">67</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">81</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">No. expressed genes</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">2344</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">6578</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>7224</bold></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Exon hit (%)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">11.0</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">62.3</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>68.8</bold></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Contiguous alignment (%)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">4.8</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">26.8</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>30.5</bold></td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn id="tblfn3"><p><italic>Note</italic>: Bold values present the best scoring result for a

      <p>Datasets 2, 3 and 4 contain a significant number of split reads. Focusing on split read
statistics on those datasets, BBMap performed significantly worse than GMAP and sometimes
than STAR: on dataset 3 it managed to overlap all exons from a read origin (Split hit all)
less precisely than STAR (10.2% versus 19.4%). For STAR, results for split reads were in
line with its overall results, but the overall number of aligned reads being so low, STAR
cannot be recommended for the alignment of third generation sequencing RNA-seq reads.</p>
      <p>Overall, BBMap outperformed GMAP in alignment precision on dataset 1 with lower
complexity (less multi-exon genes), but lagged behind in general alignment efficiency,
sometimes by a large margin, on more complex datasets. This indicates that BBMap should be
used with caution to align split RNA-seq reads. In this setting, GMAP shows the best
performance and should be preferred, although the results on dataset 1 indicate that it
still has some room for improvement in dealing with high error rates of third generation
sequencing data.</p>

      <title>3.3 Real datasets</title>
      <p>For real data, the origin of each read is not known, thus aligners were evaluated by
comparing the read alignment locations to a given set of gene annotations. Some other
relevant statistics, such as alignment match rate and number of expressed genes, were also
extracted (<xref rid="btx668-T4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). Percentages of reads
shown in <xref rid="btx668-T4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref> are relative to the number
of reads in input. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table
S3</xref> also shows percentages of reads relative to the number of reads aligned.</p>
      <p>The table shows percentage of reads that were aligned (without assessing the accuracy),
percentage of reads that overlap at least one exon (exon hit) and percentage of reads that
overlap one or more exons in a sequence, corresponding to a gene annotation (contiguous
exon alignment). All values are displayed as the percentage of all reads in the dataset.
The table also shows the number of expressed genes and average match rate of aligned
reads. Match rate is calculated as a percentage of aligned bases that are equal to the
corresponding bases on the reference. Overlaps for exon hit statistics need to be at least
five bases.</p>
      <p>All real datasets consisted of technical replicates of RNA-seq on the same D.
melanogaster sample sequenced on different platforms. Interestingly, these datasets were
characterized by different error profiles (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>).</p>
      <p>As expected from previous tests, GMAP showed the best results, followed closely by BBMap.
GMAP was slightly better at aligning reads to annotated exonic locations in the genome.
The match rate of aligned reads was roughly equal to the determined error profile for each
dataset (Shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table
S1</xref>) thus suggesting that the reads are aligned to correct positions. GMAP was
even able to align ONT MinION data with a reasonable accuracy. It is interesting to note
that by some criteria GMAP shows better results on lesser quality dataset 7 (consisting of
subreads) compared to higher quality dataset 5 (consisting of ROI) and dataset 6 (error
corrected ROI).</p>
      <p>Both BBMap and GMAP reported a large percentage of ONT MinION reads aligned, however,
match rate and exon hit percentage were lower than for PacBio datasets, indicating that a
larger percentage of those alignments were at an incorrect position.</p>
      <p>STAR showed the worst alignment results. Reads successfully aligned displayed a high
match rate, which might reflect the fact that STAR is unable to align reads with highest
error rates, or that alignment settings are very conservative.</p>
      <p><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S1</xref> shows
that error correction somewhat improved the error profile, increasing average match rate
by 2–3%. However, even that slight improvement resulted in visibly better alignment
results on dataset 6 for all aligners: more reads reported as aligned, more exons hit,
more genes expressed and higher match rate. As shown in <xref rid="btx668-T4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>, STAR benefits the most from error correction, BBMap
somewhat less and GMAP benefits the least. The conclusion that can be drawn from this is
that GMAP is the most tolerant to errors, followed by BBMap with STAR being the least
tolerant. This is supported by the results on ‘long read low error’ dataset B shown in
<xref rid="btx668-T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>.</p>
      <p>Finally, we examined what fraction of the read length was aligned (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="btx668-F2">Fig. 2</xref>). The results are consistent with other measures of
mapping quality, with STAR on average managing to align reads on a slightly larger portion
of their length compared to GMAP. BBMap results are not displayed because in the tested
settings, all alignments are made on the whole length of the reads (global alignments).
This makes the violin plots in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="btx668-F2">Figure 2</xref> for
BBMap useless because each read is aligned along 100% of its length. This behavior has
some implication in the reported results, as the alignment on both ends of the reads is
sometimes incorrect, resulting in lower match rates. It could be a good idea to clip
alignments resulting from BBMap, for example using the ‘local’ flag, which converts global
alignments into local alignments by clipping them if that results in higher scores. </p>

      <title>3.4 Resource usage</title>
      <p>To estimate the efficiency of each RNA aligner, CPU time and Maximum memory usage
(Resident set size - RSS) were measured. All tools were run in a multithreaded
environment, on 12 threads where possible, and total CPU time was measured. The results
are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure
S1</xref>. Illumina data (dataset A) and long read low error data (dataset B) were
omitted from this analysis because the focus of the paper is on third generation
sequencing data.</p>
      <p>Running time seemed to depend on dataset size. In all settings, GMAP used the least
amount of memory and ran the fastest. STAR was the slowest and consistently used 60–80 GB
of RAM. BBMap memory footprint was also consistently around 10–15 GB of RAM.</p>

    <title>4 Conclusion</title>
    <p>In recent years, third generation sequencing devices have been steadily establishing
themselves in genomic research. These technologies promise to solve problems caused by the
short read length of the NGS. Regarding RNA-seq analysis, longer reads should notably
improve transcript identification. However, third generation sequencing technologies also
introduce new bioinformatics challenges, mostly due to their high error rate.</p>
    <p>In this study, we attempted to assess the ability of currently available RNA-seq alignment
tools to work with third generation sequencing data. Five alignment tools were tested using
real and synthetic datasets.</p>
    <p>Hisat2 and Tophat2 were unable to align almost any read. STAR displayed only passable
results on the least erroneous datasets, but failed almost completely on highly error-prone
ONT MinION data.</p>
    <p>BBMap, performed quite well, especially on PacBio ROI reads (which have lower error rates)
and on simpler organisms with less multi-exonic genes. This seems to indicate that although
it is a splice-aware aligner, BBMap best performance is achieved on contiguous alignments
(e.g. coming from DNA-seq), and might not be best suited for RNA-seq data.</p>
    <p>Finally, GMAP showed the best alignment results. It ran the fastest, used the least memory
and usually produced the highest alignment rates, especially on complex datasets. BBMap
outperformed GMAP only on low complexity simulated dataset which contained very few split
reads, which could indicate that although GMAP outperformed other aligners by a significant
margin, it still has some room for improvement.</p>
    <p>GMAP particularly stands out on dataset 4 containing simulated ONT MinION reads based on
wine fly genome. GMAP maps over 97% to an approximately correct position overlapping at
least one exon from the read origin, while second best aligner (BBMap), manages to map
&lt;50%. The difference in mapping quality is much smaller on real ONT MinION dataset
(dataset 8) and on ONT MinION dataset simulated on human chromosome 19 given in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Note</xref> S4.</p>
    <p>Overall, aligning third generation sequencing RNA reads is currently viable with some
available tools (namely GMAP and BBMap), but we were surprised by the low precision on
alignment location. Apart from dataset 1, containing predominately single-exon reads, the
best aligner (GMAP) attributed between 20% and 31% of reads to their correct position of
origin (±5 bases). It is not clear if this result is inherent to the high error rates of the
technologies, or if it is due to alignment algorithms that were not originally developed for
these types of data, or to the specific parameters used in this benchmark. For example it
would be interesting to test the effects of clipping BBMap alignments on its overall
performance.</p>
    <p>There is probably large room for improvement, by developing new more sophisticated and more
sensitive algorithms, or by incorporating an error-correction step in bioinformatics
pipeline before read alignment, since in our tests this visibly improved the alignment
results.</p>
