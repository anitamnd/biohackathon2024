      <p>Electrochemical sensors
are major players in the race for improved
molecular diagnostics due to their convenience, temporal resolution,
manufacturing scalability, and their ability to support real-time
measurements. This is evident in the ever-increasing number of health-related
electrochemical sensing platforms, ranging from single-measurement
point-of-care devices to wearable devices supporting immediate and
continuous monitoring. In support of the need for such systems to
rapidly process large data volumes, we describe here an open-source,
easily customizable, multiplatform compatible program for the real-time
control, processing, and visualization of electrochemical data. The
software’s architecture is modular and fully documented, allowing
the easy customization of the code to support the processing of voltammetric
(e.g., square-wave and cyclic) and chronoamperometric data. The program,
which we have called <underline>S</underline>oftware for the <underline>A</underline>nalysis and <underline>C</underline>ontinuous <underline>M</underline>onitoring of <underline>E</underline>lectrochemical <underline>S</underline>ystems (SACMES), also includes a graphical interface
allowing the user to easily change analysis parameters (e.g., signal/noise
processing, baseline correction) in real-time. To demonstrate the
versatility of SACMES we use it here to analyze the real-time data
output by (1) the electrochemical, aptamer-based measurement of a
specific small-molecule target, (2) a monoclonal antibody-detecting
DNA-scaffold sensor, and (3) the determination of the folding thermodynamics
of an electrode-attached, redox-reporter-modified protein.</p>

<body>
  <p id="sec1">The advances
in electrochemical
sensing over the last 2 decades have created a need for software platforms
capable of analyzing large, dynamic data sets in real time.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref></sup> An example is the continuous glucose sensor,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref></sup> which requires software able to process measurements
performed several times a minute over the course of weeks.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref></sup> Following this, other emerging electrochemical technologies, including
electrochemical aptamer-based (E-AB) sensors, have been reported that
support real-time measurements of, for example, plasma drug levels
with seconds- or even subsecond time resolution<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>−<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7b">7b</xref></sup> over the course of hours, producing
exceedingly large data volumes. Unfortunately, however, commercial
software for the analysis of such data are expensive<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref></sup> and cannot be customized without specialized programming
skills. This is problematic in academic laboratories where the requisite
financial and software development resources are often scarce.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref></sup> We believe there is thus a need for the creation
and open exchange of efficient software platforms that support the
real-time analysis of high-volume electrochemical data.</p>
  <p>A software
framework for the analysis of electrochemical measurements
would ideally be based on (1) an open-source computer language compatible
with the three major personal computer operating systems (i.e., Microsoft
Windows, Apple macOS, and Linux); (2) a modular design easily customizable
to a wide range of electroanalytical applications; and (3) an intuitive
graphical user interface (GUI) providing the ability to dynamically
control key processing parameters in real time. To ensure broad application,
the software should support the analysis of data originating from
a diverse set of commercial potentiostats (e.g., CH Instruments, Gamry,
Metrohm) employed in single, multichannel, or multiplexed configurations.
Finally, to appeal to a broad userbase, the software should have a
well-documented standard operating procedure (SOP) containing detailed
instructions regarding customization to new applications. Thus, motivated,
we describe here an open-source, multiplatform software supporting
the real-time analysis of high-volume electrochemical data.</p>
  <sec id="sec2">
    <title>Experimental
Section</title>
    <sec id="sec2.1">
      <title>Software</title>
      <p>While designing our software architecture,
we incorporated three principle innovations: (1) utilizing a technique
called Blitting<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref></sup> to achieve millisecond
temporal resolution and high efficiency over time; (2) the ability
to analyze various electrochemical measurements continuously and simultaneously
(e.g., multiple electrodes, multiple frequencies); and (3) real-time
parameter manipulation to address user needs on the fly.</p>
      <p>Blitting
(also written Bit Blit or BITBLT) improves our software’s performance.
Specifically, most visualization software typically experience CPU
bottlenecks when analyzing and animating high-volume data because
they consume large amounts of random access memory (RAM) to render
images, losing computing efficiency over time as data volumes increase
and image rendering demands more memory (which is finite). Instead,
Blitting eliminates this problem by only saving a clean “bit-map,”
or background canvas, which is then used to only render data originating
from new files (it does not save graphical data from previous files).
With Blitting, a constant amount of RAM is needed for the program,
allowing for larger amounts of data to be visualized without experiencing
a decrease in performance over time.</p>
      <p>The modular nature of our
program allows for easy customization
to support the analysis of data originating from many electroanalytical
techniques. With minimal programming experience, the user can easily
manipulate the script to analyze and visualize not only square-wave
voltammetry but other widely used electrochemical methods such as,
but not limited to, cyclic voltammetry, linear sweep voltammetry,
and chronoamperometry. We provide a fully documented standard operating
procedure as <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.analchem.9b02553/suppl_file/ac9b02553_si_001.pdf">Supporting Information</ext-link> to
facilitate and promote the adoption of our software.</p>

      <title>Reagents and
Materials</title>
      <p>Sodium hydroxide, sulfuric acid,
tris(hydroxymethyl) aminomethane (Tris), ethylenediaminetetraacetic
acid (EDTA), sodium hydrogen phosphate, sodium chloride, potassium
chloride, and potassium dihydrogen phosphate were obtained from Fisher
Scientific (Waltham, MA). 6-Mercapto-1-hexanol (MCH) and tris(2-carboxyethyl)-
phosphine (TCEP) were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO).
Tobramycin sulfate (USP grade) was obtained from Gold BioTechnology,
Inc. (St. Louis, MO). All reagents were used as received. A 1×
stock solution of phosphate buffered saline (PBS) was prepared containing
10 mM sodium hydrogen phosphate, 2.7 mM potassium chloride, 137 mM
sodium chloride, and 1.76 mM potassium phosphate (pH = 7.4). A 1×
stock solution of Tris-EDTA buffer was prepared containing 10 mM Tris-HCl
(pH 8.0) and 1 mM EDTA. Anti-FLAG monoclonal antibodies were obtained
from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). Peptide nucleic acid (PNA) sequences
were purchased from PNABio (Newbury Park, CA). Hexanethiol- and methylene
blue-modified deoxynucleic acid (DNA) sequences were obtained from
Biosearch Technologies (Novato, CA).</p>
      <p>Catheters (22 G) and 1
mL syringes were purchased from Becton Dickinson (Franklin Lakes,
NJ). PTFE-insulated gold, platinum, and silver wires (75 μm
diameter) were purchased from A-M systems. To employ the silver wires
as reference electrodes, they were immersed in concentrated sodium
hypochlorite (commercial bleach) overnight to form a silver chloride
film. Heat-shrink polytetrafluoroethylene insulation (PTFE, HS Sub-Lite-Wall,
0.02, 0.005, 0.003 ± 0.001 in, black-opaque, lot no. 17747112-3),
used to electrically insulate gold, silver, and platinum wires, was
purchased from ZEUS (Branchburg Township, CA). Commercial 2 mm gold
disc electrodes employed in the protein experiments were purchased
from CH Instruments (Austin, TX).</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec2.3">
      <title>In Vitro Sensor Fabrication</title>
      <p>E-AB sensors used for in
vitro measurements were fabricated as described in previous reports.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref></sup> In short, segments of pure gold (5.5 cm) were cut and soldered to
gold-plated contacts using 60% tin/40% lead rosin-core solder (0.8
mm diameter) and then insulated with two layers of PTFE heat-shrink
insulation. The sensor window (i.e., the region devoid of insulation)
of the gold wire was made to be approximately 3 mm in length. To increase
the microscopic surface area of the gold working electrodes (to obtain
larger peak currents), the gold surface was roughened using a technique
previously described.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref></sup> Briefly, the electrode
surface was electrochemically roughened via immersion in 0.5 M sulfuric
acid followed by stepping the potential between Einitial = 0.0 V to
Ehigh = 2.0 V vs Ag/AgCl, back and forth, for 16 000 pulses
using chronoamperometry. Potential steps were applied with a 20 ms
duration with no delay between pulses. Immediately following the completion
of the roughening step, the electrodes were removed from sulfuric
acid and rinsed with DI water. In parallel, aliquots of aminoglycoside-binding
aptamer:<disp-formula id="ueq1"><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="ac9b02553_m001" position="anchor"/></disp-formula>were reduced with a 1000-fold molar
excess
of TCEP for 30 min at 25 °C. Then, freshly roughened electrodes
were immersed in a 200 nM solution of DNA aptamer in PBS for 1 h at
25 °C. Following this, the sensors were immersed in a 10 mM solution
of MCH overnight at 4 °C. Finally, the sensors were rinsed with
deionized water prior to use.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec2.4">
      <title>In Vivo Sensor Fabrication</title>
      <p>The E-AB sensors used for
in vivo measurements were fabricated as described in previous reports.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref></sup> Briefly, segments of insulated gold, platinum, and silver wire were
cut to 7.75 cm in length, and 7.5 mm of insulation was removed from
each end with a scalpel. One end of the silver wire was incubated
in 100% bleach to form a silver chloride film. A length of 4.75 cm
of heat shrinkable tubing was then used to cover the gold wire with
3 mm of the gold exposed on one end. Thus, the insulated gold wire
and a bare platinum wire were then inserted into 4.5 cm of heat shrinkable
tubing and bound together with a heat gun so that 4 mm of the platinum
wire lay just behind the bare gold wire. Lastly, the insulated gold
and platinum wires were inserted into 4.25 cm of heat shrinkable tubing
with 4 mm of the silver chloride end of the silver wire laying behind
the platinum wire, then bound to the other wires with heat. The resulting
gold electrodes were then electrochemically roughened as described
above. Following roughening, the electrodes were cleaned in 0.5 M
sulfuric acid using cyclic voltammetry by cycling the electrodes rapidly
(4 V s<sup>–1</sup>) between −0.35 and 1.5 V for 20
scans. After roughening and cleaning, the electrodes were immersed
in a solution of 200 nM aptamer in 1× PBS for 30 min. Following
this, the electrodes were emplaced into a 22-gauge PTFE catheter and
incubated in a 10 mM solution of MCH.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec2.5">
      <title>Animal Procedures</title>
      <p>Male and female Sprague–Dawley
rats from Charles River, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA) weighing between 300
and 400 g were pair-housed in a standard light cycle room (0800 ON,
2000 OFF) and given ad-libitum access to food and water. All animal
procedures were performed in accordance with the guidelines set forth
by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University
of California Santa Barbara.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref></sup></p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec2.6">
      <title>In Vivo E-AB
Measurements</title>
      <p>Continuous in vivo E-AB measurements
were performed on anesthetized rats implanted with an intravenous
drug-delivery catheter made from Silastic tubing and a 22-gauge bent
steel cannula in the left jugular vein (as we have previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref></sup>). Briefly, rats were induced under 5% isoflurane gas and maintained
under 2–3% isoflurane gas for the duration of the surgery.
The chest was shaved and cleaned with alternating solutions of betadine
and 70% ethanol. A small incision was made above the left jugular
vein with surgical scissors, and then the vein was isolated and cut
open with spring-loaded microscissors. The catheter was introduced
into the vein and tied into place with a 6-0 sterile silk suture.
In total, 300 units of heparin were then infused into the catheter
followed by 0.5 mL of 0.9% sterile saline solution. After implantation
of the catheter into the left jugular vein, the right jugular vein
was isolated, cut, and implanted with the E-AB sensor and tied off
with a 6-0 sterile silk suture. Prior to implantation, the E-AB sensor
was incubated first in 70% CIDEX-in-water solution for 20 min and
then in heparin solution (1 000 units) for at least 10 min.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec2.7">
      <title>In Vitro E-AB Measurements</title>
      <p>Continuous in vitro measurements
were performed in whole undiluted serum from BioIVT, Inc. (Westbury,
NY). Prior to performing any electrochemical measurements the sensors
were interrogated with 30 preliminary square-wave voltammetry scans
to establish a stable peak current baseline. During the course of
the experiment, tobramycin was titrated into solution using either
a pipet and hand mixed, or a low-pressure neMesys pump (Cetoni, Germany)
for the alternating target experiments, to ensure homogeneous distribution
of free drug. No sensor incubation time was used in between titrant
additions or square-wave voltammetry (SWV) measurements.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec2.8">
      <title>DNA Scaffold
Measurements</title>
      <p>E-DNA scaffold sensors were
fabricated following a previously reported procedure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref></sup> First, 2 mm gold electrodes were mechanically polished
(first with 1 μm-coarse diamond paper and then with 0.05 μm
alumina slurry) and electrochemically cleaned (through successive
scans in 0.5 M sulfuric acid and 0.1 M sulfuric acid + 0.01 M potassium
chloride). Meanwhile the DNA scaffold molecule:<disp-formula id="ueq2"><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="ac9b02553_m002" position="anchor"/></disp-formula>was reduced with a stock solution
of 10 mM
TCEP and then diluted to 25 nM final concentration in PBS. Freshly
cleaned electrodes were first incubated in the resulting DNA scaffold
solution for 1 h at 25 °C and then in 3 mM MCH overnight at 4
°C. Following this, the electrodes were incubated for 2 h in
a solution of 100 nM PNA molecule complementary to the DNA scaffold
and presenting the FLAG epitope (sequence, DYKDDDDK). The platform
was interrogated via SWV using a three-electrode cell consisting of
a Ag/AgCl reference electrode and a platinum counter electrode, contained
within a glass cell. The platform worked as follows: in the absence
of target, the DNA scaffold was free to move generating a high electrochemical
signal. However, upon addition of anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody binding
to the epitope generates steric hindrance (the antibody is larger
than the DNA scaffold) that limits the movement of the DNA scaffold
sensor generating a decrease in the electrochemical signal.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec2.9">
      <title>Measurements
from Protein-Modified Electrodes</title>
      <p>Protein-functionalized
electrodes were fabricated following a previously published protocol.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref41">41</xref></sup> Briefly, commercial 2 mm diameter gold electrodes were cleaned using
a series of electrochemical cleaning steps and functionalized with
protein by incubating the electrodes for 10 min in a solution 20 mM
sodium phosphate and 130 mM sodium chloride (pH 7.0) containing 0.1–1
μM protein. The proteins used for these experiments were modified
with a site-specifically conjugated methylene blue redox reporter
and an amino-terminal alkyl-thiol anchor that enables site-specific
surface-tethering via the proteins’ amino termini. Following
protein deposition, the electrode surface was immersed in a solution
of 5 mM MCH to form a passivating, hydroxyl-coated, self-assembled
monolayer. Prior to use, the electrodes employed in the experiments
shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref> also
underwent four washes in 20 mM sodium phosphate, 0.13 M sodium chloride
(pH 7.0) solutions alternating the presence and absence of 7 M guanidinium
chloride. The washing solutions contained 1 mM MCH to passivate any
bare gold exposed by desorption of nonspecifically adsorbed protein
during the washes. Immediately prior to initiation of each experiment,
the electrodes were repeatedly interrogated by SWV at 60 or 120 Hz
and 25 mV amplitude until producing a stable peak current (typically
around 50 interrogations). Automated guanidinium chloride titrations
were performed in 20 mM sodium phosphate, 0.5 M sodium chloride (pH
7.0), and 0.45 M trimethylamine <italic>N</italic>-oxide on Hamilton
500C dual-syringe dispensers connected to a CH Instruments 660D potentiostat
(CH Instruments, Austin, TX) and a BASi C3 Cell Stand (Bioanalytical
Systems, Inc.). MCH (50 μM) was included in the buffer to minimize
baseline drift, and ionic strength was regulated by inclusion of specific
concentrations of sodium chloride in the buffer. All electrochemical
measurements were performed against a Ag/AgCl reference electrode
with saturated potassium chloride and a platinum counter electrode,
at 25 mV amplitude and in 5 mL total bulk solution volume.</p>

    <title>Results
and Discussion</title>
    <p>We chose the Python programming language<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref></sup> to develop our software framework. As required
to produce sharable
code, Python is developed under an Open Source Initiative-approved
license, which makes our scripts freely distributable.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref></sup> Moreover, as required to ensure easy portability,
Python is a cross-platform language, such that a Python program written
in one operating system can be run on any other (for Microsoft Windows,
a free interpreter<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref></sup> must be installed
first). Finally, Python offers a large standard library of well-documented
functions, operators and toolkits,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref></sup> as
well as a community-supported library containing over 130 000
open-sourced software packages to implement graphical user interfaces
(GUIs), automation, text/image processing, and scientific computing.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>−<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref></sup></p>
    <p>Our script, which we call <underline>S</underline>oftware
for the <underline>A</underline>nalysis and <underline>C</underline>ontinuous <underline>M</underline>onitoring of <underline>E</underline>lectrochemical <underline>S</underline>ystems (SACMES), can be freely
downloaded at the link <uri xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://github.com/netzlab/SACMES.git">https://github.com/netzlab/SACMES.git</uri> and uses Python’s
de facto GUI, Tkinter, which is included
in all standard installs of Python. The GUI controls all aspects of
SACMES, running an event-driven loop that handles data analysis, real-time
data processing, and visualization (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref></xref>A). To start the Data Analysis module, a
Tkinter-based recursive loop searches for files in a user-designated
Path folder that contains files created by an external device such
as, for example, a potentiostat. When new files are found, the loop
enters the Data Analysis module to read and analyze the data contained
within those files. If no new files are found, however, the program
will exit the Data Analysis module and continue on to handle any GUI
events (e.g., button clicks or parameter inputs) while it waits for
new files to be created. After every new file is analyzed, the resulting
processed data is returned to an “Animation Class” module
to be visualized. Finally, the program returns to the Tkinter loop
to continue searching for new files while it handles any GUI events
that occurred while the Data Analysis module was in use.</p>

        <p>Software framework
for the real-time analysis of high-volume electrochemical
data. We have developed an open-source, easily customizable script
written in the Python programming language to enable the real-time
analysis of electrochemical measurements collected with multiple platforms.
(A) Our script uses a recursive loop to continuously handle user-interface
events while simultaneously looking in a user-defined Path folder
for new files generated by, for example, a potentiostat. Once a data
file exists, the script activates a Data Analysis module which performs
a series of data processing steps including signal averaging and least-squares
fitting to a user-defined function and returns the processed data
to an Animation Class to be visualized. The terms “CMD”
and “Terminal” refer to programs installed by default
in Microsoft Windows and Apple macOS, respectively, which provide
text-based access to control the operating systems. (B) In this work,
we used square-wave voltammograms arising from electrochemical sensors
to illustrate the capability of our code to extract peak currents
(calculated as the difference between peak maximum and its two minima)
and Areas Under the Curve (AUCs). (C) The script outputs and visualizes
these values in real-time as the experiment progresses. See <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.analchem.9b02553/suppl_file/ac9b02553_si_001.pdf">Figures S1 and S2</ext-link> for snapshots of the software’s

    <p>SACMES can analyze and visualize a range of electrochemical outputs.
As our first example we customized its Data Analysis module to process
SWV, an electroanalytical technique that measures currents at specific
time intervals following a square-shaped potential program to enable
the effective discrimination of faradaic currents from charging currents.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref></sup> Because of this, SWV is becoming one of the
preferred methods in the field of electrochemical sensors, where removing
double-layer charging effects is fundamental to achieving improved
detection limits.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref></sup> For example, SWV has
been used for the interrogation of electrochemical biosensors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref></sup> employing different molecular recognition elements
such as single- and double-stranded nucleic acids,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>−<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref></sup> non-natural nucleic acids,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref></sup> and peptides.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">32</xref>−<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34">34</xref></sup> SWV has also been used in the detection of environmental
pollutants like heavy metals via electrodeposition and stripping analysis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref36">36</xref></sup> More recently, SWV has been used to interrogate electrochemical
aptamer-based (E-AB) sensors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref37">37</xref></sup> supporting
the high-frequency, real-time measurement of plasma drug levels in
situ in the living body.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref38">38</xref></sup></p>
    <p>We designed SACMES with the ability to continuously process
square-wave
voltammograms via two methods: (1) peak current extraction, calculated
as the difference between the voltammogram’s maximum current
and its baseline, and (2) area under the curve (AUC), calculated using
a Riemann sum of the area under each voltammogram and above its baseline
(<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref></xref>B and <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.analchem.9b02553/suppl_file/ac9b02553_si_001.pdf">Figures S1 and S2</ext-link>). Moreover, these methods support
the simultaneous processing of multiple sensors and multiple square-wave
frequencies. The results of these analyses are then plotted over time
(or over file number) to produce data series. For example, a titration
experiment in which an E-AB sensor is challenged with its molecular
target produces curves where, as expected, peak currents and AUCs
vary monotonically with increasing target concentration (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref></xref>C). These curves
are exported in real time into text files that, if needed, can later
be analyzed to determine physicochemical parameters such as binding
affinity (from a titration with the target), folding thermodynamics
(from titration with a denaturant), or analyte concentrations (e.g.,
from a sensor monitoring drug pharmacokinetics in vivo).</p>
    <p>The
ability of SACMES to analyze square-wave voltammograms is independent
of the analytical system being interrogated. We illustrate this by
presenting the analysis of data collected from three systems commonly
employed in our groups: (1) E-AB sensors that measure specific small-molecule
targets<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref44">44</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>A); (2) DNA-scaffold sensors
detecting monoclonal antibodies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref40">40</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>B); and
(3) redox-reporter-modified proteins site-specifically attached to
an electrode to study surface effects on protein stability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref41">41</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>C). Through
these data, we demonstrate the ability of SACMES to analyze measurements
recorded on multiple electrodes at multiple square-wave frequencies.
For example, SACMES can be used to estimate electron transfer kinetics
from the analysis of peak currents extracted from voltammograms measured
at over 40 frequencies using the Lovrić approach<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref45">45</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>D). SACMES also supports the determination
of peak currents and AUCs from voltammograms recorded on multiple
electrodes simultaneously (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>E) and can perform the statistical analysis of electrode-to-electrode
variation in these parameters. Finally, since the shape of square-wave
voltammograms can be dependent on changing experimental conditions
(e.g., changes in the baseline of an E-AB sensor deployed in vivo),
SACMES is equipped with baseline control that allows the user to define,
in real time, the range of data points to be considered during the
analysis of voltammograms (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref></xref>). Thus, we have created a software that is truly adaptable
to the analysis of both low and high signal-to-noise electrochemical
measurements.</p>

        <p>Our software enables the multielectrode, multifrequency
processing
of square-wave voltammograms. Here we illustrate this via the analysis
of three systems commonly used in our laboratories: (A) a small molecule
drug-detecting E-AB sensor,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref></sup> (B) an antibody-detecting
DNA-scaffold sensor,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref40">40</xref></sup> and (C) a protein site-specifically attached to an electrode in

analysis of voltammograms recorded on multiple electrodes and at multiple
frequencies, our software facilitates the characterization of (column
D) the electron transfer behavior and (column E) the frequency-dependent
signal gain (relative signal change<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref42">42</xref></sup>)
of each system. Simultaneously it performs real-time statistical analysis
of electrode-to-electrode variation in the peak current or area under
the voltammogram (AUC), illustrated here as the shaded areas in columns

OFF response of each platform at such frequencies; the arrows also

        <p>Real-time control of software parameters improves the
analysis
of electrochemical data. We have implemented the ability to control
parameters in real time in our software, a feature that can be useful
for the analysis of electrochemical measurements recorded under fluctuating
conditions or for repetitive measurements performed over long experimental
times in harsh conditions. (A) Here, for example, we show square-wave
voltammograms recorded with a tobramycin-detecting E-AB sensor emplaced
in the jugular vein of a live rat. Using our software we extracted
peak currents from the voltammograms by performing (1) a five point
rolling average to remove high frequency noise, (2) a polynomial regression
of the data, and (3) calculating the difference between the peak current
and the lowest of the two current minima (the “valleys”
in the voltammograms) from the best-fit curve obtained from the regression.
(B) We serially interrogated the sensor every 10 s over 80 min at
square-wave frequencies of 100 and 200 Hz. The visualization module
produced graphs of the relative signal change. (C) By adjusting the
data range analyzed from each voltammogram considered in our analysis
(red line limited by the red arrows in panel C), we corrected for
poor voltammogram baselines and (D) improved the signal-to-noise ratio
of our measurements 2-fold.</p>

    </fig>
    <p>While the ability to process multielectrode, multifrequency data
should be of significant value for the interrogation of many electrochemical
systems, SACMES is uniquely suited for the processing of rapid, time-dependent
measurements. In its current form, the program’s Tkinter loop
searches for files at speeds as fast as 3 ms per cycle, enabling the
continuous, real-time processing of data files even for applications
demanding a high temporal resolution. To achieve these speeds, we
implemented Python’s “High-Level Threading Interface<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref></sup>” in our code, which allows SACMES to
run multiple tasks in parallel (as opposed to serially) to dramatically
improve processing speed and GUI responsiveness without relying on
expensive computers. For example, the program supports the real-time
analysis of chronoamperometrically interrogated E-AB sensors sampled
as frequently as every few hundred milliseconds<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref></xref>). To support the analysis of chronoamperometric measurements, we
modified the Data Analysis module to (1) read chronoamperograms, as
opposed to voltammograms, and (2) perform regression analysis between
the chronoamperograms and a monoexponential function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref46">46</xref></sup> to determine, from the best fit, the current decay time constants
from every measurement. Finally, we modified the Animation Class to
display each chronoamperogram in a log–log format, which facilitates
the analysis of current and time data covering many orders of magnitude.
The program for the analysis of the chronoamperometric measurements
can be downloaded from the link: <uri xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://github.com/netzlab/SACMES.git">https://github.com/netzlab/SACMES.git</uri>. In the same link we have also incorporated an example program for
the continuous processing of cyclic voltammograms.</p>

      <label>Figure 4</label>
      <caption>
        <p>With a processing speed
of a few milliseconds per cycle, our program
enables the real-time analysis of data acquired at fast rates. To
illustrate this, we modified our code so it would read chronoamperograms,
as opposed to voltammograms. For each measurement, we merged two chronoamperograms
(one lasting 10 ms and a second one lasting 500 ms) which we acquired
with the same sampling frequency (one point every 10 μs) but
different “current sensitivity” so we could resolve
with high signal-to-noise ratio decays spanning 4 orders of magnitude
in current. We continuously recorded these two-pulse, merged chronoamperograms
every 500 ms from a tobramycin-binding E-AB sensor. The program acquired
these measurements, merged them according to the limits set by the
user in real time in the “Regression Analysis Parameters”
box, visualized them as a single trace, and fit them to a monoexponential
decay with range limits set in the “Curve Fit Range”
box. The right-hand panel shows how the half-life of the current decay
decreases monotonically with increasing tobramycin concentrations.
This decay occurs because the sensor’s aptamer folds into a
more compact conformation upon drug binding, which increases the efficiency
of electron transfer from the redox reporter.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref></sup></p>

    </fig>
    <p>Besides achieving high processing
speeds, SACMES supports constant-speed
analysis and animation of large data volumes collected over extended
periods of time without building temporary (RAM) memory. To achieve
this, we integrated a computer graphics technique called “Blitting”.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref></sup> Whereas most image-rendering techniques require
the rendering of an entirely new image for each data file, Blitting
saves a clean background canvas, or “bit map”, in which
only new data is rendered, thus keeping the time needed to visualize
each file constant. Whether SACMES analyzes a single file or thousands,
the speed of analysis under a specific set of technique parameters
is thus constant, a feature that enables the visualization of measurements
taken over extended periods without the need for high-performance
computers. To illustrate this, we ran two experiments: (1) monitoring
the output of a tobramycin-detecting E-AB sensor (measurement frequency
of 20 s) alternatively challenged every 30 min with either tobramycin-containing
serum or drug-free serum over 14 h (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref></xref>A) and (2) the continuous monitoring of signaling
current, every 2 min, from an electrode functionalized with redox-reporter-modified
protein and immersed in a solution that unfolds the protein (10 M
urea) for 24 h (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref></xref>B). These experiments illustrate the ability of SACMES to uninterruptedly
and continuously analyze data every few seconds over the course of
hours or days.</p>

of a tobramycin-detecting E-AB sensor interrogated every 20 s over

and debugged the Python code. K.L.P. performed all animal procedures
and in vivo measurements. M.K. and G.O. fabricated electrodes functionalized
with full-length proteins and performed representative measurements.
C.P. fabricated DNA-scaffold sensors and performed representative
measurements. K.L.P., T.E.K., and N.A.-C. supervised and enforced
approved animal protocols. All authors participated in the writing
and editing of this manuscript.</p>

    <title>Notes</title>
    <p>We recognize
that even after extensive debugging, the program
may need improvement; thus, we also include online access to a GitHub
folder (<uri xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://github.com/netzlab/SACMES.git">https://github.com/netzlab/SACMES.git</uri>) where we will continue to post code fixtures and updates. This
folder also contains an open-source license for free software distribution.
We encourage the scientific community to actively use and freely distribute
our code and to reach out to us with script improvements.</p>
