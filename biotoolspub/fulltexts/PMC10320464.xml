      <title>Abstract</title>
      <p>Cancer is one of the leading causes of human death. As metabolomics techniques become more and more widely used in cancer research, metabolites are increasingly recognized as crucial factors in both cancer diagnosis and treatment. In this study, we developed MACdb (<ext-link xlink:href="https://ngdc.cncb.ac.cn/macdb" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:show="new">https://ngdc.cncb.ac.cn/macdb</ext-link>), a curated knowledgebase to recruit the metabolic associations between metabolites and cancers. Unlike conventional data-driven resources, MACdb integrates cancer-metabolic knowledge from extensive publications, providing high quality metabolite associations and tools to support multiple research purposes. In the current implementation, MACdb has integrated 40,710 cancer-metabolite associations, covering 267 traits from 17 categories of cancers with high incidence or mortality, based entirely on manual curation from 1,127 studies reported in 462 publications (screened from 5,153 research papers). MACdb offers intuitive browsing functions to explore associations at multi-dimensions (metabolite, trait, study, and publication), and constructs knowledge graph to provide overall landscape among cancer, trait, and metabolite. Furthermore, NameToCid (map metabolite name to PubChem Cid) and Enrichment tools are developed to help users enrich the association of metabolites with various cancer types and traits.</p>
      <sec>
        <title>Implication:</title>
        <p>MACdb paves an informative and practical way to evaluate cancer-metabolite associations and has a great potential to help researchers identify key predictive metabolic markers in cancers.</p>

    <title>Introduction</title>
    <p>Cancer is one of the major causes of global mortality (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Metabolites reflect the sum of downstream products as the results of alterations occurred at the DNA, RNA, and protein levels (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). They are used as biomarkers for early diagnosis, staging of cancers, which can be helpful for the need to predict disease progression, survival, and treatment follow-up (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). With the flourishing development of metabolomics in cancer research, cancer-metabolite associations in a series of cancer types have been widely investigated and reported (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4–7</xref>). However, most of the valuable associations are scattered in different literatures, which poses a huge challenge to integrate and evaluate the significance of metabolites in cancers. Firstly, researchers need to manually search and review large numbers of literature to tap into the correlation between the existing traits and metabolites, which is time-consuming. Secondly, due to the inconsistency of metabolite and trait names in the literature, comprehensive assessment of associations among cancer, traits, and metabolites are difficult. Finally, a group of metabolites reflect consensus status of cancers, however, it is hard to perform overview analysis (e.g., enrichment analysis) based on unaggregated publications.</p>
    <p>So far, several efforts have been made to recruit metabolic associations from various cancer researches. For instance, the Human Metabolome Database, a comprehensive database for human metabolites, provides ∼800 well-known disease-associated metabolites (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Lung Cancer Metabolome Database is dedicated to collecting mass spectrometry metabolite associations in lung cancer, and provides metabolite information from 65 publications (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). CMBD (refers to a manually curated cancer metabolic biomarker knowledge database) offers 282 manually curated metabolic biomarkers and 438 relationships among 18 sites of cancers from 248 articles (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Besides, MetaboAnalyst supplies powerful pathway and enrichment analysis for Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes and The Small Molecule Pathway Database (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). However, due to the limited number of associations and cancer types, it is difficult for users to obtain a comprehensive overview of metabolite associations across multiple cancer types from the existing resources. Furthermore, with the increasing use of high-throughput techniques such as mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance in cancer research, exploring the potential role of a group of metabolites in literature-based knowledge network is essential but impossible.</p>
    <p>Here, we present MACdb, a curated knowledgebase for metabolic associations in cancers. It is dedicated to integrating and standardizing valuable knowledge from the existing literature, providing a high-quality association network and powerful tools to help users evaluate the potential role of a single or a group of metabolites across multiple cancers. We hope that MACdb will help researchers to accelerate their study by enabling them to investigate the metabolites of interest in a fast and efficient way.</p>

      <title>Data curation</title>
      <p>To obtain high-quality metabolic associations, we established a standardized curation model with three main steps: literature search, study curation, and association curation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). Firstly, we used two query criteria in searching PubMed according to the definition of the cancer name. Criteria 1 is (cancer*[Title] OR tumo*[Title] OR carcinoma*[Title] OR lesion*[Title]) AND (metabolome*[Title] OR metabolite*[Title] OR metabolomic*[Title] OR metabolic[Title] OR metabolism*[Title] OR metabonom*[Title]) AND (cancer anatomic position or its synonym[Title]) AND (patient*[Title/Abstract]). Criteria 2 is ((metabolome*[Title]) OR (metabolite*[Title])) OR (metabolomic*[Title])) OR (metabolic[Title])) OR (metabolism*[Title])) OR (metabonom*[Title]))) AND (cancer name or its synonym[Title]). We searched the literature for 17 categories of cancers with the high incidence or mortality in United States, 2022 (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>) from PubMed (RRID:SCR_004846) on July 1, 2022, and found 5,153 research papers. Details of the publications were obtained through PubMed2XL (<ext-link xlink:href="https://pubmed2xl.com/xml/" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:show="new">https://pubmed2xl.com/xml/</ext-link>). Secondly, we manually reviewed these articles, only literatures containing cancer-associated traits and metabolite associations (metabolite profiling on cancer samples or differential metabolites compared between cases and controls) were incorporated into MACdb. We curated details of studies from publications, including condition, trait, cancer type, cancer subtype, tissue, platform (profiling method), and case and/or control information (group name, age, gender and/or sample size). The number of initial-enrolled and final-included literature, the type of criteria, cancer site, cancer name and its synonyms used for the preliminary screening of each category of cancer can be found in Supplementary Table S1. Thirdly, data for associations will be kept only if they have any of the following information: concentration, significance, delta change trend (up/down/unchanged or missing), and prediction accuracy. Data curation does not involve in any bias reduction techniques. Most of the studies are applied to metabolomic profiling, some other studies that provide detailed metabolite association that detected by biomedical analysis are also included. Detailed criteria are shown below. Yuan and colleagues (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>) meets all curation standards, which is included in MACdb. Lin and colleagues (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>) is based on LC-MS serum metabolic profiling, however, it is unable to extract the group comparison condition and trait, which is not recruited.

Disease Ontology (RRID:SCR_003491) was used to standardize different cancers, and PubChem (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>) was used as the metabolite ontology to eliminate the influence of metabolite synonyms from different publications. To unify the representation of biological traits, entities were mapped to the standardized terms in Experimental Factor Ontology (EFO; RRID:SCR_003574), Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO; RRID:SCR_006016), Ontology for Biomedical Investigations (OBI; RRID:SCR_006266), and Mondo Disease Ontology (MONDO) and classified into cancer, gene abnormality, genotype, medical interaction, and phenotype categories. We constructed NameToCid to standardize the metabolites in batches (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>).</p>

      <title>Knowledge graph construction</title>
      <p>Knowledge graph was built to quantify and visualize the associations in MACdb. Each node represents a cancer type, trait, or metabolite. The width of edges and the size of nodes reflect the strength of associations. We calculated the number of study or publication that support the association between nodes (cancer, trait, and metabolite; Supplementary Fig. S1), and used the evidence level (study or publication) and numbers as strength indicator.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec2-4">
      <title>Tools construction</title>
      <p>Enrichment tool was built using Python (RRID:SCR_008394) and Pandas (RRID:SCR_018214) packages. Fisher exact test was used to calculate the co-occurrence probability between inputs and trait/cancer-type related metabolites. Bonferroni correction was used to adjust the <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> value for each trait and cancer type. NameToCid was constructed on the basis of the standard and synonymous names of metabolites in PubChem. We downloaded the original dataset from PubChem, integrated by Cid (PubChem Compound Identification), and stored 226,467,569 metabolites in MySQL database. Indexes were built to accelerate retrieval. MACdb implemented a lightweight job queue (four processes per tool) to manage tasks. Task IDs was allocated to retrieve each result.</p>

    <sec id="sec2-5">
      <title>Web server implementation</title>
      <p>MACdb used the front-end and back-end separation mode. The back-end APIs were built by using FastAPI (<ext-link xlink:href="https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:show="new">https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/</ext-link>). MySQL relational database was used for data storage. The front-end pages were constructed using Vue.js (RRID:SCR_021709) along with Vue-router (<ext-link xlink:href="https://router.vuejs.org/" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:show="new">https://router.vuejs.org/</ext-link>) and Vuex (<ext-link xlink:href="https://vuex.vuejs.org/index.html" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:show="new">https://vuex.vuejs.org/index.html</ext-link>). Axios (<ext-link xlink:href="http://www.axios-js.com/" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:show="new">http://www.axios-js.com/</ext-link>) was used to send AJAX requests to convey data from the back-end. The whole system was deployed in the Nginx server (<ext-link xlink:href="http://nginx.org/" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:show="new">http://nginx.org/</ext-link>). ECharts (<ext-link xlink:href="http://echarts.baidu.com/" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:show="new">http://echarts.baidu.com/</ext-link>) was used to provide interactive charts and data visualization. The enrichment tool was implemented by Python 3.5.</p>

      <title>MACdb functionalities and overview</title>
      <p>MACdb was designed to provide high quality curated knowledge and convenient tools, including the following features: (i) high-quality and multidimensional associations for specific metabolite; (ii) an overview of current frontiers and hotspots of metabolites in various cancer categories; (iii) the ability to explore and investigate a set of metabolites based on publications. Briefly, we established collection criteria for study and association, constructed and grouped the relevant information into metabolites, traits, studies and publications for browsing, and provided knowledge graph for rapid exploration and visualization on a specific metabolite, trait, or cancer category. Besides, MACdb embeds two online tools named NameToCid and Enrichment to facilitate the standardization and enrichment of a group of metabolites without the requirement of bioinformatics skills. Moreover, MACdb provides statistic page that offers summary information, making it convenient for users to capture global views and hotspots in the field. The overall design of MACdb is shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>. All association tables and figures are interactive and can be downloaded through a user-friendly interface.</p>
      <p>MACdb provides an overview of current cancer-metabolomics researches (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). Breast cancer (88 publications), lung cancer (83 publications), colorectal cancer (68 publications), and prostate cancer (51 publications) are the most researched cancer types (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>). In terms of sampling site, serum, plasma, urine, and blood are the most commonly used ones, accounting for 283, 270, 160, and 55 studies in MACdb, respectively (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>). The most extensively studied trait is lung cancer, involving 63 studies (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>) and 1,277 associations from 43 publications (<ext-link xlink:href="https://ngdc.cncb.ac.cn/macdb/browse_trait/113" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:show="new">https://ngdc.cncb.ac.cn/macdb/browse_trait/113</ext-link>). From the aspect of metabolite, glutamic acid is the top recorded metabolite, associated with more than 80 different traits.</p>

      <title>Case study: using MACdb at different application scenarios</title>
      <p>MACdb is designed to accommodate multiple research paradigms (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>; Supplementary Methods). We take ovarian cancer as an example to show how to obtain the essential knowledge from MACdb. Firstly, researchers can quickly allocate the traits or cancer categories of interest. MACdb provides 10 traits associated with ovarian cancer, which can be selected by filtering cancer types on the trait module (Supplementary Fig. S2A, <ext-link xlink:href="https://ngdc.cncb.ac.cn/macdb/browse_trait" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:show="new">https://ngdc.cncb.ac.cn/macdb/browse_trait</ext-link>). Through the knowledge graph page, users can retrieve 10 traits associated with ovarian cancer, conditional on a <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> value ≤ 0.01. Among these traits, ovarian cancer is the most popular trait studied (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>). Secondly, researchers can retrieve detailed and comprehensive information in the metabolite and trait modules. Users can obtain 274 metabolites reported in ovarian cancer trait from the metabolite module, of which 138 metabolites with <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> value ≤ 0.01 (Supplementary Fig. S2B). In addition, users can obtain the metabolites in knowledge graph page, where 20 metabolites are differential expressed with <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> value ≤ 0.001 and recorded in at least 2 publications (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>). Among these metabolites, glutamic acid has been reported twice. Thirdly, numerous molecular studies have been conducted to confirm the hypothesis of glutamic acid as a biomarker of ovarian cancer as well as other types of cancers (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6, 15</xref>). It is also the most recorded metabolite in MACdb and users can quickly query its correlative cancer types, traits, studies, and publications (Supplementary Fig. S2C). Moreover, users can acquire that 16 traits and 8 types of cancers are associated with glutamic acid with <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> value ≤ 0.001 and at least 2 publications recorded from the knowledge graph page (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>). Last but not least, users can retrieve a specific metabolite in a specific cancer type from the metabolite module.</p>
      <p>Interestingly, evidence that ovarian benign tumor is a suggested factor in the development and progression of ovarian cancer (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>) is limited at the metabolomics level. In this case study, we use a group of 9 metabolites which are obtained from a ovarian benign tumor serum study (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). By the enrichment tool of MACdb, interestingly, the top 1 enriched traits and cancer types (8/9 hits) are ovarian cancer (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">F</xref>), which indicate the ovarian benign tumor still have a high probability of developing ovarian cancer.</p>

    <title>Discussion</title>
    <p>The rapid growth of cancer metabolomics researches poses various challenges, including the integration of scattered knowledge into a unified and comprehensive platform covering multiple cancer categories. Moreover, intercomparison within cancers, traits, and metabolites, and visual presentations are problematic as well. Although several databases have integrated cancer-metabolite associations based on manual curation of metabolomic publications, and provided candidate biomarkers for cancer research (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8–10</xref>), none of them provide high quality associations across more than ten cancer categories or effective tools. Here, we present MACdb, a public knowledgebase, providing standardized and integrated metabolic associations from literatures of multiple cancer categories as well as powerful knowledge graph and tools. In comparison with existing metabolic databases, MACdb mainly features: (i) the availability of a large number of high-quality cancer-metabolite associations across 17 cancer categories; (ii) the interconnected multidimensional browsing functions (metabolite, trait, study, publication) providing users with the possibility to gain an in-depth and comprehensive understanding of the associations of interest; (iii) knowledge graph and statistic page providing users with a global view not only on metabolites, but also on traits and cancer categories; (iv) MACdb supports multiple research paradigms, including investigate a specific metabolite or cancer type, as well as a group of metabolites. Although there are large biases between platforms, the conclusion is reliable as the comparison in a study is profiled by the same method. To integrate conclusions across different studies (publications) for a specific association, we designed the capsule summary to illustrate the percentage of change trend (e.g., down/up/unchanged &amp; missing for delta trends) and <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> value from different studies.</p>
    <p>MACdb presents consistent findings with previous studies. Glutamine is the top 3 recorded metabolite, and differentially expressed in more than 10 cancers, e.g., lung cancer, prostate cancer, and breast cancer. Glutamine is reported as an essential metabolite that has been extensively studied in cancer research (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>), and considered as an important biomarker for early cancer diagnosis (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Besides, enriching the metabolites of ovarian benign tumor (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>), liver cirrhosis (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>), prostatitis (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>), and benign lung nodules (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>) by the enrichment tool, we find that the most enriched cancer or trait is ovarian cancer (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">F</xref>), liver cancer (Supplementary Fig. S3A and S3B), prostate cancer (Supplementary Fig. S3C and S3D), and lung cancer (Supplementary Fig. S3E and S3F), respectively. These findings contribute to subsequent studies such as those for tumor formation mechanisms or biomarkers discovery. Taken together, we believe that MACdb has the potential not only to extract existing conclusions, but also to discover novel knowledge.</p>
    <p>Although the current version of MACdb does not integrate all metabolomic articles, nor can it directly replace users' understanding of the literature, it could help researchers to accelerate their study by enabling them to investigate the metabolites of interest in a fast and efficient way. To date, MACdb has catalogued 40,710 associations in 17 categories of cancers. With numerous new cancer metabolomic projects underway, analysis conducted on standard processing flow will be added in the future. For the convenience of researchers interested in various cancer types, other common cancer types such as gastric cancer, esophageal carcinoma, and skin cancer will be integrated (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20, 21</xref>). Moreover, gene mutations that play a regulatory role in cancer metabolism and expression signatures that reflect the metabolic abnormalities will also be expected to be integrated to better understand the regulatory mechanisms of cancer metabolism. In conclusion, MACdb, as one of the database resources of the National Genomics Data Center (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>), will continue to integrate more cancer metabolism studies, and develop more handy analytical tools, ultimately, supporting global human cancer researches, clinical applications and beyond.</p>
