    <abstract>
      <p>Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune condition, characterised by joint pain, damage and disability, which can be addressed in a high proportion of patients by timely use of targeted biologic treatments. However, the patients, non-responsive to the treatments often suffer from refractoriness of the disease, leading to poor quality of life. Additionally, the biologic treatments are expensive. We obtained plasma samples from N = 144 participants with RA, who were about to commence anti-tumour necrosis factor (anti-TNF) therapy. These samples were sent to Olink Proteomics, Uppsala, Sweden, where proximity extension assays of 4 panels, containing 92 proteins each, were performed. A total of n = 89 samples of patients passed the quality control of anti-TNF treatment response data. The preliminary analysis of plasma protein expression values suggested that the RA population could be divided into two distinct molecular sub-groups (endotypes). However, these broad groups did not predict response to anti-TNF treatment, but were significantly different in terms of gender and their disease activity. We then labelled these patients as responders (n = 60) and non-responders (n = 29) based on the change in disease activity score (DAS) after 6 months of anti-TNF treatment and applied machine learning (ML) with a rigorous 5-fold nested cross-validation scheme to filter 17 proteins that were significantly associated with the treatment response. We have developed a ML based classifier ATRPred (anti-TNF treatment response predictor), which can predict anti-TNF treatment response in RA patients with 81% accuracy, 75% sensitivity and 86% specificity. ATRPred may aid clinicians to direct anti-TNF therapy to patients most likely to receive benefit, thus save cost as well as prevent non-responsive patients from refractory consequences. ATRPred is implemented in R.</p>

      <title>Author summary</title>
      <p>Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic disease, characterised by joint pain, damage and disability. It is known to affect at least 1% of European population. It can be addressed in a high proportion of patients by timely use of targeted biologic treatments. But, biologic treatments continue to rank among the highest grossing drugs. Adalimumab (a biologic drug) for example, alone generated 20 billion US dollars of revenue worldwide in 2018. Additionally, European countries with limited resources, place volume controls on reimbursed medicines. A cheaper prognostic test for biologic response can help clinicians prescribe treatments to those who will receive benefit and also rationalise expensive treatments. In this study we have proposed an informative plasma protein signature, consisting of 17 proteins, and have developed a ML based classifier ATRPred (Anti-TNF Treatment Response Predictor), which can predict anti-TNF treatment response in RA patients with 81% accuracy. With this work we have tried to help clinicians to optimise treatment selection, reduce spend on biologics in unresponsive patients and overall improve quality of life for non-responsive RA patients. Our study has also identified endotypes or molecular sub-classes of RA using plasma protein profiles. These endotypes did not show difference in the responsiveness towards the anti-TNF, however they may be helpful in understanding of the disease and response to other treatments, going forward.</p>

    <title>Introduction</title>
    <p>Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune condition characterised by relapsing joint pain, inflammation, and damage along with systemic effects and elevated morbidity. Without effective treatment, RA patients suffer greater risk of disability [<xref rid="pcbi.1010204.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Initially, RA patients are treated with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and conventional disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs). Patients, refractory to conventional DMARDs, are subsequently prescribed biologic DMARDs [<xref rid="pcbi.1010204.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], among which anti-tumour necrosis factor (anti-TNF) therapies are common, which includes adalimumab, etanercept, infliximab, certolizumab or golimumab–a monoclonal anti-TNF antibody. However, not all patients respond well to anti-TNF therapy. Approximately 10–30% do not respond initially and 23–46% lose the responsiveness over time [<xref rid="pcbi.1010204.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. A recent article suggests that at least 6% of RA patients on biologics suffer from a refractory condition of the disease [<xref rid="pcbi.1010204.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. This suggests the existence of molecular sub-classes within the broad disease class. These molecular sub-classes are known as endotypes. Unlike, phenotype which involves only observable characteristics, an endotype has direct relation with disease process as it involves inflammatory parameters and specific biological mechanisms. A recent paper from McInnes et al [<xref rid="pcbi.1010204.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] advocates the need for clinically meaningful RA endotypes to stratify patients for the therapeutics.</p>
    <p>Clinicians generally decide to prescribe anti-TNF therapy based on their disease severity, progression, and other comorbidities. Recent research suggests that the clinicians often switch between different treatments empirically because of a lack of suitable predictive tests [<xref rid="pcbi.1010204.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. A major downside of this approach is that for patients who remain unresponsive to attempted biologic treatments, inadequate suppression of ongoing disease activity elevates the risk of permanent joint damage and disability [<xref rid="pcbi.1010204.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. This argues for the need of developing a better prognostic model, that can predict a patient’s responsiveness towards the anti-TNF therapy.</p>
    <p>Furthermore, RA is known to affect at least 1% of European population [<xref rid="pcbi.1010204.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. A recent epidemiological study has reviewed prevalence of RA in different countries of every continent and reports that the prevalence is still close to 1% in many European countries [<xref rid="pcbi.1010204.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Additionally, biologic treatments remain relatively costly and continue to rank among the highest grossing drugs. Humira (adalimumab) for example, alone generated 20 billion US dollars of revenue worldwide in 2018 [<xref rid="pcbi.1010204.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. A very recent study [<xref rid="pcbi.1010204.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] has pointed out various hidden access barriers to biologic treatment in the European Union (EU).</p>
    <p>Thus, there is a strong clinical as well as health-economic need for a more personalised prognostic models which can determine likelihood of response to anti-TNF therapy [<xref rid="pcbi.1010204.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Several studies using different omics profiles have attempted to predict response to anti-TNF therapy [<xref rid="pcbi.1010204.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Literature review shows that the researchers have identified serum proteomic biomarkers for response to anti-TNF therapy [<xref rid="pcbi.1010204.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] including one based on autoantibody and cytokine profiles [<xref rid="pcbi.1010204.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Biomarkers have also been found specific to infliximab drug response [<xref rid="pcbi.1010204.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] and etanercept drug response [<xref rid="pcbi.1010204.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Further differentiated responses have been noted for adalimumab and infliximab [<xref rid="pcbi.1010204.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Also, clinical efficacy can be intensified with infliximab using therapeutic drug monitoring approaches [<xref rid="pcbi.1010204.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Several multi-omics approaches have also been used to predict anti-TNF efficacy [<xref rid="pcbi.1010204.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. For example, an integrated multi-omics approach of previously known DNA, RNA, and protein biomarkers [<xref rid="pcbi.1010204.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], and a more recent approach which combines transcriptomic and genomic analysis [<xref rid="pcbi.1010204.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. However, none of these studies have presented a robust scoring scheme/model for drug responsiveness that can help in decision making under a clinical setting; rather they relied on only p-values.</p>
    <p>We have strictly followed European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) criteria for patient recruitment, as it is known to have good construct, criterion, and discriminatory validity [<xref rid="pcbi.1010204.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Further, to stratify a patient’s potential response to treatment, a proteomic profile (which is highly variable) may better reflect current disease state than transcriptomic (variable) or genomic (constant) profiles. With the advent of new high-throughput proteomics technology such as multiplexed proximity extension assay (PEA), it is now possible to profile a patients’ plasma proteins with high accuracy and sensitivity [<xref rid="pcbi.1010204.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. This study was designed to identify a robust protein signature which can predict a patient’s response to anti-TNF therapy using a highly sensitive protein detection platform. This study investigates whether plausible endotypes with clinical relevance can be detected in the plasma proteome and if further stratification can predict future response to anti-TNF treatment. Machine Learning (ML) based algorithms, which have been widely exploited for prediction and/or classification problems in bioinformatics, were deployed to mine targeted proteome data. This could help clinicians to optimise treatment selection, reduce spend on biologics in unresponsive patients and overall improve quality of life for non-responsive RA patients.</p>

      <title>Patient recruitment and selection criteria</title>
      <p>A total of one hundred and forty-four (N = 144) Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients who were unresponsive to conventional DMARDs and naïve to biologic DMARDs were recruited from rheumatology biologic clinics at Altnagelvin Hospital, Londonderry and Musgrave Park Hospital, Belfast, Northern Ireland. The study inclusion criteria were: i) RA patients fulfilling EULAR classification criteria [<xref rid="pcbi.1010204.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1010204.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], ii) about to receive anti-TNF treatment as part of routine clinical practice, iii) fulfil the BSR 2001 criteria for anti-TNF therapy [<xref rid="pcbi.1010204.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], iv) had a DAS28 score of &gt;5.1 when assessed for treatment (before baseline), and v) reached 6 months of follow-up. Patients who stopped anti-TNF temporarily during first six months or discontinued therapy prior to the 6 months’ follow-up for reasons other than inefficacy were excluded.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec005">
      <title>Sample collection and collation of clinical information</title>
      <p>The study was supported by a patient advisory group who met regularly throughout the study to advise on study design, recruitment literature and results dissemination. Eligible patients were invited by mailed patient information sheets, a minimum of 48 hours before a routine care appointment. Written informed consent was obtained and blood samples were collected prior to anti-TNF treatment. Blood samples were then processed to plasma by centrifugation, aliquoted and stored at -80°C until shipped to Olink Proteomics, Uppsala, Sweden for proximity extension assay (PEA) analysis. Clinical and demographic information were collated from medical records and clinic databases. The disease activity score across 28 joints (DAS-28) based on erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was recorded at baseline and after six months of anti-TNF therapy. Patients were classified as responders and non-responders at six months as per British Society for Rheumatology (BSR) response criteria [<xref rid="pcbi.1010204.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Further, a patient, whose drug was changed from anti-TNF to a different class by clinicians were also classified as non-responders. Out of N = 144 patients recruited 55 were either lost to follow-up or were given other biologic DMARDs (such as Tociluzimab, Ritiuximab, etc). The recruits lost were unable to make 6 months follow-up appointments, or complete composite data required to calculate DAS score were not available.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec006">
      <title>Plasma protein profile</title>
      <p>Patients’ plasma samples were analysed by multiplexed PEA [<xref rid="pcbi.1010204.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] provided by Olink Proteomics (<ext-link xlink:href="http://www.olink.com/" ext-link-type="uri">www.olink.com</ext-link>). Following four Proseek Multiplex panels comprising 92 proteins each were used for analyses: cardiovascular panels II and III, immune response panel and the inflammatory panel. Each panel was quantified by real-time PCR using the Fluidigm BioMark HD platform. In each panel run, 92 samples, 1 negative control and 3 positive controls were analysed. Controls were used for determining the assay limit of detection (LoD) values as well as allowing normalization of measurements into ddCq (ΔΔC<sub>q</sub>: double delta quantification cycle in qPCR) values. The ddCq values are then log<sub>2</sub>-transformed to promote normal distribution for subsequent analysis. Olink proteomics returned protein expression data in exponential scale called normalised protein expression (NPX), such that the real expression values are proportional to 2<sup>NPX</sup>. Each protein’s NPX values are relative quantification and hence they cannot be compared across different proteins [<xref rid="pcbi.1010204.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Therefore, to obtain comparable results for all proteins [<xref rid="pcbi.1010204.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] and as a pre-processing step for machine learning inputs, each of them is separately scaled into a standard normal distribution ~N(0, 1). A total of 352 proteins passed the initial quality control (QC) and were subsequently used for the statistical and machine learning based analysis.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec007">
      <title>Statistical, computational and bioinformatics analyses</title>
      <p>All statistical and computational analyses were carried out in R v3.6.1 [<xref rid="pcbi.1010204.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. The t-test or chi-square test (as appropriate) to check for statistical significance of demographic and clinical features, and the principal component analysis (PCA) of Olink proteomics data, were performed in the <italic toggle="yes">base</italic> R package. Quality control (QC) of protein NPX datasets involved discarding protein values which were flagged with a QC warning (sample did not pass quality control for a given protein panel). Also, NPX values were removed if below the limit of detection (LoD) level for a given protein PEA, resulting in &lt; 2% of missing values. Since missingness was very small, it was imputed using k-Nearest Neighbour (k-NN) method using the <italic toggle="yes">RANN</italic> package [<xref rid="pcbi.1010204.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. PCA result was validated with leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) using <italic toggle="yes">sinkr</italic> package [<xref rid="pcbi.1010204.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. General ML pre- and post- processing methods were derived from <italic toggle="yes">caret</italic> [<xref rid="pcbi.1010204.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] and <italic toggle="yes">e1071</italic> package [<xref rid="pcbi.1010204.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Further, we deployed generalised linear models (GLMs), using the <italic toggle="yes">glmnet</italic> package [<xref rid="pcbi.1010204.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], to create an intuitive mathematical formulation with a linear combination of protein expression values. Receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves were obtained via <italic toggle="yes">pROC</italic> package [<xref rid="pcbi.1010204.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Finally, Youden Index [<xref rid="pcbi.1010204.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] was used to choose the best point in ROC curve to calculate thresholds for model score to obtain sensitivity and specificity values. Box plot and beeswarm plot were drawn using <italic toggle="yes">beanplot</italic> package [<xref rid="pcbi.1010204.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] and <italic toggle="yes">beeswarm</italic> package [<xref rid="pcbi.1010204.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] respectively, and <italic toggle="yes">gplots</italic> package [<xref rid="pcbi.1010204.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] and <italic toggle="yes">ggrepel</italic> package [<xref rid="pcbi.1010204.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] were used for presenting the results. The final model selection was done based on Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) metric, which is the most preferred metric for the classification problems. Enrichment analysis and Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) network analysis was performed using STRING database [<xref rid="pcbi.1010204.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. The Gene Ontology (GO) terms were summarised using REVIGO [<xref rid="pcbi.1010204.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] with its default parameters and the PPI networks were visualised using Cytoscape [<xref rid="pcbi.1010204.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>], an open-source software commonly used for network-based analysis. The Pearson’s correlation coefficient between the protein features was computed using <italic toggle="yes">stats</italic> namespace under <italic toggle="yes">base</italic> R package. This was followed by hierarchical clustering and plotting using the <italic toggle="yes">heatmaply</italic> package [<xref rid="pcbi.1010204.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>].</p>

      <title>Feature selection with machine learning</title>
      <p>A total of 500 simulations were run by randomly splitting the dataset into 80%:20% and a GLM was learned on 80% training data and tested on 20% test data. If the GLM model had better than random performance (i.e., AUC &gt; 0.5), the feature selected in the model was then appended to a feature list. Thus, the importance of a feature reflects its frequency in the feature list. For example, a frequency of 0.8 for a feature represents that the feature showed up in 80% of the 500 simulated models. It is worth mentioning here, that multiple proteomics signature, having different feature set, are possible [<xref rid="pcbi.1010204.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. However, getting all the signature and its performance can be computationally expensive due to large number of combinations possible. Therefore, we went with a deterministic approach of stepwise feature selection, by calculating feature importance (FI) as described above, using a fixed seed value of 200 for 500 simulations.</p>

      <title>Machine learning based model development</title>
      <p>Our dataset involved 89 samples; hence we chose 5-fold double alias nested cross-validation (CV) for the development of the predictive model [<xref rid="pcbi.1010204.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. This CV scheme for testing ensures no bias in the selection of completely independent model-blind test-set [<xref rid="pcbi.1010204.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Model evaluation was done first by having only gender and baseline DAS and then including protein features one-by-one as per the frequency obtained during feature selection in decreasing order. Mean AUC of training and test sets were measured after fitting a GLM, which was optimised for lambda hyperparameter by 10-fold CV within the training set. The GLM was an Elastic Net with alpha of 0.9, which implements regression with 90% LASSO and 10% Ridge regularization. The aim was to select non-correlated protein, which is achieved by LASSO regularization; a popular method used for feature selection. However, 10% of Ridge regularization was kept to overcome LASSO’s limitation to saturate with fewer features. The protein feature set having the highest test set AUC, without the decrease in training set AUC, was selected and the model performance was noted. Finally, with these protein features along with gender and baseline DAS, the model was trained on the whole data and the beta or regression coefficients were computed.</p>

      <title>ATRPred tool development</title>
      <p>An R-based package was developed for implementing the above-mentioned ML model with the help of <italic toggle="yes">devtools</italic> package [<xref rid="pcbi.1010204.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. An input file template along with sample input files of a responder as well as a non-responder are also included in the examples folder present within the package. The R function <italic toggle="yes">antiTNFresponse()</italic> reads the input and normalises the same with the internal 89 patient data to get comparable numbers for feature sets and finally scores the patient for response to the anti-TNF therapy. It then calculates the patient’s probability to respond anti-TNF treatment and predicts if the patient will be a responder or non-responder. This tool is provided as an open-source GitHub repository at <ext-link xlink:href="https://github.com/ShuklaLab/ATRPred" ext-link-type="uri">https://github.com/ShuklaLab/ATRPred</ext-link>.</p>

    <p>The main demographic and clinical features of the patients are shown in <xref rid="pcbi.1010204.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. Gender and DAS values at both baseline and 6 months, were found to be statistically significant (p &lt; 0.05) between responders and non-responders. The anti-TNF response rate of 67% in our study is almost identical to the 68% reported in a larger study [<xref rid="pcbi.1010204.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. However, neither this study [<xref rid="pcbi.1010204.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>] nor any other study has reported any gender difference as per the author’s knowledge. This deference might be due to gender selective confounders like smoking history for which unfortunately the data was not available.</p>

      <p>Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for all n = 89 patients was performed to visualise potential endotypes based on plasma proteome profile. The elbow plot of first 30 PCs showed the drop of explained variance to less than 1% at PC 20 (<xref rid="pcbi.1010204.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1A Fig</xref>). Therefore, we carried out LOOCV of the first 20 PCs, which gave top 20, 6, and 4 PCs with minimum predicted sum of squares (PRESS) for naïve, approximate, and pseudoinverse approaches, respectively (<xref rid="pcbi.1010204.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1B Fig</xref>). Although the naïve approach has limitations [<xref rid="pcbi.1010204.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>], all three LOOCV approaches suggested that at least first 4 PCs are important. The first two principal components (PC1 and PC2) did not show any segregation; however, the third principal component (PC3) was able to subdivide patients into two distinct clusters i.e., endotypes (<xref rid="pcbi.1010204.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>). The demographic and clinical features for each cluster are shown in <xref rid="pcbi.1010204.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. A statistically significant difference (p &lt; 0.05) in baseline DAS and gender was noted between the two clusters.

The association between baseline DAS and gender within the clusters is illustrated in <xref rid="pcbi.1010204.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>. The plot indicates a relatively higher baseline DAS and a higher proportion of females in the cluster positioned in the upper/positive PC3 quadrant.

The feature set available for building the ML classifier includes demographic and clinical data (<italic toggle="yes">viz</italic>. gender, age, disease duration, baseline DAS (BLDAS) and ΔDAS at 6 months) as well as 352 QC passed proteins’ normalised NPX values. Since gender and BLDAS were found to be statistically significant to response to anti-TNF therapy as per <xref rid="pcbi.1010204.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, these two features were also included in the signature formulation.</p>

The graph depicting mean AUC for training as well as test set for each stepwise addition of protein features up to 30 proteins is shown in <xref rid="pcbi.1010204.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3B</xref>. The threshold of 30 proteins as features was decided after noting the gradual dip in the AUC values for test set (<xref rid="pcbi.1010204.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3B</xref>). A set of 17 protein gave the maximum mean AUC of 0.86 on test sets, without decreasing the training set AUC. The ROC curves for 5-fold training sets and test sets are shown in <xref rid="pcbi.1010204.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3C and 3D</xref>, respectively. The corresponding best point threshold on ROC curve gave a mean sensitivity of 0.75 and mean specificity of 0.86 on the test sets. The overall mean accuracy was 0.81 on test set. Further, the mean Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC), popularly used and advocated to assess the quality of binary classification [<xref rid="pcbi.1010204.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>], was 0.60, implying a good prediction for each class, <italic toggle="yes">viz</italic>. responders and non-responders.

      <title>Enrichment analysis with Gene Ontology (GO) terms and KEGG pathways</title>
      <p>The 17 protein set, when tested for enrichment with Gene Ontology (GO) terms for Biological Process (BP) using STRING database, gave 72 significant (FDR &lt; 0.05) hits as shown in <xref rid="pcbi.1010204.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Table</xref>. These 72 GO BP terms along with its FDR, when summarised using REVIGO (<xref rid="pcbi.1010204.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Table</xref>), were mostly involved with inflammatory response or its regulation (<xref rid="pcbi.1010204.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Fig</xref>). The enrichment for GO terms for Molecular Function (MF) gave 8 significant (FDR &lt; 0.05) hits (<xref rid="pcbi.1010204.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4 Table</xref>), mostly corresponding to receptor binding. Furthermore, the enrichment for GO terms for Cellular Components (CC) gave 4 significant (FDR &lt; 0.05) hits (<xref rid="pcbi.1010204.s007" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5 Table</xref>), mostly suggesting extracellular region as the location of proteins. Finally, the enrichment analysis for the KEGG pathway gave 6 significant (FDR &lt; 0.05) hits as shown in <xref rid="pcbi.1010204.s008" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6 Table</xref>. These hits include, as expected, rheumatoid arthritis pathway. Further, it also included IL-17 signalling pathway as well as NF-kappa B signalling pathway, which are well known for their role in inflammatory response in case of rheumatoid arthritis [<xref rid="pcbi.1010204.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1010204.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>], suggesting their pathological role in response to biologic DMARDs as well. It was also interesting to see Measles appearing in these hits. It was recently found through pathway and network analyses of Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) that Measles truly contributes to rheumatoid arthritis [<xref rid="pcbi.1010204.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>].</p>

      <title>Network analysis</title>
      <p>STRING database reports scores for Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI). These scores range from 0 for no evidence of interaction to 1 implying evidence of strong interaction. These scores are computed using different parameters such as co-expression, annotated pathways, neighbourhood, text mining, etc. We obtained the combined PPI scores of all combination of our feature proteins. The PPI network thus obtained, was then uploaded in Cystoscope for visualizing the graph in circular layout (<xref rid="pcbi.1010204.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4C</xref>). The size of the cell corresponds to the degree i.e., number of connections with the other proteins. We note that the cytokine IL13 has the highest degree of connection in the network; connected to 10 other feature proteins (<xref rid="pcbi.1010204.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4C</xref>). This was closely followed by CXCL1 which was connected to 9 other feature proteins. Further, the edge thickness is proportional to the score from STRING database. <xref rid="pcbi.1010204.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4C</xref> shows thick edges connecting IL13, CXCL1, CCL8 (alias MCP-2) and MMP1, thus implying high interaction between them. Interestingly, all these proteins are present in the extracellular region (<xref rid="pcbi.1010204.s007" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5 Table</xref>) and except CCL8 all other proteins are involved in IL17 signalling pathway (<xref rid="pcbi.1010204.s008" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6 Table</xref>). Out of these four highly interactive proteins, only CXCL1 has positive effect size to response to treatment, whereas IL13, CCL8, and MMP1 have negative effect sizes (<xref rid="pcbi.1010204.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Thus, a high expression of CXCL1 and low expression of IL13, CCL8, and MMP1 will lead to a better response to anti-TNF treatment. Further, these four highly interacting proteins have smaller effect sizes compared to other proteins (<xref rid="pcbi.1010204.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A</xref>), suggesting they are correlated due to their high PPI scores. We confirmed that indeed MMP1, MCP-2 (alias CCL8) and CXCL1 are significantly and highly correlated (<xref rid="pcbi.1010204.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4D</xref>). The elastic net regression distributes the weightage among the three proteins due to redundancy, as these variables have similar variations. On the contrary, less correlated features, even if they have low FI, have high effect sizes, since they have independent variation and can contribute more to anti-TNF treatment response prediction.</p>

    <title>Discussion</title>
    <p>Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients show different pathologies in terms of functional or biological mechanism, treatment response, etc. and hence can be considered as a broad disease class containing different disease entity or sub-class. Therefore, there is a need to further stratify patients based on their distinct functional or pathobiological mechanism, more commonly called as endotypes [<xref rid="pcbi.1010204.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. A recent review article [<xref rid="pcbi.1010204.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>], investigates such pathobiological endotypes in early RA (n = 85). They validated 2 proteins, 52 SNPs and 72 gene expression biomarkers, that were predictive of changes in DAS28-CRP, identified from literature review. Out of the 72 transcript biomarkers, they independently replicated 8 biomarkers (SORBS3, AKAP9, CYP4F12, MUSTN, CX3CR1, SLC2A3, C21orf58 and TBC1D8). Further, the two protein candidates viz. sICAM1 and CXCL13 were also validated as predictor of anti-TNF response. They have also validated 2 SNPs (rs6028945 and rs73055646), that were significantly associated with anti-TNF response. Using 11 biomarkers, this integrative approach showed an anti-TNF response predictability with an AUC of 0.815.</p>
    <p>The current study uncovered two distinct endotypes based on the expression profile of 352 plasma proteins, which had significantly different gender proportions and baseline DAS (<xref rid="pcbi.1010204.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref> and <xref rid="pcbi.1010204.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Since these endotypes were not significantly different in terms of their anti-TNF treatment response (<xref rid="pcbi.1010204.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>), there is a possibility of the existence of two distinct RA disease endotypes, which may be important in other aspects of the disease management or other drug response.</p>
    <p>Gender is known to be significantly associated with plasma protein profile [<xref rid="pcbi.1010204.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. Further, DAS28 is also known to be correlated with the plasma proteins such as IL37 [<xref rid="pcbi.1010204.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>] and CXCL10 [<xref rid="pcbi.1010204.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. A significantly higher average ESR has been observed in females of age up to 75 years [<xref rid="pcbi.1010204.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. Considering the above literature, there is another possibility that the two endotypes uncovered in this study may be totally unrelated to RA. Hence, the clinicians may consider keeping a strict vigil on these endotypes, which may be helpful in better informed decision making.</p>
    <p>Anti-TNF therapy is also a part of treatment regimens followed in other inflammatory disorders like psoriatic arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), which includes Crohn’s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). Proteomic signature for response to anti-TNF treatment in these disorders have also been studied. About 57 out of 107 targeted proteins were found to be predictive to anti-TNF treatment response with AUC of 0.76 in psoriatic arthritis [<xref rid="pcbi.1010204.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. In another study [<xref rid="pcbi.1010204.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>], 25 potential anti-TNF treatment predictive biomarkers based on significant differential expression between good and poor response were suggested out of 119 investigated proteins in psoriatic arthritis (n = 12). They further went on to investigate 4 out of the 25 proteins as the anti-TNF treatment predictive biomarkers, however, none of these 25 differentially expressed proteins have any intersection with our feature proteins. Another study [<xref rid="pcbi.1010204.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>] tried to stratify patients (n = 56) for prognosis or predicting response to anti-TNF therapy in IBD by identifying candidate proteomics biomarkers involved in therapeutic pathways. They suggested overall expression of defensin-5α and eosinophil cationic protein was related to responders (n = 25) and high expression of cathepsin, IL-12, IL17A and TNF was related to non-response (n = 31). Unfortunately, performance of anti-TNF treatment response prediction was not reported. With AUC of 0.86 for a relatively bigger cohort (n = 89), our plasma protein signature for the prognosis of anti-TNF therapy responsiveness in RA patients is different and its prediction performance is more accurate than of those described in the studies discussed above.</p>
    <p>A robust machine learning based bioinformatics study requires a complete independent test set from the cross-validation set for the evaluation of the predictive model. Conventionally, single choice of independent test set is implemented, leading to possible biasness towards better performance of the predictive model. To mitigate this issue and being conscious of our limited sample size, we implemented a double or nested cross-validation based ML architecture (<xref rid="pcbi.1010204.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B</xref>), which not only ensures an independent test set from the cross-validation sets, but also removes the biasness from choosing the independent test set by averaging the performance for all possible choice of independent test sets.</p>
    <p>The feature importance (FI) for the proteins, obtained from the feature selection procedure, suggest the need for the feature to be included in the model. Further, the effect sizes or regression/beta coefficient, obtained from the model training, suggests the contribution of a particular feature protein has on the final score of the patient. However, FI and β-coefficient are not correlated (<xref rid="pcbi.1010204.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A</xref>). This is due to the fact that some of the proteins are interacting with each other (<xref rid="pcbi.1010204.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4C</xref>) and therefore are correlated (<xref rid="pcbi.1010204.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4D</xref>). All the feature proteins having a lower β-coefficients are mostly correlated with each other and therefore the Elastic-Net regression analysis distributes their weightage due to redundancy. Proteins that can classify patients into responders and non-responders to anti-TNF drugs were filtered down to seventeen (<xref rid="pcbi.1010204.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). The model presented is a simple linear combination of gender, BLDAS, and plasma protein expression values that has been implemented to develop a R-based tool ATRPred. Further, the model was 5-fold cross-validated and the mean performance was reported, which although modest, is the highest till date as per the literature review presented and the author’s knowledge.</p>
    <p>In current clinical practice, RA patients who may not respond to conventional DMARDs are routinely administered anti-TNF therapy, without enough prior knowledge of potential for efficacy. <xref rid="pcbi.1010204.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> indicates that gender and BLDAS have the highest discriminatory feature importance with respect to future response to anti-TNF therapy. These two features were also significantly different for treatment response to anti-TNF therapy (<xref rid="pcbi.1010204.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). It is common knowledge amongst clinicians that the response to biologics is greater when the ESR is higher. This knowledge is also advocated by NICE (National Institute for Health and Care Excellence) guidelines which recommends a cut-off of DAS28-ESR &gt;5.1. The patients had all fulfilled the criteria (DAS28 &gt;5.1) but at the time they started therapy their disease could have been going through a flare or a dip in disease activity. The former would clearly be expected to respond better, partly from the ‘regression to the mean’ trend. However, significance of female patients in general respond better to biologics than male patients has not been widely reported. Females are less likely to achieve remission with DAS28-ESR partly due to differences in the baseline ESR and the way the DAS28 is calculated [<xref rid="pcbi.1010204.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Further, it is known that RA is more commonly found in women than men [<xref rid="pcbi.1010204.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. In line with this, most of the patients observed by the clinicians in our BioRA cohort were also females (<xref rid="pcbi.1010204.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). We have taken these two demographic and clinical features, viz. gender and BLDAS, as confounders and included in our signature summarised in <xref rid="pcbi.1010204.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. As per the model performance (<xref rid="pcbi.1010204.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Table</xref>), we can note that the performance using just the gender and BLDAS has a test set 5-fold mean AUC of 0.57. A random model has an AUC 0.5, hence the clinical decision making using these two demographic and clinical features is only slightly better than random. However, inclusion of the 17 informative plasma proteins increased the test set 5-fold mean AUC to 0.86, resulting in about 51% increase in performance (<xref rid="pcbi.1010204.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Table</xref>). Thus, our plasma protein signature may prove to be an advancement in the current clinical decision making and treatment regime of anti-TNF therapy for RA patients.</p>
    <p>Different genome wide association studies clearly implicate the central role of the immune system in RA. To further investigate the pathways defining the patients’ responsiveness and to understand the biological processes underlying the 17 protein signature, we went on to carry out enrichment analysis and network analysis. Well known rheumatoid arthritis related pathways such as IL-17 and NF-kappa B signalling pathway were found to be significantly enriched in this protein signature. Further, the clustering of significant GO BP terms for the 17 featured protein set suggests that they mostly belong to either inflammatory response or its regulation (<xref rid="pcbi.1010204.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Fig</xref>). However, our study was limited to the set of proteins obtained from four pre-selected Olink Proteomics’ panels; so, there is a possibility of selection bias which would influence enrichment analysis. To get an unbiased pathway topology, we extracted a protein-protein interaction network that was built on pre-existing knowledge (<xref rid="pcbi.1010204.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4C</xref>). We identified four highly interacting proteins IL13, CXCL1, CCL8, and MMP1. IL13, CXCL1 and MMP1 are involved in IL-17 signalling pathway, and their signature in responders suggests a potential role of IL-17 signalling pathway in anti-TNF response. Out of these proteins, only CXCL1 has positive effect size i.e., its higher baseline expression is indicative of future anti-TNF response. Further, CXCL1 is known to contribute to inflammation and present at higher levels during inflammatory flare [<xref rid="pcbi.1010204.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. Thus, a high pre-treatment CXCL1 expression may act as a sentinel of future good response towards anti-TNF treatment.</p>
    <p>We have identified two clusters (<xref rid="pcbi.1010204.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref> and <xref rid="pcbi.1010204.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>) driven by plasma protein profile as a plausible endotypes. Unfortunately, they do not correspond to anti-TNF therapy responsiveness, but they are still significantly different in terms of disease activity and gender, and thus possibly play an important role in patient management. For example, since these endotypes are independent of future treatment response, they may indicate pre-biologic treatment pathology sub-groups, which can be investigated in future studies. Further, we have built a ML based classifier ATRPred to predict anti-TNF treatment response of RA patients at earlier timepoint using seventeen proteins feature set along with gender and BLDAS. Our model was rigorously cross-validated and performance on model-blind test sets have been presented. We have provided this tool in the form of a R-based package on an open-source GitHub repository at <ext-link xlink:href="https://github.com/ShuklaLab/ATRPred" ext-link-type="uri">https://github.com/ShuklaLab/ATRPred</ext-link>, which may aid clinicians in deciding about putting an RA patient under anti-TNF therapy. This will help in saving the treatment cost as well as preventing nonresponsive patients to go through refractory condition of the disease leading to poor quality of life.</p>

    <p>ATRPred tool is built in R and provided as an open-source GitHub repository at <ext-link xlink:href="https://github.com/ShuklaLab/ATRPred" ext-link-type="uri">https://github.com/ShuklaLab/ATRPred</ext-link>. A README file has been provided with the instructions for how to install the package and run the tool. All the R scripts and raw data used in the analysis and development of ATRPred have been included in the scripts and raw data folders present within the package. An input file template along with sample input files of a responder as well as a non-responder are also included in the examples folder present within the package. The R function <italic toggle="yes">antiTNFresponse()</italic> reads the input and normalises the same with the internal 89 patient data to get comparable numbers for feature set and finally scores the patient for response to the anti-TNF therapy. It then calculates the patient’s probability to respond anti-TNF treatment and predicts if the patient will be a responder or non-responder. ATRPred may aid clinicians to optimise treatment selection, reduce spend on biologics in unresponsive patients and overall improve quality of life for non-responsive RA patients.</p>

    <p>Dear Dr. Shukla,</p>
    <p>Thank you very much for submitting your manuscript "ATRPred: a machine learning based tool for clinical decision making of anti-TNF treatment in rheumatoid arthritis patients" for consideration at PLOS Computational Biology.</p>
    <p>As with all papers reviewed by the journal, your manuscript was reviewed by members of the editorial board and by several independent reviewers. In light of the reviews (below this email), we would like to invite the resubmission of a significantly-revised version that takes into account the reviewers' comments.</p>
    <p>We cannot make any decision about publication until we have seen the revised manuscript and your response to the reviewers' comments. Your revised manuscript is also likely to be sent to reviewers for further evaluation.</p>
    <p>When you are ready to resubmit, please upload the following:</p>
    <p>[1] A letter containing a detailed list of your responses to the review comments and a description of the changes you have made in the manuscript. Please note while forming your response, if your article is accepted, you may have the opportunity to make the peer review history publicly available. The record will include editor decision letters (with reviews) and your responses to reviewer comments. If eligible, we will contact you to opt in or out.</p>
    <p>[2] Two versions of the revised manuscript: one with either highlights or tracked changes denoting where the text has been changed; the other a clean version (uploaded as the manuscript file).</p>
    <p>Important additional instructions are given below your reviewer comments.</p>
    <p>Please prepare and submit your revised manuscript within 60 days. If you anticipate any delay, please let us know the expected resubmission date by replying to this email. Please note that revised manuscripts received after the 60-day due date may require evaluation and peer review similar to newly submitted manuscripts.</p>
    <p>Thank you again for your submission. We hope that our editorial process has been constructive so far, and we welcome your feedback at any time. Please don't hesitate to contact us if you have any questions or comments.</p>
    <p>Sincerely,</p>

    <p>Reviewer's Responses to Questions</p>
    <p>
      <bold>Comments to the Authors:</bold>
    </p>
    <p>
      <bold>Please note here if the review is uploaded as an attachment.</bold>
    </p>
    <p>Reviewer #1: This is a nicely written prediction study, where a machine learning model used clinical and proteomics data to predict response to TNF blockers after 6 months in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. 89 patients were included. Features included demographic and clinical data and over 300 proteins that have been obtained from 60 responders and 29 non-responders. The form of the manuscript including the figures is clear.</p>
    <p>There are some minor limitations that need to be discussed. Whilst the proteomics part is described in detail, the manuscript only provides minimal clinical information. BLDAS and gender are the most important features in the machine learning model. Why is gender so important? How about other features such as rheumatoid factor and or anti-CCP? Methotrexate is not mentioned once in the text, despite this clearly improves the response rate of TNF blockers. Was this the same in responders and non-responders? Methotrexate might also influence the protein composition in the serum. A section on limitations in the discussion (relaitvely low patient number, moderate accuracy ect.) would be appropriate.</p>
    <p>Reviewer #2: In the present manuscript, Prasad B et al, use plasma proteomics data from a cohort of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients starting anti-TNF therapy. The objective pursued here is of high translational value, since there is yet no tool with which to discriminate responders from non-responder patients to this therapy. However there are several concerning aspects from the actual depth and reproducibility of the study.</p>
    <p>- Proteomic data: One key concerning aspect is the low number of plasma samples with good proteomic data (89 from 144, 64%). The used platform, OLINK, is a robust proteomic technology and normally yields good protein quantifications. Unless the samples were extremely degraded, usable proteomic data should be obtained from a majority of the patients. Without any convincing explanation on the reason for this issue, it really questions the validity of the remaining proteomic sample data.</p>
    <p>- Response criteria: two criteria (BSR and NICE) were used to define response. Why two methods? EULAR or ACR response criteria is a more common methods for disease response classification; what was the reason not to use these.</p>
    <p>- Methodology: The authors describe in detail the bioinformatic packages used and have developed an accompanying R package to apply the methodology, which is useful. However, using the mentioned Github repository, there is substantial missing information describing how to apply the R package. Also, why didn’t the authors include the proteomic (and phenotype) data from the study to evaluate the method’s performance?</p>
    <p>- Predictor: Internal cross-validation (CV) is used to develop the predictor model. This is a useful approach to estimate the generalizability of the predictor. However, the way that this has been used is highly questionable. Feature selection is done with the entire cohort of patients before CV. This includes a major bias in the procedure since it will increase the overfitting to the current dataset, despite using a cross-validation schema afterwards. Also, it is not clear how the authors balanced the unequal representation of non-responders, which is another potential bias in predictor building.</p>
    <p>- The identification of a putative 2 class division of patients is rather arbitrary. First, the separation is done visually, with no assessment of the randomness of this separation. Second, the separating variable, PC3 is not described: how much variance is captured. Third, the fact that is associated to confounders, age and baseline DAS28, clearly does not provide much interest to the finding with regards to the objective at hand.</p>
    <p>- No real test set is used to demonstrate the performance of the method. An application to an independent cohort of patients would really help on the credibility of the proposed patient stratification tool.</p>
    <p>Reviewer #3: The paper by Prasad et al address an important unmet need for better patient stratification in the clinical management of arthritis. The treatments for arthritis are expensive, not universally effective and are currently administered on a trial and error basis meaning control of symptoms is sub-optimal for many patients. The study uses circulating proteins to predict response to TNFi after six months of care and identified a number of proteins that may be useful in stratification.</p>
    <p>I have some general and specific comments.</p>
    <p>General</p>
    <p>It is my understanding that the raw data and the analysis methods (e.g. scripts) should be made available in an appropriate online repository. The authors state that this is achieved via a GitHub page but it is not clear to me that the raw data and analysis scripts used to perfume the analysis as presented are available in this location. If I understand correctly, this is a prerequisite for publication in PLOS Computational Biology and should be addressed.</p>
    <p>The paper could be condensed in several sections to. For example, the introduction could be shortened and as well as the discussion (particularly between lines 91 to 104 and 455 to 472).</p>
    <p>In the abstract the authors state “We then labelled these patients as responders (n=60) and non-responders (n=29) based on the baseline disease activity score (BLDAS).” This seems a bit misleading as EULAR criteria applied at 6-months was used?</p>
    <p>Specific</p>
    <p>The authors state that of 144 samples sent to Olink 1/3 (n=55) failed QC – Can the authors explain why this failure rate was so high?</p>
    <p>The biological Importance of PCA based grouping of patients is very unclear and adds little to the paper. Could the author possibly add more detail here e.g. identify which proteins account for the perceived separation?</p>
    <p>Could the author give more information on the TNFi therapy - was a specific TNFi used or were all TNFi permitted? Did the TNFi type differ between the responder groups? Were the patients exposed to TNFi for the first time? This information should be added to the table of patient characteristics.</p>
    <p>My main concern is the limited sample size and the lack of true independent validation. The entire cohort included only 29 non-responders. Once you get down to the inner folds of the nested CV these numbers are starting to get extremely small. Although the authors took care to design the experiment to minimise bias due to only having a single dataset, I’m still concerned that all samples were touched by the statistical approach and no truly independent samples were available for validation. A completely separate validation sample would strengthen the paper considerably.</p>
    <p>Due to the imbalanced nature of the outcome, did the authors consider oversampling the non-responders and if not why was this decided not to be important?</p>
    <p>Table 1 and Figure 1. It looks like there are some quite low baseline DAS scores if I read correctly? However, I think this cannot be the case as a DAS score &gt;5.1 at pre-treatment is an inclusion criteria?</p>
    <p>ML methods are repeated in the results section. Please consolidate in the methods and remove from results.</p>

    <p>The <ext-link xlink:href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/s/materials-and-software-sharing" ext-link-type="uri">PLOS Data policy</ext-link> requires authors to make all data and code underlying the findings described in their manuscript fully available without restriction, with rare exception (please refer to the Data Availability Statement in the manuscript PDF file). The data and code should be provided as part of the manuscript or its supporting information, or deposited to a public repository. For example, in addition to summary statistics, the data points behind means, medians and variance measures should be available. If there are restrictions on publicly sharing data or code —e.g. participant privacy or use of data from a third party—those must be specified.</p>
    <p>Reviewer #1: Yes</p>
    <p>Reviewer #2: <bold>No: </bold>The dataset used in this study is not available. Only demo data is avaiable on the associated Github repository.</p>
    <p>Reviewer #3: <bold>No: </bold>The authors say the code/data is available on GitHub. If this is the case it is not obvious to me where it is and I actually think it isn't there. This should be confirmed with the authors.</p>
