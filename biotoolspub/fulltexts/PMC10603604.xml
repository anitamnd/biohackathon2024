      <p>The process of peak picking and quality assessment for
multiple
reaction monitoring (MRM) data demands significant human effort, especially
for signals with low abundance and high interference. Although multiple
peak-picking software packages are available, they often fail to detect
peaks with low quality and do not report cases with low confidence.
Furthermore, visual examination of all chromatograms is still necessary
to identify uncertain or erroneous cases. This study introduces HeapMS,
a web service that uses artificial intelligence to assist with peak
picking and the quality assessment of MRM chromatograms. HeapMS applies
a rule-based filter to remove chromatograms with low interference
and high-confidence peak boundaries detected by Skyline. Additionally,
it transforms two histograms (representing light and heavy peptides)
into a single encoded heatmap and performs a two-step evaluation (quality
detection and peak picking) using image convolutional neural networks.
HeapMS offers three categories of peak picking: uncertain peak picking
that requires manual inspection, deletion peak picking that requires
removal or manual re-examination, and automatic peak picking. HeapMS
acquires the chromatogram and peak-picking boundaries directly from
Skyline output. The output results are imported back into Skyline
for further manual inspection, facilitating integration with Skyline.
HeapMS offers the benefit of detecting chromatograms that should be
deleted or require human inspection. Based on defined categories,
it can significantly reduce human workload and provide consistent
results. Furthermore, by using heatmaps instead of histograms, HeapMS
can adapt to future updates in image recognition models. The HeapMS
is available at: <uri xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://github.com/ccllabe/HeapMS">https://github.com/ccllabe/HeapMS</uri>.</p>

    <title>Introduction</title>
    <p>Targeted proteomic approaches have been
widely applied in biomolecular
studies of proteins and metabolites. The liquid chromatography-multiple
reaction monitoring-mass spectrometry (LC-MRM-MS) assay is a multiplexed
and targeted quantification approach and has been demonstrated as
a robust technology platform for disease biomarker discovery and verification.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>−<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref></sup> The MRM assay is capable of precisely quantifying multiple candidates
of interest in a single analysis by employing the corresponding stable
isotope-labeled standard (SIS) peptides with known amounts as the
internal standards. Recently, the MRM assay has enabled sensitive,
reproducible, and specific quantification of 100 or more peptide features
in complex biological matrices.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref></sup> Due to
the multiple quantification results obtained from the MRM assay, data
analysis of hundreds of samples is a time- and labor-consuming process.</p>
    <p>Analysis of multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) data typically involves
two major steps: peak picking and quality assessment. Because chromatographic
peaks exhibit a variety of patterns, data processing and examination
heavily rely on human experience. Generally, MRM analysis requires
weeks or even months of data processing and manual evaluation, especially
for peak quality inspection, selected peak correction, and sample
comparison. Therefore, the identification of methods to improve the
fluency, effectiveness, and accuracy of this process is critical.
Several mass spectrometry (MS) data algorithms and tools focus on
the quality assessment of ion transitions and peak boundary picking.
MRM analysis software such as Skyline<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref></sup> provides
peak-picking capabilities through software prediction or manual operation
functionalities. Skyline is a powerful software for the visualization
of chromatograms obtained from the MRM assay that facilitates human
inspection. Human inspection remains the primary step in the workflow
for peak quality assessment and boundary picking.</p>
    <p>Several mass
spectrometry (MS) data algorithms and tools focus
on the quality assessment of peak boundary picking. Two types of strategies
are typically adopted: scores and prediction models. Featuring scores
is used to build the criteria for manual examinations, whereas prediction
models are developed from predefined rules, machine learning methods,
and deep learning techniques. <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="other">Table <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="other">1</xref></xref> summarizes the types of supporting MS instruments,
targets, user interfaces, and prediction abilities. TargetedMSQC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref></sup> uses different peak features against data from
targeted MS to calculate the metrics and filter out the peak qualities.
These features include full width at half-maximum, peak jaggedness,
and symmetry. PeakOnly<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref></sup> is a convolutional
neural network (CNN) based on machine learning for the detection of
regions of interest (ROIs) and peak area integration to classify ROIs
into three categories. NeatMS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref></sup> is an application
of CNNs that describes model and train selection peaks by using tools
such as XCMS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref></sup> and MZmine 2.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref></sup> It also filters peak qualities to reduce the
number of false peaks. AutomRm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref></sup> uses machine
learning to train two models, namely, a peak-picking model and a peak-reporting
model, to execute MS data peak preprocessing. Currently, software
provides users with prediction results directly, but for certain parts
where predictions are not accurate, the software does not report them
to the user. This leads to users having to verify the prediction results
one by one. Additionally, the differences in MRM technology, such
as quantifier and qualifier purposes, lead to diverse output contents.
Although it is the same technology, the data structure is different
due to differences in experimental design and parameter settings.
This complicates the process of comparing different tools for different
purposes.</p>

    <p>Technicians tend to examine ion transition graphs
one by one by
using visualization tools, resulting in time-consuming MRM data processing.
In this study, we developed HeapMS, a user-friendly web service that
serves as an MRM chromatogram quality assessment and automatic peak-picking
pipeline. The primary goal of HeapMS is to reduce the duration of
manual postprocessing and to work alongside current MRM data processing
software. HeapMS reports uncertain chromatograms that require a manual
examination. It also provides accurate peak boundary prediction capabilities
for technicians to focus on reexamining chromatograms that are marked
as uncertain and those marked as deleted. Three types of HeapMS outputs,
namely, peak boundaries, uncertain chromatograms, and marks for deletion,
are imported into Skyline for manual examination and verification.
This not only shortens the duration of manual comparison and inspection
for peak selection but also increases the efficiency of the entire
process. We also developed an accuracy of quantification (AQ) score
as a standard peak-picking benchmark based on a comparison of manual
picking results for different tools and technicians. By exporting
the software automatic picking results and importing the prediction
results of HeapMS, the HeapMS can be integrated into the current MRM
workflow.</p>

      <title>Sample Collection and Preparation</title>
      <p>The biofluid samples
(first morning-urine and unstimulated whole saliva) were collected
from our unpublished chronic kidney disease (CKD) data and oral squamous
cell carcinoma (OSCC) patients and prepared as described in our previous
studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref></sup> Briefly, the collected samples were centrifuged
to remove cells and debris, and the clarified supernatants were stored
at −80 °C. For urine sample, urinary proteins were further
concentrated using a 10 kDa centrifugal filter. Based on the protein
concentration measured by the BCA Protein Assay kit, triplicate aliquots
of each sample containing 30 μg proteins were diluted with an
appropriate amount of 25 mM ammonium bicarbonate, denatured with 10%
sodium deoxycholate (DOC), reduced with 50 mM Tris (2-carboxyethyl)
phosphine (TCEP) at 60 °C for 30 min, alkylated with 100 mM iodoacetamide
at 37 °C for 30 min, and acidified with 10% formic acid (FA)
and 10% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) to precipitate DOC. The resulting
samples were mixed with stable isotope-labeled standard (SIS) peptides
and subsequently subjected to trypsin-mediated digestion.</p>

      <title>LC-MRM-MS Analysis and Data Acquisition</title>
      <p>A nano-ACQUITY
UPLC system equipped with a C18 column (100 μm × 100 mm,
1.7 μm particle size; Waters) was coupled with a triple quadrupole
mass spectrometer (QTRAP 5500; AB Sciex, Redwood, CA). Four-microliter
samples containing 1 μg of peptides were injected into the LC-MRM-MS
system, and a 42 min linear gradient of buffer A (0.1% FA in H<sub>2</sub>O) combined with buffer B (0.1% FA in acetonitrile) was applied
as described in our previous studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref></sup> The acquisition
parameters (CE, DP, EP, CEP, CXP) for each target peptide and the
instrument settings were experimentally determined in order to obtain
sensitive detection of peptide targets in biological samples. Raw
files (.wiff) of MRM analysis were processed using Skyline software
based on the defined precursor (Q1) and fragment (Q3) mass list of
the target peptides. All spectra were manually checked to ensure confident
quantitative results with adjustments or deletions as needed.</p>

      <title>Data Sets for Deep Learning</title>
      <p>Four data sets were used
to establish the data processing and prediction pipeline: one from
the urine samples of CKD patients and three from the saliva samples
of OSCC patients. All samples underwent triplicate measurements of
LC-MRM-MS for technical replicates. The four data sets differ in the
number of monitored peptides: data set CKD comprises 20 peptides,
data set OSCC-1 comprises 53 peptides, data set OSCC-2 comprises 28
peptides, and data set OSCC-3 comprises 45 peptides. Each chromatogram
consists of the light ion (target peptide) and the heavy ion (SIS
peptide), and the identities of the peptides are represented by three
unique transitions (paired Q1/Q3). Output files of Skyline software
in text format, including chromatograms and peak boundaries, were
utilized for subsequent processes.</p>

      <title>AQ Score: An Objective Score for Evaluating Peak-Picking Results</title>
      <p>Generally, time boundaries for peak picking cannot be fully correlated
to quantification results. Moreover, chromatograms labeled with the
same time boundaries may have varying intensities, resulting in different
quantification results. In this study, we developed a relative score,
called the AQ score, to evaluate the prediction results accurately
by comparing the area ratio of the predicted results with that of
human-evaluated results for the same chromatogram. The AQ score primarily
evaluates the area ratio of selected peak boundaries, which can be
utilized to calculate the quantification results by cross-referencing
with an internal standard. The AQ score provides a more precise evaluation
than simply measuring the time boundaries for peak picking. <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.analchem.3c01011/suppl_file/ac3c01011_si_001.pdf">Figure S1</ext-link> illustrates how the AQ score is calculated

      <title>Identifying Low-Interference Chromatograms</title>
      <p>The MRM
analytical software provides precise peak boundaries for low-interference
chromatograms observed in the data set. Low-interference chromatograms
have high signal-to-noise ratios and exhibit comparable patterns and
peak time boundaries for three ion transitions. In this study, we
utilized a Savitzky–Golay filter<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref></sup> to obtain smoothed chromatograms. We identified low-interference
chromatograms on the basis of the following rules: (1) the root-mean-square
error of ion transitions should be less than 0.25, (2) each chromatogram
must have only one high peak defined by intensities higher than 20%
of the highest intensity of the three ion transitions, and (3) the
retention bias of the six highest intensities of both heavy and light
ions should be less than 0.3 times the retention time period.<disp-formula id="ueq4"><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="ac3c01011_m004" position="anchor"/></disp-formula></p>
      <p>We used strict rules to identify low-interference
chromatograms to ensure highly accurate software prediction results.
After filtering low-interference chromatograms, we used two artificial
intelligence (AI) models to perform a quality assessment and automatic
peak picking using the following transformations.</p>

    <sec id="sec2.6">
      <title>Converting MRM Spectra into AI Predictable Chromatographic Heatmaps</title>
      <p>We used a spectrum-to-image generator to convert the spectra of
both heavy- and light-ion intensities, coupled with retention time,
into a two-dimensional (2D) heatmap designed for AI recognition and
object detection. <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref></xref> illustrates the concept of this conversion. The intensities
of three ions were converted into relative intensities, summed into
a single value, and mapped to a color bar called “nipy_spectral”
using the matplotlib package in Python. We also tested grayscale and
two other color settings, named Gist_gray, Gnuplot, and Spring, respectively.
The results are shown in <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.analchem.3c01011/suppl_file/ac3c01011_si_001.pdf">Figure S2</ext-link>. This
heatmap conversion strategy maintains information such as the input
spectra, including the relative intensities of both heavy and light
ions and the pattern of the quantified ions. In addition, it conserves
the patterns of correct peak boundaries and high-quality chromatograms,
making the chromatographic heatmaps suitable for AI prediction.</p>

      <title>Implementation of HeapMS</title>
      <p>On the web interface of HeapMS,
we use PHP, JavaScript, and HTML for development. Users simply need
to convert and select files using Skyline before uploading them to
HeapMS for processing. We used the docker environment and Python language
to implement a backend pipeline with a Queuing system to handle all
user requests. The HeapMS platform is composed of multiple independent
computing nodes connected, and any computer capable of running the
HeapMS container can serve as a computing node. Once the user’s
files are uploaded, the system executes the tasks sequentially based
on the upload time. Each time, only one task is executed individually.
When the computation starts, a log file is generated to record the
execution time for each step. If another task triggered by another
user is submitted, then it will wait until the previous task is completed
before proceeding. The source code and a step-by-step installation
guide are available on GitHub: <uri xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://github.com/ccllabe/HeapMS">https://github.com/ccllabe/HeapMS</uri>.</p>

      <title>Deep Learning Architectures</title>
      <p>To build the prediction
modules for HeapMS, we utilized two convolutional neural network architectures:
CoAtNet-4<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref></sup> as a quality control (QC) checker
and Faster R-CNN<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref></sup> as a boundary picker.
CoAtNets combines convolution and self-attention to achieve outstanding
performance on various data sets, while Faster R-CNN uses region proposals
to detect objects in images by identifying bounding boxes. Both CoAtNet-416
and Faster R-CNN are compatible with GPU acceleration. We trained
the deep learning models from chromatographic heatmaps and implemented
the training and prediction components of HeapMS using Python.</p>

      <p>We used precision,
recall, and F1 score to evaluate the performance of the QC checker
by comparing the predicted results to the manually evaluated results.
A true positive (TP) is defined as a chromatogram that is predicted
to be positive and is also labeled as positive in manual evaluation.
A true negative (TN) is defined as a chromatogram that is predicted
to be negative and is also labeled as negative in the manual evaluation.
A false positive (FP) is defined as a chromatogram that is predicted
to be positive but is actually negative, according to the manual evaluation.
A false negative (FN) is defined as a chromatogram that is predicted
to be negative but is actually positive, according to the manual evaluation.<disp-formula id="ueq5"><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="ac3c01011_m005" position="anchor"/></disp-formula><disp-formula id="ueq6"><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="ac3c01011_m006" position="anchor"/></disp-formula></p>

      <title>Workflow of HeapMS</title>
      <p>HeapMS is a front-end web interface
and backend data processing pipeline. <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>a depicts the data processing pipeline. Users
are advised to use Skyline to perform automatic software picking and
export the data into time boundary comma-separated value (CSV) and
ion transition tab-separated value (TSV) files. An interference detector
is then used to identify low-interference chromatograms, which are
subsequently applied to the picking results of Skyline. The QC checker
uses a pretrained CoAtNet model to divide the remaining data into
QC-failed and QC-passed groups. The QC-failed chromatograms are either
deleted or manually reexamined. The boundary picker then uses a pretrained
Faster R-CNN model to perform automatic time boundary picking. Users
are required to upload only their automatic picking and ion transition
files exported from Skyline. The queuing system then automatically
performs heatmap conversion, QC checks, and boundary picking. Users
then download the picked time boundary files in CSV format and intensities
in TSV format and import them into Skyline to perform manual inspection. <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>b depicts the user
interface of HeapMS. Users can select computing nodes with fewer queuing
jobs and can upload their manually picked data. HeapMS compares the

      <title>Interplay between Traditional Workflows</title>
      <p>In traditional
workflows, analytical software and human technicians collaborate.
The first step involves identifying and visualizing peak boundaries
using software such as Skyline. Technicians manually examined all
chromatograms according to the spectrum of transitional ions. Chromatograms
with low intensities, low signal-to-noise ratios, and no coelution
properties are eliminated (marked as “Deletion” in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref></xref>a). Technicians use
their experience to accept the time boundary detected by analytic
software (marked as “Computation” in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>a) and to manually adjust the
time boundaries (marked as “Manually picked” in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref></xref>a). <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref></xref>a summarizes the standard workflow
results for four data sets. In practical cases, all software-predicted
boundaries must be manually validated, which is the most time-consuming
step. The decision and adjustment to delete or repick the boundaries
might generally take 30 s per chromatogram, while review of the acceptable
boundaries would take 5 s. The labor working-hours were 53.3, 23.9,
125.8, and 414.0 h for CDK, OSCC-1, OSCC-2, and OSCC-3 data sets,
respectively (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref></xref>a).</p>

      <title>Advantage of the AQ Score</title>
      <p>The AQ score can help identify
which chromatograms truly need to be repicked by evaluating the similarity
between manually and software-predicted results. <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref></xref>b summarizes the AQ scores
of chromatograms picked automatically from four data sets (purple
areas in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref></xref>a).
The acceptable time boundary is represented by two dashed lines in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref></xref>b, which are 0.2
units above and below the baseline. As shown in the figure, compared
to manually adjusted results, after evaluating the AQ scores before
adjustment, we found that most chromatograms considered in need of
adjustment by humans did not actually require adjustment, as the predicted
results from Skyline were acceptable. Around 7–23% of the chromatograms
did require manual adjustment. In the proteomic MRM analysis, software-based
boundary predictions are still judged manually due to the lack of
assistant tools. Nonetheless, as depicted in the figure, manual judgments
tend to be too strict, resulting in the inclusion of many acceptable
predicted results in the category requiring manual adjustment, which
undoubtedly increases labor costs. Manual re-examination makes the
analytical workflow for MRM data time-consuming.</p>

      <title>Need for AI-Assisted Peak Picking</title>
      <p>As a significant
portion of the data required manual examination and repicking, we
conducted an experiment to determine the variation in examination
outcomes among the individual technicians. We randomly selected 20
peptides, each containing 130 chromatograms, to investigate the deviation
in manual operations. Three well-trained technicians independently
examined the data, either accepting the software predictions or performing
manual repicking. We then combined the coefficient of variation of
peak-picking time (time CV) and the area ratio of light- and heavy-ion
transitions (area CV) on a 2D plot. The results showed similar area
CVs, indicating that the quantification of human-validated data was
consistent. However, the time CVs were more diverse than the area
CVs, indicating that transitions near peak boundaries had low intensities
and were challenging to manually define. Based on <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref></xref>, relying solely on peak-picking
time boundaries to evaluate peak-picking results may be insufficient.
However, the quantification result, represented by the ratio of peak
areas between the picked light- and heavy-ion boundaries, may provide
a reasonable measure of adjustment. <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref></xref>b,<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>c demonstrates

resulting in varied peak-picking times, the area ratios of the selected
regions were similar.</p>

Of the four data sets, CoAtNet-4

we performed peak time boundary identification. Generally, HeapMS
uses Faster R-CNN to detect peak boundaries on heatmaps generated
from light- and heavy-ion transitions. Therefore, we cropped all manually
picked time boundaries, which are represented as a square area in
the chromatographic heatmap, as a training data set to build an object

      <p>The QC checker of HeapMS distinguishes between
QC-passed and QC-failed
chromatograms by identifying heatmap patterns. Discernible variations
can be observed in the color-pixel permutations, with QC-passed cases
exhibiting greater symmetry than QC-failed cases. <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="other">Table <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="other">3</xref></xref> lists the prediction results
of the four data sets. To eliminate the artifacts across samples,
we performed experiments employing a 5-fold cross-validation methodology.
In this approach, we randomly divided our data sets of 72,220 chromatograms
into a test set comprising 20% (14,444 chromatograms) and a training
set consisting of 80% (57,776 chromatograms). This was repeated five
times, and the mean and standard deviation were obtained. The F1 score
of the four data sets was approximately 0.8, with OSCC-3 exhibiting
a high false deletion rate. Compared with the data shown in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref></xref>, the results of
HeapMS and Skyline contained a higher proportion of deleted chromatograms.
The workflow allowed users to manually examine the predicted QC-failed
chromatograms, including true and false deletion. Compared to traditional
workflows, integrating HeapMS can reduce the work time by approximately
5–10 times. For experiments that allow for the possibility
of chromatogram deletion, manual inspection of those marked as “Uncertain”
is sufficient, resulting in a 10× increase in efficiency compared
to traditional workflows. Additionally, the team can manually review
chromatograms marked as “deletion” based on their workload
and available resources.</p>

      <title>Performance and Time Cost of HeapMS</title>
      <p>To objectively
evaluate the overall performance of HeapMS, we developed two models:
Model 1 and Model 2. We developed Model 1 from OSCC-3 and used it
to predict CKD, OSCC-1, and OSCC-2. Because the number of chromatograms
used for training in Model 1 was lower than that in OSCC-3, we developed
Model 2 by combining CKD, OSCC-1, and OSCC-2 and used this model to
predict OSCC-3. <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref></xref> summarizes all of the results, including the calculation time, number
of chromatograms, and predicted categories, and compares them with
the results of manual peak picking. <xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="other">Table <xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="other">4</xref></xref> lists the definitions of six categories
compared to manual inspection.</p>

      </table-wrap>
      <p>Because Skyline can pick peaks from
any input chromatogram, only
three categories are labeled in its output results. Although the overall
accuracy of human technicians is lower than that of Skyline, human
technicians can focus only on the “Uncertain” category,
which represents only approximately 2% of all input chromatograms.
For laboratories that require automatically acquired MRM data, a false
deletion rate of approximately 5–15% is observed. However,
for laboratories that prefer the collection of a large amount of data,
technicians can manually inspect all of the chromatograms labeled
in the “Deletion” category. HeapMS guarantees an error
rate of less than 2% and substantially reduces the human inspection
workload. The comparisons of AQ scores from HeapMS and Skyline are
shown in <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.analchem.3c01011/suppl_file/ac3c01011_si_001.pdf">Figure S5</ext-link>. We present the experimental
result of choosing an appropriate threshold of the object detection
model in <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.analchem.3c01011/suppl_file/ac3c01011_si_001.pdf">Figure S6</ext-link>. HeapMS shows a higher
number of chromatograms with an acceptable AQ score range. Moreover,
Skyline predicts pick boundaries in all chromatograms without quality
filtering; technicians must manually examine all chromatograms.</p>
      <p>We plotted the proportion of deleted chromatograms that were marked
by the QC checker for each target peptide because the proportion of
true deletions is much higher in OSCC samples than in CKD samples.
As shown in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref></xref>, each purple cell in the third row represents a single target peptide,
sorted in a descending order by the number of marked deletions. Almost
all chromatograms of the first 10 peptides of OSCC-1 were marked as
deleted. In the CKD samples, the cells marked as deleted are relatively
lower compared to other data sets. In comparison to human results,
the proportions of true and false deletions are lower than the other
three data sets. The proportions of true and false deletions are high,
as well. Therefore, technicians can use the HeapMS QC checker as a
quality estimator for target peptides and delete those whose chromatograms
are mostly marked as deleted.</p>

    <sec id="sec3.8">
      <title>Universal AI Model for Predicting Various Sample Types</title>
      <p>Generally, the low-interference detector and AI models of HeapMS
can be used on different sample types. In our test, we used the model
developed by OSCC-3, a saliva sample, to perform peak picking on saliva
samples from patients with oral cancer. This is because manual inspection
uses the same criteria, and technicians use relative intensities to
evaluate the quality of transitions from three heavy and light pairs.
For example, the signal-to-noise ratio, the pattern of each ion, and
a coalition of targeting ions are generally used to adjust the peak-picking
results in manual inspections. These features are conserved in different
tissues and samples, and they can be preserved by our chromatographic
heatmap conservation. Based on the previous cross-tissue exchange
experiments, HeapMS demonstrates robust transferability of pretrained
AI models across various types of samples. The use of HeapMS in MRM
workflows can dramatically reduce the time cost from months to only
a few days. In addition, the output data can be reimported into Skyline
or another MRM analytic tool for further examination. Thus, HeapMS
can seamlessly integrate into existing MRM workflows without requiring
any deliberate adjustments or modifications to incorporate the AI
prediction tool.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec3.9">
      <title>Limitation of HeapMS and Future Work</title>
      <p>The present study
focuses on developing HeapMS, a tool specifically designed for analyzing
the precise quantification of multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) data.
By integration of heavy and light peptides, HeapMS enables more precise
data analysis from an experimental perspective. The current version
of HeapMS allows for only three transitions per chromatogram. If more
than three transitions are uploaded, the pipeline will select the
first three to generate the heatmap. Additionally, because our neural
network can be used for the two-dimensional images, only target peptides
paired as light and heavy transitions can be processed by HeapMS.
HeapMS has the potential to handle more than three ion transitions.
It accomplishes this by converting intensities into relative percentages,
summing them, and representing the total as color blocks on a heatmap.
In the future, we will fine-tune the 2D heatmap transformation specifically
for chromatograms with multiple transitions, aiming to enhance the
applicability of HeapMS. It demonstrates its potential in processing
parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) data, which includes multiple transitions
within a single chromatogram.</p>

    <title>Conclusions</title>
    <p>MRM peak picking and quality assessment
heavily rely on the experience
of technicians. In some cases, technicians obtained varying picking
results. In other cases, manual adjustments are highly similar to
the original software predictions. Although automatic peak-picking
tools, such as Skyline, provide reliable peak results, the output
data often contain hidden errors or uncertainties. Therefore, to ensure
high data quality, manual inspection is required to examine the data,
which is a highly time-consuming process. HeapMS combines rule-based
and machine learning approaches to provide flexible and accurate MRM
peak picking. The input and output file formats are the same as those
provided by the current software. Thus, HeapMS can be easily integrated
into existing MRM workflows.</p>

      <p>The process of peak picking and quality assessment for
multiple
reaction monitoring (MRM) data demands significant human effort, especially
for signals with low abundance and high interference. Although multiple
peak-picking software packages are available, they often fail to detect
peaks with low quality and do not report cases with low confidence.
Furthermore, visual examination of all chromatograms is still necessary
to identify uncertain or erroneous cases. This study introduces HeapMS,
a web service that uses artificial intelligence to assist with peak
picking and the quality assessment of MRM chromatograms. HeapMS applies
a rule-based filter to remove chromatograms with low interference
and high-confidence peak boundaries detected by Skyline. Additionally,
it transforms two histograms (representing light and heavy peptides)
into a single encoded heatmap and performs a two-step evaluation (quality
detection and peak picking) using image convolutional neural networks.
HeapMS offers three categories of peak picking: uncertain peak picking
that requires manual inspection, deletion peak picking that requires
removal or manual re-examination, and automatic peak picking. HeapMS
acquires the chromatogram and peak-picking boundaries directly from
Skyline output. The output results are imported back into Skyline
for further manual inspection, facilitating integration with Skyline.
HeapMS offers the benefit of detecting chromatograms that should be
deleted or require human inspection. Based on defined categories,
it can significantly reduce human workload and provide consistent
results. Furthermore, by using heatmaps instead of histograms, HeapMS
can adapt to future updates in image recognition models. The HeapMS
is available at: <uri xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://github.com/ccllabe/HeapMS">https://github.com/ccllabe/HeapMS</uri>.</p>

    <title>Introduction</title>
    <p>Targeted proteomic approaches have been
widely applied in biomolecular
studies of proteins and metabolites. The liquid chromatography-multiple
reaction monitoring-mass spectrometry (LC-MRM-MS) assay is a multiplexed
and targeted quantification approach and has been demonstrated as
a robust technology platform for disease biomarker discovery and verification.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>−<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref></sup> The MRM assay is capable of precisely quantifying multiple candidates
of interest in a single analysis by employing the corresponding stable
isotope-labeled standard (SIS) peptides with known amounts as the
internal standards. Recently, the MRM assay has enabled sensitive,
reproducible, and specific quantification of 100 or more peptide features
in complex biological matrices.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref></sup> Due to
the multiple quantification results obtained from the MRM assay, data
analysis of hundreds of samples is a time- and labor-consuming process.</p>
    <p>Analysis of multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) data typically involves
two major steps: peak picking and quality assessment. Because chromatographic
peaks exhibit a variety of patterns, data processing and examination
heavily rely on human experience. Generally, MRM analysis requires
weeks or even months of data processing and manual evaluation, especially
for peak quality inspection, selected peak correction, and sample
comparison. Therefore, the identification of methods to improve the
fluency, effectiveness, and accuracy of this process is critical.
Several mass spectrometry (MS) data algorithms and tools focus on
the quality assessment of ion transitions and peak boundary picking.
MRM analysis software such as Skyline<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref></sup> provides
peak-picking capabilities through software prediction or manual operation
functionalities. Skyline is a powerful software for the visualization
of chromatograms obtained from the MRM assay that facilitates human
inspection. Human inspection remains the primary step in the workflow
for peak quality assessment and boundary picking.</p>
    <p>Several mass
spectrometry (MS) data algorithms and tools focus
on the quality assessment of peak boundary picking. Two types of strategies
are typically adopted: scores and prediction models. Featuring scores
is used to build the criteria for manual examinations, whereas prediction
models are developed from predefined rules, machine learning methods,
and deep learning techniques. <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="other">Table <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="other">1</xref></xref> summarizes the types of supporting MS instruments,
targets, user interfaces, and prediction abilities. TargetedMSQC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref></sup> uses different peak features against data from
targeted MS to calculate the metrics and filter out the peak qualities.
These features include full width at half-maximum, peak jaggedness,
and symmetry. PeakOnly<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref></sup> is a convolutional
neural network (CNN) based on machine learning for the detection of
regions of interest (ROIs) and peak area integration to classify ROIs
into three categories. NeatMS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref></sup> is an application
of CNNs that describes model and train selection peaks by using tools
such as XCMS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref></sup> and MZmine 2.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref></sup> It also filters peak qualities to reduce the
number of false peaks. AutomRm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref></sup> uses machine
learning to train two models, namely, a peak-picking model and a peak-reporting
model, to execute MS data peak preprocessing. Currently, software
provides users with prediction results directly, but for certain parts
where predictions are not accurate, the software does not report them
to the user. This leads to users having to verify the prediction results
one by one. Additionally, the differences in MRM technology, such
as quantifier and qualifier purposes, lead to diverse output contents.
Although it is the same technology, the data structure is different
due to differences in experimental design and parameter settings.
This complicates the process of comparing different tools for different
purposes.</p>

    <p>Technicians tend to examine ion transition graphs
one by one by
using visualization tools, resulting in time-consuming MRM data processing.
In this study, we developed HeapMS, a user-friendly web service that
serves as an MRM chromatogram quality assessment and automatic peak-picking
pipeline. The primary goal of HeapMS is to reduce the duration of
manual postprocessing and to work alongside current MRM data processing
software. HeapMS reports uncertain chromatograms that require a manual
examination. It also provides accurate peak boundary prediction capabilities
for technicians to focus on reexamining chromatograms that are marked
as uncertain and those marked as deleted. Three types of HeapMS outputs,
namely, peak boundaries, uncertain chromatograms, and marks for deletion,
are imported into Skyline for manual examination and verification.
This not only shortens the duration of manual comparison and inspection
for peak selection but also increases the efficiency of the entire
process. We also developed an accuracy of quantification (AQ) score
as a standard peak-picking benchmark based on a comparison of manual
picking results for different tools and technicians. By exporting
the software automatic picking results and importing the prediction
results of HeapMS, the HeapMS can be integrated into the current MRM
workflow.</p>

      <title>Sample Collection and Preparation</title>
      <p>The biofluid samples
(first morning-urine and unstimulated whole saliva) were collected
from our unpublished chronic kidney disease (CKD) data and oral squamous
cell carcinoma (OSCC) patients and prepared as described in our previous
studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref></sup> Briefly, the collected samples were centrifuged
to remove cells and debris, and the clarified supernatants were stored
at −80 °C. For urine sample, urinary proteins were further
concentrated using a 10 kDa centrifugal filter. Based on the protein
concentration measured by the BCA Protein Assay kit, triplicate aliquots
of each sample containing 30 μg proteins were diluted with an
appropriate amount of 25 mM ammonium bicarbonate, denatured with 10%
sodium deoxycholate (DOC), reduced with 50 mM Tris (2-carboxyethyl)
phosphine (TCEP) at 60 °C for 30 min, alkylated with 100 mM iodoacetamide
at 37 °C for 30 min, and acidified with 10% formic acid (FA)
and 10% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) to precipitate DOC. The resulting
samples were mixed with stable isotope-labeled standard (SIS) peptides
and subsequently subjected to trypsin-mediated digestion.</p>

      <p>A nano-ACQUITY
UPLC system equipped with a C18 column (100 μm × 100 mm,
1.7 μm particle size; Waters) was coupled with a triple quadrupole
mass spectrometer (QTRAP 5500; AB Sciex, Redwood, CA). Four-microliter
samples containing 1 μg of peptides were injected into the LC-MRM-MS
system, and a 42 min linear gradient of buffer A (0.1% FA in H<sub>2</sub>O) combined with buffer B (0.1% FA in acetonitrile) was applied
as described in our previous studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref></sup> The acquisition

sensitive detection of peptide targets in biological samples. Raw

based on the defined precursor (Q1) and fragment (Q3) mass list of
the target peptides. All spectra were manually checked to ensure confident

LC-MRM-MS for technical replicates. The four data sets differ in the
number of monitored peptides: data set CKD comprises 20 peptides,
data set OSCC-1 comprises 53 peptides, data set OSCC-2 comprises 28
peptides, and data set OSCC-3 comprises 45 peptides. Each chromatogram
consists of the light ion (target peptide) and the heavy ion (SIS
peptide), and the identities of the peptides are represented by three
unique transitions (paired Q1/Q3). Output files of Skyline software

      <title>AQ Score: An Objective Score for Evaluating Peak-Picking Results</title>
      <p>Generally, time boundaries for peak picking cannot be fully correlated
to quantification results. Moreover, chromatograms labeled with the
same time boundaries may have varying intensities, resulting in different
quantification results. In this study, we developed a relative score,
called the AQ score, to evaluate the prediction results accurately
by comparing the area ratio of the predicted results with that of
human-evaluated results for the same chromatogram. The AQ score primarily
evaluates the area ratio of selected peak boundaries, which can be
utilized to calculate the quantification results by cross-referencing
with an internal standard. The AQ score provides a more precise evaluation
than simply measuring the time boundaries for peak picking. <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.analchem.3c01011/suppl_file/ac3c01011_si_001.pdf">Figure S1</ext-link> illustrates how the AQ score is calculated

      <title>Identifying Low-Interference Chromatograms</title>
      <p>The MRM
analytical software provides precise peak boundaries for low-interference
chromatograms observed in the data set. Low-interference chromatograms
have high signal-to-noise ratios and exhibit comparable patterns and
peak time boundaries for three ion transitions. In this study, we
utilized a Savitzky–Golay filter<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref></sup> to obtain smoothed chromatograms. We identified low-interference
chromatograms on the basis of the following rules: (1) the root-mean-square
error of ion transitions should be less than 0.25, (2) each chromatogram
must have only one high peak defined by intensities higher than 20%
of the highest intensity of the three ion transitions, and (3) the
retention bias of the six highest intensities of both heavy and light
ions should be less than 0.3 times the retention time period.<disp-formula id="ueq4"><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="ac3c01011_m004" position="anchor"/></disp-formula></p>
      <p>We used strict rules to identify low-interference
chromatograms to ensure highly accurate software prediction results.
After filtering low-interference chromatograms, we used two artificial
intelligence (AI) models to perform a quality assessment and automatic
peak picking using the following transformations.</p>

    <sec id="sec2.6">
      <title>Converting MRM Spectra into AI Predictable Chromatographic Heatmaps</title>
      <p>We used a spectrum-to-image generator to convert the spectra of
both heavy- and light-ion intensities, coupled with retention time,
into a two-dimensional (2D) heatmap designed for AI recognition and
object detection. <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref></xref> illustrates the concept of this conversion. The intensities
of three ions were converted into relative intensities, summed into
a single value, and mapped to a color bar called “nipy_spectral”
using the matplotlib package in Python. We also tested grayscale and
two other color settings, named Gist_gray, Gnuplot, and Spring, respectively.
The results are shown in <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.analchem.3c01011/suppl_file/ac3c01011_si_001.pdf">Figure S2</ext-link>. This
heatmap conversion strategy maintains information such as the input
spectra, including the relative intensities of both heavy and light
ions and the pattern of the quantified ions. In addition, it conserves
the patterns of correct peak boundaries and high-quality chromatograms,
making the chromatographic heatmaps suitable for AI prediction.</p>

      <title>Implementation of HeapMS</title>
      <p>On the web interface of HeapMS,
we use PHP, JavaScript, and HTML for development. Users simply need
to convert and select files using Skyline before uploading them to
HeapMS for processing. We used the docker environment and Python language
to implement a backend pipeline with a Queuing system to handle all
user requests. The HeapMS platform is composed of multiple independent
computing nodes connected, and any computer capable of running the
HeapMS container can serve as a computing node. Once the user’s
files are uploaded, the system executes the tasks sequentially based
on the upload time. Each time, only one task is executed individually.
When the computation starts, a log file is generated to record the
execution time for each step. If another task triggered by another
user is submitted, then it will wait until the previous task is completed
before proceeding. The source code and a step-by-step installation
guide are available on GitHub: <uri xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://github.com/ccllabe/HeapMS">https://github.com/ccllabe/HeapMS</uri>.</p>

      <title>Deep Learning Architectures</title>
      <p>To build the prediction

and Faster R-CNN<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref></sup> as a boundary picker.
CoAtNets combines convolution and self-attention to achieve outstanding
performance on various data sets, while Faster R-CNN uses region proposals
to detect objects in images by identifying bounding boxes. Both CoAtNet-416
and Faster R-CNN are compatible with GPU acceleration. We trained
the deep learning models from chromatographic heatmaps and implemented
the training and prediction components of HeapMS using Python.</p>

      <title>Workflow of HeapMS</title>
      <p>HeapMS is a front-end web interface
and backend data processing pipeline. <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>a depicts the data processing pipeline. Users
are advised to use Skyline to perform automatic software picking and
export the data into time boundary comma-separated value (CSV) and
ion transition tab-separated value (TSV) files. An interference detector
is then used to identify low-interference chromatograms, which are
subsequently applied to the picking results of Skyline. The QC checker
uses a pretrained CoAtNet model to divide the remaining data into
QC-failed and QC-passed groups. The QC-failed chromatograms are either
deleted or manually reexamined. The boundary picker then uses a pretrained
Faster R-CNN model to perform automatic time boundary picking. Users
are required to upload only their automatic picking and ion transition
files exported from Skyline. The queuing system then automatically
performs heatmap conversion, QC checks, and boundary picking. Users
then download the picked time boundary files in CSV format and intensities
in TSV format and import them into Skyline to perform manual inspection. <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>b depicts the user

      <title>Interplay between Traditional Workflows</title>
      <p>In traditional
workflows, analytical software and human technicians collaborate.
The first step involves identifying and visualizing peak boundaries
using software such as Skyline. Technicians manually examined all
chromatograms according to the spectrum of transitional ions. Chromatograms
with low intensities, low signal-to-noise ratios, and no coelution
properties are eliminated (marked as “Deletion” in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref></xref>a). Technicians use
their experience to accept the time boundary detected by analytic
software (marked as “Computation” in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>a) and to manually adjust the
time boundaries (marked as “Manually picked” in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref></xref>a). <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref></xref>a summarizes the standard workflow
results for four data sets. In practical cases, all software-predicted
boundaries must be manually validated, which is the most time-consuming
step. The decision and adjustment to delete or repick the boundaries
might generally take 30 s per chromatogram, while review of the acceptable
boundaries would take 5 s. The labor working-hours were 53.3, 23.9,
125.8, and 414.0 h for CDK, OSCC-1, OSCC-2, and OSCC-3 data sets,
respectively (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref></xref>a).</p>

    <sec id="sec3.3">
      <title>Advantage of the AQ Score</title>
      <p>The AQ score can help identify
which chromatograms truly need to be repicked by evaluating the similarity
between manually and software-predicted results. <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref></xref>b summarizes the AQ scores
of chromatograms picked automatically from four data sets (purple
areas in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref></xref>a).
The acceptable time boundary is represented by two dashed lines in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref></xref>b, which are 0.2
units above and below the baseline. As shown in the figure, compared
to manually adjusted results, after evaluating the AQ scores before
adjustment, we found that most chromatograms considered in need of
adjustment by humans did not actually require adjustment, as the predicted
results from Skyline were acceptable. Around 7–23% of the chromatograms
did require manual adjustment. In the proteomic MRM analysis, software-based
boundary predictions are still judged manually due to the lack of
assistant tools. Nonetheless, as depicted in the figure, manual judgments
tend to be too strict, resulting in the inclusion of many acceptable
predicted results in the category requiring manual adjustment, which
undoubtedly increases labor costs. Manual re-examination makes the
analytical workflow for MRM data time-consuming.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec3.4">
      <title>Need for AI-Assisted Peak Picking</title>
      <p>As a significant
portion of the data required manual examination and repicking, we
conducted an experiment to determine the variation in examination
outcomes among the individual technicians. We randomly selected 20
peptides, each containing 130 chromatograms, to investigate the deviation
in manual operations. Three well-trained technicians independently
examined the data, either accepting the software predictions or performing
manual repicking. We then combined the coefficient of variation of
peak-picking time (time CV) and the area ratio of light- and heavy-ion
transitions (area CV) on a 2D plot. The results showed similar area
CVs, indicating that the quantification of human-validated data was
consistent. However, the time CVs were more diverse than the area
CVs, indicating that transitions near peak boundaries had low intensities
and were challenging to manually define. Based on <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref></xref>, relying solely on peak-picking
time boundaries to evaluate peak-picking results may be insufficient.
However, the quantification result, represented by the ratio of peak
areas between the picked light- and heavy-ion boundaries, may provide
a reasonable measure of adjustment. <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref></xref>b,<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>c demonstrates
two data points from <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref></xref>a with highly diverse area and time coefficients of variation

resulting in varied peak-picking times, the area ratios of the selected
regions were similar.</p>

we performed peak time boundary identification. Generally, HeapMS
uses Faster R-CNN to detect peak boundaries on heatmaps generated
from light- and heavy-ion transitions. Therefore, we cropped all manually

the chromatographic heatmap, as a training data set to build an object

      <p>The QC checker of HeapMS distinguishes between
QC-passed and QC-failed
chromatograms by identifying heatmap patterns. Discernible variations
can be observed in the color-pixel permutations, with QC-passed cases
exhibiting greater symmetry than QC-failed cases. <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="other">Table <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="other">3</xref></xref> lists the prediction results
of the four data sets. To eliminate the artifacts across samples,
we performed experiments employing a 5-fold cross-validation methodology.
In this approach, we randomly divided our data sets of 72,220 chromatograms
into a test set comprising 20% (14,444 chromatograms) and a training
set consisting of 80% (57,776 chromatograms). This was repeated five
times, and the mean and standard deviation were obtained. The F1 score
of the four data sets was approximately 0.8, with OSCC-3 exhibiting
a high false deletion rate. Compared with the data shown in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref></xref>, the results of
HeapMS and Skyline contained a higher proportion of deleted chromatograms.
The workflow allowed users to manually examine the predicted QC-failed
chromatograms, including true and false deletion. Compared to traditional
workflows, integrating HeapMS can reduce the work time by approximately
5–10 times. For experiments that allow for the possibility
of chromatogram deletion, manual inspection of those marked as “Uncertain”
is sufficient, resulting in a 10× increase in efficiency compared
to traditional workflows. Additionally, the team can manually review
chromatograms marked as “deletion” based on their workload
and available resources.</p>

      <title>Performance and Time Cost of HeapMS</title>
      <p>To objectively
evaluate the overall performance of HeapMS, we developed two models:
Model 1 and Model 2. We developed Model 1 from OSCC-3 and used it
to predict CKD, OSCC-1, and OSCC-2. Because the number of chromatograms
used for training in Model 1 was lower than that in OSCC-3, we developed
Model 2 by combining CKD, OSCC-1, and OSCC-2 and used this model to
predict OSCC-3. <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref></xref> summarizes all of the results, including the calculation time, number
of chromatograms, and predicted categories, and compares them with
the results of manual peak picking. <xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="other">Table <xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="other">4</xref></xref> lists the definitions of six categories
compared to manual inspection.</p>
      <table-wrap id="tbl4" position="float">
        <label>Table 4</label>
        <caption>
          <title>Categories of Prediction Results</title>

        <graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="ac3c01011_0010" id="GRAPHIC-d14e1336-autogenerated" position="float"/>
      </table-wrap>
      <p>Because Skyline can pick peaks from
any input chromatogram, only
three categories are labeled in its output results. Although the overall
accuracy of human technicians is lower than that of Skyline, human
technicians can focus only on the “Uncertain” category,
which represents only approximately 2% of all input chromatograms.
For laboratories that require automatically acquired MRM data, a false
deletion rate of approximately 5–15% is observed. However,
for laboratories that prefer the collection of a large amount of data,
technicians can manually inspect all of the chromatograms labeled
in the “Deletion” category. HeapMS guarantees an error
rate of less than 2% and substantially reduces the human inspection
workload. The comparisons of AQ scores from HeapMS and Skyline are
shown in <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.analchem.3c01011/suppl_file/ac3c01011_si_001.pdf">Figure S5</ext-link>. We present the experimental
result of choosing an appropriate threshold of the object detection
model in <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.analchem.3c01011/suppl_file/ac3c01011_si_001.pdf">Figure S6</ext-link>. HeapMS shows a higher
number of chromatograms with an acceptable AQ score range. Moreover,
Skyline predicts pick boundaries in all chromatograms without quality
filtering; technicians must manually examine all chromatograms.</p>
      <p>We plotted the proportion of deleted chromatograms that were marked
by the QC checker for each target peptide because the proportion of
true deletions is much higher in OSCC samples than in CKD samples.
As shown in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref></xref>, each purple cell in the third row represents a single target peptide,
sorted in a descending order by the number of marked deletions. Almost
all chromatograms of the first 10 peptides of OSCC-1 were marked as
deleted. In the CKD samples, the cells marked as deleted are relatively
lower compared to other data sets. In comparison to human results,
the proportions of true and false deletions are lower than the other
three data sets. The proportions of true and false deletions are high,
as well. Therefore, technicians can use the HeapMS QC checker as a
quality estimator for target peptides and delete those whose chromatograms
are mostly marked as deleted.</p>

    <sec id="sec3.8">
      <title>Universal AI Model for Predicting Various Sample Types</title>
      <p>Generally, the low-interference detector and AI models of HeapMS
can be used on different sample types. In our test, we used the model
developed by OSCC-3, a saliva sample, to perform peak picking on saliva
samples from patients with oral cancer. This is because manual inspection
uses the same criteria, and technicians use relative intensities to
evaluate the quality of transitions from three heavy and light pairs.
For example, the signal-to-noise ratio, the pattern of each ion, and
a coalition of targeting ions are generally used to adjust the peak-picking
results in manual inspections. These features are conserved in different
tissues and samples, and they can be preserved by our chromatographic
heatmap conservation. Based on the previous cross-tissue exchange
experiments, HeapMS demonstrates robust transferability of pretrained
AI models across various types of samples. The use of HeapMS in MRM
workflows can dramatically reduce the time cost from months to only
a few days. In addition, the output data can be reimported into Skyline
or another MRM analytic tool for further examination. Thus, HeapMS
can seamlessly integrate into existing MRM workflows without requiring
any deliberate adjustments or modifications to incorporate the AI
prediction tool.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec3.9">
      <title>Limitation of HeapMS and Future Work</title>
      <p>The present study
focuses on developing HeapMS, a tool specifically designed for analyzing
the precise quantification of multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) data.
By integration of heavy and light peptides, HeapMS enables more precise
data analysis from an experimental perspective. The current version
of HeapMS allows for only three transitions per chromatogram. If more
than three transitions are uploaded, the pipeline will select the
first three to generate the heatmap. Additionally, because our neural
network can be used for the two-dimensional images, only target peptides
paired as light and heavy transitions can be processed by HeapMS.
HeapMS has the potential to handle more than three ion transitions.
It accomplishes this by converting intensities into relative percentages,
summing them, and representing the total as color blocks on a heatmap.
In the future, we will fine-tune the 2D heatmap transformation specifically
for chromatograms with multiple transitions, aiming to enhance the
applicability of HeapMS. It demonstrates its potential in processing
parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) data, which includes multiple transitions
within a single chromatogram.</p>

    <title>Conclusions</title>
    <p>MRM peak picking and quality assessment
heavily rely on the experience
of technicians. In some cases, technicians obtained varying picking
results. In other cases, manual adjustments are highly similar to
the original software predictions. Although automatic peak-picking
tools, such as Skyline, provide reliable peak results, the output
data often contain hidden errors or uncertainties. Therefore, to ensure
high data quality, manual inspection is required to examine the data,
which is a highly time-consuming process. HeapMS combines rule-based
and machine learning approaches to provide flexible and accurate MRM
peak picking. The input and output file formats are the same as those
provided by the current software. Thus, HeapMS can be easily integrated
into existing MRM workflows.</p>
