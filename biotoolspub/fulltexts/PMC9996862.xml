        <title>Background</title>
        <p id="Par1">Long-read sequencing technologies have the potential to overcome the limitations of short reads and provide a comprehensive picture of the human genome. However, the characterization of repetitive sequences by reconstructing genomic structures at high resolution solely from long reads remains difficult. Here, we developed a localized assembly method (LoMA) that constructs highly accurate consensus sequences (CSs) from long reads.

      <sec>
        <title>Methods</title>
        <p id="Par2">We developed LoMA by combining minimap2, MAFFT, and our algorithm, which classifies diploid haplotypes based on structural variants and CSs. Using this tool, we analyzed two human samples (NA18943 and NA19240) sequenced with the Oxford Nanopore sequencer. We defined target regions in each genome based on mapping patterns and then constructed a high-quality catalog of the human insertion solely from the long-read data.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>Results</title>
        <p id="Par3">The assessment of LoMA showed a high accuracy of CSs (error rate &lt; 0.3%) compared with raw data (error rate &gt; 8%) and superiority to a previous study. The genome-wide analysis of NA18943 and NA19240 identified 5516 and 6542 insertions (≥ 100 bp), respectively. Most insertions (~ 80%) were derived from tandem repeats and transposable elements. We also detected processed pseudogenes, insertions in transposable elements, and long insertions (&gt; 10 kbp). Finally, our analysis suggested that short tandem duplications are associated with gene expression and transposons.</p>

        <title>Conclusions</title>
        <p id="Par4">Our analysis showed that LoMA constructs high-quality sequences from long reads with substantial errors.

    <title>Background</title>
    <p id="Par20">Long-read sequencing technologies, such as Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) and Pacific Biosciences (PacBio), have the potential to overcome the limitations of next-generation sequencing technologies and provide a comprehensive picture of the human genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Current technological shortcomings, such as high sequencing error rates, are steadily being overcome, and many recent studies using long reads have interrogated previously inaccessible regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Further, long-read technologies have enabled the identification of pathogenic structural variants (SVs) such as large deletions in <italic>EYS</italic> in retinitis pigmentosa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] and the expansion of a triplet repeat in <italic>NOTCH2NLC</italic> in neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Moreover, there is a growing demand for clinical applications of long reads studies to solve common and Mendelian disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Studies using long reads may thus contribute to new therapeutics and more accurate diagnosis of human disease.</p>
    <p id="Par21">However, many problematic regions are still harbored in the human genome. Widely distributed repeats, such as tandem and interspersed repeats, can cause issues in the data processing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Importantly, expansions of tandem repeats (TRs) cause various disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], and transposable elements (TEs), including <italic>Alu</italic> element and LINE, have been associated with a range of disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p>
    <p id="Par22">Recently, the first complete sequence of a human genome was finished by the Telomere-to-Telomere (T2T) Consortium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], which added 238 Mbp of non-syntenic sequences to the GRCh38 assembly. This study also showed that most additional bases were derived from repetitive sequences, such as centromeric satellites and segmental duplications, suggesting that previous research based on de novo assembly may have dismissed a large portion of repetitive sequences. Although the T2T-CHM13 assembly is one of the greatest achievements of long reads, it was attained by sequencing the cell line from a complete hydatidiform mole (uniformly homozygous) and by combining data from multiple platforms including HiFi, ONT, Illumina, and other state-of-the-art techniques. Such large-scale, comprehensive approaches cannot be applied to practical clinical studies in most cases due to cost and human resources.</p>
    <p id="Par23">Current SV calling is essentially based on two types of methodologies: a de novo assembly-based approach and a mapping-based approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. One of the advantages of the former lies in the detection of large variants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. However, this method is hampered by haplotype representations and assembly errors caused by repetitive sequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. On the other hand, a mapping-based approach with long reads is advantageous when coverage of the available data is low or the samples contain low-frequency SVs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The variant discovery of this approach usually begins with the mapping of reads to a reference genome and detects SVs based on specific mapping patterns. However, misalignments due to sequencing errors sometimes cause false positives and negatives, and tangled, nested SVs prevent accurate SV calling. Considering these advantages and disadvantages of the current approaches, we aimed to establish a hybrid approach to analyze SVs at single-base resolution.</p>
    <p id="Par24">Here we developed a localized assembly tool, LoMA (Localized Merging and Assembly), which generates accurate consensus sequences (CSs) based on the mapping results of long reads. LoMA captures haplotype structures based on SVs and produces haplotype-resolved CSs, which helps identify heterozygous variants. To our best knowledge, only one tool, lamassemble, has been developed to fulfill a similar purpose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]; however, this software cannot classify heterozygous regions, which can hinder the resolution of human diploid genomes. In response, we implemented haplotype classification of a target region to improve the accuracy of SV detection.</p>
    <p id="Par25">We applied LoMA to genome-wide SV detection in two samples using the high-coverage whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data from ONT. Generally, true genomic structures of insertions are difficult to resolve. Thus, we aimed to reveal true inserted sequences at single-base resolution. Our analysis showed that LoMA constructs high-quality sequences from single-platform long-read data with substantial errors and revealed the true structures of tandem and interspersed repeats in the human genome.</p>

      <title>Development of LoMA</title>
      <p id="Par26">Raw reads yielded by ONT are accompanied by substantial sequencing errors. LoMA is a tool to assemble long reads mapped to a region of interest and generates a highly accurate CS that spans the target region (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). LoMA detects heterozygous SVs in a target region and outputs haplotype-resolved sequences. In the first step, LoMA constructs a CS spanning the region. This process is initiated by finding overlaps of raw reads using all-to-all pairwise alignment using minimap2 (-x ava-ont) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] and then generates a layout of overlapped reads (read layout) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>A). Based on the all-to-all pairwise alignment, the read layout is estimated. First, pairs with a dangling read or short overlapping lengths are excluded to remove possible alignment errors (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Fig. S1). Second, the longest read is selected, and pairwise alignments are used to determine the positional relationship between the longest read and other reads. The read layout is divided into overlapped, evenly-spaced divisions of constant length, and read sequences included in each division undergo a multiple alignment using MAFFT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Based on the multiple alignment, each consensus nucleotide is determined at every position, and a partial CS is generated for each division. Finally, partial CSs of neighboring divisions are aligned using MAFFT and concatenated into a single CS spanning the entire target region. <fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Schematic overview of LoMA's algorithm. <bold>A</bold>. The main process to compose a consensus sequence (CS) is shown. Reads are laid out based on all-to-all alignment using minimap2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The layout is then subdivided into small divisions for the successive procedure to determine partial CSs based on multiple alignments using MAFFT for each division [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. The entire CS is obtained by concatenating these small divisions. <bold>B</bold>. The read classification process is shown. Reads constituting a CS are aligned to the CS using minimap2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. LoMA predicts heterozygous loci in the region based on the number of reads supporting a SV, and the reads derived from each estimated haplotype are gathered (Type I and II read sets). Both sets return to the main process (<bold>A</bold>) after this step</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="40246_2023_467_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p>
      <p id="Par27">The generated single CS can be a mosaic sequence (pseudo-haplotype) mixing paternal and maternal haplotypes, resulting in the dismissal of one allele of the heterozygous variants. To overcome this problem, we adopted the read-separation step (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>B). In this step, all input reads are aligned to the first CS recurrently by using minimap2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Then, bins (700 bp) with mismatch clusters are detected based on two conditions: the number of discordant reads to the first CS being &gt; 7 and the number of discordant reads being within the mean ± 3σ of a binomial distribution with <italic>p</italic> = 0.5 (see Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>). Two haplotypes that have multiple heterozygous SVs at different loci are separated using reads that span more than one SV (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>B). By tracking back all heterozygous bins in a target region, all reads are coherently classified into two individual read sets (Type I and II) in most cases (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>B). Two CSs are generated from Type I and II. Two read sets will not be produced if a target region does not contain any SV, and the region will be regarded as homozygous.</p>

      <title>DNA sequencing and data processing</title>
      <p id="Par28">Two samples, NA18943 and NA19240, from the International HapMap Project, were analyzed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. NA19240 is a Yoruban male sequenced with PromethION (ONT) by De Coster et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. The WGS data of this sample were downloaded in fastq files from the European Nucleotide Archive (accession number: PRJEB26791) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. NA18943 is a Japanese male and is the first Japanese sample sequenced by short reads [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. In this study, its genomic DNA was extracted from a B cell line and sequenced for 26 flowcells using MinION (ONT).</p>
      <p id="Par29">Basecalling was performed for the WGS data of NA18943 using Guppy (ver.4.4.1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]:</p>

      <title>Accuracy assessment and simulation of LoMA</title>
      <p id="Par33">To estimate the accuracy of LoMA, we compared CSs assembled using the ONT data of NA18943 with GRCh38. We randomly selected 108 positions from the human genome while excluding centromeres and gaps (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S1). We collected all reads mapped within 20 kbp of each position from the data of NA18943 and constructed CSs using LoMA. We aligned the generated CSs to GRCh38 using minimap2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] and calculated the error rates from the edit distance. We also aligned all raw reads to GRCh38 and calculated error rates for the raw reads again using the edit distance. For a comparison, we assembled matched regions using lamassemble [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]:</p>
      <p id="Par34">

</p>
      <p id="Par35">The error rate of lamassemble was calculated as above.</p>
      <p id="Par36">We also evaluated LoMA using simulated data. We randomly selected one hundred regions from GRCh38 (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S2). Simulated reads were generated using NanoSim with the error profile of NA12878 (total error rate, 10.8%) provided by the developers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Various data sets were generated for each region: coverage 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 (with a fixed size of 20 kbp), targeted size 20 kbp, 40 kbp, 60 kbp, 80 kbp, and 100 kbp (with a fixed mean coverage of 30×). The error rate, CPU time, and peak memory (RSS) were measured. A computer with M1 chip (Apple) was used to measure the performance. The error rate (edit distance) was calculated as described above.</p>

      <title>Detecting unclear regions in genomes</title>
      <p id="Par37">To detect SVs from the two samples, we applied LoMA to the WGS data. We first searched for target regions (unclear regions) by scanning all chromosomes from telomere to telomere. We split each autosome and sex chromosome binned per 500 bp, step size 250 bp, and defined an “unclear” region as follows: (1) average coverage between 10 and 200, (2) total number of reads containing indels (≥ 100 bp) or hard- or soft-clipped sequences (≥ 500 bp) &gt; 10, and (3) the proportion of reads containing indels (≥ 100 bp) or hard- or soft-clipped sequences (≥ 500 bp) &gt; 0.2 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>A). Then, multiple bins within 10 kbp were merged into one bin. We defined each merged bin as an unclear region in this study. After defining the unclear regions for both NA18943 and NA19240, we collected reads mapped within 10 kbp from both ends of each unclear region using SAMtools [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Whole-genome LoMA analysis. <bold>A</bold>. The workflow of the whole-genome analysis. Unclear regions were first defined based on the alignment status (indels and clips) of ONT reads. Reads mapped to the regions were separately collected. For each region, LoMA attempted a localized assembly to obtain CSs. CAMPHOR collectively detected structural variants from the CSs for NA18943 and NA19240. <bold>B</bold>. The relative density of unclear regions of NA18943 and NA19240 are shown in red- and blue-colored heatmaps, respectively. The light-colored regions are dense with unclear regions. The white arrows indicate the autosomal centromeres except chromosome 6. The arrows on chromosome 6 represent the <italic>HLA</italic> region. <bold>C</bold>. The precision of indels to the standard SV set was assessed for NA19240. The left vertical axis (bar graphs) shows the number of indels found in each bin (the number of constitutive reads). The right (line graphs) shows the precision of indels in each bin. Both graphs were binned per 2 reads</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="40246_2023_467_Fig2_HTML" id="MO2"/></fig></p>

PCR primers were designed in flanking regions, and the PCR-direct sequence was conducted. We compared the sequences by Sanger sequencing with the matched sequences of CSs generated by LoMA. Since the length of homopolymers was difficult to determine by Sanger sequencing, the stretches of poly(A) were removed from the comparison.</p>

      <title>Decomposing insertions</title>
      <p id="Par43">Insertion events are known to be caused by various mechanisms and have various consequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. To characterize and investigate the origins of the detected insertions, we decomposed them into TRs, TEs, tandem duplications (TDs), satellite sequences, dispersed duplications, processed pseudogenes, alternative sequences, “deletions” in GRCh38, and nuclear mitochondrial DNA sequences (NUMTs).</p>
      <p id="Par44">We first applied Tandem Repeats Finder (TRF) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] to all inserted sequences and defined TRs as having (1) element lengths &lt; 50 bp and (2) covering more than 50% of an inserted sequence. After filtering TRs, we identified TEs using RepeatMasker [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] if (1) an inserted sequence covered a TE &gt; 50%, (2) the inserted sequence was covered by the TE &gt; 50% (reciprocal overlap), and (3) the total substitutions and indels were &lt; 50% (matching condition).</p>
      <p id="Par45">Previous studies have reported that TDs are understudied but widespread [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. After detecting TRs and TEs, we manually reviewed the remaining insertions and found that they contained TDs derived from non-repetitive regions in the reference. We considered these insertions as TDs. To identify this class of insertions, we aligned all insertions except TRs to GRCh38 using BLAT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. We then collected insertions mapped to original breakpoints within 5 bp with &gt; 90% in BLAT identity and defined them as TDs. In this process, missing TRs with long repeat elements were found. Therefore, they were added to the TR callset if (1) an inserted sequence aligned within 500 bp from the insertion breakpoint and (2) the ratio of the total number of matching bases to the insertion length was &gt; 0.5.</p>
      <p id="Par46">To understand the remaining insertions, we manually checked their features by aligning them to the reference using BLAT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. We identified insertions that were aligned from end to end to different chromosomal regions with high identity (&gt; 90%). We defined these insertions as dispersed duplications. Next, we detected insertions aligned to a series of exons and untranslated regions (UTRs) of coding genes with high identity (&gt; 90%) and classified them as processed pseudogenes. We also found other insertions aligned to the alternative sequences (e.g., “alt” or “fix” sequences) on BLAT with high identity (&gt; 90%). We classified them as alternative sequences. Some of the insertions left at this point were thought to have arisen by deletion events in GRCh38 because they were securely aligned to the chimpanzee reference genome (panTro6), although they were classified as insertions when compared with GRCh38 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. We aligned the remaining insertions to the panTro6 assembly and categorized the insertions that lifted over panTro6 with high accuracy (&gt; 90%) within 100 bp of the inserted position on GRCh38 as "deletions” in GRCh38. After this, the remaining insertions were manually reviewed, and features of the genomic regions (segmental duplications or self-chain) were examined.</p>

      <title>Reduction in error rate and accuracy validation of LoMA</title>
      <p id="Par52">To evaluate the accuracy of LoMA, we performed extensive validations. First, we randomly selected 108 regions and constructed CSs using LoMA (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S1). Thirteen of the 108 regions were classified as heterozygous, and two CSs were generated for each heterozygous region. In total, 121 CSs were obtained. We aligned them to GRCh38 and assessed the error rate. The total alignment length was approximately 7.3 Mbp (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S4). The estimated error rate was 8.7% (SD = 0.72) for raw reads and 0.76% (SD = 0.67) for CSs by LoMA (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>A, Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S1). Similarly, we attempted to construct CSs of matched regions using lamassemble for a comparison but failed to assemble three of the 108 regions, leaving 105 obtained sequences (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S1). The alignment with GRCh38 estimated the mean error rate of the lamassemble sequences to be 2.3% (SD = 4.1) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>A, Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S1).<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>Accuracy assessment and simulated error rate of LoMA<bold>.

      <p id="Par53">We next performed an experimental validation for the CSs generated by LoMA. We found 14 SV candidates from 13 heterozygous regions (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Tables S1, S5). The primer design and PCR amplification were successful for eight heterozygous candidates, and the product sizes of all candidates were concordant with the expectation of LoMA (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S5, Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Fig. S2).</p>
      <p id="Par54">Further, we performed Sanger sequencing for 121 homozygous insertions randomly selected from NA18943 (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S6).

The computation time and peak RSS of LoMA were also measured. The computation time was generally linear for coverage up to 50× and target size up to 100 kbp, with a processing time of a few minutes (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S7, Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figs S4, S5). The peak RSS was approximately 1 GB for coverage up to 50× and target size up to 100 kbp, and the memory increase was more suppressive than linear (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S8, Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figs S4, S5).

The larger number of unclear regions in NA19240 reflected the high genetic diversity of African populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>].

The mean precisions of insertions and deletions with 20 or more reads were 0.82 and 0.93, respectively. For less than 20 reads, the mean precision was 0.52 for each. However, the percentage of SVs with less than 20 reads in the entire SV set was 21.9% for insertions and deletions, respectively; thus, excluding these SVs did not strongly affect the conclusions of this study. Accordingly, we focused on SVs in regions with 20 or more reads to define a more conservative callset of indels. After this filtration, we finally obtained 5516 insertions and 2687 deletions in NA18943, and 6542 insertions and 3475 deletions in NA19240 (the LoMA SV set).

For example, a processed pseudogene found in NA19240, sized 1115 bp (the breakpoint was at chr11:60,274,156), was precisely mapped to <italic>RPLP0</italic> on chromosome 12 with 99.9% in BLAT identity (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>D).

The motif search of flanking sequences detected a strong motif at the first nicking site, TTAAAAA (<italic>E</italic>-value = 2.5 × 10<sup>–315</sup>) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>A), as shown in previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. On the other hand, no clear motif was identified around the second nicking site. We next analyzed the length distribution of TSDs flanking <italic>Alu</italic> elements, and single-peak distributions (median length of 15 bp) were obtained (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>B). The overall shape of the distributions was slightly skewed left, showing TSDs longer than 15 bp were fewer than TSDs shorter than 15 bp.<fig id="Fig6"><label>Fig. 6</label><caption><p>Analysis of TSDs among <italic>Alu</italic> insertions.<bold> A</bold>.

      <p id="Par66">Lastly, we detected and analyzed TDs (<italic>n</italic> = 71 in NA18943 and <italic>n</italic> = 88 in NA19240). The length distribution showed that TDs were relatively short (the largest duplication was ~ 600 bp in length) and that short TDs were dominant (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>A). A manual review using UCSC Genome Browser [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>] showed that 50 (NA18943) and 54 (NA19240) TDs were observed in TEs and significantly enriched in TEs in NA18943 and NA19240, respectively (binomial test: <italic>P</italic> = 3.0 × 10<sup>–5</sup> in NA18943 and <italic>P</italic> = 3.5 × 10<sup>–3</sup> in NA19240) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>B). We analyzed the association of TDs and genes. TDs were observed in 30 (NA18943) and 34 (NA19240) genes, and together, 54 non-redundant TDs in genic regions were identified (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S11). The genes with TDs showed higher expression levels than other genes (Wilcoxon test: <italic>P</italic> = 4.4 × 10<sup>–12</sup>) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>C), although TDs were not enriched in gene regions (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Fig. S8).<fig id="Fig7"><label>Fig. 7</label><caption><p>The characteristics of short TDs.<bold> A</bold>.

    <title>Discussion</title>
    <p id="Par67">Assembling and polishing noisy long reads for local genomic regions can be a useful approach for the investigation of SVs underlying the human genome. This study showed that LoMA constructs accurate CSs from error-prone ONT reads and revealed fine structures of insertions. In this study, we evaluated the performance of LoMA using real and simulated data. A comparison with GRCh38 showed that LoMA reduced the error rate from 8.7% (raw ONT reads) to 0.76% (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>A). Sanger sequencing estimated the error rate of CSs by LoMA as 0.29% (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>B). In the simulation, the average error rate dropped below 0.1% with a coverage of 30×, which is an error rate comparable with short-read sequencing technologies (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>C). Additionally, most heterozygous SVs detected by LoMA were successfully validated by PCR (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Fig. S2), suggesting a good accuracy of haplotype representation. We also compared the accuracy with a similar tool, lamassemble, finding LoMA had a lower average error rate (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>A). Notably, the error patterns showed different patterns: the insertion rate was larger in LoMA in many cases (69%, 74 from 108 regions), although the deletion rate was larger in lamassemble in most cases (94%, 102 from 108 regions) (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S1). Thus, LoMA has the advantage of a lower deletion rate, although both tools may have systematic bias. Moreover, LoMA is superior in haplotype representation. Many de novo assemblers and lamassemble lack haplotype resolution, which results in representing a pseudo-haplotype and a decline in accuracy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Taken together, these results demonstrated that LoMA had sufficient accuracy to investigate genomic sequences at single-base resolution.</p>
    <p id="Par68">Since a large part of the human genome is identical within human populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>], a targeted analysis of unclear regions should be enough for most human genome studies. In the current study, we focused on regions where clipped or collapsed reads were clustered (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>A), because such regions were likely to contain SVs and unstable genomic structures. The unclear regions were scattered throughout the entire genome, but the clusters were observed in the pericentromeric and <italic>HLA</italic> region, as expected (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>B).</p>
    <p id="Par69">We reconstructed the unclear regions using LoMA to understand their structures. Insertions are difficult to resolve because an inserted sequence complicates alignment and remains uncharacterized without an accuracy sequence. We found 5516 and 6542 insertions (≥ 100 bp) in NA18943 and NA19240, respectively (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>B) and restored them from single-platform data. This analysis identified some interesting examples that showed the effectiveness of our approach. First, a processed pseudogene of <italic>RPLP0</italic> (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>D) was accurately aligned to the original gene on chromosome 12 (99.9% in identity), although <italic>RPLP0</italic> has many reverse-transcribed copies scattered on other chromosomes. Among them, the identified insertion was most accurately aligned to the original gene (specific splice variant) rather than the other reverse-transcribed copies (the second most accurate alignment was 98.7% in identity), suggesting that the processed pseudogene was derived from the original <italic>RPLP0</italic> gene, not from other pseudogenes. This result indicated the importance of high-quality CSs for biological analyses. Second, we identified 15% of insertions of the alternative sequences in NA19240 were undetected in the standard SV set (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S9); these insertions were likely caused by analytical difficulties in a previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Particularly, we corrected the SV structure (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>E) in the <italic>HLA</italic> region, which is known for its hypervariability in human populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. In NA18943, an insertion (~ 14 kbp) derived from an alternative sequence was highly concordant (99.8% in identity) (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Fig. S6). Since such long insertions are difficult to restore by a mapping-based approach, this result indicates the efficiency of our assembly approach.</p>
    <p id="Par70">Our analysis showed that TR expansions were highly variable in length (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>A). Large TR expansions found in our analysis ranged thousands of base pairs. Although the landscape of TR expansions has been studied using short and long reads [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>], to our knowledge, no studies have constructed long repeats and assessed the expansion rate throughout genomes. Many studies have identified pathogenic long repeat expansions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>], and several methods were developed to detect repeat expansions. However, such laboratory techniques are not suitable for multiple loci [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. Thus, genome-wide analysis using LoMA will help explore TR expansions more widely and simply. Further, our analysis suggested that TR expansions existed even in healthy individuals, and these polymorphisms may affect disease susceptibility. Indeed, our results showed healthy individuals had expansions in exons consisting of TRs, and most of them were associated with various human traits and disease susceptibility (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S10) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. Further studies of human populations using long reads may identify disease-related TR expansions. We also observed TR expansions inside TEs, especially in SVAs (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>D), suggesting the existence of repetitive polymorphisms in repetitive sequences. A recent study reported SVs in SVAs associated with neurological disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. Our results are consistent with this previous study and indicated the importance of investigating TR expansions in TEs. Nested repeats are hard to identify without long reads, and an assembly approach is necessary to interpret them. Therefore, investigations of human genetic variations using our method may lead to findings of novel susceptible genes of complex diseases. We also showed that TR expansions are prone to exist downstream of SINEs (<italic>Alu</italic> and <italic>MIR</italic>) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>D). This relationship may reflect the reverse transcription mechanism in which an RNA element introduces a poly(A) sequence into the inserted site and provide a source of genomic instability around the site that gives rise to TR expansions.</p>
    <p id="Par71"><italic>Alu</italic> elements are non-autonomous retrotransposons, and their insertion is initiated by target site-primed reverse transcription dependent on L1 endonuclease and reverse transcriptase, although there is no consensus on how the synthesized end is integrated to the target sequence on the opposite DNA strand [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. We showed that the first nick induced by the initiation of the target-site primed reverse transcription of an <italic>Alu</italic> element has a strong motif, which is consistent with sites that L1 ORF2p endonuclease recognizes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]; however, our analysis also suggested this recognition can take place at other sites that contain G-rich sequences (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>A). The length of a TSD is dependent on the second nicking site in the sense strand [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. A past study suggested that TSD lengths are within 15–16 bp, though the investigated size of an <italic>Alu</italic> element was relatively small [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. Our results corroborated that finding and further suggested that the distribution was skewed left, with an average length of 15 bp (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>B).</p>
    <p id="Par72">Lastly, we showed the characteristics of TDs. This class of insertions is understudied due to a lack of genome-wide sequence analysis at single-base resolution. We found that genes containing a TD were highly expressed compared to other genes (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>C), suggesting that TDs are induced by transcription stress. Furthermore, TDs were enriched in transposable elements (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>B). It is known that inversions are induced in L1 retrotransposition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. TE integration may also be related to the birth of novel TDs by some mechanism through the reverse transcription process. In the present study, we did not analyze indels shorter than 100 bp in length. However, the length distribution of TDs suggested that a number of TDs lie in short ranges (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>A) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. The numerical dominance of short TDs may contribute to genetic variations in the human population.</p>
    <p id="Par73">We revealed the true structures of insertions with high accuracy and inferred mechanisms for the insertions. However, our study has several limitations to be addressed in the future. First, LoMA classified haplotypes based on SVs, but SNVs and short indels were not taken into account. This is because current long reads have high sequencing error rates and haplotype classification based on SNVs may cause computational errors. As sequencing technologies and basecalling accuracies improve, SNV-based haplotype reconstruction should be possible in the near future. Second, SV callings in low-coverage regions had low precision (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>C) due to high error rates in the current platforms. Improvements in sequencing error rates will enable reliable data from low-coverage regions. Third, in the genome-wide survey of unclear regions, we could not obtain satisfactory results in centromeric satellites and other complex regions, because the lengths of the reads were not sufficient to completely resolve these complex regions (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S3) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Longer reads should help to analyze these regions.
