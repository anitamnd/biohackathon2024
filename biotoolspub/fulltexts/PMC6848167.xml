      <p id="Par1">While gene expression profiling is commonly used to gain an overview of cellular processes, the identification of upstream processes that drive expression changes remains a challenge. To address this issue, we introduce CARNIVAL, a causal network contextualization tool which derives network architectures from gene expression footprints. CARNIVAL (CAusal Reasoning pipeline for Network identification using Integer VALue programming) integrates different sources of prior knowledge including signed and directed protein–protein interactions, transcription factor targets, and pathway signatures. The use of prior knowledge in CARNIVAL enables capturing a broad set of upstream cellular processes and regulators, leading to a higher accuracy when benchmarked against related tools. Implementation as an integer linear programming (ILP) problem guarantees efficient computation. As a case study, we applied CARNIVAL to contextualize signaling networks from gene expression data in IgA nephropathy (IgAN), a condition that can lead to chronic kidney disease. CARNIVAL identified specific signaling pathways and associated mediators dysregulated in IgAN including Wnt and TGF-β, which we subsequently validated experimentally. These results demonstrated how CARNIVAL generates hypotheses on potential upstream alterations that propagate through signaling networks, providing insights into diseases.</p>

      <title>Network inference: causal reasoning from expression and prior knowledge</title>
      <p id="Par2">Changes in gene expression are generally indirect consequences of upstream dysregulation, and it is often important to understand what caused it. A team of researchers led by Julio Saez-Rodriguez from Heidelberg and Aachen has developed CARNIVAL to infer causal networks of proteins upstream of gene expression. In the first step, dysregulated transcription factors are inferred from gene expression. Subsequently, an algorithm finds explanations for their up- or down-regulation through known protein–protein interactions using an ILP formulation. Optionally, known targets of perturbation can be provided. This integration of different sources of prior knowledge led to higher performance than alternative methods and was able to identify key pathways and proteins, including TGFβ signaling and β-Catenin, in a case study on IgA nephropathy. Overall, CARNIVAL may provide clues to understand causal mechanisms in diseases and treatments.</p>

    <title>Introduction</title>
    <p id="Par3">Cells possess a sophisticated and finely tuned signaling architecture, and its dysregulation can alter cellular behavior leading to many diseases. A better understanding of signaling networks, therefore, allows us to gain insights into disease processes and to prioritize potential targets for drug development.</p>
    <p id="Par4">Signaling networks are context specific. A network for a specific context can be inferred from dedicated data computationally. This inference can be performed based on phosphoproteomics data that directly measure key signaling players such as receptors and kinases,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup> preferably in combination with prior knowledge.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup> However, the availability of phosphoproteomics data is often limited while gene expression data are more abundant. The inference of signaling networks based on gene expression is, therefore, an attractive approach to uncover the organization of cellular signal transduction.</p>
    <p id="Par5">There are multiple computational tools which allow the inference of regulatory signaling networks from gene expression data. Many of these methods assume gene expression levels as a proxy for signaling protein activities and use them to construct networks.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup> For instance, Huang and Fraenkel mapped transcriptomics data onto signaling pathways and then applied a Steiner’s tree algorithm for network contextualization.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup> Such methods can provide valuable insight, but are limited by the fact that the abundance and activities of signaling proteins only partially correlate with gene expression.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup></p>
    <p id="Par6">To overcome this limitation, one can alternatively identify upstream signaling regulators from the profiles of downstream gene targets. One approach is to analyze gene expression footprints of signaling pathways obtained from perturbation experiments.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup> Another one is to predict transcription factor (TF) activities based on their regulons.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup> However, these approaches do not provide information on the topology of signaling pathways. This information can be obtained by applying network-based approaches that can incorporate the network structure as prior information.</p>
    <p id="Par7">Given a starting prior knowledge network (PKN), upstream regulators can be inferred from downstream signaling targets in the form of a sub-network that infers direct connections and further upstream signaling events, as implemented by Melas et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup> These tools, however, only take the PKN as prior knowledge. The tool X2K, in contrast, uses expression footprint as prior knowledge to link gene expression to upstream regulatory kinases using TF and kinase enrichment, but without considering the causality of the cascades.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup></p>
    <p id="Par8">We set out to integrate the causal network approach with expression footprints to infer the whole signaling cascade. For this, we developed the causal reasoning tool CARNIVAL (CAusal Reasoning pipeline for Network identification using Integer VALue programming). CARNIVAL expands an integer linear programming (ILP) implementation for causal reasoning<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup> to integrate information from TF and signaling pathway activity scoring. In addition, it can be applied not only to perturbation experiments, as in the original implementation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>, but also generally to compare between two or more conditions. CARNIVAL uses a comprehensive collection of pathway resources available in OmniPath as PKN,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup> though other sources can be used (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). We performed a benchmarking study using the SBVimprover Species Translation Challenge dataset<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup> and compared its performance to an alternative causal reasoning network contextualization tool CausalR.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup> As a case study, we apply CARNIVAL to glomerular gene expression data on IgA nephropathy (IgAN), a common chronic kidney disease (CKD) accounting for 35% of all renal transplantations in adults,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup> in order to gain insights on the cellular processes that regulate its pathophysiology. These were confirmed by independent experimental validation.</p>

      <title>Benchmarking on the SBV improver dataset</title>
      <p id="Par9">To evaluate the performance of the CARNIVAL pipeline, we applied it to the SBVimprover Species Translation Challenge dataset which provides phosphorylation and gene expression data for multiple perturbations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup> We applied both the Standard CARNIVAL “StdCARNIVAL” and Inverse CARNIVAL “InvCARNIVAL” pipelines to evaluate the effect of information from the perturbation targets onto the resulting networks. The results from both pipelines were then compared to the ones generated by CausalR as well as GSEA.</p>
      <p id="Par10">This study provides phosphoprotein data, which in principle lend itself to validate the estimated activity of nodes with CARNIVAL. However, only 3-to-4 out of 19 phosphosites in the phosphoprotein dataset could be mapped to CARNIVAL node activities per condition, which is insufficient for statistical analyses (see Methods). We therefore used an alternative validation. We first determined which pathways are known to be linked to the perturbations by different molecules according to the KEGG database;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup> referred to perturbation-attributed pathways henceforth. We then performed an enrichment analysis to define whether they are more up- or down-regulated with a two-step inference approach (see Methods and Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). This gives insights into how well expected pathways and their regulatory direction are captured by CARNIVAL. As all 20 perturbations which were investigated have activatory effects, we expect significant enrichments in the up-regulated direction.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><title>CARNIVAL pipeline.</title><p>The CARNIVAL pipeline requires as input a prior knowledge network and differential gene expression. The information on perturbed targets and their effects can be assigned (Standard CARNIVAL “StdCARNIVAL”) or omitted (InvCARNIVAL). The differential gene expression is used to infer transcription factor (TF) activities with DoRothEA, which are subsequently discretized in order to formulate ILPconstraints. As a result, CARNIVAL derives a family of highest scoring networks which best explain theinferred TF activities. Continuous pathway and TF activities can be additionally considered in the objective function</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="41540_2019_118_Fig1_HTML" id="d29e377"/></fig></p>

      <title>Incorporation of predicted TF and pathway activities</title>
      <p id="Par11">The normalized enrichment scores (NESs) from DoRothEA were used as an estimate for the degree of dysregulation (see Methods). In comparison to the results from Melas et al.’s pipeline without the integration of TF weights, the results from StdCARNIVAL showed that significant enrichment of the perturbation-attributed pathway set in up-regulated pathways is only achieved for IL1-β (IL1B) and TGF-ɑ (TGFA) with the introduction of TF weights (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>). In InvCARNIVAL, where the targets of perturbations are not known, the results with pathway weights from PROGENy showed a significant enrichment of perturbation-attributed pathways in up-regulated pathways for PDGF-β (PDGFB), IL1-β, EGF, TGF-ɑ, and flagellin while only TGF-ɑ and FSL1 were significant without pathway weights (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref>). TGF-ɑ was more enriched in activated than in inhibited pathways with pathway weights but this trend was inverse for IGF2 and AREG. While this implementation could not capture all expected changes, PROGENy weight still provides an overall improvement in detecting more dysregulated pathways in the up-regulated direction (5 versus 2). Given that improved performance was found with the implementation of TF and pathway weights, these were implemented in our subsequent benchmarking.</p>
      <p id="Par12">To illustrate the values of the CARNIVAL pipeline with respect to the ones of DoRothEA and PROGENy, we compared CARNIVAL enrichment results to the ones generated solely from either DoRothEA or PROGENy. Results show good agreement to the ones of StdCARNIVAL but it should be noted that positive results are not always confirmed by both methods (Supplementary Text S<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref>).</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="Sec5">
      <title>Comparison of StdCARNIVAL, InvCARNIVAL, GSEA, and CausalR</title>
      <p id="Par13">To benchmark CARNIVAL results against related tools, we applied the two-step inference approach also on their results and made comparisons. As an overview, the perturbations of the significant up-regulated sets found in InvCARNIVAL (PDGF-β, IL1-β, EGF, TGF-ɑ, and flagellin) were also identified in StdCARNIVAL (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>; Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S3</xref>). In contrast, NTF3 and FSL1 only showed a significant enrichment of the up-regulated gene sets in StdCARNIVAL. This suggests that a wider coverage of pathways can be detected by StdCARNIVAL, where the perturbation target is known. The same number of enrichment of activated pathways in the perturbation-attributed pathways (up-regulated) captured with InvCARNIVAL is slightly higher than the one with pathway inference from differential gene expression directly (<italic>n</italic> = 5 versus <italic>n</italic> = 4). TGF-ɑ and IL1-β were captured with both approaches, while IFN-γ (IFNG) and TNF-ɑ (TNFA) were only significantly enriched in activated pathways inferred by GSEA, and IL1-β, PDGF-β, and EGF by InvCARNIVAL. However, the trend of clear directionality, i.e. significant in the up-regulated gene sets and insignificant in the down-regulated gene sets, was only captured with InvCARNIVAL. CausalR captured a significant enrichment of activated pathways in the perturbation-attributed pathway set for IFN-γ, IL1-β, and TNF-ɑ, showing an equal performance to InvCARNIVAL in terms of detecting non-ambiguous directionality but still captured less numbers of up-regulated pathways than GSEA and Std/InvCARNIVAL (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><title>Two-step inference analysis to determine whether relevant molecular processes were identified in CARNIVAL.</title><p>First, dysregulated pathways were inferred by over-representation of the nodes in CARNIVAL solution networks based on the KEGG pathway sets in MSigDB. In the second step, an enrichment analysis was performed on the identified dysregulated pathways using stimulus specific pathways as prior set. The distributions of <italic>p</italic>-values from multiple statistical tests are reported as final result. A significant enrichment of the attributed pathways in the direction that the target protein is perturbed is expected</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="41540_2019_118_Fig2_HTML" id="d29e428"/></fig></p>
      <p id="Par14">We then compared the network topology of the CARNIVAL versus CausalR networks. We found a bias towards hub nodes for CausalR but not for CARNIVAL. The degree distribution of edges in CARNIVAL was very similar to the one of the PKN, see Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S4</xref>. This trend was not affected by different beta parameters in (0.03; 0.1; 0.3; 0.5; 0.8) (result not shown).</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="Sec6">
      <title>Inferring signaling networks in IgAN</title>
      <p id="Par15">We applied CARNIVAL to identify the regulatory signaling network that governs the pathophysiological mechanism of IgAN. It is known from the literature that the pathogenic IgA-containing immune complexes trigger the activation of inflammation and fibrosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup> but the dysregulation at the molecular level is yet to be elucidated. Further improvement in early diagnosis and treatment of IgAN are still needed and can only be achieved by a better understanding of the disease’s mechanisms to design appropriate treatments.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="Sec7">
      <title>InvCARNIVAL results</title>
      <p id="Par16">In this study, we generated the causal networks from the differential gene expression in glomeruli between groups of healthy subjects versus IgAN patients. Given that the node penalty did not affect the performance but might result in minor fluctuations, this analysis was performed with different node penalties to achieve more robust results (β in (0.03; 0.1; 0.3; 0.5; 0.8), see Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> for β = 0.8 and Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S5</xref> for all betas). Given that the adherens junction set is the most dysregulated one, the set members are highlighted in the network. Thereby, only one transcription factor (TCF7) inferred by DoRothEA is represented in this gene set, while 13 associated nodes and four input nodes are solely inferred by causal reasoning with CARNIVAL. Hence, CARNIVAL was able to capture more pathway members and their connections than through TF-regulons alone.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><title>Comparison of the enrichment results of the perturbation-attributed pathway set in dysregulated pathways inferred with different tools.</title><p>An enrichment of the perturbation-attributed pathway set among the significant pathways was determined. The significance level of 0.05 is indicated by the dotted lines. Asterisks (*) indicate the clear directionality of results where the enrichment results are significant in the up-regulated set and insignificant in the down-regulated set</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="41540_2019_118_Fig3_HTML" id="d29e464"/></fig></p>
      <p id="Par17">In addition, we performed down-sampling and network randomization via re-shuffling of TF scores and labels to assess the robustness of CARNIVAL results for the IgAN datasets (see Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S6</xref>). We observed that the inferred node activities of CARNIVAL networks from ±70% down-sampling datasets is relatively similar to the true IgAN network inferred from the full dataset (Jaccard similarity measure: 0.448 ± 0.051 [mean ± S.D.]). In contrast, a major difference was observed when compared the true IgAN network with the randomized networks from the re-shuffling dataset (Jaccard similarity measure: 0.065 ± 0.032 [mean ± S.D.]). These results suggest that CARNIVAL provides robust results significantly different from random networks (<italic>p</italic>-value &lt; 0.001).</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="Sec8">
      <title>Topological analyses and text-mining results of CARNIVAL networks</title>
      <p id="Par18">To identify the central regulatory nodes in the IgAN inferred networks, network’s properties of the results generated from different node penalties parameters were extracted. These measures include in-, out-, and all-degree of interactions as well as betweenness, hub-scor,e and authority-score of nodes in the networks (see Methods). The Top-20 results in each category are shown in Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S3</xref> and the robustness of results are shown in Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S7</xref>. Of note, signaling molecules which are related to p53 pathway and cell cycle regulation including CDK1, ATM, and TP53 appeared frequently in the top list. In addition, the ERK/MAPK pathway represented by MAPK1 (ERK-2) and MAPK3 (ERK-1) was shown to have high-degree of connectivity where MAPK3 has a very high hub-score. The distributions of network topology measures for these nodes from the IgAN networks are statistically different comparing to the ones from randomized PKNs with the same degree distribution (average <italic>p</italic>-value = 0.0135). This suggests that central nodes in the IgAN network are not necessarily the existing hub nodes in the PKN. In addition, TP53 is the highest scoring node in randomized networks while MAPK1 and MAPK3 are often found to rank higher in the IgAN network. Note that a similar finding was observed for GSK-3β (GSK3B), highlighting the potential involvement of PI3K/Akt pathway (together with AKT1) as well as Wnt pathway in the molecular pathogenesis of IgAN.</p>
      <p id="Par19">Besides topological analyses, we systematically searched in the literature to identify whether the signaling proteins identified to be dysregulated in CARNIVAL have support for the roles in the pathophysiology of IgAN (see Methods and Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S4</xref>). We observed that the molecules in the MAPK pathway and PI3K/Akt pathways, which are previously supported by topological analysis, also have multiple hits (7 hits for MAPK1/MAPK3 and 3 hits for AKT1). On the other hand, we identified many molecules which are in the top list of network topology measures but with no hit on text-mining results. These include down-regulated MAPK14 in the p38 MAPK pathway, down-regulated GSK3B in the PI3K/Akt and Wnt pathways, and up-regulated CDK5 in the cell cycle circuit. Also, we identified RhoA (RHOA) and β-Catenin (CTNNB1) as the components in the TGF-β and Wnt pathways having a few literature support with 2 and 3 hits, respectively. These less or not characterized proteins are candidate players in IgAN, pending validation.</p>

The most significantly up- and down-regulated pathways were identified by median <italic>p</italic>-value over different node penalties (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>).

      <title>Fluorescence immunohistology detection of RhoA and β-catenin</title>
      <p id="Par22">The role of MAPK and PI3K/Akt signaling on IgAN’s pathophysiology have been described in previous studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup> We therefore focused on validating key components of the TGF-β and Wnt signaling pathways with less literature support and where CARNIVAL and GSEA provided inconclusive results. We chose RhoA (RHOA) and β-catenin (CTNNB1) for fluorescence immunostaining on human renal biopsies from healthy pre-transplantation (controls) and biopsies from diagnosed IgAN patients (see Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref> and Supplementary Text S<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5</xref>). Both RhoA and β-catenin genes were down-regulated comparing IgAN to control samples while the corresponding KEGG pathway enrichment scores showed a deregulation yet unclear direction. In contrast, CARNIVAL predicts that signaling activities are relatively increased for both when compared the ones from IgAN patients against healthy donors. Using immunohistology, mesangial IgA (green) was present in IgAN but absent in control specimens as expected for this condition (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6d–f</xref> and Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6a–c</xref>, respectively). RhoA (blue) and β-catenin (red) were present, albeit differentially expressed between IgAN and control. While the expression of RhoA (blue) was appreciable in all samples, IgA patients tend to have higher expression, in particular in the glomeruli (most prominent in Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6c</xref> versus Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6f</xref>). In comparison to healthy biopsies, we observed an increase in β-catenin staining in IgAN glomeruli, most likely in mesangial cells (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). Thus, the increase in β-catenin expression might be related to increased Wnt/β-catenin signaling in IgAN glomeruli and this might be related to the deposition of IgA.<fig id="Fig5"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption><title>Dysregulated cellular processes in IgAN.</title><p>Up- and down-regulated pathways are shown with decreasing median significance from top to bottom.

    <title>Discussion</title>
    <p id="Par23">In this paper, we present an open-source causal network contextualization tool, CARNIVAL. It seamlessly integrates the information from gene expression data with various types of prior biological knowledge (signaling networks, TF-targets, and pathway-footprints). CARNIVAL merges TF and pathway activities estimated from gene expression data with prior knowledge on the signaling network architecture to identify processes driving changes in gene expression which can be derived from microarray or RNAseq data (see an additional independent study using RNAseq data in Supplementary Text S<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6</xref>). The network inference process is swiftly performed with an ILP formulation of causal reasoning. Importantly, using the variant InvCARNIVAL, the origin of these changes (e.g. perturbation targets) do not need to be known to produce the contextualized networks.</p>
    <p id="Par24">According to our benchmarking study, the introduction of TF weights from DoRothEA improves the performance of StdCARNIVAL (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>). For InvCARNIVAL, a performance was improved with the additional introduction of pathway weights inferred from PROGENy (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref>), although the same advantage was not observed in StdCARNIVAL. This demonstrates that the pathway weights only guide the network search if a direction is not provided through a known perturbed target node.</p>
    <p id="Par25">The benchmarking results show that the InvCARNIVAL implementation with TF and pathway weights can obtain perturbation-attributed pathways with a comparable accuracy to StdCARNIVAL (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Therefore, we recommend to include the TF and pathway implementations as the default setting. Comparing to GSEA, perturbation-attributed pathways were more frequently identified with the correct direction. Additionally, a related method, CausalR, did not perform as well as InvCARNIVAL or GSEA in detecting up-regulated pathway sets and was biased towards hub nodes while CARNIVAL was not (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S4</xref>).</p>
    <p id="Par26">Given that CausalR also captured certain pathways with correct directionality that CARNIVAL missed, results from the two methods could be complementary to each other to ensure the highest coverage of the enriched signaling pathways. It should be noted though that combined results of the two methods at the network level does not increase the number of positive results (see Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S3</xref>). In addition, CARNIVAL offers additional information from its constituting tools (Supplementary Text S<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref>). We therefore propose to also perform functional analyses with DoRothEA and PROGENY along CARNIVAL to get a broader overview for further interpretation at multiple granularities.</p>
    <p id="Par27">In the application study in IgAN, besides standard enrichment analyses, quantitative measures from network topology analyses also pointed to the involvement of multiple signaling pathways in the pathophysiology of the disease including MAPK, neurotrophin, PI3K/Akt, cell cycle, Wnt, and TGF-β pathways. The first two pathways had already been well studied and validated.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup> In our study, we chose the latter two which have less literature support and have inconsistent results to GSEA for experimental validation. Wnt signaling was reported as a dysregulated process in CARNIVAL and is known to be involved in podocyte injury and renal fibrosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup> The IgAN network included representative mediators of the classical Wnt signaling pathway from the messenger WNT7A to the TFs TCF4 and TCF7, although it should be noted that not all of these are linked in the expected ways nor do all members show the expected activity. GSK3B, which is one of the components in the Wnt signaling pathway, also appears among the nodes with top network topology measure, highlighting the importance of this molecule as an important mediator in the signaling regulation of IgAN’s pathophysiology.</p>
    <p id="Par28">TGF-β signaling is a main driver of fibrosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup> CARNIVAL’s IgAN network captured all members of the TGF-β/RhoA pathway as up-regulated and linked through the biologically expected interactions. This includes the TGF-β receptors (TGFBR1 and TGFBR2), the ras homolog gene family member A (RHOA) and the Rho-associated protein kinase 2 (ROCK2). This is consistent with the previously reported upregulation of protein levels of TGF-β receptors and RhoA in IgAN<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup> and illustrates how CARNIVAL can identify highly relevant and specific processes and regulators from gene expression data. Our validation experiment shows that both β-catenin and RhoA are more expressed in IgAN compared to healthy controls, consistent with the involvement of these cells in the pathophysiology of the disease. This was not captured via differential expression analysis at the individual gene level and the results were inconclusive via GSEA at the pathway scale (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>). β-catenin and Wnt signaling are studied as drug targets for different cancers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup> They have been proposed as a potential target for chronic kidney.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup> There are multiple Wnt signaling small-molecule drugs that bind β-catenin.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup> Such drugs have not been tested in IgAN thus far. Given the pathological importance of the glomerulus in IgAN, the possible differential expression and signaling function of RhoA and Wnt/β-catenin needs to be investigated further. Other dysregulated signaling molecules identified by CARNIVAL, including MAPK14, GSK3B, and CDK5, are also interesting targets for further validation, as their role on the pathophysiology of IgAN is unknown.</p>
    <p id="Par29">Overall, we demonstrate the superior performance of CARNIVAL over existing methods in the benchmarking study and also its applicability to biomedical data in our IgAN case study. Many components in the pipeline are also customizable such as the optimization parameters and the number and selection method of TF inputs. It should be noted though that the benchmarking is performed at the cellular process level due to the limited information on protein activities (see Methods). Moreover, the two-step inference approach also has a few limitations: (1) not all attributed pathways in the KEGG database are represented in MSigDB nor equally relevant, (2) the majority of the KEGG gene sets for canonical pathways do not account for directionality, and (3) gene sets for the same process can be inconsistent in different databases while some are not directly associated with the perturbations. All of these factors could affect the benchmarking results across all methodologies being tested and resulting in lower yield of overall positive results. Further analyses should be performed to determine the generality of our findings.</p>
    <p id="Par30">Although we demonstrated that incorporating prior knowledge into the network inference can lead to a higher accuracy, the drawback is the inherent bias towards known biology. CARNIVAL only uses the known interactions as a scaffold and the contextualization of the network is data driven. Hence, it can still be applied to predict the status of proteins and their connections for specific contexts. Since CARNIVAL cannot propose de novo connections between signaling molecules, it could be combined with pure data-driven network inference approaches such as nested effect models (NEMs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup> in the future.</p>
    <p id="Par31">To conclude, we believe that, given the flexibility of the CARNIVAL pipeline, it can be a useful tool to infer context-specific signaling network architectures from gene expression in many studies.</p>

      <title>CARNIVAL pipeline</title>
      <p id="Par32">We introduce CARNIVAL, an ILP-based causal network contextualization tool with a high flexibility for data integration. CARNIVAL refines a quantitative objective function for ILP problem by incorporating TF and pathway activities on a continuous scale. In addition, the CARNIVAL framework allows us to contextualize the network with or without known targets of perturbations. The implementation is separated into two pipelines which will be referred henceforth as Standard CARNIVAL “StdCARNIVAL” (with known perturbation targets as an input) and Inverse CARNIVAL “InvCARNIVAL” (without information on targets of perturbation), see Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>.<fig id="Fig6"><label>Fig. 6</label><caption><title>Validation experiment.</title><p>IgA (green) beta-catenin (red) and RhoA (blue) staining was performed in human biopsies collected from either healthy pre-transplantation control donors(Con1-3; <bold>a</bold>–<bold>c</bold>) or diagnosed IgAN patients (IgAN1-3; <bold>d</bold>–<bold>f</bold>). 3 representative examples are shown and areas with glomeruli (G) and proximal tubules (T) are indicated.

      <p id="Par33">CARNIVAL is a major improvement and extension of the causal reasoning pipeline by Melas et al. which requires, besides a PKN, discretized differential gene expression, as well as the target(s) of perturbation as inputs. The InvCARNIVAL pipeline overcomes the latter requirement that restricts the original method’s applicability to only well-characterized perturbations. Also, CARNIVAL takes dysregulated TFs derived with DoRothEA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup> which summarizes their activities from the expression of their multiple targets into TF activities with continuous values. This step potentially helps us to reduce the noise from the discretization of individual differential expressed genes and also to reduce the number of measurements inputs which subsequently increase computational efficiency of the pipeline.</p>

    <sec id="Sec14">
      <title>CARNIVAL inputs and data pre-processing</title>
      <p id="Par34">CARNIVAL requires at least two inputs: a PKN consisting of causal protein interactions and a set of measurement inputs derived from gene expression data (either microarray or RNA-seq). The measurement inputs for CARNIVAL are flexible and can be quantitative measures from differentially expressed genes (e.g. log-fold-changes or <italic>t</italic>-values) or predicted TF activities. These measurement inputs are discretized to generate ILP constraints as in the original implementation of Melas et al. The actual continuous input values are used to weight and select causal links in the network. Optionally, predicted pathway activities in a continuous scale between −1 and 1 can also be integrated into CARNIVAL to refine the contextualized network solutions. Targets of perturbation can be provided if known but are not required.</p>
      <p id="Par35">As a PKN, we considered a signed and direct human signaling network retrieved from Omnipath. The network contains 9306 signed and directed edges connecting 3610 nodes pooled and curated from multiple resources including Signor, Reactome, and Wikipathways.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup> Alternative causal knowledge networks are also compatible with the CARNIVAL pipeline.</p>
      <p id="Par36">For TF activity prediction, we applied DoRothEA version 2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup> which provides a framework to estimate TF activity from the gene expression of its direct target genes. The provided regulon set was filtered to include only the 289 TF-regulons with at least ten TF-target gene interactions with medium to high confidence (confidence score A, B, and C as defined in<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>). Subsequently, the differential gene expression t-values processed by the <italic>limma</italic> R-package<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup> and the filtered DoRothEA regulon were passed to the viper function in the <italic>VIPER</italic> package<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup> to perform an analytic Rank-based Enrichment Analysis (aREA). The activities of each TF in the form of NES were then derived from the rank of the genes and the top 50 TF scores were used as the input in CARNIVAL by default. Though users can also select the desirable number of included TFs according to the study.</p>
      <p id="Par37">To predict pathway activity, we applied PROGENy, which calculates pathways scores of 14 major signaling pathways based on pathway footprint genes derived from perturbation-based experiments.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup> The 14 PROGENy pathway signatures were obtained from differential expression <italic>t</italic>-values using the <italic>limma</italic> package.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup> Based on an empirical null distribution generated through 10,000 times gene-wise permutation and the percentile corresponding to the observed value, the significance score (termed “score” henceforth, Eq. <xref rid="Equ1" ref-type="">1</xref>) was derived:<disp-formula id="Equ1"><label>1</label><alternatives><tex-math id="M1">\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

      <title>Two-step inference approach to KEGG pathways attribution</title>
      <p id="Par47">In our study, we assume that the inferred node activities from CARNIVAL represent upstream signaling and should hence map well with the KEGG pathways attributed to the corresponding perturbation. Hence, a two-step inference approach was developed for validation (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). In the first step, we assume that an over-representation of up-regulated CARNIVAL nodes indicates higher activity pathway and, conversely, down-representation represents down-regulation. Up- and down-regulated pathways were predicted with a hypergeometric test from the <italic>Category</italic> package in R on the dysregulated nodes inferred by CARNIVAL. The universe in this regard was set to all nodes present in the PKN derived from Omnipath and the curated KEGG pathway sets were obtained from MSigDB.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup> A significance test was only performed if at least one set member of the pathway was present in the given CARNIVAL node set.</p>
      <p id="Par48">In the second step, we assumed that the list of KEGG pathways attributed to the perturbation should be up-regulated upon perturbation while others are not. We then check if the pathways identified with CARNIVAL fulfill this assumption (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Specifically, we evaluate if both the up- and down-regulated pathways with their FDR-adjusted <italic>p</italic>-values from the first step were enriched in the attributed pathways. Here, we applied the function <italic>runGSA</italic> with the <italic>stouffer, tailStrength, wilcoxon and reporter</italic> methods in the <italic>piano</italic> R-package.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup> The mean and standard deviation across the four methods of the resulting <italic>p</italic>-values were reported.

      <title>Network topological analyses and text mining</title>
      <p id="Par49">To identify central nodes with regulatory features, we computed quantitative measures from topological analyses of CARNIVAL networks and compare them to the ones derived from randomized networks. These measures were extracted using the functions <italic>degree, betweenness, hub_score and authority_score</italic> in the <italic>igraph</italic> R-package.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup> The average nodes’ activities over the range of size penalty parameter (β in (0.03; 0.1; 0.3; 0.5; 0.8)) in the CARNIVAL networks were applied as weights for the calculation of these topological analyses measures. The R-package <italic>BiRewire</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup> was applied to generate 100 randomized networks with preserved distributions of node degrees as well as interaction signs. Student’s <italic>t</italic> test was subsequently used to determine significant differences between the distributions of network topology measures from CARNIVAL networks versus the ones from randomized networks. To assess the “novelty” of genes identified in this analysis in the context of IgA nephropathy we queried PubMed Central using the approved gene symbol and approved gene name from the HUGO gene nomenclature committee database (genenames.org), together with the following keywords: “IgA nephropathy”, “IgAN”, “IgA glomerulonephritis” and “Berger’s disease”. All search terms were enclosed in quotations to ensure that terms were searched in full and retrieved abstracts were examined to exclude erroneous matches.</p>
