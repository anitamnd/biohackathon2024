    <abstract>
      <p>We describe a web and standalone Shiny app for calculating the common, linear within-individual association for repeated assessments of paired measures with multiple individuals: repeated measures correlation (rmcorr). This tool makes rmcorr more widely accessible, providing a graphical interface for performing and visualizing the output of analysis with rmcorr. In contrast to rmcorr, most widely used correlation techniques assume paired data are independent. Incorrectly analyzing repeated measures data as independent will likely produce misleading results. Using aggregation or separate models to address the issue of independence may obscure meaningful patterns and will also tend to reduce statistical power. rmcorrShiny (repeated measures correlation Shiny) provides a simple and accessible solution for computing the repeated measures correlation. It is available at: https://lmarusich.shinyapps.io/shiny_rmcorr/.</p>

    <title>Introduction</title>
    <p>The most common techniques for calculating the correlation between two variables (
<italic toggle="yes">e.g.,</italic> the Pearson correlation coefficient) assume that each pair of data points arises from an independent observation. Take, for example, a study that calculates the correlation between age and the volume of a specific brain region for a sample of people. In this example, each individual contributes a data point consisting of a brain volume and an age. However, it is not uncommon for studies to use repeated measures designs, such as a study by Raz
<italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>
<sup><xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> that collected the brain region volume and age at two different time points. Each participant in this study contributed two (repeated) data points of paired measures. Repeated measures of the same individual are no longer independent observations and should not be analyzed as such. Erroneously modeling repeated measures data as independent observations is surprisingly prevalent in published research, even though such results will generally be misleading.
<sup><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>-
<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> A common way to resolve this problem is to use aggregated data: first taking an average of the repeated measures data of each person so that every individual again contributes a single paired data point, and then calculating the correlation from these averages (between-participants). Another possibility is to use separate models to analyze each paired data point, removing the dependency. For example, the study by Raz
<italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>
<sup><xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> computed separate correlations between brain region volume and age at each of the two time points.</p>
    <p>Instead of aggregation or separate models, an alternative solution is to calculate the repeated measures correlation,
<sup><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>-
<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> which assesses the common intra-individual (within-participants) association for paired repeated measures data. The repeated measures correlation technique is conceptually similar to a null multilevel model, with a common (fixed effect) slope but varying (random effect) intercept for each individual. It is calculated using a form of ANCOVA, and thus shares the same statistical assumptions as ANCOVA, with the exception of independence of errors. Using the repeated measures correlation has multiple potential benefits. It is simpler and more straightforward to implement than a multilevel model, with the potential for much greater statistical power than aggregation. In addition, repeated measures correlation can provide insights into patterns within individuals that may be obscured by aggregation or use of separate models (see, for example, the use case described below and illustrated in
<xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>).
<sup><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>
</p>
    <p>We previously developed the rmcorr package
<sup><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> in R
<sup><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> to make the repeated measures correlation technique widely available for researchers; it has since also been adapted as a function in the Pingouin statistics package
<sup><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> for Python. However, the use of both of these packages requires some facility with programming languages, which may limit accessibility.</p>

    <sec id="sec3">
      <title>Implementation</title>
      <p>Here we introduce rmcorrShiny, a Shiny
<sup><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> app, which provides an intuitive graphical interface for computing and plotting the repeated measures correlation. An example of the interface is shown in
<xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>.</p>
      <fig position="anchor" fig-type="figure" id="f1">
        <label>Figure 1. </label>

        </caption>
        <graphic xlink:href="f1000research-10-78432-g0000" position="float"/>
      </fig>
      <p>The interface consists of two panels, corresponding roughly to input (left) and output (right), with each containing multiple subpanels or tabs. The left panel has tabs for
<bold>Input</bold>: uploading data or using sample data,
<bold>Data Options</bold>: selecting variables for analysis, and
<bold>Plot Options</bold>: customizing labels and plot appearance. The right panel has tabs for
<bold>Results</bold>: statistical output from rmcorr,
<bold>Plot</bold>: corresponding visualization of the rmcorr results,
<bold>R code</bold>: the custom R code generating the analysis and plot for the selected data/options,
<bold>Processed Data</bold>: summary statistics on data and raw viewer,
<bold>Download</bold>: buttons to download the plot and generated R code, and
<bold>About</bold>: information about the app.</p>
      <p>The primary features of rmcorrShiny include:

</p>

    <title>Use case</title>
    <p>As a use case, we use rmcorrShiny to compute and plot the repeated measures correlation of
<italic toggle="yes">raz2005</italic>
<sup><xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>, one of the four included sample datasets. The right panel of
<xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref> shows the rmcorr plot for this data. Because a variety of patterns in data can produce similar or even identical statistical results for rmcorr, as well as other models, we highly recommend visualization to aid in interpreting results. In
<xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>, the x-axis is age and the y-axis is volume of a brain area, the cerebellar hemisphere. Each participant, plotted in a different color, contributes two paired data points representing two assessments of age and brain volume. Paired age and brain volume were measured twice per participant about five years apart. The corresponding lines depict the repeated measures correlation model. Note the large negative slope and close fit of the lines to many of the data points. This shows a strong pattern of a common decrease in the volume of this brain area over time, across different ages. The lower left corner of the plot shows the effect size for rmcorr and its
<italic toggle="yes">p</italic>-value.</p>

    <p>As mentioned previously, the pattern of results may vary, depending on whether the analysis is within- or between-individuals.
<sup><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,
<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> This can be observed in the current example; when the
<italic toggle="yes">raz2005</italic> dataset is analyzed using aggregation or separate models (between-individual analyses), the magnitude of the negative association is diminished in comparison to rmcorr (within-individual analysis; see Figure 5 in Bakdash &amp; Marusich
<sup><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>).</p>
  </sec>
  <sec id="sec6">
    <title>Limitations</title>
    <p>rmcorrShiny has the advantage of making the useful and already fairly simple-to-use rmcorr technique even more accessible and easy to implement and interpret. However, its limitations are the same as rmcorr’s: it does not have all of the capabilities of multilevel modeling and thus it is not a replacement. We recommend using multilevel modeling if: there are more than two outcome variables and/or predictors of interest, data have more than two levels (e.g., academic performance for students [Level 1] nested within classrooms [Level 2] nested within schools [Level 3]), simultaneous modeling of within- and between-participants is needed, visual patterns suggest varying slopes by individual and/or non-linear associations, or time needs to be explicitly included in the model (
<italic toggle="yes">i.e.</italic>, modeling change over time as a separate variable; note in
<xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref> age is a measure of time, but it is not a separate variable). For more information about multilevel modeling, see Aarts
<italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>.

<bold>About</bold> tab in rmcorrShiny.</p>
    <p>When running the app in the browser, users are limited to a maximum file size of 30 MB when uploading data. However, when running the app locally it should be possible to load larger files.</p>

    <title>Conclusion</title>
    <p>This paper demonstrates the rmcorrShiny app for graphing and analyzing paired, repeated measures data without requiring programming knowledge. By increasing the accessibility of the rmcorr technique, we aim to bolster the researcher's toolbox by providing a simple but powerful tool for examining associations present at the within-subject level in a way that does not violate independence assumptions or require use of separate models or data aggregation. In particular, this app may be useful for visualization and analysis of a common linear pattern across participants and could be an informative precursor complementing multilevel modeling.</p>

    <p>The authors present an online (and open source), user-friendly and very complete software tool within the R Shiny framework to infer the linear within-individual correlation for repeated observations within multiple individuals for two outcomes. The R shiny app is based on the previously developed R package rmcorr published on CRAN, making both analyses using rmcorr and data visualization accessible to an audience not comfortable with R. The manuscript provides a concise and clear rationalization for the development of the software tool, explaining why dependency due to repeated observations needs to be accommodated in the used analysis method. We especially enjoyed the clear and aesthetically pleasing graphs making use of ggplot2 provided with the app, and the numerous customization options for the graphs: from more basic matters like specifying the titles of the axes to even allowing the user to specify the color palette. Also, the code provided in the R Code tab is potentially very helpful and insightful to users wanting to become more acquainted with doing these analyses in R or wanting to slightly modify some steps of the analysis or visualization. The fact that multiple sample datasets are available within the tool is also a big plus. In conclusion, the app is a very nice resource valuable to a wide audience. It's a tool we will recommend to applied researchers analyzing dependent data and we look forward to use it for teaching purposes.  </p>
    <p> We have some minor suggestions that might help to further improve the tool and the utility for other researchers:
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>It is unclear what happens when the data includes missing observations. Will these cases be ignored using listwise deletion? It would be nice if the authors could provide a small comment on this in the manuscript.</p></list-item><list-item><p>We can imagine that for some users it might be very useful and insightful if the app includes a tab that provides (visual) information on whether the statistical assumptions of the analysis method are met. It would be a very nice addition to an already very complete app.</p></list-item><list-item><p>When trying out the app, an error was produced on the max upload size (the app did work when using a different dataset of a smaller size), if there is a restriction on the maximum size for used datasets it would be nice if a mention of this could be included in the manuscript.</p></list-item></list>

    <p>The authors outline the development of a user-friendly software tool ('rmcorrShiny') for running repeated-measures correlation (rmcorr) analysis without the need for any prior programming knowledge. The paper provides a compelling rationale for the development of this novel tool and all materials are shared in an open and transparent way. I believe this has the potential to be a highly useful resource for researchers across a variety of disciplines. I particularly enjoyed the seamless integration with ggplot2 in R to provide detailed and aesthetically-pleasing visualizations of the rmcorr data, which can be very easily created and modified by the user. I also liked the 'reportable results' section of the app, which I believe novice users will find especially useful. Overall, I believe this is an excellent resource that I look forward to using myself and have no doubt others will follow suit.</p>
    <p> I just have a few minor suggestions that I hope will help to promote the utility of this tool for researchers:
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>As mentioned above, I found the shiny app extremely intuitive and straight-forward to use. To test it with some of my own data, I uploaded two data sets. First, I uploaded a dataset from my own previous study for which I had run rmcorr analysis to see if the plots/findings would replicate on the app. I am pleased to report that all of the values provided in the 'results' section on the app were consistent with my own previous analyses, and the plot looked great! To test the app once more, this time I fabricated a dataset in excel (5 repeated measures, two variables, 10 subjects) and tried to plot/analyze the data once again using the app. The 'Results', 'Processed data', and 'R Code' sections all looked fine and appeared similar in format to both the previous analysis and the sample data provided on the app (the columns in the .csv file were correctly identified as variables, etc.). However, the plot tab did not appear to work on this occasion - I received the following error message; 'Error: an error has occurred. Check your logs or contact the app author for clarification'. I'm sure there will be a very simple fix, but I just wanted to flag this in case of a bug. Please feel free contact me if you would like me to share the specific datasets so that you can try to replicate the issue yourselves.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Introduction, paragraph 2: When describing the benefits of rmcorr in the Introduction, I wonder if it might be worth providing a more concrete example to highlight when this approach may be particularly useful - e.g., as a way to assess changes over time between two adjacent measures. A more concrete example might help to really drive home this point for interested readers. For example, researchers are often interested in examining to what extent changes over time in one measure (e.g., self-report) mirror changes over time in another measure (e.g., physiological). While data aggregation would collapse over (and thus ignore) this kind of association, rmcorr provides a powerful way to assess within-subject change between these paired measures.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Limitations, line 4: I just had to re-read this sentence a few times. I wonder if changing this to 'if there are more than two 
<italic toggle="yes">outcome</italic> variables of interest' would help to clarify this point (instead of what is currently in brackets)?</p></list-item><list-item><p>Limitations, line 4: I wonder if it would be helpful to clarify what you mean by 'data with more than two levels', with an example perhaps? I guess I'm just wondering if data collected at two separate time points constitutes two levels in this context (I'm guessing not, but I think it might just be useful to clarify).</p></list-item><list-item><p>Conclusions, lines 2-5: I found the first sentence of this paragraph ('we aim to increase analyses of patterns within-participants') a little tricky to parse. As a possible alternative that I hope does not misinterpret the point you are trying to make (if so, please feel free to ignore), how about something like: 'we aim to bolster the researcher’s toolbox by providing a simple but powerful tool for examining associations present at the within-subject level in a way that does not violate independence assumptions or require use of separate models or data aggregation'.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Conclusions, line 6: 'an' informative precursor.</p></list-item></list>
