      <title>Summary</title>
      <p>Macrophages are strongly adapted to their tissue of residence. Yet, little is known about the cell-cell interactions that imprint the tissue-specific identities of macrophages in their respective niches. Using conditional depletion of liver Kupffer cells, we traced the developmental stages of monocytes differentiating into Kupffer cells and mapped the cellular interactions imprinting the Kupffer cell identity. Kupffer cell loss induced tumor necrosis factor (TNF)- and interleukin-1 (IL-1) receptor-dependent activation of stellate cells and endothelial cells, resulting in the transient production of chemokines and adhesion molecules orchestrating monocyte engraftment. Engrafted circulating monocytes transmigrated into the perisinusoidal space and acquired the liver-associated transcription factors inhibitor of DNA 3 (ID3) and liver X receptor-α (LXR-α). Coordinated interactions with hepatocytes induced ID3 expression, whereas endothelial cells and stellate cells induced LXR-α via a synergistic NOTCH-BMP pathway. This study shows that the Kupffer cell niche is composed of stellate cells, hepatocytes, and endothelial cells that together imprint the liver-specific macrophage identity.</p>

    <title>Introduction</title>
    <p id="p0030">Macrophages were first identified in the late 19th century by Elie Metchnikoff because of their participation in host defense through phagocytosis (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Metchnikoff, 1892</xref>). It is now clear that macrophages also perform unique tissue-specific functions that are not related to host defense but essential for tissue homeostasis, such as electrical conduction in the heart, synaptic pruning in the brain, or alveolar surfactant clearance in the lung (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Hulsmans et al., 2017</xref>, <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Paolicelli et al., 2011</xref>, <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Trapnell et al., 2003</xref>, <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">van de Laar et al., 2016</xref>). These functions are thought to be performed by tissue-specific gene modules controlled by specific transcription factors imprinted by their microenvironment (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Lavin et al., 2014</xref>, <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Okabe and Medzhitov, 2016</xref>, <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">T’Jonck et al., 2018</xref>). Little is known about the cell-cell interactions underlying the tissue-specific imprinting of macrophages.</p>
    <p id="p0035">We have recently shown that depletion of liver-resident macrophages, known as Kupffer cells (KCs), induces their repopulation by bone marrow (BM) monocytes yielding monocyte-derived KCs that are genetically and functionally nearly identical to their embryonic counterparts (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Scott et al., 2016</xref>). Furthermore, recent studies have highlighted the central role of the transcription factors LXR-α and ID3 in the control of the KC-specific identity given that genetic deletion of <italic>Id3</italic> or <italic>Nr1h3</italic> (encoding LXR-α) induces the loss of KC identity and compromises KC survival (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Mass et al., 2016</xref>, <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Scott et al., 2018</xref>). However, the cellular and molecular interactions imprinting the expression of LXR-α and ID3 in KCs are unknown.</p>
    <p id="p0040">In this study, we utilized a KC-specific depletion model to decipher the signals driving monocyte recruitment, engraftment, and acquisition of the KC-associated transcription factors and identify the differential contributions of stellate cells, endothelial cells, and hepatocytes to the KC niche.</p>

      <p id="p0045">Clec4F is a lectin specifically expressed by Kupffer cells (KCs) (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Scott et al., 2016</xref>). Using <italic>Clec4f</italic><sup>DTR/+</sup> mice, we had previously shown that Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> monocytes can act as KC precursors (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Scott et al., 2016</xref>). We crossed these mice to <italic>Ccr2</italic><sup>GFP/+</sup> mice to temporarily fate-map the green fluorescent protein (GFP)-expressing monocytes differentiating into monocyte-derived KCs (mo-KCs) and evaluate their relative contribution to the mo-KC pool (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Satpathy et al., 2013</xref>, <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Serbina and Pamer, 2006</xref>). Diphtheria toxin (DT) injection induced a rapid disappearance of KCs without affecting liver capsule macrophages and a strong recruitment of Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> monocytes in the liver (12 h DT) that gradually lost Ly6C and acquired both F4/80 and Clec4F (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1</xref>A and <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref>A–S1C; <xref rid="mmc2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Video S1</xref>). At day 2 after KC loss, F4/80<sup>+</sup> mo-KCs uniformly expressed GFP as highly as Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> monocytes, and from day 3 the GFP was gradually decreased, consistent with the downregulation of <italic>Ccr2</italic> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1</xref>A, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>B, and <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref>C). We also observed a rapid increase of the mo-KC population between day 2 and day 6 after KC depletion (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>C). Transcriptome analysis of mo-KCs at day 3 compared with days 1 and 7 showed that the top 30 of upregulated genes were related to cell cycle, indicating that mo-KCs were undergoing proliferation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>D). We next evaluated their proliferation rate by measuring 5-Ethyl-2′-deoxyuridine (EdU) incorporation and KI-67 staining. Mo-KCs showed a proliferation phase with a peak 3 days after depletion (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1</xref>E, 1F, and <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref>C). This proliferation phase was dependent on colony-stimulating factor 1 (CSF1) receptor (CSF1R) signaling as injection of PLX3397 (an inhibitor of CSF1R) blocked mo-KC proliferation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>G) (<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Yan et al., 2017</xref>).<fig id="fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Replenishment of KC Pool by Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> Monocytes</p><p>(A and B) Expression of GFP, Ly6C, and F4/80 of monocytes (green gate), em-KCs (black gate), and mo-KCs (red gate) after DT injection in (A) <italic>Clec4f</italic><sup>DTR/+</sup>-<italic>Ccr2</italic><sup>GFP/+</sup> mice or (B) <italic>Clec4f</italic><sup>DTR/+</sup>-<italic>Ccr2</italic><sup>GFP/GFP</sup> mice.

      <p id="p0055">We further investigated the replenishment of the KC population in mice lacking <italic>Ccr2</italic>, which have a reduced pool of circulating Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> monocytes (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Serbina and Pamer, 2006</xref>). Consequently, 2 days after DT injection <italic>Ccr2</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice had 4 times less mo-KCs than their heterozygous counterparts (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1</xref>A–1C). Note that the remaining mo-KCs were GFP<sup>hi</sup> confirming that they were still exclusively derived from the few circulating Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> monocytes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>B). Nonetheless, at day 6 these mice showed a restored mo-KC population because of a more intense and prolonged proliferation phase than their heterozygous counterparts (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1</xref>E and 1F).</p>
      <p id="p0060">Altogether, these results indicate that the replenishment of the KC pool involves a transient recruitment of monocytes within 12 h after KC depletion, followed by their differentiation into F4/80<sup>+</sup> mo-KCs within 48 h and their subsequent CSF1R-dependent proliferation until the population reaches the steady-state KC density by day 6 after depletion. This engraftment and proliferation phase occurred over the whole liver parenchyma and was not restricted to a particular hepatic zone (<xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S1</xref>C). The diminished recruitment of monocytes observed in the <italic>Ccr2</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice does not lead to the recruitment of other precursors but is compensated by increased proliferation of the engrafted monocytes.</p>

      <title>Acquisition of the KC Identity Begins within Hours after Liver Engraftment</title>
      <p id="p0065">To better understand the signals inducing the engraftment and differentiation of monocytes into KCs, we first set out to precisely define the time frame of these events. We performed a transcriptome analysis on bone marrow (BM) monocytes and mo-KCs 1, 3, 7, 15, and 30 days after KC depletion. Monocytes engrafted within 24 h already lost classical monocyte genes and upregulated general macrophage genes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>B). We next investigated the expression of KC-associated transcription factors, defined through the comparison of KCs with multiple tissue-resident macrophages obtained from the Immgen Consortium (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Gautier et al., 2012</xref>, <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Heng et al., 2008</xref>). This revealed that KC-associated transcription factors were already highly expressed in monocytes 24 h after DT injection (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>C). Expression of the KC-core genes (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Scott et al., 2018</xref>) rapidly increased in the following days (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>D). However, this differentiation process could be influenced by the DTR model and might not reflect the KC development occurring during the embryogenesis. Transcriptome analysis comparison of developing embryonic-derived liver macrophages and developing mo-KCs showed similar acquisition kinetics of KC-associated transcription factors and KC-core genes during both embryogenesis and the DT repopulation model (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2</xref>A, 2C, and 2D).</p>
      <p id="p0070">We next sought to investigate the precise time of engraftment of monocytes by intravital two-photon imaging. We crossed <italic>Clec4f</italic><sup>DTR/+</sup>-<italic>Ccr2</italic><sup>GFP/+</sup> mice with <italic>Clec4f</italic><sup>Cre/+</sup>-<italic>Rosa26</italic><sup>TdT/+</sup> mice to simultaneously visualize GFP<sup>hi</sup> monocytes and TdT<sup>hi</sup> KCs in live imaging during KC depletion. At steady-state, monocytes were circulating in blood sinusoids with an average speed of 8 μm/min and a confinement index of 0.61 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>E; <xref rid="mmc3" ref-type="supplementary-material">Video S2</xref>). KC depletion induced a rapid change of monocyte behavior with a decrease of both the average speed and the confinement index (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>; <xref rid="mmc4" ref-type="supplementary-material">Video S3</xref>). Twenty-four hours after KC loss, many monocytes were arrested and had adopted an elongated shape with big processes, resembling KC morphology (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>E; <xref rid="mmc5" ref-type="supplementary-material">Video S4</xref>). Size increase was confirmed by confocal analysis (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>F). However, both two-photon and confocal microscopy showed that a fraction of monocytes remained round and did not arrest in the liver (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2</xref>E and 2F). We data-mined our transcriptome data of monocytes developing into KCs and searched by genes coding for surface markers that would rapidly be upregulated by mo-KCs. We found that both <italic>Itgax</italic> (coding for CD11c) and major histocompatibility complex II (MHCII)-related genes (<italic>Cd74</italic>, <italic>H2-DMa</italic>, <italic>H2-Aa</italic>, and <italic>H2-Ab1</italic>) were expressed in monocytes recruited to the liver 24 h after DT injection (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>B). We therefore analyzed the expression of CD11c and MHCII during mo-KC differentiation. At steady-state, monocytes were CD11c<sup>−</sup>MHCII<sup>−</sup> whereas KCs were CD11c<sup>lo</sup>MHCII<sup>hi</sup> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>G). Twenty-four hours after depletion, a proportion of monocytes were CD11c<sup>hi</sup>MHCII<sup>hi</sup> whereas the residual cells remained CD11c<sup>lo</sup>MHCII<sup>lo</sup>, confirming the concomitant presence of two monocyte populations in the liver at that time (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>G). In accordance with the transcriptome profile, MHCII remained stable over time on mo-KCs whereas CD11c was gradually downregulated from day 3 onward to reach the steady-state KC expression at 6 day (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2</xref>A and 2G). Confocal microscopy revealed that MHCII<sup>hi</sup> monocytes were corresponding to the elongated engrafted population whereas MHCII<sup>−</sup> monocytes were smaller circulating monocytes with a round shape (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>F). Furthermore, qRT-PCR revealed that 24 h after depletion the engrafted CD11c<sup>hi</sup>MHCII<sup>hi</sup> monocytes had upregulated KC-associated transcription factors, whereas CD11c<sup>−</sup>MHCII<sup>−</sup> monocytes had not (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>H).</p>

      <p id="p0095">The intravital microscopy revealed that the monocytes that had arrested in one specific spot (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>A, panels 1–6) began to extend processes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>A, panels 7–11). Confocal microscopy showed that these processes extended across the endothelial vessel wall to reach the liver parenchyma (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>B, panel 1). To identify the cellular target of these processes, we switched to correlative light-electron microscopy (CLEM), a method that allows to overlay fluorescence microscopy data with high resolution electron microscopy (EM) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>B, panel 2; <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S2</xref>A) (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Begemann and Galic, 2016</xref>).

Ingenuity pathway analysis performed on the DE genes indicated that HSCs and LSECs displayed strong signatures for granulocyte and agranulocyte adhesion and diapedesis (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4</xref>B and <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4</xref>B). HSCs showed a strong upregulation of genes involved in monocyte (<italic>Ccl2</italic>, <italic>Ccl7</italic>, <italic>Cxcl10</italic>, and <italic>Pf4</italic>) and neutrophil recruitment (<italic>Cxcl1</italic>, <italic>Cxcl5</italic>, and <italic>Pf4</italic>). Genes coding for adhesion molecules involved in the arrest and diapedesis of monocytes (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Gerhardt and Ley, 2015</xref>) were strongly upregulated by both HSCs (<italic>Vcam1</italic>, <italic>Sele</italic>, and <italic>Icam1</italic>) and LSECs (<italic>Vcam1</italic>, <italic>Sele</italic>, <italic>Icam1</italic>, and <italic>Selp</italic>) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>B). We next sought to validate this at the protein level. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) performed on serum from PBS- or DT-injected mice confirmed a transient increase of CCL2 reaching a peak 8 h after DT injection (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>C). Confocal microscopy detected a widely distributed pattern of CCL2 expression and identified HSCs as the main CCL2-producing cells 8 h after DT (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4</xref>D, arrows, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>E, and <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3</xref>E). We occasionally found a few CCL2-expressing LSECs (arrows) and monocytes (asterisks) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>D). We also confirmed the temporal nature of CCL2 expression because the chemokine was no longer detected 16 h after KC depletion (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>E). KC depletion also induced a transient increase of Selectin-E and VCAM-1 on both HSCs and LSECs from 8 h to 16 h after DT injection, reaching a peak at 10 h after DT (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4</xref>F and <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3</xref>F).<fig id="fig4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>HSCs and LSECs Induce Monocyte Recruitment and Engraftment in the Liver after Kupffer Depletion</p><p>(A) Principal component analysis of HSCs, LSECs, and hepatocytes at steady state, 12 h or 36 h after DT injection.</p><p>(B) Heatmap of genes involved in granulocyte and agranulocyte adhesion and diapedesis upregulated by HSCs and/or LSECs after KC depletion according to ingenuity pathway analysis.</p><p>(C) Analysis by ELISA of CCL2 concentration in the serum of mice after DT injection.

      <p id="p0125">Altogether, these results show that KC depletion transiently activates HSCs and LSECs. Activated HSCs produce monocyte-attracting chemokines, whereas both activated LSECs and activated HSCs upregulate receptors involved in adhesion and endothelial transmigration. Both chemokines and adhesion molecules are expressed for a restricted time period that coincides with the engraftment and transmigration of monocytes into the space of Disse observed by microscopy. This transient window probably explains why only a fraction of the recruited monocytes were able to engraft in the liver and why proliferation of these mo-KCs was subsequently required to completely repopulate the KC pool.</p>

      <title>HSC and LSEC Activation Are Mediated by IL-1 and TNF Released Mainly by Dying KCs</title>
      <p id="p0130">We next set out to identify the signals driving the activation of HSCs and LSECs upon KC loss. To do so, we used NicheNet, an algorithm that infers ligand-receptor interactions inducing gene expression variations by combining transcriptome data of interacting cells with existing knowledge on signaling and gene regulatory networks (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Browaeys and Saeys, 2019</xref>). We applied NicheNet to predict which ligand-receptor interactions could potentially induce the DE genes found in activated HSCs and LSECs (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>A). The top 5 predicted ligands were tumor necrosis factor (TNF), interleukin-1α (IL-1α) and IL-1β, interferon gamma (IFN-γ), and the apolipoprotein E. HSCs strongly expressed all TNF receptors, IL-1 receptor 1, and IFN-γ receptors, whereas LSECs expressed <italic>Tnfrsf1a</italic>, <italic>Ltbr</italic>, IFN-γ receptors, <italic>Ldlr</italic>, and <italic>Il1r1</italic> (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>A). On the basis of predicted upstream ligand activity and receptor expression, we hypothesized that TNF and/or IL-1 were responsible for HSC and LSEC activation. We thus blocked them by injecting a cocktail of anti-TNF antibodies and Anakinra, a recombinant antagonist protein preventing the binding of both IL-1α and IL-1β to the IL-1 receptor (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Cavalli and Dinarello, 2018</xref>). Confocal imaging and flow-cytometry analysis showed that CCL2 production by HSCs as well as Vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) and Selectin E upregulation by HSCs and LSECs were efficiently inhibited by the blocking cocktail (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5</xref>B, 5C, and <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5</xref>A). Consequently, anti-TNF and Anakinra treatment efficiently blocked the recruitment of monocytes to the liver, whereas injection of anti-TNF or Anakinra alone resulted in a partial block (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5</xref>D and 5E). As Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> monocytes engrafting in the liver could be identified by their CD11c<sup>hi</sup>MHCII<sup>hi</sup> expression, we evaluated the effect of anti-TNF and Anakinra treatment on their presence and found a significant reduction of CD11c<sup>hi</sup>MHCII<sup>hi</sup> monocytes in the liver (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5</xref>F and 5G). However, 6 days after KC loss, treated mice displayed the same proportion of KCs as isotype-injected or non-depleted mice (<xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S5</xref>B). We thus hypothesized that, as for <italic>Ccr2</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>F), the few engrafted monocytes proliferated more to compensate for the initial number reduction.

Potential HSC-derived ligands included <italic>Csf1</italic>, a cytokine involved in monocyte-to-macrophage differentiation as well as macrophage chemotaxis, survival, and proliferation.

Twenty-four hours after DT injection, CD11c<sup>hi</sup>MHCII<sup>hi</sup> monocytes showed significantly decreased expression of both <italic>Nr1h3</italic> and <italic>Spic,</italic> confirming the relevance of Notch signaling in the acquisition of KC-associated transcription factors <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figures 7</xref>F and <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">S7</xref>E).</p>
      <p id="p0170">Altogether these data identify the LSEC-derived DLL-Notch signal as a strong inducer of LXRα, SPIC, and the KC identity, which is further amplified by BMP signaling. The main source of BMP signal could be the BMP9 produced by HSCs.</p>

    <title>Discussion</title>
    <p id="p0175">Under homeostatic conditions, monocytes circulate in the liver sinusoids but do not contribute to the adult KC pool (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Hoeffel et al., 2015</xref>, <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Schulz et al., 2012</xref>, <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Scott et al., 2016</xref>, <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Yona et al., 2013</xref>). However, depletion of KCs induces a rapid recruitment of BM monocytes that engraft in the liver in one single wave, acquire the KC-specific genetic program, and gain the capacity to self-maintain in the liver without any subsequent contribution of BM monocytes (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Scott et al., 2016</xref>). KC death therefore seems to temporarily allow the engraftment and differentiation of monocytes into KCs, but the precise cellular and molecular events governing this process were unknown. Here, we used a broad set of microscopy techniques to track monocytes developing into KCs and identified the main cells interacting with monocytes during that process. Next, we performed transcriptomic profiling of these cells and utilized NicheNet to prioritize the potential molecular signals driving the repopulation of the KC niche and proceeded to experimentally test the strongest predictions.</p>
    <p id="p0180">We show that contrary to the general assumption, KC are not strictly located inside the blood vessels but always extend an important fraction of their cell body into the perisinusoidal space of Disse where they closely interact with HSCs and hepatocytes. The position of KCs in the space of Disse is functionally important. KCs have been shown to deliver iron they acquire from dying red blood cells to hepatocytes (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Theurl et al., 2016</xref>). Their position with part of their cell body on each side of the endothelium provides a probable explanation for the efficient uptake of aged red blood cells in the blood vessel and the efficient transfer of iron to hepatocytes. Anecdotally, Karl Wilhelm von Kupffer originally mixed-up KCs and HSCs. He first described stellar-shaped cells on the basis of gold chloride incorporation, which stains the retinol inside the HSCs. Later, he injected India ink or sheep red blood cells and identified phagocytic stellar-shaped cells, now known to be the KCs, and thought that both cells were one same cell that he called “Sternzellen.” Seeing the co-localization of these cells and their strong cell-cell interactions in the space of Disse it is now easy to understand where the confusion came from (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Von Kupffer, 1876</xref>, <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Wake, 2004</xref>).</p>
    <p id="p0185">The Medzhitov group recently proposed that fibroblasts and macrophages form a stable two-cell circuit in which the population density is controlled through exchange of growth factors. In these cultures, CSF1 is provided by fibroblasts and binds CSF1R on macrophages that in return produce PDGF, essential for fibroblast survival (<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Zhou et al., 2018</xref>). We found that under homeostatic conditions HSCs are the main cellular source of CSF1 and IL-34, the two primary macrophage growth factors. Furthermore, <italic>Pdgfc</italic> is gradually expressed during mo-KCs development. The HSC-KC interaction might thus represent the <italic>in vivo</italic> equivalent of the <italic>in vitro</italic> cell-cell circuit described by Zhou and colleagues. They also found that <italic>in vitro</italic> cultures starting at a 1:10 macrophage-fibroblast ratio triggered macrophage proliferation until a stable cell-cell ratio around 1:1 was obtained (<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Zhou et al., 2018</xref>). Here, we showed that monocyte engraftment was followed by a proliferation phase until the steady-state KC density was recovered. Lowering the starting mo-KC population by diminishing the number of available precursors (<italic>Ccr2</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice) or dampening the engraftment of monocytes (anti-TNF + Anakinra treatment) resulted in a prolonged proliferation phase but in the end yielded the same KC population density, thus fitting with a stable HSC-KC circuit that, on the basis of our microscopy, would also stabilize around a 1:1 ratio.</p>
    <p id="p0190">The engraftment of monocytes in the liver after KC depletion is transient in nature. This short window of opportunity for engraftment in the liver is explained by the transient TNF and IL-1-dependent activation of HSCs and LSECs that induces the brief expression of monocyte-attracting chemokines and adhesion molecules. We have recently hypothesized that macrophage precursors might compete for a restricted number of niches per organ and proposed niche accessibility and niche availability as the predominant factors determining the outcome of this competition (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Guilliams and Scott, 2017</xref>). Here, we generated maximal niche availability by complete depletion of the KC population. Nonetheless, only a fraction of the recruited monocytes engrafted in the liver and did so only in the first few hours after KC depletion. We feel this illustrates the importance of niche accessibility given that in this KC repopulation model the niche only temporarily “opens” when the molecules specialized in the recruitment, arrest, and transmigration of monocytes across the endothelial barrier are expressed.</p>
    <p id="p0195">Finally, we set out to unravel the signals driving the acquisition of the KC-specific identity by monocytes. It was previously shown that ID3 and LXR-α control an important part of the KC-specific identity (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Mass et al., 2016</xref>, <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Scott et al., 2018</xref>). We showed that these transcription factors are acquired by engrafted monocytes within 24 h after KC depletion. We report that the LSECs are the main niche cell inducing LXR-α expression in monocytes and demonstrate that DLL4-induced Notch activation lead to the rapid expression of LXR-α in monocytes as well as part of the KC identity. Importantly, <italic>in vivo</italic> blocking of Notch signaling dampened the expression of the transcription factors <italic>Nr1h3</italic> and <italic>Spic</italic> in recruited monocytes, confirming the role of Notch signaling in the acquisition of KC identity <italic>in vivo</italic>. Remarkably, it has recently been reported that DLL4 expression on LSECs is zonated, being highly expressed in the periportal region and lowly expressed around the central vein, therefore correlating with the location of KCs (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Halpern et al., 2018</xref>). NicheNet also highlighted an important overlap between predicted BMP- and Notch-target genes. We found that Notch signaling is needed to render the monocytes responsive to BMP activity, because BMPs alone did not induce the expression of any of the KC-associated genes, whereas the combination between Notch and BMP9 signaling synergized to induce high expression of <italic>Nr1h3</italic> and <italic>Nr1h3</italic>-dependent KC genes. However, HSCs and LSECs express many BMPs, so the <italic>in vivo</italic> relevance of the different BMPs in the imprinting of the KC identity remains to be determined. Finally, we showed that <italic>Id3</italic> expression is strongly induced in monocytes cultured with hepatocytes. The underlying molecular pathway driving ID3 expression by the hepatocytes still has to be determined, but the transmigration of the monocytes inside the perisinusoidal space of Disse might be crucial to bring the monocytes in close contact with hepatocytes and receive the signals imprinting ID3.</p>
    <p id="p0200">Altogether this study sheds light on the cell-cell interactions governing the engraftment and tissue-specific imprinting of monocytes differentiating into resident macrophages and emphasizes the differential roles of fibroblasts, endothelial cells, and parenchymal cells in this process. The localization of an important part of the KC body inside the space of Disse ensures the continuous close contact of KCs with these three cells. Death of KCs, in part through the release of TNF and IL-1, induces the activation of HSCs and LSECs, temporarily opening the KC niche for monocyte colonization and allowing their engraftment and transmigration into the space of Disse. Interaction with hepatocytes induces ID3, whereas interaction with LSECs induces LXR-α via the DLL4-Notch pathway. Moreover, we found that the HSC-associated BMP9 can synergize with Notch signaling to amplify the LXR-α-controlled KC-module. Although this remains to be determined, we believe these mechanisms will also play a role in monocyte engraftment during liver injury or infections. Finally, we hope this study will represent a blueprint for the study of cell-cell interactions in other macrophage niches across tissues and species.</p>

After retrograde cannulation, livers were first perfused with a EGTA-containing solution for 1–2 min following by a perfusion with 0,2 mg/mL collagenase A-containing solution for 5 min (6 mL/min). Livers were minced and incubated 20 min with 0,4 mg/mL Collagenase A and 10U/mL DNase in a water bath at 37°C. All the subsequent procedures were at 4°C. After filtration with a 100 μm mesh filter, the cell suspensions were centrifuged at 400 g for 7 min and re-suspended in 2 mL of red blood lysis buffer for 2 min to remove any red blood cells left. Suspensions were washed in PBS and further filtered on a 40 μm mesh filter and centrifuged twice for 1 min at 50 g resulting in an hepatocytes-enriched fraction (pellet) and a leukocytes/LSECs/HSCs-enriched fraction (supernatant). Both fractions were further centrifuged at 400 g for 7 min before to proceeding to FACS staining.</p>

        <title>Flow Cytometry</title>
        <p id="p0235">Cells (0.5–5x10<sup>6</sup>) were pre-incubated with 2.4G2 antibody (Bioceros) to block Fc receptors, stained with appropriate antibodies at 4°C in the dark for 30 min and permeabilized for KI-67 and EDU staining according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Click-iT Plus EdU, Thermo Fisher). Cell viability was assessed using Fixable Viability dye eFluor780 (Thermo Fisher) and the cell suspensions were analyzed with a Fortessa or a FACSymphony (BD Biosciences) and FlowJo software (TreeStar). Retinol fluorescence was visualized using a 405–407 nm laser for excitation and a 450/50 nm band-pass filter for detection. KCs/HSCs/LSECs/hepatocytes were sorted using an ARIA II or ARIA III (BD, Biosciences) with a purity ≥ 90% (not shown).

        <p id="p0275">NicheNet is a method that predicts which ligands produced by one cell regulate the expression of which target genes in another cell. Ligand-target links are inferred by combining bulk or single-cell expression data of interacting cells with existing knowledge on signaling and gene regulatory networks.</p>
        <p id="p0280">A first question NicheNet can address, is predicting which ligands produced by a sender cell are the most active in affecting gene expression in the receiver cell (i.e., ligand activity analysis). For this, NicheNet assesses how well these ligands predict the observed changes in gene expression and ranks them according to this. After ligand prioritization, NicheNet infers active ligand-target links by looking for genes that are affected in the receiver cell and have a high potential to be regulated by the prioritized ligands. An open source R implementation of NicheNet is available at GitHub (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/saeyslab/nichenetr" id="intref0380">https://github.com/saeyslab/nichenetr</ext-link>).</p>

          <p id="p0285">To perform NicheNet ligand activity analysis, we need to define a list of potentially active ligands and sets of affected and non-affected background genes in the receiving cell. NicheNet will then rank ligands according to how well they predict whether a gene belongs to the gene set of interest compared to the background gene set. As potentially active ligands for regulating respectively HSC or LSEC activation, we considered all ligands in the NicheNet model for which at least one specific receptor was expressed in respectively HSC or LSEC (average log2 expression value &gt; 4). Receptors of ligands were determined by querying the ligand-receptor data sources of NicheNet after excluding the data sources containing predicted ligand-receptor interactions. As target gene set, we considered the list of genes that are differentially expressed in respectively HSC or LSEC between steady-state and 12 h after KC depletion (adjusted p value ≤ 0.05 and |average log2 fold change| &gt; = 1; expressed in at least 10% KCs single cells). As background, we considered all other genes that are not differentially expressed. Ligand activity scores were then calculated both for the HSC and LSEC setting as the pearson correlation coefficient between the ligand-target regulatory potential scores of each selected ligand and the target indicator vector, which indicates whether a gene belongs to the gene set of interest or not. To make the activity scores of the HSC and LSEC settings comparable, z-score normalization of the pearson correlation coefficients was performed.</p>

We considered once HSC-specific, once LSEC-specific and once hepatocyte-specific ligands as potentially active ligands if at least one specific receptor was expressed in monocytes (average log2 expression value &gt; 6). Cell-type specific ligands were determined as ligands that are stronger expressed in the cell type of interest compared with both other cell types (log2 fold change &gt; 0.5 and adjusted p value ≤ 0.05 and average log2 expression value &gt; 4). Receptors of ligands were determined by querying the ligand-receptor data sources of NicheNet after excluding the data sources containing predicted ligand-receptor interactions. As target gene sets, we considered once the list of genes that are differentially expressed between monocytes and mo-KCs 3 days after KC depletion (adjusted p value ≤ 0.05; |log2 fold change| &gt; = 1; expressed in at least 10% of mature KC single cells) and once the list of the top 20 prioritized KC TFs. As background, we considered all other genes that are not differentially expressed. Ligand activity scores were then calculated both for the differentially expressed genes and KC TFs setting as the Pearson correlation coefficient between the ligand-target regulatory potential scores of each selected ligand and the target indicator vector, which indicates whether a gene belongs to the gene set of interest or not. To make the activity scores of both settings comparable over all ligands, z-score normalization of the Pearson correlation coefficients was performed after pooling the ligands for the different cell types together.</p>
