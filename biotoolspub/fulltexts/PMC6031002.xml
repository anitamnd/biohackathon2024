      <title>Abstract</title>
      <p>The small subunit ribosomal RNA gene (16S rRNA) has been successfully used to catalogue and study the diversity of prokaryotic species and communities but it offers limited resolution at the species and finer levels, and cannot represent the whole-genome diversity and fluidity. To overcome these limitations, we introduced the Microbial Genomes Atlas (MiGA), a webserver that allows the classification of an unknown query genomic sequence, complete or partial, against all taxonomically classified taxa with available genome sequences, as well as comparisons to other related genomes including uncultivated ones, based on the genome-aggregate Average Nucleotide and Amino Acid Identity (ANI/AAI) concepts. MiGA integrates best practices in sequence quality trimming and assembly and allows input to be raw reads or assemblies from isolate genomes, single-cell sequences, and metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs). Further, MiGA can take as input hundreds of closely related genomes of the same or closely related species (a so-called ‘Clade Project’) to assess their gene content diversity and evolutionary relationships, and calculate important clade properties such as the pangenome and core gene sets. Therefore, MiGA is expected to facilitate a range of genome-based taxonomic and diversity studies, and quality assessment across environmental and clinical settings. MiGA is available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://microbial-genomes.org/">http://microbial-genomes.org/</ext-link>.</p>

    <title>MiGA CLASSIFICATION OF A QUERY GENOMIC SEQUENCE</title>
    <p>The small subunit ribosomal RNA gene (16S) has been successfully used to catalogue and study the diversity of prokaryotic species and their communities for over thirty years. However, genome-based methods are needed to better resolve microbial communities at the species and finer levels, which cannot be efficiently assessed by 16S (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>), and to catalogue whole-genome diversity and fluidity. One such genomic method is the Average Nucleotide Identity or ANI (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). ANI represents the average nucleotide identity of all orthologous genes shared between any two genomes and offers robust resolution between strains of the same or closely related species (i.e. showing 80–100% ANI). The ANI measurement does not strictly represent core genome evolutionary relatedness, as orthologous genes can vary widely between pairs of genomes compared. Nevertheless, it closely reflects the traditional microbiological concept of DNA-DNA hybridization (DDH) relatedness for genomically circumscribing species (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>), as it takes into account the fluid nature of the bacterial gene pool and hence, implicitly considers shared function. Accordingly, ANI has been recognized internationally for its potential to replace DDH as the standard measure of relatedness, as it is easier to estimate and represents portable and reproducible data (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>).</p>
    <p>The Microbial Genomes Atlas (MiGA) project offers robust taxonomic classification of a query genome or assembled contig sequences based on ANI or, for more divergent (deep-branching) sequences, Average Amino Acid Identity (AAI; (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>)) values against a reference genome database. The reference database could be NCBI’s RefSeq, which encompass 1927 high-quality closed genomes from 1865 species (as of May 2018; updated bimonthly), or the NCBI Genome Database, Prokaryotic section (henceforth NCBI_Prok), encompassing 11 487 genomes from 3921 species (updated monthly). MiGA identifies the best matching reference genome for the query sequence based on ANI/AAI values and subsequently, assesses if the query sequence should be assigned to the same taxonomic rank (e.g. species, genus, <italic>etc</italic>.) as its best match or instead, if it represents a new/novel taxon at that rank. Additional information is provided for the best-matching sequence (and all reference genomes), including sequence statistics, genome quality and type material (when available). For the assignment step, MiGA compares the AAI value between the query sequence and its best match against empirical distributions of AAI values for each taxonomic rank derived from (pre-computed) AAI comparisons among the RefSeq genomes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>) to estimate the probability of not sharing the same rank or not being novel (empirical <italic>P</italic>-values of taxonomic classification and taxonomic novelty, respectively; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Methods</xref> for details). For example, genomes of the same species typically share more than 95% ANI (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S2</xref>). Hence, a query genome with a best match ANI value &lt;95% most likely represents a novel species, and the confidence (probability) for the latter classification (as novel species) would depend on how different its best ANI value is from the distribution of ANI values among all genomes assigned to the same species in RefSeq (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). Similarly, MiGA can determine the level of novelty of a query genome, e.g. if it represents a novel species within a known/described genus, or a novel genus of a known family <italic>etc</italic>., based on the AAI value of the best match. We tested MiGA’s classification accuracy using genomes of known taxonomy from NCBI_Prok and classifying them against the RefSeq database. MiGA’s accuracy was 90% or higher when its <italic>P</italic>-value for the assignment was 0.05–0.01 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S1</xref>). False positive or negative calls were of low frequency and almost always associated with inconsistently named species; e.g. species encompassing genome pairs with ANI values much lower than 95% (see also below).</p>

Colors correspond to the evaluated rank (as in A and B).</p>

    <p>Further, the query genomic sequence can be searched against unclassified genomes of isolates as well as selected metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) and single-cell amplified genome (SAGs) collections to identify the closest relatives in the total available genome sequence space. General statistics as well as quality assessments, including estimates of completeness, contamination, and taxonomically biased regions (see below), are provided both for the query sequence as well as for all reference MAGs and SAGs, so users can evaluate the significance of the best matches on their own. Note that in this case no direct classification to species, or other low taxonomic levels, is typically possible since the matching reference genomes are not officially classified yet, and the only available classification is that transferred by MiGA based on the (pre-computed) best matches of the reference MAGs and SAGs to NCBI_Prok. However, this analysis could provide answers to several ecological questions such as ‘has the query genome been found elsewhere?’ and ‘how similar at the gene content is it to its best match?’ and facilitate future novel taxon descriptions. In this case, the reference genomes are organized in so-called Projects, which are distinct reference genome databases from RefSeq and NCBI_Prok within MiGA. For instance, genomes are grouped into projects based on the habitat they originated from (see also below). We are currently expanding this collection with recently published collections of MAGs, and welcome submissions from external users of MAGs with sequence data registered in member databases of INSDC (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>) and metadata registered in the Digital Protologue Database in order to capture key metadata and make them available to all users (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Therefore, MiGA can also help cataloging the uncultivated microbial majority, which represents a great and urgent need (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>), especially if external users are willing to (freely) share their genomic sequences with the scientific community through MiGA.</p>
    <sec id="SEC1-1">
      <title>Clade projects</title>
      <p>Finally, Clade Projects involve the analysis of tens to hundreds of genome sequences assigned to the same or closely related species, using the ANI approach outlined above, in order to assess gene content diversity and genetic relatedness among the genomes. MiGA computes the full AAI and ANI values among the sequences of a Clade Project, produces the ANI-based phylogenetic tree (see also below), and saves, in addition, the matches of individual genes contributing to the AAI calculation. The latter information is used to identify all orthologous groups of proteins (defined as reciprocal best matching proteins), and provide descriptive statistics on the distribution of genes within the clade such as the size of the core gene set and the pangenome (<italic>i.e</italic>., total, non-redundant genes among all input genomes). Thus, Clade Projects are ideal for microdiversity and epidemiological studies, including of plant and animal pathogens. For instance, our analysis of ∼400 <italic>Bacillus anthracis</italic>, one of the least diverse and thus, most challenging to resolve species known (ANI values among <italic>B. anthracis</italic> genomes &gt;99.7%) revealed that the ANI-based tree recovered all previously known sub-clades of the species. The ANI tree also provided higher resolution compared to canonical SNP (Single Nucleotide Polymorphosms) or MLVA (Multi-Locus VNTR Analysis; VNTR: Variable Number of Tandem Repeats; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>), which are commonly used to genotype <italic>B. anthracis</italic> genomes. MiGA Online offers an expanding collection of Clade Projects to browse, including all (complete and draft) genomes of <italic>Bacillus cereus sensu lato, Marinobacter, Pelagibacter ubique</italic>, and <italic>Thaumarchaeota</italic> (updated bimonthly). Developing new Clade Projects by external users is possible in the standalone MiGA implementation and the cloud computing platforms, but not in the online MiGA webserver at the time of writing. Additional species can be requested in the public roadmap of MiGA Online (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://roadmap.microbial-genomes.org/">http://roadmap.microbial-genomes.org/</ext-link>).</p>

      <p>MiGA also offers the possibility to search any project dataset or genome sequence database (<italic>e.g</italic>., NCBI_Prok or RefSeq) by species name or metadata such as taxonomy at any registered rank, type material, and genome quality. In addition, users can browse all reference datasets on each Project by either AAI clustering or taxonomy, and explore the distributions of hAAI (see below), AAI and ANI values within each Project. Additional features available for examining the user-submitted query genome sequences include: (i) estimates of the completeness and contamination levels of a query sequence, (ii) detection of regions of the query sequence that may have different phylogenetic origin than its best matching reference genome due to recent horizontal gene transfer or miss-assembly (chimeric sequences; see also MyTaxa scan below), (iii) 16S analysis using the RDP classifier (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>) when 16S gene sequences are present in the query genome and (iv) general sequence statistics such as G+C% content, coding density, and assembly length and N50.</p>

      <title>MiGA workflow: ANI/AAI distances</title>
      <p>To efficiently search query sequences against all these reference genome sequences (e.g. over 11 000 for NCBI_Prok), MiGA employs several heuristic approximations. First, MiGA estimates the genome-based relatedness between each query sequence and all reference medoid genomes in the database. Medoid genomes represent single representatives of AAI clusters of reference genomes, or distinct subclusters within each AAI cluster (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Methods</xref>); medoids are used so that not all genomes of highly populated clusters are included in the search, which results in substantial reduction in computing time (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary material</xref>). For each pair of genomes, relatedness is first assessed by heuristic AAI (hAAI), based on only 110 universal genes (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">supplementary methods</xref>). If this value cannot be calculated (<italic>e.g</italic>., there are less than ten common universal gene matches in the two genomes) or is close to saturation (hAAI ≥ 90%), MiGA estimates the complete AAI (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>) using aai.rb (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). If this value is also close to saturation (AAI ≥ 90%), MiGA estimates the ANI of the genome pair (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>) using ani.rb (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). For each query genome, MiGA applies this hierarchical approach (hAAI, next AAI, and finally ANI; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S2</xref>) against medoid reference datasets. Once the medoid with the highest identity to the query is identified, MiGA proceeds to compare against the medoids in the related subclusters. This process is recursively applied until a cluster without subclusters is found, at which point MiGA calculates the similarities against all members of that cluster and thus, identifies the best match member.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="SEC1-4">
      <title>MiGA workflow: Data preprocessing</title>
      <p>MiGA implements a genomic data management and processing system that integrates best practices in genomic analyses, and with presets that allow input sequences to represent raw reads or assembled sequences from isolate genomes, single-cell sequences, and metagenome-derived bins or contigs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). Datasets initialized from raw short reads are trimmed, stripped from typically used adaptor sequences, and quality-checked using SolexaQA++ with Phred quality score threshold of 20 and minimum length of 50 bp (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>), Scythe with default parameters (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>), and FastQC (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>), respectively. Trimmed and clipped datasets are next assembled using IDBA UD with default parameters (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Genome binning of the resulting assemblies, if desired, must be currently done outside MiGA currently.</p>

      <p>Next, coding sequences are predicted using Prodigal with default parameters (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Genes frequently observed to be present in single-copy in bacterial and archaeal genomes are next identified as described in (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>), and implemented in HMM.essential.rb from the Enveomics collection (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>) including a quality report of redundancy and completeness. Redundancy is defined as the fraction of the total single-copy genes that have more than one copy in the query sequence; completeness represents the fraction of the total single-copy genes recovered in the query sequence. In genome sequences (isolate genomes, MAGs or SAGs), MiGA identifies potentially problematic regions like large horizontally transferred regions, contamination, erroneous assembly, <italic>etc</italic>., using MyTaxa scan (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S3</xref>). MyTaxa scan traverses the genome sequence in windows of ten genes and compares the taxonomic affiliations predicted by MyTaxa (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>), flagging regions with unexpectedly large Hellinger distances to the genome-wide distribution (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). This analysis is performed for all reference genomes that are part of MiGA’s genome databases (e.g. NCBI_Prok) and Projects, and can be launched (optionally) for any query dataset.</p>

    <title>MiGA INFRASTRUCTURE AND ONLINE WEBSERVER</title>
    <p>The main infrastructure of MiGA is an object-oriented application written in Ruby with minimal additional requirements, and ancillary shell code is used to implement analysis tasks. Data is stored in a variety of formats while metadata is stored in JSON files. MiGA features Application Programmatic, Command Line, and Web-based User Interfaces (API, CLI and Web). For further details on the infrastructure, see the manual available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://manual.microbial-genomes.org/">http://manual.microbial-genomes.org/</ext-link>. The entire system, including the processing core and the webserver, can be replicated from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://code.microbial-genomes.org/">http://code.microbial-genomes.org/</ext-link>, available under the Artistic License 2.0. The MiGA infrastructure has been successfully deployed for the autonomous processing of various input data types as described above. MiGA Online makes all its internal Projects and genome databases publicly available to browse, search, and query. Short videos on how to upload data, which Project to choose for specific research questions, understand the different outputs and interpret the results are also available through the homepage. MiGA is also available in preconfigured virtual machines for cloud computing through the Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud platforms.</p>

    <title>CONCLUSIONS</title>
    <p>We introduce MiGA Online, a webserver featuring a processing workflow for genomic and metagenomic analyses, including novel developments in whole-genome-based taxonomy and classification. Genome-wide comparisons in MiGA, including ANI/AAI and the implementation of heuristic approximations, enable the classification of query genomes against the 11 487 genomes (NCBI_Prok) currently included in its database. MiGA offers several Projects to browse or search query sequences against in order to suit different research needs, with NCBI_Prok being the most general and widely used. Therefore, MiGA fulfills a critical need of contemporary research, as no similar web resource is currently available, and is expected to greatly facilitate genome-level classification and gene diversity studies across the fields of environmental and clinical microbiology. Classification of genome sequences has been attempted based on the phylogenetic analysis of a few singe-copy universally conserved genes (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/01/31/256800">https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/01/31/256800</ext-link>), such as 16S rRNA and ribosomal protein-encoding genes, but these genes typically show higher sequence conservation than the genome average (e.g. ANI). Consequently, analysis of universal genes is not always feasible (depending on completeness), provide lower resolution than whole-genome comparisons near or below the species level, and has frequently resulted in lack of clear sequence/genetic relatedness boundaries between species (e.g. 16S rRNA), which is rarely observed with ANI (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/11/27/225342">https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/11/27/225342</ext-link>). Thus, MiGA provides significant advantages over these alterative methods for classification analysis, especially at the species level and below. In addition, MiGA uniquely provides information on gene content diversity and the degree of taxonomic novelty of query sequences, and is equally applicable to complete as well incomplete genomes that may be missing universal genes (e.g. the genes are not assembled) or include contamination, substantially expanding the microbial genome diversity that can be catalogued.</p>
