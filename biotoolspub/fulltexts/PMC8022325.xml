      <p>The CETSA and Thermal
Proteome Profiling (TPP) analytical methods
are invaluable for the study of protein–ligand interactions
and protein stability in a cellular context. These tools have increasingly
been leveraged in work ranging from understanding signaling paradigms
to drug discovery. Consequently, there is an important need to optimize
the data analysis pipeline that is used to calculate protein melt
temperatures (<italic>T</italic><sub>m</sub>) and relative melt shifts
from proteomics abundance data. Here, we report a user-friendly analysis
of the melt shift calculation workflow where we describe the impact
of each individual calculation step on the final output list of stabilized
and destabilized proteins. This report also includes a description
of how key steps in the analysis workflow quantitatively impact the
list of stabilized/destabilized proteins from an experiment. We applied
our findings to develop a more optimized analysis workflow that illustrates
the dramatic sensitivity of chosen calculation steps on the final
list of reported proteins of interest in a study and have made the
R based program Inflect available for research community use through
the CRAN repository [McCracken, N. Inflect: Melt Curve Fitting and
Melt Shift Analysis. <italic>R package version 1.0.3</italic>, 2021].
The Inflect outputs include melt curves for each protein which passes
filtering criteria in addition to a data matrix which is directly
compatible with downstream packages such as UpsetR for replicate comparisons
and identification of biologically relevant changes. Overall, this
work provides an essential resource for scientists as they analyze
data from TPP and CETSA experiments and implement their own analysis
pipelines geared toward specific applications.</p>

    <title>Introduction</title>
    <p>Within the complex
cellular milieu, there has long been an inability
to screen for untargeted changes in protein stabilization or destabilization.
The advent of Cellular Thermal Shift Analysis (CETSA)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref></sup> and
thermal proteome profiling (TPP)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref></sup> has rapidly increased
our ability to measure changes in protein stability within the context
of the intact proteome. The CETSA/TPP workflow begins with cultures
of cells exposed to different conditions such as those treated with
a small molecule vs vehicle or that have different genetic backgrounds.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref></sup> After culture, the cells are lysed in a nondenaturing extraction
buffer, and the cellular debris is pelleted and discarded. The supernatant
is decanted, aliquoted, and subsequently exposed to a thermal gradient
(typically using a PCR machine) ranging from ambient temperature to
90 °C. Alternatively, intact cells can be exposed to a thermal
gradient.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref></sup> During this heat treatment,
the bulk of the proteins in the solution unfold at a temperature range
based on their inherent biophysical properties such as individual
structure and their interactions with other partners (including proteins,
small molecules, metabolites, etc.). As they unfold, proteins have
a greater propensity for aggregation with nearby unfolded proteins
and may also precipitate postaggregation. After the short thermal
treatment, the heat-treated samples are centrifuged to pellet aggregated
protein. The supernatant containing the soluble fraction is decanted
once again, proteolytically digested, cleaned up, and labeled with
isobaric chemical tags such as tandem mass tag (TMT) reagents for
multiplexed analysis by LC-MS/MS. Relative peptide fragment abundance
values from a LC-MS/MS experiment are analyzed using a proteomics
search program, and the list of reported protein melt curves is further
processed manually or by an analysis program to yield a list of proteins
affected in the experiment and across replicates. Each step in this
described computational process, while having an essential role in
the execution of the assay, also has its own potential for adding
variability to the final output and conclusions from the study. Challenges
with accounting for variability were addressed in part by R- and Python-based
pipelines that calculate the melt shift curves from a search algorithm
data set.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref></sup> The pipeline that accompanied the TPP method,
hereafter described as “TPP-TR,” uses raw abundance
values from a proteomics program and processes the data through several
steps prior to calculating melt temperatures (<italic>T</italic><sub>m</sub>) and by comparison melt shift values. The operations used
in these steps include data filtering, normalization, meltome quantification
by curve fitting with correction, and individual protein melt fitting,
along with melt temperature and shift calculations.</p>
    <p>Despite
the availability of resources like TPP-TR that do the heavy
lifting in melt shift analysis, there has been no report to date that
describes how the chosen analysis steps can impact the final study
conclusions. Along with this void, additional challenges remain related
to the computational analysis. In order to address these deficiencies
related to the downstream computational data analysis, we investigated
the existing TPP-TR workflow with aims to better describe and optimize
the output of a TPP experiment. Herein, we describe the relative impact
of each melt shift analysis step on the total number of proteins and
melt shift standard deviations. Our analysis shows that the impact
of the data analysis workflow on the results reported from a TPP experiment
is significant and rivals the impact of the aforementioned technical
issues on the output. We used our findings to develop an analysis
workflow that acts as a complementary pipeline to the existing TPP-TR.
Our R based analysis pipeline, named “Inflect,” is publicly
available to the research community so that it can be utilized to
aid in the ease and accuracy of CETSA/TPP analysis and for comparison
to results that can already be obtained with other analysis programs;
furthermore, Inflect will be updated as we continue to update the
data analysis workflow. Our findings summarized below will allow researchers
to not only better leverage the results from the costly and time-consuming
TPP experiments but also act as a resource for those who develop their
own algorithms for analysis.</p>

      <title>Data Sets</title>
      <p>The
Peck Justice Data set—the first
data set used in our analysis—is one where the investigators
illustrated a novel approach for utilizing the TPP-TR workflow to
understand the impact of genetic mutations on the melt of the proteome.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref></sup> Their data set was generated from <italic>S.
cerevisiae</italic> strains, with mutations in the ORFs encoding proteasome
subunits Pup2 and Rpn5. The first and third data sets (p1 and p3)
generated from a wild type (WT) strain and mutant pup2 and rpn5 cells
were used in our pipeline analysis with the resulting data matrix
allowing for comparison between replicates. Raw abundance values reported
from a search in Proteome Discoverer were used in our analysis, and
the raw data files are available from PRIDE Project ID PXD017222.
The Perrin data set—the second data set used in the analysis—was
reported by Perrin and co-workers using CETSA to identify targets
of Panobinostat in organs and blood of rodents and humans, respectively.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref></sup> The raw data files were analyzed in Proteome
Discoverer Version 2.4. Files for the rat kidney and liver were obtained
from PRIDE Project ID PXD015427 (sample IDs 02290_F1_R1_P0189540B,
02293_F1_R1_P0189550B, 02066_F1_R1_P0177049B, and 02065_F1_R2_P0177039B),
while files for the human PBMC and whole blood data sets were obtained
from PRIDE Project ID PXD015373 (files 02032_F1_R1_P0175529B and 02604_F1_R1_P0204098E).
Proteome Discover searches for the rat data set were searched against <italic>Rattus norvegicus</italic> NCBI 062312, using the trypsin enzyme
setting, a precursor mass tolerance of 20 ppm, and a fragment mass
tolerance of 0.5 Da. Regression settings for the search used nonlinear
regression with coarse parameter tuning. The same search settings
were used for the human blood data sets, except the <italic>Homo sapiens</italic> (092919) database from Uniprot was used.</p>
      <p>Search results from
human whole blood raw data sets were used as the “WT”
data sets in the pipelines, while the peripheral blood mononuclear
cell (PBMC) data sets were designated as the “mutant”
data sets. Melt shifts (D<italic>T</italic><sub>m</sub>) were calculated
by subtracting the “mutant” melt temperature from the
“WT” melt temperature, and destabilized proteins were
those with positive shifts while stabilized proteins were those with
negative shifts. After searching against the <italic>Rattus norvegicus</italic> proteome, the raw abundance values for each protein were also analyzed
using both the TPP-TR and our pipeline in R. The kidney data sets
were set as the “mutant” strains, while the liver data
sets were designated as “WT” in order that each of these
two organs could be compared against the liver data sets. The analysis
workflows were the same as those that were previously described for
the Peck-Justice data set.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref></sup></p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec2.2">
      <title>JMP Analysis</title>
      <p>The statistical analysis software JMP
Pro 14 and Pro 15 were used to randomly vary five of the factors used
in the custom TPP analysis workflow along with their respective two-level
ranges to generate a full factorial design of experiments (DoE). A
total of 32 experiment conditions were created, and each of the 12
data sets discussed in this report were used to evaluate the performance
of each combination of steps (288 total experiments). The outputs
of the workflow analyses were both the total number of reported significant
proteins along with the standard deviation of the observed melt temperatures.
These outputs not only allowed for an understanding of the “signal”
that came out of each workflow combination but also gave an appreciation
of the level of uncertainty from the overall data. Desirable conditions
were those where there were high levels of proteins reported with
low levels of standard deviation. A definition of significance was
used to find melt curves with a calculated <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> greater than or equal to 0.95 and melt shifts with values
greater than 2 standard deviations from the mean melt shift.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec2.3">
      <title>R Analysis</title>
      <p>Code development and execution were done
in RStudio version 1.3.1056. R programs were used first for the development
of the TPP analysis pipeline that we describe. The optimized workflow
“Inflect” was also coded in R and RStudio.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref></sup> The current version of Inflect contains several
functions including readxl,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref></sup> writexl,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref></sup> optimr,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref></sup> data.table,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref></sup> plotrix,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref></sup> tidyr,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref></sup> and ggplot2.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref></sup> Inflect
currently analyzes biological replicate data sets separately from
each other but summarizes the results from all replicates in several
files that describe not only the melt temperatures but which proteins
had significant melt shifts across the replicates. The data matrix
output can be used directly as an input for UpsetR.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref></sup> R programs were also coded for the multivariate analyses
used to determine the relative impact of analysis steps on the final
TPP pipeline outputs. Various diagrams shown in the figures were also
generated within RStudio. GraphPad Prism 8 was also used for the generation
of plots.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec2.4">
      <title>Inflect Accessibility</title>
      <p>The Inflect code is available
through the CRAN repository.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref></sup> The function
processes data for each set of replicates that are specified by the
user (“Control” and “Condition”). The
outputs of this program are as follows: The Results.xlsx file lists
the calculated melt shifts and related data for each protein regardless
of the criteria (<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> and standard deviations).
The SignificantResults.xlsx file lists the calculated melt shifts
and related data for each protein that was considered significant
by the criteria above. The Curves folder contains the melt curves
(in pdf format) for each protein regardless of the significance of
the curve. The Significant Curves folder contains the melt curves
(in pdf format) for significant proteins only. The Normalized Condition
and Control result files contain the normalized abundance values for
each protein and at each temperature. The Waterfall plot shows the
calculated melt shifts across the proteome in the study. The melt
shifts are plotted in order of value (from highest to lowest). A PDF
version of this plot is created in the Curves folder. Outputs also
include summary data matrix files that list melt shifts for each significant
protein calculated across the replicates (if applicable); these files
are amenable to further analysis as desired (i.e., Venn diagramming
applications and UpsetR<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref></sup>). Example files
for Inflect analysis have been included as <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.jproteome.0c00872/suppl_file/pr0c00872_si_002.xlsx">Supporting Table 1</ext-link> and <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.jproteome.0c00872/suppl_file/pr0c00872_si_003.xlsx">Supporting Table 2</ext-link> for

    <title>Results and Discussion</title>
    <p>Protein melt shift calculation of TPP experimental data can be
delineated into 10 steps, which are summarized pictorially in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref></xref>. Step 1 excludes
data that do not meet predefined quality control criteria, followed
by step 2 that normalizes the abundance values for each protein to
the lowest temperature abundance. Step 3 uses statistics to quantify
the total protein meltome, and the curve fit routine in step 4 uses
nonlinear equations to describe the meltome shape. Step 5 calculates
correction values based on the actual and predicted curve fit values,
after which constants are then used to correct normalized abundance
values for each protein. Curve fitting again occurs in step 6 but
on each individual protein abundance that has been corrected. The
computationally laborious step 6 fits nonlinear equations to each
of the thousands of individual protein melt curves followed by another
exclusion in step 7 to remove proteins that do not meet another set
of quality control criterion. The calculation of the melt temperature
for each protein occurs in step 8, after which the melt shift is calculated
in step 9. The final step 10 involves the summary of the proteins
with significant stabilization or destabilization based on the shift
of all calculated proteins. We utilized two published CETSA/TPP studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref></sup> with a total of 12 separate replicate data sets to define and quantify
the relative impact of each data analysis step on the output from
an experiment. The Peck-Justice experiments investigated the impact
of genetic mutations in proteasome subunits Pup2 and Rpn5 on protein
interactions in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> on protein thermal
stability and protein–protein interactions. The Perrin experiments
focused on the use of CETSA to find Panobinostat targets in human
blood and rat organs while also using a 10-temperature gradient (without
drug) to probe for interactions in crude cell and tissues. These data
sets were chosen because they represent more recent executions of
the CETSA/TPP workflows, have publicly available raw data that have
not been previously normalized, and also feature the use of TMT label
sets. The analysis was demarcated into 10 steps with some key parameters
discussed in more detail below.</p>

        <p>Pictorial representation of the general
data analysis workflow
from a TPP experiment. Step 1 in the pipeline excludes protein abundance
data that do not meet certain criteria, while step 2 normalizes the
abundance values for each protein. Step 3 quantifies the total protein
meltome (i.e., statistical functions like median abundance in the
case of the current TPP-TR package), and the curve fit routine in
step 4 uses nonlinear equations to describe the meltome shape. Step
5 calculates correction values. Curve fitting occurs for individual
proteins in step 6, while exclusion is used again in step 7 to remove
more proteins that do not meet fit quality criteria. The calculation
of the melt temperature for each protein occurs in step 8 after which
the melt shift is calculated in step 9. The final step 10 involves
the summary of the proteins with significant stabilization or destabilization.</p>

      <title>Data Exclusion, Normalization, and Quantification</title>
      <p>Raw
abundance values reported by a proteomics search algorithm consist
of the relative number of ions detected from a peptide homologous
with an associated protein. Prior to beginning the analysis with the
TPP-TR pipeline, proteins can be excluded or filtered based on predetermined
quality control criteria. The purpose of the filtering is to address
the technical variability that is present from the sample harvesting
to LC-MS/MS analysis. One criterion used is whether a protein of interest
is present in both data sets used to calculate the melt shift. In
the event that a protein is observed in only one of the two conditions,
the protein will be filtered from the analysis and will not be included
in downstream analysis. It is also possible for proteins that are
not present in all biological replicates to be excluded from further
analysis so as to eliminate low abundance proteins. This step is not
unlike data preprocessing done for other types of quantitative proteomics
studies to deal with the challenges of missing values from multiple
MS-acquired data sets.</p>
      <p>The raw untreated data from the proteomic
analyses for each of the 12 data sets were analyzed to determine the
total number of proteins that were present in each condition so that
the level of exclusion could be quantified. We calculated the number
of proteins that were present in each condition (i.e., mutant, WT),
along with the number of proteins that were not present in the compared
group. In the case of the Peck-Justice data sets, this analysis involved
comparing the WT and <italic>rpn5-ts</italic> and <italic>pup2-ts</italic> mutant data sets from two biological replicates. The analysis done
on the Perrin data sets compared the melt shift between the proteins
in the PBMC and the whole blood data sets. The rodent organ data sets
from Perrin were used by comparing the melt shift between the kidney
and the liver data. While between tissue melt shifts were not specifically
reported by Perrin et al., other studies have recently reported similar
types of analyses.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref></sup></p>
      <p>Between 7 and
32% of the total number of proteins would not be
used in further analysis if an exclusion step were to be used in the
pipeline (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.jproteome.0c00872/suppl_file/pr0c00872_si_001.pdf">Supporting Figure 1</ext-link>). Upon further
examination, it was confirmed that the reason for proteins being exclusive
to only one of the two data sets (i.e., mutant or WT) was due to a
generally low abundance for the protein of interest in the systems
studied such that it was not detected across the MS runs that were
being compared. These low abundance values have the impact of lowering
the statistical values used to describe the total proteome or meltome
(downstream analysis). The impact to the quantified meltome would
be even more noticeable with the use of the mean function, which is
more sensitive to data skew. It is important to note as well that
the use of newly reported mass spectrometry techniques like the use
of a isobaric carrier channel<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref></sup> would impact this step
in the analysis pipeline and whether proteins have sufficient abundance
to be included in further analysis. Additionally, this clearly shows
that efforts to increase the overall protein depth of coverage across
samples is an important metric for this TPP/CETSA analysis, as it
is for global proteomics studies.</p>
      <p>After low abundance proteins
are excluded, all protein abundance
values at each temperature in the heat treatment are divided by the
abundance observed at the lowest temperature in the heat treatment.
This normalization step not only sets a reference of abundance to
the lowest heat treatment temperature (or the theoretical max protein
abundance) but it also converts protein abundance values to an equivalent
scale so that they can be compared between different conditions. Results
from abundance normalization for the Perrin and Peck-Justice data
sets are shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref> and <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.jproteome.0c00872/suppl_file/pr0c00872_si_001.pdf">Supporting Figure 2</ext-link>, respectively.
Not only do the data in these sets of dot plots show the spread of
abundance values that has been observed to occur at each temperature
but the median bars in the plots demonstrate examples of the general
departure from ideal sigmoidal shape that can occur. The sources of
variability in a multiplexed workflow like this have previously been
described to be due to a host of challenges ranging from technical
differences to TMT label variation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>−<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref></sup></p>

      <p>Post normalization, abundance
values across all proteins under
each condition are then quantified statistically by use of mean or
median functions. The calculated statistic and the corresponding proteome
melt curves numerically describe the total abundance of proteins for
a particular treatment or mutation. Curve fitting methodologies (described
in the next section) are afterward utilized to describe and predict
the total protein abundance as a function of heat treatment temperature.
Differences between actual and predicted protein abundance are used
to calculate correction constants for each heat treatment temperature.
The correction process adjusts the abundance of each protein at each
temperature for any departures of the global meltome from expected
melt behavior. The statistic chosen to describe and create the global
melt curve will have an impact on the correction constants calculated
for each condition and will consequently have a downstream impact.
For example, if the global protein abundance distribution is skewed
to lower levels and the mean statistic is used to describe the global
protein abundance, the correction constant may end up being a higher
value than if the median is used. Curve fitting, used a second time
(per the next section), is then used to describe the normalized and
corrected abundance of each individual protein as a function of heat
treatment temperature.</p>

      <title>Curve Fitting</title>
      <p>A melt curve with
its sigmoidal shape
can be described mathematically by a logistic expression. Two nonlinear
equations were used in our evaluation to determine which is optimal
for TPP/CETSA studies: a three-parameter log fit (3PL) and a four-parameter
log fit (4PL). The 3PL equation, which is solely used in TPP-TR, uses
three calculated constants <italic>a</italic>, <italic>b</italic>,
and Pl to describe the abundance as a function of temperature, <italic>T</italic>, whereas 4PL uses an extra constant to describe the variability.
The 4PL constants <italic>a</italic>, <italic>b</italic>, <italic>c</italic>, and <italic>d</italic> are equal to the slope at the
inflection point, the inflection point, lower plateau, and maximum
plateau, respectively. The normalized abundance vs temperature for
two proteins in the Peck-Justice data set are shown in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref></xref>, and these two curves provide
insight into the impact of fit equation on the melt curve. First,
the curve fits for the two selected proteins are just below and above
our commonly used cutoff criteria of <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> (0.95) depending on which equation was used. In the case where the
3PL is used, the goodness of fit is below these criteria, whereas
the 4PL fit results in a better fit that would be quantified as significant
by the workflow (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref></xref>A). Another point from this analysis is that the fitting equation
can also contribute to the curvature of the melt plot. In the case
of <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref></xref>B, the curvature
of the melt is much steeper for the 4PL than for the 3PL fit. The
steeper 4PL curve has a more clearly defined inflection (point on
the line where curvature changes direction) than the 3PL fit and would
have a more defined melt temperature if the inflection point definition
were to be used. The 3PL fit, however, has a higher top plateau (crosses
the <italic>y</italic> axis at 1 instead of 0.9) and has a shallower
curve down the heat treatment. The impact of the more “stretched
out” melt curve could affect the defined melt temperature depending
on where the lower plateau of the 3PL curve levels off (greater than
75 °C in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref></xref>B).</p>

      <p>The overall ability for a mathematical expression
to describe the
observed variability in a series of data points is commonly done using
the coefficient of determination, <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup>.
This coefficient used in linear systems equals the percentage of variability
that is described by the independent variable. The sum of the residual
squared error and regression squared error in a nonlinear or logistic
system, on the other hand, does not necessarily equal the sum of squared
total error, and therefore the <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> can
lie outside of the range of 0 to 1. The limitation makes the determination
coefficient a poor measurement of fit for a nonlinear model.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>−<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref></sup> One measurement of fit that was proposed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref></sup> and evaluated<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref></sup> as a more suitable comparator
for nonlinear fit than <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> is the Bayesian
information criterion (BIC). The BIC is a quantitative evaluation
of fit where more negative values indicate a more optimal regression
between conditions. The WT-p1 data set from the Peck-Justice experiments
was fit using both of the previously described 3PL and 4PL equations,
and the quality of fit was quantified using both the BIC and <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref></xref>). While results shown in this figure indicate that
the BIC has a smaller fit distribution for 3PL, the median BIC value
was lower for the 4PL, suggesting improved fit with 4PL on average
(<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref></xref>A). The results
show that the 4PL fit provides models with a comparatively higher <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> than the 3PL fit, again suggesting better
modeling of the experimental curves with 4PL (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref></xref>B). More detailed investigation needs to
be done to understand the meaning of the BIC especially as it relates
to comparing results between different curve fitting methods and if
specific protein melt properties are better captured by a specific
combination of analysis procedures.</p>

      <p>After the melt curves are described
by their respective equations
in step 4 in the analysis workflow, a single melt curve from one of
the two conditions is used to calculate the correction factor for
all conditions (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref></xref>, step 5). The curve and corresponding condition with the best fit,

that is used to calculate the correction constant for both conditions.
An example of a result from this TPP normalization is shown in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref></xref> for the Rpn5 protein

The three parameter fits to the corrected points in A and B are shown
in green and blue, respectively, and show no significant correction
in the case of the WT data set. The curve shift for the three-parameter
fit that resulted from the correction to the mutant data set, on the
other hand, was larger than the one observed for the WT data set.
These data are informative in a couple ways. First, it is important
to note that correction can help to abrogate overall differences in
curve shape that likely result from technical variation between samples,
making it key for direct sample comparison and for reproducibility
analysis across replicates. Second, the data sets included together
in the analysis pipeline should be limited to data that are directly
being compared, as direct comparison in the correction steps can impact
the downstream calculation protein melt temperatures.</p>

      <title>Melt Temperature Calculation
and Exclusion</title>
      <p>The melting
point, <italic>T</italic><sub>m</sub>, of any protein is defined as
the temperature at which a protein unfolds from its native state.
Due to the fact that all proteins in solution do not unfold en bloc,
the melt point is often defined as a transition point in one of two
ways. While some sources have defined the melt as the point at which
50% of the protein remains folded,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref></sup> others
consider this transition to be the inflection point in a melt curve.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">32</xref></sup> In order to study the impact of melt definition on the analysis
output, the normalized abundance values for the proteins at the highest
treatment temperature across all experiments were plotted (<xref rid="notes-2" ref-type="notes">Supporting Figure 3</xref>). Each of the values at the
highest temperature in these plots correspond to the bottom plateau
of each melt curve and should ideally cross at the value of 0 if all
protein is denatured and is separated from the liquid. These plots
show that despite the median abundance being near zero, there are
a large number of proteins in each data set with normalized abundance
values which remain above 0.5 at the highest temperature. In the case
of the data sets evaluated in this report, up to 22% of proteins were
in a replicate data set (control and condition) where the highest
temperature abundance was greater than 0.5. The conclusion from these
findings is that there are a large number of proteins in our evaluated
data sets that departed from expected behavior and could result in
a lack of <italic>T</italic><sub>m</sub> calculation simply because
less than half of the starting protein abundance value is lost as
a consequence of heat treatment. To ensure that proteins with a variety
of biophysical properties are considered within CETSA/TPP workflows,
these data suggest that a reconsideration of the chosen melt shift
definition is appropriate. It is important to note that this conclusion
is supported by others that have even considered use of variables
other than melt point in TPP experiments to characterize changes in
protein stability.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref></sup> However, melt point
calculation has value for the analysis of protein biophysical state
across studies and cellular systems including but not limited to comparisons
across species (or other systems) or when considering a biophysical
state change as a consequence of genetic encoded protein sequence
changes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref></sup></p>
      <p>Two of the melt curves from the TPP-TR
pipeline analysis are plotted in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref></xref>, and the example data in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref></xref>A reinforce why some of the
proteins do not have calculated melt temperatures as a consequence
of the melting point definition alone. The melt curve for protein
PRA1 (Uniprot accession: Q9ES40) in the “mutant”
condition has a curve with a low plateau higher than 0.5 and consequently
does not have a defined melt temperature with a loss of 50% of protein
abundance definition. A lack of melt temperature from one of the two
conditions being compared (“WT” or “mutant”)
results in no melt shift calculation, which reduces the overall number
of comparative values being reported. In the case of <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref></xref>B, the definition of the melt
being equal to 0.5 can also have a more subtle impact on the calculated
shift. The “mutant” curve for RNF170 (Uniprot accession: Q96K19) crosses
the 50% loss of protein abundance point at 53 °C, while the inflection
point of this same curve is closer to 51%. The melt shift based on
a definition of where the curves equal 0.5 can result in a different
shift than if the definition is based on the inflection point of the
curves. These data clearly show that inflection point is favorable
to a 0.5 loss in summed protein signal and may have significant impact
on protein inclusion in the downstream data set as well as melt temperature
values in final data sets. The definition of <italic>T</italic><sub>m</sub> could have impactful consequences in data sets in which small
molecule/drug treatment or protein sequence changes lead to stabilization
or improved solubility of specific proteins as shown in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref></xref>A. As a consequence, we strongly
recommend that inflection point be considered as advantageous for
many CETSA/TPP studies.</p>

the data sets collected by Peck-Justice and Perrin were analyzed using
both the Childs et al. TPP-TR workflow and our Inflect workflow in
order to understand the relative quantity of significantly stabilized
and destabilized proteins, and a comparison of our findings is shown
in <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref></xref>. Our assessment
used the same goodness of fit criteria (melt curve <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> of 0.95) and melt shift significance cutoff (2 standard
deviations from mean, a 95% confidence interval) for both pipelines.
In the case of the Pup2 and Rpn5 data sets, each curve was compared
with its corresponding WT data set in order to calculate melt shifts.
In the case of the Perrin human blood data set, PBMC values were used
as the experimental condition while whole blood results were used
as the control data set. This analysis was not carried out in the
original published report but was used in our analysis for comparison
to illustrate potential shifts in melt between a specific fraction
of blood and the bulk of human blood matrix. Additionally, the rodent
organ data analysis was done by comparing each of the kidney with
the liver data sets with the goal of showing comparative protein stabilization/destabilization
between each organ and the liver. Once each data set was evaluated
using the two workflows, the number of proteins with significant melt
shift results were compared. The first comparison (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref></xref>A) illustrates the amount of
overlap in significant proteins between the two outputs regardless
of whether they were stabilized or destabilized. The replicates for
the data sets (i.e., Pup2_p1 and Pup2_p3) were also combined in these
respective diagrams. These diagrams show that while 54 protein <italic>T</italic><sub>m</sub> changes were shared between the two methods,
there were an even greater number of proteins in each case that were
not observed as significant by the other corresponding analysis pipeline.
Similar observations were obtained for the other data sets under investigation

      <p>Not only were there were a large number of proteins that were found
to be uniquely significant in the Inflect workflow but we also found
that many of these proteins were relevant to the question being asked
in the original data set. In the case of the Pup2 data set, Pre1,
a component of the 26S proteasome, was reported as destabilized in
our data set but was not found to be significant using the same criteria
for significance in the TPP-TR workflow. The TPP-TR workflow neglected
to find this shift as significant due to the fact that the melt shift
for the wild type condition was just below the fit quality criteria
of 0.95. As we have shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>, the fit quality as determined by <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> is greatly improved using Inflect as a consequence of
4PL fitting. This protein is of interest due to the fact that the
strain used in the reported experiment leveraged a mutation to the
Pup2 gene, another component of the 26S proteasome and thereby a potential
protein–protein interaction partner.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref></sup> The negative shift in the melt temperature indicates that the <italic>PUP2</italic> mutation resulted in a destabilization of the Pre1
protein with other proteins, potentially those in the 26S proteasome.
Other proteasome or ubiquitin-related proteins that were observed
as significant in our workflow are shown in <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="other">Table <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="other">1</xref></xref>, and the associated melt curves for some
of these proteins are displayed in <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.jproteome.0c00872/suppl_file/pr0c00872_si_001.pdf">Supporting Figure 4</ext-link>. A similar trend was observed using our workflow to
analyze the Rpn5 data sets where a significant number of proteasome
subunits were observed with significant melt shifts, which was not
uncovered in the initial published study. The proteins of interest
are shown in <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="other">Table <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="other">2</xref></xref>, with some of the melt shifts from these Rpn5 proteins shown in <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">9</xref></xref>. We observed that
in the case of more than one of the “WT” data sets,
the melt curves had a higher than average inflection point, which
suggests that these proteins have higher than average thermal stability
in WT cells. It has already been shown by others that the proteasome
and ubiquitin have higher melt temperatures than the average protein
and therefore would have implied greater than average thermal stability.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34">34</xref></sup> It is possible that proteins with higher than average intrinsic
thermal stability may represent data set outliers; however, to facilitate
the development of TPP analysis methods that facilitate biological
discovery, it is important that optimized analysis pipelines consider
proteins with a wide array of biophysical properties.</p>

      <title>Biological
and/or Technical Replicate Analysis</title>
      <p>TPP
experiments should always include biological replicates to facilitate
discovery of reproducible changes that occur across experiments. Our
analysis in this article treats replicate experiments individually
and does not use mathematical operations to group replicates prior
to the aforementioned TPP analysis workflow, which is also allowed
in TPP-TR. One of the reasons for individual analysis of replicates
is that proteins may not always be detected across biological replicates
and thereby not pass filtering criteria as a consequence of a lack
of detection in separate mass spectrometry experiments rather than
a lack of change in thermal stability. We are working to address this
challenge in other work using isobaric trigger channels to increase
protein detection across biological replicates; however, that work
is outside the scope of this current study.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref></sup> In this implementation, the Inflect workflow processes each replicate
data set separately (i.e., control and condition) through the analysis
pipeline. Results from the function are saved to data matrix files
that can be opened in programs such as Excel that summarize the melt
shifts for each protein across each of the replicate experiments.
The reporting of melt shifts by our function allows for the user to
understand the reproducibility of the resulting melt shifts for each
protein and allows user defined cutoffs for downstream significance
reporting. Proteins with common stabilized or destabilized proteins
between replicates provide further evidence that the change in stability
is less transient in nature and potentially more significant. An example
of the comparison of significant proteins between replicates is shown
in the UpsetR generated plot<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref></sup> in <xref rid="fig11" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig11" ref-type="fig">11</xref></xref>, which is used
in our typical workflows to identify overlap of significant changes
identified by TPP experiments. As shown, there were 15 destabilized
proteins that were common between the two Pup2 replicates and only
one protein commonly stabilized between the two replicate sets. The
data matrix output is formatted for direct use in the UpsetR function
from the Inflect workflow.</p>

      <title>Multivariate Analysis to Assess the Impact of Each Step on End
Result</title>
      <p>The melt shift analysis pipeline involves a series
of steps that are used to prepare the raw abundance data for analysis,
describe the prepared data using fitting routines, and calculate melt
temperature shifts from each protein. In order to ascertain the relative
influence of each step on the output of the analysis pipeline, a program
was written in R which allowed for a multivariate analysis to be executed
using various combinations of each step to be run in series with the
goal of quantifying the respective output. All 12 data sets described
in this article were used in the evaluation. The results from the
analysis of the conditions were analyzed using the Fit Model routine
in JMP. Fit Model (using a factorial to second degree) was used to
describe the observed variability in the outputs as a function of
the five factors (step 1, exclusion; step 3, total quantitation; step
4, curve fit; step 6, curve fit; step 8, melt definition) also using
the experiment as a specific factor. The relative impact of each pipeline
factor along with the experiment being evaluated on the two outputs
was quantified by comparing the scaled estimates of each factor in
the model. The fit of each of the four models was good (&gt;90% of
the
variability was described in our model) and the order of the effects
with respect to importance to the models is summarized in <xref rid="tbl5" ref-type="other">Table <xref rid="tbl5" ref-type="other">5</xref></xref>.</p>

      <p>Results from our evaluation show that along with the standard deviation
of the melt shift, the second curve fitting routine in step 6 is the
most important of the variables studied in affecting the number of
observed proteins and the standard deviation of the melt shift values.
The initial curve fit equation had the next level of importance in
the results from our experiment. Interestingly, the use of the 3PL
fit for the initial curve fit of the meltome was more beneficial for
increasing the number of proteins with significant melt shifts, while
in the case of the second curve fit, the 4PL was more beneficial for
detecting proteins. This finding of a step-specific benefit for different
curve fitting routines indicates a need for a better understanding
of how curve fitting equations affect the <italic>T</italic><sub>m</sub> and melt shift calculations. The definition of the melt temperature
(50% reduction in protein abundance vs inflection point) and the statistical
quantitation of the proteome (specifically, the use of mean or median
to describe the total abundance) had less of an impact on these parameters
but were still statistically significant. It should be noted that
while the statistics indicate that there is a slight benefit to using
the 0.5 definition over the inflection point in the number of proteins
observed, we determined that the use of the inflection point over
the 50% value allows for analysis of proteins that have nontraditional
melt curves (where the lower plateau is not equal to 0). The exclusion
step used in our <italic>in silico</italic> experiments did not have
a statistically significant impact on the number of proteins or the
standard deviation of the melt shifts.</p>

    <title>Conclusions</title>
    <p>Our
group investigated the TPP melt shift analysis workflow and
the evaluation found that it is beneficial to use the 4PL curve fit
over the 3PL fit in order to define proteins with significant melt
shifts. To facilitate comparison of our workflow with other data processing
pipelines for TPP/CETSA, we have developed the R-based program Inflect.
We also show that the number of equation parameters used in curve
fitting can dramatically affect the number of proteins observed in
the melt shift analysis.</p>
    <p>Results from our optimized workflow
show that the second curve
fitting routine in step 6 is the most important of the variables studied
in affecting the output of the analysis pipeline (number of observed
proteins and the standard deviation of the melt shifts). The initial
curve fit equation had the next level of importance in the results
from our experiment. These findings reflect on how critical the choice
of fitting algorithm and melt curve equation are to the results of
a TPP study. It is also important to note that it is possible that
four parameter log fit equations are preferable to three parameter
log fits in multiple cases including the first curve fitting step.
Chosen optimization criteria (<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> vs BIC)
may also be important for future development of analysis algorithms
as current significance criteria leverage linear system-based functions
like the coefficient of determination. The definition of the melt
temperature and total quantitation statistics had lessof an impact
on the number of proteins observed; however, these parameters have
been shown to have a strong impact on specific proteins (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref></xref>).</p>
    <p>While our
work provides extensive insight into the data analysis
from TPP experiments, there is still ample opportunity for improvement.
As more TPP experiments are executed, the experimental procedure will
improve along with the methodology for isobaric labeling. As technical
improvements occur, the data analysis pipeline should also be evaluated
to determine whether the steps used are most appropriate and beneficial
for maximizing the number of biologically relevant results.</p>
