      <p id="P3">Proteins can be phosphorylated at neighboring sites resulting in
different functional states, and studying the regulation of these sites has been
challenging. Here we present Thesaurus, a search engine that detects and
quantifies phosphopeptide positional isomers from parallel reaction monitoring
and data independent acquisition mass spectrometry experiments. We apply
Thesaurus to analyze phosphorylation events in the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway
and show neighboring sites with distinct regulation.</p>

<body>
  <p id="P4">Hundreds of thousands of amino acids in thousands of proteins are estimated to be
actively phosphorylated in every human cell (<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>).
Many proteins are phosphorylated at neighboring sites (<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>) and over half of sites in multi-phosphorylated proteins are within four
amino acids of each other (<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Several
well-studied proteins make use of neighboring phosphorylation sites to act as switches
(MAPK (<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>), CDC4 (<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>)), timers (PER (<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>)) or as negative
inhibition toggles (IRS1 (<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>)) but global analysis
of these phosphorylation clusters has remained impractical. Tandem mass spectrometry
(MS/MS) of tryptic peptides is a key tool in discovering and quantifying sites of
protein phosphorylation. Typical phosphoproteomic workflows use data dependent
acquisition (DDA) to collect MS/MS spectra based on precursor m/z as peptides
chromatographically elute. Site localization software tools such as Ascore (<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>) assign the most likely phosphorylation position
for each peptide using site-specific fragment ions. To increase the number of distinct
peptides that are sampled, DDA dynamically excludes peptides of the same m/z from being
sampled repeatedly within a narrow elution time. However, phosphopeptides that exist as
multiple positional isomers are difficult to sample and assign using DDA because they
have the same mass, similar retention times, and share many fragment ions.</p>
  <p id="P5">Parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) and data independent acquisition (DIA) are
alternative approaches that systematically collect MS/MS spectra across the
chromatographic elution profile of peptides, improving quantitative reproducibility.
While PRM methods target specific peptide precursors (<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>), DIA methods acquire MS/MS spectra systematically across the m/z space
(<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). These methods are free of both
intensity biases during data collection and active exclusion of previously sequenced
precursors, making it possible to detect closely eluting positional isomers. Despite the
strengths of these methods, assigning phosphorylation to a specific amino acid remains
difficult. Recently, Rosenberger et al (<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>)
reported on IPF, a peptide-centric tool that uses OpenSwath (<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>) to determine the most likely positional isomer from
fragment ions in a peak. An alternate spectrum-centric approach, PIQED (<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>), deconvolves DIA data with DIA-Umpire (<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>) to enable site localization tools originally designed for
DDA. Finally, Specter (<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>) deconvolves DIA
signals using linear combinations of spectra in libraries, and in some instances can
resolve positional isomers. A limitation of IPF and PIQED is that they compete potential
positional isomers with similar retention times against each other and only the best
scoring isomer is reported. On the other hand, Specter was not designed for
phosphopeptide localization and lacks site localization statistics. Here we extend these
approaches and present a new DIA and PRM search engine named Thesaurus, which is
designed to specifically look for positional isomers.</p>
  <p id="P6">Thesaurus detects phosphopeptides with EncyclopeDIA and a spectrum library (<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>), and using the detections as retention time
anchors, iteratively finds new positional isomers that share many of the same fragment
ions but differ in their phosphorylation site-specific ions (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>). Thesaurus can
detect multiple co-eluting positional isomers because it calculates localization
probabilities directly using an interference distribution, rather than by competing
isomers against each other. For each phosphopeptide, Thesaurus determines every possible
positional isomer and extracts corresponding site-specific fragment ion signals. Each
ion has a unique frequency of interference across the experiment, and this frequency is
highest with low m/z ions (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 2</xref>). Thesaurus uses this frequency to calculate a
background distribution for each run and precursor isolation window, since these
distributions depend on peptide mass and various acquisition settings. Localization
p-values are calculated as the probability that all site-specific ions were observable
by chance in this background distribution and FDR corrected using the Benjamini-Hochberg
method. Thesaurus detects positional isomers absent from the spectrum library by
generating synthetic spectra with shifted fragment ions. Thesaurus quantifies positional
isomers even if their precursor signals are convolved, using site-specific ions to
determine peak boundaries and including additional fragment ions that fit that
shape.</p>
  <p id="P7">We validated Thesaurus using a synthetic phosphopeptide DIA dataset described
previously (<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>) (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 3</xref>), and found that it
produced both more detections and more accurate error estimates than IPF and PIQED. In
addition to correctly localizing 240 synthetic phosphopeptides, Thesaurus was also able
to identify and flag 11 products of a gas-phase phosphate rearrangement (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 4</xref>). We further
demonstrated Thesaurus‚Äô performance with phosphopeptides derived from
serum-stimulated HeLa cells. Previously we reported a human phosphopeptide library based
on nearly a thousand DDA experiments (<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Here
we used a subset of this library containing 82,029 phosphopeptides, where 44% of
phosphopeptides are phosphorylated at multiple positions (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 5</xref>). Thesaurus was able
to detect an average of 10,780 phosphopeptides across four technical replicates (<xref rid="SD3" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Dataset 1</xref>),
corresponding to an average of 6,288 confidently localized positional isomers (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 6a</xref>). We
found that within phosphopeptides containing multiple acceptor sites, approximately 13%
were phosphorylated at multiple positions (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 6b</xref>). While overall
Thesaurus performed comparably to DDA/Ascore (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure
1a</xref>), Thesaurus found four times more phosphopeptides with multiple positional
isomers per run (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1b</xref>), predominantly when the
retention time difference was less than 60 seconds (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 6c</xref>). The detection of
positional isomers was also more reproducible, as demonstrated for phosphopeptides with
only two acceptor sites (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1c</xref>). For example,
Thesaurus consistently detected two isomers of the peptide AITGASLADIMAK from the 60S
ribosomal protein RPL24 with phosphorylation at either T83 or S86 (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1d</xref>). These isomers elute within 25 seconds of each
other, and while the precursor signal represents a mixture of both isomers (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1e</xref>), Thesaurus confidently assigned them using
site-specific ions (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1f</xref> and <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">1g</xref>) to calculate localization scores (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1h</xref>). Although the site-specific fragment ions observed
in DIA were confirmed with DDA (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 7</xref>), DDA reliably triggered MS/MS on the early-eluting
isomer (pS86) and excluded the more intense late-eluting isomer (pT83) in 3 of the 4
replicates (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1d</xref>). Here, precursor
quantification was unreliable because the total signal was only assigned to the lower
abundance isomer. In contrast, IPF and PIQED assigned the higher intensity pT83 isomer
in every DIA replicate but never detected the lower intensity pS86 isomer.</p>
  <p id="P8">We designed a DIA quantitative experiment to resolve positional isomers in the
PI3K/AKT signaling network in MCF-7 cells after stimulation with insulin or IGF-1. We
found that 2,273 of the 7,434 localized phosphopeptides that were measured consistently
in six cell culture replicates changed abundance at an FDR-corrected p-value
&lt;0.05 (<xref rid="SD4" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Dataset
2</xref>), including several known AKT substrate sites (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 8</xref>) and 48 of 759
positional isomer pairs (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary
Figure 9</xref> and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">10</xref>).
For example, the peptide KGSGDYMPMSPK from the insulin receptor scaffold protein IRS1
(<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2a</xref>) contains three residues that are
putatively phosphorylated by three different kinases: Y632 by INSR (upstream of AKT),
S636 by S6K1 (downstream of AKT), and S629 by either PKA (<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>) or AKT (<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). While
our spectrum library did not contain KGSGDpYMPMSPK, Thesaurus was able to independently
detect, localize, and quantify all three singly phosphorylated isomers (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2b</xref>‚Äì<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">e</xref>),
which we confirmed with targeted PRM (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 11</xref>). As expected from the model, phosphorylation of
IRS1 Y632 increased by &gt;10-fold after both insulin and IGF-1 stimulation (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2e</xref>). Similarly, S636 phosphorylation also
increased, but that effect was lower and significantly diminished after treatment with
the AKT inhibitor MK-2206. We saw a decrease in phosphorylation of S629 after insulin
and IGF-1 stimulation, likely associated with an increase in the doubly phosphorylated
(S629 and S636) peptide (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary
Figure 12</xref>). This result suggests that S629 is phosphorylated by PKA and not
AKT. While Thesaurus consistently detected all three forms, both IPF and PIQED make
assumptions that can complicate positional isomer detection (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2b</xref>, <xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Note</xref>).</p>
  <p id="P9">Some phosphopeptide positional isomers were indistinguishable by retention time,
yet could be localized and quantified using site-specific ions. For example, MARK3
positional isomers at S469 and S476 co-eluted under our chromatographic conditions.
Using Thesaurus, we were able to detect that the S469 isomer responded to insulin/IGF-1
and AKT inhibition while the S476 isomer remained constant (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 13</xref>). However, one
should be cautious about interpreting co-eluting positional isomers. Potentially a third
to a half of these isomers may actually be the result of gas-phase phosphate
rearrangement, and only additional evidence such as measured differential regulation can
confirm that both isomers exist biologically (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Note</xref>).</p>
  <p id="P10">Positional isomers represent an important concept for understanding signaling
biology. Thesaurus provides a new avenue to study positional isomers even if their
precursor signals cannot be resolved. With a search engine specifically designed to
analyze neighboring sites of phosphorylation it is possible to determine whether they
have distinct functional implications, are redundant mechanisms for regulation, or are
simply representative of a background phosphorylation state. Additionally, Thesaurus
could be used to estimate phosphate rearrangements occurring in the mass spectrometer
and how these interfere with phosphoproteome analysis. Other types of PTM studies will
also benefit from this approach, so we have extended Thesaurus to support other
modifications. Our results indicate that PRM and DIA strategies will be crucial in
assessing the complex regulatory nature of the human phosphoproteome.</p>

      <title>Cell Culture:</title>
      <p id="P12">HeLa cervical cancer cells were cultured at 37¬∞C and 5%
CO<sub>2</sub> in Dulbecco‚Äôs modified Eagle‚Äôs medium (DMEM)
supplemented with L-glutamine, 10% FBS, and 0.5% streptomycin/penicillin. Cells
were grown to an estimated 90% confluence in 10-cm plates, where one plate was
used for each replicate/condition. Prior to harvest, cells were incubated for 4
hours under serum starvation conditions and then serum stimulated for 30
minutes. MCF-7 breast cancer cells were similarly cultured and starved, followed
by stimulation with insulin (100 ng/ml) or IGF-1 (100 ng/ml) in
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) or unstimulated (control, added same volume of
PBS) for 20 minutes. Some MCF-7 cells were additionally treated with DMSO or the
pan-AKT inhibitor MK-2206 for 40 minutes before stimulation. After stimulation
cells were quickly washed three times with refrigerated PBS and immediately
flash frozen with liquid nitrogen. With the MCF-7 experiment, six cell culture
replicates were performed for each of the six conditions: control/DMSO,
insulin/DMSO, IGF-1/DMSO, control/MK-2206, insulin/MK-2206, and IGF-1/MK-2206.
The six replicates were performed in three cell culture batches to simplify
sample handling and ensure precise timing.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="S4">
      <title>Sample Preparation:</title>
      <p id="P13">Frozen cells were lysed in a buffer of 9 M urea, 50 mM Tris (pH 8), and
75 mM NaCl, with a cocktail of protease inhibitors (Roche Complete-mini
EDTA-free) and phosphatase inhibitors (50 mM NaF, 50 mM
Œ≤-glycerophosphate, 10 mM pyrophosphate, and 1 mM orthovanadate). After
scraping, cells were subjected to 2 cycles of 25 seconds of probe sonication
each followed by 10 minutes of incubation on ice. Lysates were centrifuged for
10 minutes at 21,000 √ó <italic>g</italic> and 4¬∞C to eliminate
cell debris. The protein content of the supernatant was estimated using BCA. For
every condition/replicate, an estimated 850 Œºg of protein was reduced
with 5 mM dithiothreitol for 30 minutes at 55¬∞C, alkylated with 10 mM
iodoacetamide in the dark for 30 minutes at room temperature, and the alkylation
was quenched with an additional 5 mM dithiothreitol for 15 minutes at room
temperature. The proteins were diluted to 1.8 M urea and then digested with
sequencing grade trypsin (Pierce) at a 1:50 enzyme to substrate ratio for 4
hours at 37¬∞C. The digestion was quenched by adding 10% trifluoroacetic
acid (TFA) to achieve pH ~ 2. Resulting peptides were desalted with 100
mg tC18 SepPak cartridges (Waters) using vendor-provided protocols and dried
with vacuum centrifugation. Phosphopeptides were enriched using immobilized
metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) using Fe-NTA magnetic agarose beads (Cube
Biotech). Enrichment was performed with a KingFisher Flex magnetic particle
processor (Thermo Scientific), which incubated peptides with 150 Œºl 5%
bead slurry in 0.1% TFA 80% acetonitrile for 30 minutes, washed them three times
with the same solution, and eluted them with 60 Œºl 25% acetonitrile 0.5%
NH<sub>4</sub>OH. Phosphopeptides were then acidified with 10% formic acid
and dried. Phosphopeptides were brought to 1 Œºg / 3 Œºl in 0.1%
formic acid assuming a 1:100 reduction in peptide abundance from the IMAC
enrichment.</p>

      <title>Liquid Chromatography Mass Spectrometry:</title>
      <p id="P14">Phosphopeptides were separated with a Waters NanoAcquity UPLC and
emitted into a Thermo Q-Exactive HF or a Thermo Fusion tribrid mass
spectrometer. Pulled tip columns were created from 75 Œºm inner diameter
fused silica capillary in-house using a laser pulling device and packed with 3
Œºm ReproSil-Pur C18 beads (Dr. Maisch) to 300 mm. Trap columns were
created from 150 Œºm inner diameter fused silica capillary fritted with
Kasil on one end and packed with the same C18 beads to 25 mm. Solvent A was 0.1%
formic acid in water, while solvent B was 0.1% formic acid in 98% acetonitrile.
For each injection, 3 Œºl (approximately 1 Œºg) was loaded and
eluted using a 90-minute gradient from 5 to 25% B, followed by a 40-minute
washing gradient. Data were acquired using data-dependent acquisition (DDA),
data-independent acquisition (DIA), or parallel reaction monitoring (PRM). Four
DDA and DIA HeLa technical replicates were acquired in alternating mode to avoid
bias. Single injections for 36 MCF-7 samples (six cell culture replicates of six
conditions) was randomized within blocks to enable downstream statistical
analysis.</p>

set to 100 ms. MS/MS scans were collected at 30,000 resolution, AGC target of
1e6, and maximum injection time of 55 ms. The isolation width was set to 1.5 m/z
with a normalized collision energy of 27. Only precursors charged between +2 and

allowing for variable methionine oxidation, protein N-terminal acetylation, and
phosphorylation at serines, threonines, and tyrosines. Cysteines were assumed to
be fully carbamidomethylated. Searches were performed using a 50 ppm precursor
tolerance and a 0.02 Da fragment ion tolerance using fully tryptic specificity
(KR|P) permitting up to two missed cleavages. Search results were filtered to a
0.6% PSM-level (Peptide to Spectrum Match-level) FDR using Percolator (version
3.1), which we determined in this experiment to closely track to a 1%
peptide-level FDR. Site localization was performed using an in-house
implementation of Ascore (<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>) that was
modified to not compete positional isomers against each other in order to have a
higher chance of detecting overlapping isomers. We set Ascore to use a 0.02 Da

corresponding PSM that produced an Ascore value &gt;= 20

18 scans. MS/MS scans were programed with normalized collision energy of 27 and
an assumed charge state of +2.</p>
      <p id="P18">For PRMs, the Thermo Fusion tribrid mass spectrometer was configured to
collect MS/MS scans corresponding to 62 precursor targets in the PI3K/AKT
signaling pathway scheduled with 10-minute retention time windows using
Phosphopedia. The large 10-minute window enables both scheduling from
Phosphopedia without additional calibration runs and the detection of alternate
positional isomers that may elute far away from the target. Full MS scans (mass
range 400‚Äì1600) were collected at 60,000 resolution to hit an AGC target
of 3e6. The maximum injection time was set to 100 ms. MS/MS scans were collected
at mass range of 100‚Äì1600, resolution of 30,000, AGC target of 1e6, and
maximum inject time of 55 ms. The isolation width was set to 0.7 m/z with a

      <p id="P19">A Bibliospec (<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>) HCD spectrum
library of tryptic phosphopeptides was created from the Thermo Q-Exactive data
previously published in Lawrence <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>) using Skyline (version 3.1.0.7382) (<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). This .BLIB library and accompanying
.iRTDB normalized retention time database were used to search the .mzMLs for
peptides. Thermo .RAW files were converted to .mzML and .mzXML formats using the
ProteoWizard package (version 3.0.10922) where they were peak picked using
vendor libraries and deconvoluted using Prism in ‚Äúoverlap_only‚Äù
mode. We used EncyclopeDIA (<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>), a
spectrum library search engine to detect peptides in a peptide-centric approach.
Our engine searches DIA data using b- and y-ion fragments of charges +1 and +2,
and includes phosphate neutral losses that can be found in library spectra. We
applied the following settings: 30,000 resolution (effectively +/‚àí 16.7
ppm tolerance) for precursor, fragment, and library. Detected features were
assigned and corrected to &lt;0.01 FDR using Percolator version 3.1.</p>
      <p id="P20">In addition to Thesaurus, DIA experiments were analyzed with PIQED and
IPF. PIQED 0.1.2 using DIA-Umpire v2.0 was configured for 10 ppm mass tolerances
and 30,000 resolution, and to extract +2 to +4 charged peptides. DIA-Umpire
produces three .MGFs for each .mzXML; all three were searched with the Comet
v2017012 pipeline using the Trans Proteome Pipeline v5.1.0. Comet was configured
using the same parameters as for DDA. After Comet analysis, PIQED ran
PeptideProphet, iProphet, and PTMProphet through the xinteract interface using
the following command line options: ‚Äú-p0.01 -l6 -PPM -OH -i
-M-STY:79.966,M:15.995,n:42.010565-MZTOL=0.1-PPMTOL=10‚Äù to combine and
localize the three searches per sample. IPF was run using OpenMS
v2.4.0-nightly-2018-08-22. The .BLIB library was converted to TraML and filtered
to use the top 6 transitions for detection. For iRT anchors we used the most
highly abundant phosphopeptide in each of 11√ó 10-minute retention time
bins that were also found localized in every experiment by Thesaurus (both HeLa
and MCF-7). OpenSwath was configured to use 30,000 resolution (+/‚àí 16.67
ppm tolerance) using the following command line options: ‚Äú-tr

small MS1-level fitting parameters (lambda: 0.001, 0, 0) to ensure convergence
for MS1-level scoring, and no additional parameters for MS2 and transition-level
scoring. Finally, IPF was configured to use ‚Äú--no-ipf_ms1_scoring

      <title>Primary Scoring Using All Fragment Ions:</title>
      <p id="P21">Site-specific fragment ions can distinguish positional isomers, but
applying current site localization tools originally designed for DDA (<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>‚Äì<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>) to DIA can be
problematic because they assume a constant background noise level inconsistent
with the high level of background interference ions found in DIA data (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 2</xref>).
We account for this by calculating a background frequency distribution to
estimate the likelihood of detecting an interfering signal as the frequency of
each m/z in the raw file for a given precursor isolation window. Our approach
allows us to quickly query the distribution of ions for every fragment ion
individually, enabling the use tight mass tolerances (measured in ppm) to assess
the likelihood of interference.</p>
      <p id="P22">For each queried phosphopeptide, we determine the set of combinatorial
permutations corresponding to the number of phosphorylations and the number of
potential phosphoacceptor sites. If a positional isomer permutation is not
present in the library, then a synthetic library spectrum is generated from the
anchor by shifting fragment ion peak intensities for each b-type, y-type, and
neutral loss ions to the appropriate m/z‚Äôs, using an approach similar to
that used in SpectraST (<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>).</p>
      <p id="P23">First, we extract chromatograms for fragment ions in a window +/‚àí
10% of the total acquired chromatographic time from the retention time anchor.
At every retention time point in that window we calculate a score (Primary
Score) based on the X!Tandem HyperScore where the function is the dot product of
the intensities in the acquired spectrum (<italic>I</italic>) and the library
spectrum (<italic>P</italic>) multiplied by the factorial of the number of
matching ions: <disp-formula id="FD1"><mml:math display="block" id="M1"><mml:mrow><mml:mtext mathvariant="italic">Primary</mml:mtext><mml:mspace width="1pt"/><mml:mtext mathvariant="italic">Score</mml:mtext><mml:mspace width="1pt"/><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mspace width="1pt"/><mml:mspace width="1pt"/><mml:mo>‚àí</mml:mo><mml:mi>L</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mi>g</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>10</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:munderover><mml:mstyle><mml:mo>‚àë</mml:mo></mml:mstyle><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:munderover><mml:msub><mml:mi>I</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo>‚ãÖ</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo>‚ãÖ</mml:mo><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mo>!</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula></p>

    <sec id="S9">
      <title>Iterative Localization Scoring:</title>
      <p id="P24">We begin the localization process by comparing the highest scoring
isomer and retention time point to every other alternate isomer
(<italic>j</italic>) that either a) has not been detected, b) has been
detected nearby this RT, or c) scores higher at this RT. We calculate a p-value
as the probability of finding all of the detected site-specific ions
(<italic>n</italic>) by chance from the background frequency distribution
(<italic>m</italic>) and the total number of site-specific ions considered
(<italic>N</italic>). The final localization p-value is the max (least
significant) of these values across alternate isomers (<italic>j</italic>):

      <p id="P25">The localization score is the -log<sub>10</sub>(p-value) to produce a
positive score for higher confident localizations. This score is smoothed across
time by Gaussian weighting, where the Gaussian standard deviation is estimated
from the expected peak width (here we used 25 sec = 6 standard deviations).
Thesaurus then extracts the chromatographic shape of the localizing fragment
ions (for the target isomer compared to the alternate isomer with the least
significant p-value) to calculate the IonCount score, a measure of the number of
co-eluting fragments. The peak shape of every co-eluting b- and y-ion
(<italic>i</italic>) associated with the target isomer is compared to the
shape defined by the localizing fragment ions using Pearson‚Äôs correlation
(<italic>c</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>). The IonCount score is
calculated as: <disp-formula id="FD3"><mml:math display="block" id="M3"><mml:mrow><mml:mtext mathvariant="italic">IonCount</mml:mtext><mml:mspace width="1pt"/><mml:mtext mathvariant="italic">Score</mml:mtext><mml:mspace width="1pt"/><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mspace width="1pt"/><mml:mspace width="1pt"/><mml:munderover><mml:mstyle><mml:mo>‚àë</mml:mo></mml:mstyle><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:munderover><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula></p>
      <p id="P26">The sum of squares of correlation values is used to heavily downweight
the impact of ions that poorly correlate with the target isomer. Only ions with
positive correlation scores are used. The target isomer is considered detected
if the apex p-value p &lt;=0.01 and the IonCount score is &gt;=3 (these
thresholds are user adjustable). If the target isomer does not pass these
thresholds, the retention time window is blacklisted for this isomer and up to
one more attempt can be made to localize the peptide. The localization process
is iterated until all isomers have been detected or ruled out.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="S10">
      <title>Localization Post Processing:</title>
      <p id="P27">A parallel process is performed using decoy-generated spectra and the
scoring features for both are fed into Percolator 3.1 to generate Q-values. Of
peptides that pass the detection Q-value threshold, an additional localization
Q-value is calculated using the Benjamini-Hochberg method and the top reported
localization p-values for each isomer. Detected isomers are filtered to a
user-settable Q-value (typically 0.01 or 0.05) using both thresholds to ensure
high confidence detections.</p>
      <p id="P28">Positional isomer searching can be performed in an
‚Äúuncalibrated‚Äù manner (where retention times in the library are
assumed to be precise) if the DIA data was searched directly with a DIA library
search tool or if DDA experiments were run concurrently (SWATH). Alternatively,
Thesaurus supports searching in a ‚Äúcalibrated‚Äù manner, which
assigns relative retention time ordering by searching each peptide anchor across
the entire experiment window using the Primary Score if retention times are
unknown (e.g. importing NIST libraries) or need to be calibrated (e.g. with
spectrum libraries acquired on different platforms, gradients, or HPLC columns).
Alternatively, searches can be performed across the entire acquisition window
when analyzing targeted PRM data. We have also enabled options for only
calculating localization scores and estimating FDR, skipping the detection of
positional isomers that are not found in the library.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="S11">
      <title>Quantitation and Statistical Analysis:</title>
      <p id="P29">We used strict criteria to consider a localized peptide quantifiable. In
addition to the localization scoring requirements, we also required at least
three quantitative fragment ions and that the localized isomer was observed in
every replicate of at least one condition. Thesaurus uses the site-specific
fragment ions to determine the shape of the peak and assigns quantitative
fragment ions as those that match that shape for quantification with
Pearson‚Äôs correlation coefficients greater than 0.9. Quantification was
performed by summing the background-subtracted peak areas of site-specific
fragment ions or all fragment ions, depending on the level of peptide
separation. Background subtraction removes the trapezoidal area below the peak
integration window. Integrated intensities were normalized within each replicate
group, and across groups to the control intensity median. Statistical analysis
was performed on the MCF-7 dataset globally with Benjamini-Hochberg FDR
corrected one-way ANOVAs from six conditions with six replicates.</p>
      <p id="P30">PRM results were further validated with follow-up analysis in
Skyline-Daily (version 3.6.1.10615). Skyline was configured to extract all +1
and +2 b- and y-ions, including neutral losses of phosphate, as well as
precursor traces for the monoisotopic, first and second isotopes. After
initially importing the runs, peptides were hand-curated to match the retention
time boundaries determined by site-localizing analysis. Fragment ions that
appeared to be interfered with were removed from the analysis.</p>
