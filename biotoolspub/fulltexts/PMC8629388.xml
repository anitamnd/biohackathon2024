    <abstract>
      <p>A vast range of research applications in biodiversity sciences requires integrating primary species, genetic, or ecosystem data with other environmental data. This integration requires a consideration of the spatial and temporal scale appropriate for the data and processes in question. But a versatile and scale flexible environmental annotation of biodiversity data remains constrained by technical hurdles. Existing tools have streamlined the intersection of occurrence records with gridded environmental data but have remained limited in their ability to address a range of spatial and temporal grains, especially for large datasets. We present the Spatiotemporal Observation Annotation Tool (STOAT), a cloud-based toolbox for flexible biodiversity–environment annotations. STOAT is optimized for large biodiversity datasets and allows user-specified spatial and temporal resolution and buffering in support of environmental characterizations that account for the uncertainty and scale of data and of relevant processes. The tool offers these services for a growing set of near global, remotely sensed, or modeled environmental data, including Landsat, MODIS, EarthEnv, and CHELSA. STOAT includes a user-friendly, web-based dashboard that provides tools for annotation task management and result visualization, linked to Map of Life, and a dedicated R package (<italic toggle="yes">rstoat</italic>) for programmatic access. We demonstrate STOAT functionality with several examples that illustrate phenological variation and spatial and temporal scale dependence of environmental characteristics of birds at a continental scale. We expect STOAT to facilitate broader exploration and assessment of the scale dependence of observations and processes in ecology.</p>

      <p>In ecology and evolution, processes, data collection, and inference or prediction usually occur at different scales in space and time. This study introduces a cloud-based toolbox for the flexible fusion of biodiversity records with remotely sensed and other environmental information that supports an assessment and accounting of such scale dependencies.</p>

    <title>Introduction</title>
    <p>Spatiotemporal biodiversity data are accumulating rapidly, offering an ever larger and more diverse foundation for research. Citizen science observations are driving much of this increase [<xref rid="pbio.3001460.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.3001460.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], complemented in recent years by GPS tracking data and camera trapping data [<xref rid="pbio.3001460.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.3001460.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Simultaneously, there have been substantial increases in the quantity, spectral, and spatiotemporal resolution and availability of ecologically relevant environmental data, thanks to increasing Earth-orbiting satellite-based sensors and powerful models of global environmental conditions [<xref rid="pbio.3001460.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>–<xref rid="pbio.3001460.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p>
    <p>The fusion of these 2 data types, that is, the characterization of environmental conditions at, or surrounding, spatiotemporal points or polygons representing biodiversity data, is commonly called “environmental annotation” of biodiversity records (e.g., [<xref rid="pbio.3001460.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]). Annotations may range from simple space-time intersections between biodiversity and environmental data, to more complex zonal calculations incorporating values from neighboring space-time locations, analogous to feature extraction in purely spatial applications. Environmental annotation of biodiversity records over larger scales has already supported a broad range of applications and insights. These include studies of species distribution [<xref rid="pbio.3001460.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.3001460.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], animal movement [<xref rid="pbio.3001460.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.3001460.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.3001460.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], phenology [<xref rid="pbio.3001460.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.3001460.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], habitat use [<xref rid="pbio.3001460.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.3001460.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], landscape ecology [<xref rid="pbio.3001460.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], disease ecology [<xref rid="pbio.3001460.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], climate change [<xref rid="pbio.3001460.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], and others. The continued growth in the volume and variety of biodiversity and environmental data is poised to further increase the scope of research applications.</p>
    <sec id="sec002">
      <title>Matching the respective scales of observations, uncertainty, and process</title>
      <p>Despite the large volume and breadth of research relying in some form on the combination of biodiversity and environmental data, best approaches for proper integration have yet to be well specified. Notably, both spatiotemporal biodiversity and environmental data vary widely in their associated spatial and temporal grains and uncertainties [<xref rid="pbio.3001460.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Biodiversity records may refer to split-second observations of single organisms or larger areas sampled over months. They may be measured with extremely high accuracy, as for GPS-based tracking or camera trap records [<xref rid="pbio.3001460.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.3001460.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], or be less precise in their time stamps or locations as is often the case for citizen science or older museum specimen data. Environmental data layers similarly range from precisely captured 30-m pixels overflights to monthly 1-km characterizations. Beyond these discrepancies in the spatiotemporal attributes of data, there are well-recognized temporal and spatial scale dependencies in ecological processes [<xref rid="pbio.3001460.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.3001460.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Connecting environmental and biodiversity observation data in a way that does not address the respective spatial or temporal scales (i.e., grains) of evidence or process can severely compromise ecological inference and prediction. Currently, many studies relying on environment—biodiversity data annotation do not actively consider these scale issues [<xref rid="pbio.3001460.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], or do so only on an ad hoc basis [<xref rid="pbio.3001460.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], thus incurring observation and process mismatches and missed opportunities for more effective and informed integration.</p>
      <p>We suggest that a central reason for the relatively limited consideration of these data and process scale differences, despite rapidly growing data, is the lack of performant, readily usable tools. This is the motivation for the development of the versatile biodiversity–environment annotation toolbox that we present here: Spatiotemporal Observation Annotation Tool (STOAT). To further support STOAT’s relevance and specific uses, we explore 3 major concepts in detail (<xref rid="pbio.3001460.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>): (i) spatiotemporal observational grain (data resolution); (ii) spatiotemporal uncertainty; and (iii) spatiotemporal process scale.</p>

        <title>Spatiotemporal observational grain</title>
        <p>The grain of observations and environmental data can vary widely depending on their sources and subsequent processing. A species observation could range from a single point in time and space where an individual was recorded by a GPS collar, to a polygon with an area of thousands of square kilometers representing a national park the species was known to inhabit over the past few decades. Likewise, an environmental characterization of a location could range from an estimate of vegetation status on a specific day for an area of 25m<sup>2</sup> to a multidecadal mean averaged over hundreds of km<sup>2</sup>. The observations are essentially the same (species location or vegetation status), but the grain and associated interpretation of those observations are, or should be, very different.</p>
        <p>The linking of environmental with biodiversity data adds a further set of challenges. The grains of environmental data are predetermined and may or may not align with those of biodiversity data [<xref rid="pbio.3001460.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Likewise, the grains of biodiversity data may differ from each other in analyses that aggregate data from multiple sources. The intersection of spatially fine-grain biodiversity data with coarser gridded datasets is also vulnerable to the modifiable areal unit problem [<xref rid="pbio.3001460.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. When considering grain heterogeneity, entire classes of biodiversity data may be unfit for simple intersections with categories of environmental products: temporally fine-grain camera trap observations with temporally coarse climatological products and spatially coarse biological survey data with fine-grain remote sensing products.</p>
        <p>The 2-way spatiotemporal grain variability between biodiversity observations and environmental data increases the likelihood of mischaracterization following a simple intersection (i.e., identifying the grid cell of environmental data that is closest to a biodiversity observation). The impact of mismatches in data grain size can be lessened using techniques such as data coarsening or statistically using multiscale models [<xref rid="pbio.3001460.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.3001460.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], but all of these methods presume existing knowledge of biodiversity and environmental data grain as well as the grain of the relevant ecological processes, in addition to access to the appropriate data. Furthermore, coarsening either type of data risks removing fine-grain variability that is critically important for understanding the underlying ecological processes. Data coarsening loses utility if the spatiotemporal scale of an ecological process is finer than the finest grain biodiversity or environmental data available. Demand for data of higher resolution for the study of fine-scale ecological problems (e.g., animal behavior [<xref rid="pbio.3001460.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] or mechanistic niche models [<xref rid="pbio.3001460.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]) demonstrates the need for advancement in our biodiversity and Earth observation technologies. Addressing grain mismatch is made more difficult by the general lack of attention to scale dependency [<xref rid="pbio.3001460.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.3001460.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]; spatial and temporal scale metadata of biodiversity data (especially in large aggregated databases) are often unavailable, lost, or discarded [<xref rid="pbio.3001460.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.3001460.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec004">
        <title>Spatiotemporal uncertainty</title>
        <p>Biodiversity observations also vary in their spatiotemporal uncertainty owing to the variety of data collection methods. These can vary from a global positioning system location with spatiotemporal accuracies of seconds and meters to text-based descriptions of location common in museum collections, which may have uncertainties measured in kilometers and days or even years. The interpretation of uncertainty is distinct from that of grain. Consider 2 hypothetical biodiversity observations: the first with a coarse spatial grain but low uncertainty (e.g., a polygon representing the home range of a bird estimated from many GPS observations) and the second with fine grain but high uncertainty (e.g., a record of a museum specimen with imprecise geocoding). For the first GPS-derived range, taking the mean and variance of the environmental conditions across the range may be an appropriate way to characterize the individual’s environmental niche. The environmental characterization of the museum observation could also utilize the mean and variance of the area of spatial uncertainty, but would be more appropriately interpreted as a random variable drawn from the possible values across the area of uncertainty. The organism recorded in the second case is not assumed to inhabit all locations within its area of uncertainty, and thus the same mean and variance can be interpreted differently.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec005">
        <title>Spatiotemporal process scale</title>
        <p>Ecological processes are highly scale dependent, a fact that has been documented in analyses spanning a broad range of disciplines [<xref rid="pbio.3001460.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Data process mismatch occurs when the spatial or temporal scales (i.e., grain or extent) of attempted observations of an ecological process differ from the scales at which the process produces its signal. Depending on the severity of mismatch, the observations can produce a signal that is weaker than the true signal, masked by noise, or even opposite in directionality to the true signal [<xref rid="pbio.3001460.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Field observations are often used to generate metrics of biodiversity using data captured at different spatial scales, resulting in seemingly contradictory results across studies [<xref rid="pbio.3001460.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.3001460.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Considering the large scope of many studies using the present data fusion techniques, any mischaracterizations can lead to misguided conservation and management decisions that are based on inaccurate results. Researchers must account for the spatial and temporal scales of ecological processes and should make an effort to use data with appropriate scales during their data analyses. Biodiversity and environmental data suitability will vary from case to case: Long-term mean climatic conditions may be suitable for estimating the climatic niche of a long-lived plant species, but entirely unsuitable for understanding the movement dynamics of a long-distance bird migrant. Knowledge of one’s particular research system is key: Insight into the spatial or temporal scale of a studied process can help inform data selection, annotation, and assist in analysis and the interpretation of results.</p>

      <title>Enabling the versatile environmental annotation of biodiversity records</title>
      <p>The pitfalls of the environmental annotation of data with varying grains, uncertainties, and process scales highlight the importance of scale explicitness, i.e., the careful consideration and documentation of scales of both biodiversity and environmental data and associated sampling or ecological processes. Ideally, such annotations would offer flexibility to assess sensitivity to necessary assumptions or uncertainties around these relevant scales. Operationally, zonal calculations in space and time around a point of interest, i.e., spatiotemporal “buffers,” can help to change the effective grain of biodiversity data. Buffers can be used to match the grain of biodiversity data to that of an environmental layer or the scale of an ecological process. They can help account for spatiotemporal uncertainty in species records by averaging over potential occurrence locations. Spatiotemporal buffering is thus a versatile procedure with the potential to improve the environmental characterization of species for analyses that require species–environment matching. Easily scale-adjustable annotations would additionally support the exploration and quantification of scaling relationships themselves, both for studies primarily investigating spatiotemporal scaling effects and for studies focused on potentially scale-dependent ecological phenomena.</p>
      <p>We introduce STOAT to fill the need for a performant, scale-explicit, and scale-adjustable environmental annotation service. STOAT provides buffering capability in both space and time, supporting explorations and decisions around the grain and uncertainty dependence of results and scale-variant processes. STOAT is optimized for geographically large or spatiotemporally heterogeneous datasets, such as global species occurrence records, and serves annotations against a varied and growing set of remote sensing–supported and other environmental layers at a range of spatiotemporal scales. We use several cases studies to demonstrate how STOAT can provide the specificity and versatility needed for more informed environmental annotation of biodiversity data.</p>
      <p>With a combined focus on performance and scale versatility, STOAT complements existing environmental annotation tools. These include the R package <italic toggle="yes">raster</italic> [<xref rid="pbio.3001460.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], which enables annotation on local computers, but requires download and storage of environmental layers. For movement data, the Environmental Data Automated Track Annotation System (Env-DATA) in Movebank supports single point in time-specific environmental annotations with a particular view to behavioral analyses [<xref rid="pbio.3001460.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA’s) Application for Extracting and Exploring Analysis Ready Data (AppEEARS) [<xref rid="pbio.3001460.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] provides annotation functionality for individual occurrence coordinates or geographic regions, and, more recently, the Google Earth Engine R package (<italic toggle="yes">rgee</italic>) [<xref rid="pbio.3001460.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] offers access Google Earth Engine’s environmental layer catalog [<xref rid="pbio.3001460.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. In all of these tools, further user scripting to support spatiotemporally versatile annotations is required, and they thus remain nonoptimized for that purpose.</p>
      <p>STOAT can be accessed through a web client (<ext-link xlink:href="https://mol.org/stoat" ext-link-type="uri">https://mol.org/stoat</ext-link>), which offers a range of visual and map-based reports, and dashboards for the management of annotation tasks and data. An associated R package (<italic toggle="yes">rstoat</italic>) provides core functionality in the R environment. STOAT is integrated with Map of Life (<ext-link xlink:href="https://mol.org/" ext-link-type="uri">https://mol.org</ext-link>), a platform supporting the analysis and use of species distribution information, and its biodiversity mapping and analysis tools. The goal of STOAT is to support easier, more flexible, and scale-conscious integration of environmental and biodiversity data.</p>

      <title>STOAT functionality and usage</title>
      <p>An overview of usage steps for the web application (<ext-link xlink:href="https://mol.org/stoat" ext-link-type="uri">https://mol.org/stoat</ext-link>) and the R package (<italic toggle="yes">rstoat</italic>) is given through the website, associated help files, and an R vignette. In the current version of STOAT (v1.0), user datasets for annotation are uploaded into a private cloud datastore (large datasets) or can be loaded into memory in R (small datasets). The current version accepts occurrence records structured in a comma-separated values (.csv) file, with other data types such as polygons planned for the future. STOAT v1.0 limits environmental annotation jobs in size and layer count as a pragmatic way to avoid time and compute costly operations. Current limits can be found on the STOAT website. Computationally highly intensive annotations are possible (the architecture is fully scalable), but in v1.0 require coordination of cloud computing resources with the STOAT team. STOAT is designed to efficiently handle global datasets and is thus well situated to link with GBIF and other large spatiotemporal biodiversity datastores.</p>
      <p>After biodiversity data are uploaded, users are able to select annotation options regarding the biodiversity dataset, environmental products, and spatial and temporal buffers. These selections can be made from either the web interface (<xref rid="pbio.3001460.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>) or functions available in the R package. <xref rid="pbio.3001460.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref> shows the overall architecture of STOAT, explored in detail below. The various backend steps of the annotation process (<xref rid="pbio.3001460.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4</xref>) are executed using a cloud-based computing cluster, obviating the need for users to download large environmental datasets, especially important when working with high spatial or temporal sampling frequencies. Upon the completion of the annotation job, users are notified via email and can keep results on the cloud or retrieve results through the STOAT web application or R package. STOAT returns a ZIP file containing (i) comma-separated values (.csv) files with the annotated values and associated statistics; and (ii) text (.txt) files containing the parameters of the annotation, as well as metadata and layer citations. For small datasets, an “on-the-fly” annotation that provides results through the R console is available and allows users to run pilots for larger annotation jobs. <italic toggle="yes">rstoat</italic> is available through CRAN: <ext-link xlink:href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rstoat/index.html" ext-link-type="uri">https://CRAN.R-project.org/web/packages/rstoat/index.html</ext-link>.

      <title>Environmental datasets</title>
      <p>STOAT offers key global gridded environmental datasets at their native spatial and temporal resolutions. These environmental data span a variety of environmental characterizations, including climate, topography, vegetation, land cover, and human impacts. We group these datasets according to their temporal frequencies of sampling. These range from static products (single layer typically representing a long time period) to annual products, monthly products, and submonthly (dynamic) products.</p>
      <p>Dynamic products in v1.0 include MODIS day/night Land Surface Temperature (LST) at 1-km spatial resolution and daily temporal resolution. MODIS vegetation indices (i.e., Enhanced Vegetation Index [EVI] and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index [NDVI]) are provided at 250-m spatial and daily temporal resolution. STOAT also provides vegetation indices for both Landsat 7 and Landsat 8, each at a 30-m spatial and 16-day temporal resolution. Finally, STOAT provides access to the EarthEnv-CHELSA high-resolution precipitation dataset [<xref rid="pbio.3001460.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] at 1-km spatial and daily temporal resolution.</p>
      <p>Other layers provided on release include the European Space Agency’s global land cover maps [<xref rid="pbio.3001460.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], global human modification by the Nature Conservancy [<xref rid="pbio.3001460.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], global climatologies from CHELSA [<xref rid="pbio.3001460.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.3001460.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], and selected layers from the EarthEnv project (<ext-link xlink:href="https://www.earthenv.org/" ext-link-type="uri">https://earthenv.org</ext-link>), including topography [<xref rid="pbio.3001460.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], habitat heterogeneity [<xref rid="pbio.3001460.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], and cloud cover [<xref rid="pbio.3001460.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. As additional layers are developed, they will become available through STOAT; for the v1.0 list, see <xref rid="pbio.3001460.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, and consult <ext-link xlink:href="https://mol.org/stoat/sources" ext-link-type="uri">https://mol.org/stoat/sources</ext-link> for up-to-date information.</p>

      <title>Custom spatial and temporal grains (buffers)</title>
      <p>STOAT allows users to manipulate effective biodiversity data grain size using its user-customizable spatial and temporal buffers. STOAT draws spatial buffers as a radius around the coordinate(s) of interest, aggregating environmental layer pixel values within the buffered region to generate the output values including the mean, standard deviation, and the number of pixels present in the buffer. Only pixels within the buffered area are included (as determined by GDAL’s rasterize function). Temporal buffers are implemented by aggregating values across the days before the date of interest after the spatial buffers have been applied at the daily level (including the day of observation, so minimum is 1). These spatial and temporal buffers allow the user to adjust the effective grain size of the environmental data, characterize uncertainty, and match the grain of the data with the underlying ecological processes.</p>
      <p>The effective use of both spatial and temporal buffers requires basic knowledge of the spatial and temporal grains of the environmental product requested. For example, a temporal buffer of 7 days on a MODIS (daily resolution) request would generate 7 days of data (the day of and 6 days before), but might not generate a single value when applied to a 16-day Landsat sampling interval. Suggested buffers for various products are provided as defaults to allow basic data accessibility to those less familiar with the underlying datasets.</p>

    <sec id="sec011">
      <title>Architecture and workflows</title>
      <p>STOAT leverages software and infrastructure developed in Map of Life. The STOAT architecture consists of 3 units: the STOAT client, server, and environmental layer services (<xref rid="pbio.3001460.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>). Users launch tasks through the STOAT client (via the web app or R), including data uploads, annotation jobs, and result retrievals. Upon receipt of an annotation request, the STOAT server (annotation task manager) schedules the annotation job and allocates computing resources. The annotation service then initiates and connects to both the biodiversity datastore (where data for annotation are stored) and the environmental layer service. The annotation service sends tasks for initiation of the annotation workflow (<xref rid="pbio.3001460.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4</xref>) to the layer service, for annotation against the layer catalog. Results are returned to the annotation service and stored for later retrieval by the user. At launch (v1.0), environmental layers are provided by Descartes Labs, a geospatial data aggregator and analytics platform provider (<ext-link xlink:href="https://descarteslabs.com/" ext-link-type="uri">https://descarteslabs.com</ext-link>), and Google Earth Engine [<xref rid="pbio.3001460.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Annotation jobs are managed by the Map of Life platform, which runs the annotation server, and stores uploaded and annotated biodiversity data.</p>
      <p>STOAT is optimized for the environmental annotation of large numbers of spatiotemporal biodiversity records. Nevertheless, the computational requirements for annotations with large spatial and temporal buffers can be substantial. Computation time in practice depends on the number of records, the size of the spatial and temporal buffers, the number and temporal density of layers for annotation, and the availability of computational resources. For an overview of computational benchmarks for STOAT v1.0, see <xref rid="pbio.3001460.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Table</xref>.</p>

    <sec id="sec012">
      <title>Annotations at scale</title>
      <p>STOAT uses occurrence clustering to support the efficient annotation of particularly large biodiversity datasets. By grouping records in space and time before annotation, STOAT can reduce the number of computationally expensive scene retrievals. Spatial clustering is implemented using geohashes, wherein occurrences are classified into standardized grid cells according to coordinate location [<xref rid="pbio.3001460.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Geohash length (i.e., precision) is dependent on the spatial grain of the environmental layer, with longer geohashes used for finer grain layers (e.g., Landsat). As time stamps are hierarchical in nature, temporal grouping is implemented by binning occurrences into their year, year-month, or year-month-week of observation, depending on the product temporal grain and the level of spatial clustering used. By spatially and temporally grouping records, STOAT can achieve significantly improved performance in areas with high record density (e.g., urban areas or citizen science hotspots). As an example, one could consider 500 records within a small area on a single date, for which a 7-day temporal buffer is requested. A simple iterative annotator would need to retrieve a scene 3,500 times. STOAT’s clustering and buffer integration allow a user to complete the task with only 7 scene retrievals. Maximally time-efficient annotations enabled through clustering come at computational expense. Since clusters are annotated in parallel by computing nodes, the approach is only suitable when the number of records annotated by a single node outweighs the cost of node use. However, clustering methods remain an option for very large or very spatially dense biodiversity datasets.</p>

      <title>Case studies</title>
      <p>We present 2 case studies to highlight STOAT’s research potential and to illustrate use cases for its grain-flexible environmental annotations. First, we compare the annual greenness and temperature niches of a migratory bird species (ruby-throated hummingbird, <italic toggle="yes">Archilochus colubris</italic>) with those of a nonmigratory species (tufted titmouse, <italic toggle="yes">Baeolophus bicolor</italic>). Using STOAT’s spatiotemporal buffers, we demonstrate both spatial and temporal scale dependence of the 2 species’ environmental niches. Second, we explore differences in the annotated greenness values of Anna’s hummingbird (<italic toggle="yes">Calypte anna</italic>) occurrences across annotation methods. We compare the results of a record grain-specific environmental annotation facilitated by STOAT to a uniform environmental annotation representative of current popular methods.</p>

        <title>Spatial and temporal scale dependence of species niches</title>
        <p>To illustrate the STOAT workflow and the utility of scale-adjustable annotations, we chose 2 bird species native to North America: the migratory ruby-throated hummingbird (<ext-link xlink:href="https://mol.org/en/species/map/Archilochus_colubris" ext-link-type="uri">https://mol.org/en/species/map/Archilochus_colubris</ext-link>) and the nonmigratory tufted titmouse (<ext-link xlink:href="https://mol.org/species/map/Baeolophus_bicolor" ext-link-type="uri">https://mol.org/species/map/Baeolophus_bicolor</ext-link>). We downloaded global occurrences for the 2 species from eBird [<xref rid="pbio.3001460.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.3001460.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] and filtered the data using the <italic toggle="yes">Auk</italic> R package [<xref rid="pbio.3001460.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>], for the years 2013 to 2017, for data collected under the “Stationary” protocol, and for coordinates associated with “Personal” locality types. Personal localities in eBird are occurrence locations manually provided by the observer and are of finer and less variable grain than eBird hotspots, which may range from the size of a city block to a national park. Data using the stationary protocol and personal localities should have the finest and least variable grain among all eBird observations (30-m according to protocol definition). We expect spatial uncertainty to also be on the order of tens of meters (determined by the accuracy with which observers pin personal localities on a map). With the necessary assumptions about data spatial grain and uncertainty, we estimate that our occurrence data are approximately accurate to the 100-m scale. Temporal grain was standardized by coarsening data to the day of observation. Temporal uncertainty in eBird is usually on the order of hours rather than days, and we do not expect it to impact results.</p>
        <p>From the records remaining after applying these filters, we randomly sampled 20,000 occurrences, which we spatially thinned using the <italic toggle="yes">spThin</italic> R package [<xref rid="pbio.3001460.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>] to reduce the impacts of spatial sampling bias, resulting in 5,185 hummingbird occurrences and 5,021 titmouse occurrences.</p>
        <p>We annotated occurrences of both species with the MODIS LST Day (1,000 m, 1-day grain) and Landsat 8 EVI (30 m, 16-day grain) layers to illustrate variation in environmental association across species over time. We conducted annotations at fine and coarse spatiotemporal buffering levels to demonstrate the spatial (hummingbird) and temporal (titmouse) scale dependence of species environmental characterizations. The ruby-throated hummingbird was annotated against Landsat 8 EVI with a spatial buffer of 120 m (the estimated spatial grain of the data and a round multiple of the native Landsat grain of 30 m) and 990 m, and the tufted titmouse was annotated against MODIS LST with a temporal buffer of 1 and 30 days. In each case, the other buffer dimension (temporal for hummingbird, spatial for titmouse) was left at native grain. The hummingbird was further annotated with EarthEnv Habitat Heterogeneity (EVI-based Coefficient of Variation, 1,000 m grain, static). After job completion, annotated results were downloaded and analyzed in R [<xref rid="pbio.3001460.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Records with no value successfully annotated (due to missing or poor data quality) were omitted from the analyses. Since larger buffers are associated with greater likelihoods of retrieving valid data, only records successfully annotated at both buffering levels were retained for cross-buffer comparisons (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 3,162 and 1,766 for hummingbird and titmouse, respectively). The relatively low rate of successful annotation is attributable primarily to missing data from cloud cover and highlights additional utility provided by temporal buffers.</p>
        <p>To explore the spatial scale sensitivity of the hummingbird environmental niche, we calculated the cross-grain differences in EVI (|<italic toggle="yes">Δ</italic>EVI|) as the absolute difference between the EVI value of a given observation annotated at a 120-m grain and that of the same observation at a 990-m grain (i.e., 120 versus 990m spatial buffer). Higher |<italic toggle="yes">Δ</italic>EVI| values would indicate greater, and lower values lesser dissimilarity between the 2 spatial buffer sizes (grains). We compared |<italic toggle="yes">Δ</italic>EVI| with habitat heterogeneity as we hypothesized that greater spatial landscape heterogeneity would result in greater impact of grain on calculated EVI. For the titmouse, we calculated |<italic toggle="yes">Δ</italic>LST| as the difference between the LST value of an observation annotated at 1-day grain and 30-day grain. We compared the |<italic toggle="yes">Δ</italic>LST| with the date of observation to observe seasonal differences in experienced temperature variability. All analyses used R version 3.6.0 [<xref rid="pbio.3001460.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>].</p>

        <title>Record grain-specific versus grain-agnostic annotations</title>
        <p>To highlight the utility of record grain-specific annotations enabled by STOAT, we explored environmental characterizations of the Anna’s hummingbird. The species was chosen for its frequency of observation in eBird as well as for its geographic distribution. The Anna’s hummingbird (<ext-link xlink:href="https://mol.org/en/species/map/Calypte_anna" ext-link-type="uri">https://mol.org/en/species/map/Calypte_anna</ext-link>) inhabits western regions in North America, many of which are more arid and less EVI saturated than the eastern forests occupied by the ruby-throated hummingbird. As in the previous case study, we first downloaded species occurrences from eBird [<xref rid="pbio.3001460.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.3001460.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>], and filtered using <italic toggle="yes">Auk</italic> [<xref rid="pbio.3001460.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>], for the years 2013 to 2017 and for coordinates associated with personal localities. Instead of retaining species occurrences at a single spatial grain by filtering for “Stationary” eBird observation protocol, we sorted occurrences into different spatial grain bins by filtering for “Travelling” eBird observations and using the observation checklist’s “distanced travelled” as a proxy for spatial grain. Four spatial grain bins were created, with observations having distances between (1) 0.15 and 0.25 km; (2) 0.45 and 0.75 km; (3) 1.35 and 2.25 km; and (4) 4.05 and 6.75 km. We spatially thinned using <italic toggle="yes">spThin</italic> [<xref rid="pbio.3001460.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>] the records in each of the 4 spatial grain bins separately and randomly sampled 2,500 records from each group to form a final dataset of 10,000 Anna’s hummingbird occurrences of variable observational grain. The temporal grains of the occurrences were coarsened to the day of observation, as in the previous case study.</p>
        <p>We utilized 2 different environmental annotation methodologies, firstly, a record grain-specific EVI annotation using STOAT, and, secondly, a record grain-agnostic annotation using one or relatively few static EVI layers. For the grain-specific annotation, we used STOAT’s Landsat 8 EVI layer, annotating with a separate spatial buffer (effective annotation grain) for each bin. The spatial buffers used were the lower bounds of the spatial grain bins (e.g., 150 m for all occurrences within the 0.15- to 0.25-km bin), with the temporal buffer set to 32 days across all observations. For the grain-agnostic annotations, we used Google Earth Engine [<xref rid="pbio.3001460.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] and conducted intersections between the occurrence records and spatially coarsened (from 30 m to 1 km) Landsat 8 layers. Using the original 8-day composite Landsat 8 product (GEE product: “LANDSAT/LC08/C01/T1_8DAY_EVI”), we generated (1) an aggregated long-term mean EVI layer averaging all layer data from 2013 to 2017; and (2) long-term monthly EVI averages across the years 2013 to 2017 (i.e., 1 long-term layer for each of 12 months). We conducted our grain-agnostic annotations against these 2 layers, which represent common spatial and temporal grains (1-km monthly and long-term EVI) used in ecological analyses, and which serve as a contrast to grain-specific annotation. Spatial intersections were done to the grid cell of intersection, with no spatial buffer applied. The date of observation was coarsened to the month of observation for annotation against the monthly layers or was completely ignored when annotating against the long-term EVI layer. Results from both grain-specific and grain-agnostic annotations were downloaded and analyzed in R. Data were filtered to those with valid annotated values across all methods, resulting in 8,798 observations in total, split into 2,101, 2,175, 2,234, and 2,288 observations in the 4 spatial grain bins from finest to coarsest. Missing data were primarily attributable to cloud cover in the grain-specific annotation.</p>
        <p>We quantified the impact of the differing annotation methods by subtracting the annotated EVI values of the grain-agnostic annotations from the same record’s grain-specific EVI, generating 2 <italic toggle="yes">Δ</italic>EVI metrics (grain specific: monthly and grain specific: long term). We plotted the absolute value of the former <italic toggle="yes">Δ</italic>EVI against the original record spatial grain as we hypothesized that annotated values from the 2 methods would become less similar as record grains deviated from the common annotation grain of 1 km imposed for the grain-agnostic annotation. We plotted the second <italic toggle="yes">Δ</italic>EVI metric (grain specific: long term) against the Julian day of record observation to illuminate seasonal patterns in the differences between grain-specific and grain-agnostic annotation methodologies. All analyses again used R version 3.6.0 [<xref rid="pbio.3001460.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>].</p>

        <title>Spatial and temporal scale dependence of species niches</title>
        <p>We used range-wide occurrence data of 2 bird species to illustrate the versatility of STOAT for environmental characterization over space and time and its utility for exploring scale-dependent relationships between organisms and their environment. We performed example environmental annotations for the migratory ruby-throated hummingbird and the tufted titmouse for a subset of available data across their full global range and the 2013 to 2017 period.</p>
        <p>The tufted titmouse performs long-distance movements away from its northern geographic range and largely tracks the annual variation in vegetation productivity and temperature. On the contrary, the ruby-throated hummingbird is a migrant with a narrower climatic niche that is tracked throughout the year through its large geographic movements. The temporally specific annotation through STOAT (<xref rid="pbio.3001460.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref>) captures these differences for remotely sensed EVI (greenness) and LST (temperature). The environmental space occupied by the 2 species is largely overlapping in the warmer months when both are at higher latitudes. In the colder months, however, environmental associations of the 2 species diverge, as the hummingbirds migrate south and the titmice endure the winter. Further niche differences are also apparent: The hummingbirds demonstrate a closer tracking of preferred temperature range than of their preferred greenness of vegetation across seasons.</p>

        <title>Environmental characterization across spatial grains</title>
        <p>We illustrate how STOAT supports identification of the dependence of environmental niche characterizations on spatial grain size using the ruby-throated hummingbird data. Specifically, we calculated the cross-grain differences in EVI (|<italic toggle="yes">Δ</italic>EVI|) as the absolute difference between the EVI value of a given observation annotated at a 120-m grain and that of the same observation at a 990-m grain (i.e., 120 versus 990 m spatial buffer, both Landsat 8 EVI). Higher |<italic toggle="yes">Δ</italic>EVI| values would indicate greater, and lower values lesser dissimilarity between the 2 spatial buffer sizes (grains). As homogeneous environments by definition should offer similar characteristics over some distance, we anticipated that |<italic toggle="yes">Δ</italic>EVI| should be positively correlated with environmental heterogeneity. We found substantial differences in EVI between the 2 spatial grains (<xref rid="pbio.3001460.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6</xref>, right-hand histogram), with |<italic toggle="yes">Δ</italic>EVI| exceeding 0.2 in 10.1% of records (median = 0.06). For context, mean EVI of mixed forests in the Northeastern United States (which both species partially inhabit) ranges from approximately 0.2 in the winter to 0.5 in the summer, an annual swing of only approximately 0.3 [<xref rid="pbio.3001460.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. See <xref rid="pbio.3001460.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref> for overall range of EVI in this species, typically between 0.0 and 0.9. |<italic toggle="yes">Δ</italic>EVI| values showed a positive correlation with the EVI-based habitat heterogeneity of the landscape (Spearman R = 0.143, <italic toggle="yes">N</italic> = 3162).</p>

        <title>Grain-specific versus grain-agnostic annotation</title>
        <p>We compare the results of record grain-specific environmental annotations, enabled by STOAT, to record grain-agnostic annotations, which represent the status quo in most current environmental annotation applications. Specifically, we investigate the Anna’s hummingbird, a species known to select areas with productive, green vegetation (high EVI) within the generally arid surrounding conditions (lower EVI) typical of its broader geographic range. Given the large heterogeneity, in space and time, of the relevant environmental conditions for this species, we expect a strong scale dependence in the environmental annotation outcome. We hypothesize annotations matching the original spatiotemporal record grain to more appropriately characterize the species’ environmental requirements and predict these to be different to those using grain-agnostic standard values, e.g., strict 1-km spatial resolution and long-term annual averages.</p>
        <p>Using a selection of records varying in original observation grain from ca. 200 m to 5,000 m, we find this expectation confirmed for spatial grain (<xref rid="pbio.3001460.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig 8A</xref>). The absolute EVI difference (|<italic toggle="yes">Δ</italic>EVI|) between matched observation grain and standard 1,000 m grain is greater than zero and increases with increasing grain gap (all using monthly layers). Specifically, the 2 grain groups closest to 1,000 m have a median |<italic toggle="yes">Δ</italic>EVI| of 0.038, compared to 0.051 for the farther groups (Mann–Whitney U test, W = 11,158,301, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = 1.4e-35).</p>

        <p>To assess the effect of temporal grain mismatches, we compare results from an EVI annotation specific to the day of observation to one using a long-term annual average (<italic toggle="yes">Δ</italic>EVI). We expect a seasonal trend in <italic toggle="yes">Δ</italic>EVI, because the representativeness of the long-term annual average for the actually selected EVI conditions likely varies by season. This was the pattern observed, with <italic toggle="yes">Δ</italic>EVI peaking in the summer months (June, July, and August) compared to the winter (December, January, and February; Mann–Whitney U test, W = 3,148,513, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = 2.0e-133).</p>

    <title>Discussion</title>
    <p>By offering an easy-to-use toolbox for versatile and computationally scalable environmental annotation of biodiversity data, STOAT lowers the barriers for researchers to consider the spatiotemporal grain and uncertainty aspects of their data and relevant processes. STOAT’s optimized workflow and utilization of cloud-based data storage and processing allow for the efficient retrieval of environmental data. This workflow is optimized for large quantities of records significantly dispersed in space and time and custom selection of spatial and temporal buffers. STOAT reduces the complexity of environmental annotation with its user-friendly web application and R package. The larger motivation for the toolbox is to allow users to spend less time processing and linking diverse data types and more time exploring and analyzing results.</p>
    <p>STOAT addresses key considerations of data scale and uncertainty through its spatial and temporal buffers. Buffers are a flexible tool users can apply to their specific data needs in the annotation process, including integrating data of variable grains, accounting for data uncertainty, and scale matching between data grain and extent of ecological processes. We demonstrated the scale sensitivity of species–environment relationships, both across space (<xref rid="pbio.3001460.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6</xref>) and time (<xref rid="pbio.3001460.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7</xref>), and illustrated the usefulness of spatiotemporal buffers in exploring these scale relationships. We explored the impacts of spatial and temporal grain on resultant EVIs (<xref rid="pbio.3001460.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig 8</xref>) and demonstrated the need for grain-conscious environmental annotations. Scale-adjustable spatial buffering is an important tool for accurate characterization moving forward, as are finer-grain environmental datasets that allow for improved environmental characterizations.</p>
    <p>Nonetheless, spatiotemporal buffering is not a cure-all for issues of scale. Simple buffers as currently implemented might not be able to fully characterize data needing both grain and uncertainty matching, as addressing one component of scale limits the ability to address others. One could consider data with both coarse spatial grain and high uncertainty: Using a single spatial buffer when annotating against an environmental layer, set to either grain or uncertainty, would omit the impact of the second scale component. It is not immediately clear if a simply larger buffer is appropriate to combine grain and uncertainty effects. Furthermore, computational limits necessitate upper bounds on the size of both spatial and temporal buffers. This reduces the versatility of buffers in the present, but is an unavoidable constraint given finite computing resources. For spatial buffers an upper bound is particularly important, as the number of pixels in a buffered area increases exponentially with buffer radius.</p>
    <sec id="sec023">
      <title>STOAT in the larger ecosystem of spatial data annotation</title>
      <p>STOAT was developed specifically for the large-scale environmental annotation of spatiotemporal biodiversity data, providing efficient and scalable annotations beyond those previously available. Existing annotation tools have constraints that limit their ability to serve high-resolution annotations at global scale and a multidecadal temporal extent. AppEEARS [<xref rid="pbio.3001460.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] is optimized for the retrieval of time series data, utilizing a single temporal window across all coordinates instead of STOAT’s record-specific time stamps. Users must annotate every record against the coordinate dataset’s full temporal extent, and thus AppEEARS experiences severe performance reductions for datasets with broad temporal extents. Furthermore, AppEEARS does not natively support spatiotemporal buffering. Env-DATA [<xref rid="pbio.3001460.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] allows record-specific time stamps, being much more performant on dispersed data, but like AppEEARS provides no buffering functionality.</p>
      <p>The extract functions available in the <italic toggle="yes">raster</italic> [<xref rid="pbio.3001460.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] and <italic toggle="yes">rgee</italic> [<xref rid="pbio.3001460.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] R packages are the most versatile existing annotators in their buffering capacity. Spatial and temporal buffers can both be implemented, although temporal buffers (spatial buffers as well for <italic toggle="yes">rgee</italic>) require user scripting. However, <italic toggle="yes">raster (extract</italic> function<italic toggle="yes">)</italic> has no product library and operates only on local layers, imposing a significant download and storage requirement on the user. This can prove prohibitive for temporally dense products like MODIS. The <italic toggle="yes">rgee</italic> (<italic toggle="yes">ee_extract</italic> function) package remedies this issue, mimicking <italic toggle="yes">raster</italic>’s functionality while simultaneously providing access to Google Earth Engine’s extensive layer catalog. Nonetheless, <italic toggle="yes">rgee</italic> is constrained by a hard limit of user memory usage in Google Earth Engine, which prevents users from annotating global and temporally dispersed records against high-resolution environmental layers (e.g., MODIS) in a single extraction. Like AppEEARS, both <italic toggle="yes">raster</italic>’s extract and <italic toggle="yes">rgee</italic>’s ee_extract functions use a single temporal interval per extraction. Although the programmatic interface allows users to iteratively submit a separate extraction request for every record, this approach is prohibitively inefficient for large numbers of records. To our knowledge, currently, no tool is capable of annotating global biodiversity data at scale at the fine spatial and temporal grains that STOAT offers. STOAT is additionally currently the only annotation tool with fully integrated and computationally efficient spatial and temporal buffering, saving users’ time and costs in implementation and computation.</p>
      <p>STOAT’s environmental layers span a breadth of spatial and temporal grains and extents, but may not prove sufficient for all environmental annotation purposes. On launch, STOAT’s finest temporal grain layers are daily, and its coarsest is yearly. Users at scale extremes (e.g., needing hourly precision annotations) may find more suitable alternatives. Similarly, although STOAT is capable of serving precomputed layers representing long-term average environmental conditions, it is neither designed nor optimized for their ad hoc computation from fine-grain layers. Users should assess the usefulness of STOAT for their own annotation purposes by the layers available and their spatiotemporal grains. More layers will be added to STOAT over time, as we hope to make STOAT as broadly useful as possible.</p>

      <title>Outlook</title>
      <p>This research and software implementation was motivated by the recognition that in the face of rapidly growing biodiversity data, researchers might benefit from a more accessible and performant way of exploring and addressing inherent issues of spatiotemporal grain and uncertainty when performing environmental annotations. In essence, all spatiotemporal biodiversity data have, and indeed vary, in their sampling grain (data resolution) and uncertainty. Alongside, the spatiotemporal scale of processes associated with environmental conditions may also vary. We demonstrated the effect of these issues on biological inference, and quantified differences between annotation methodologies, using several case studies and introduced STOAT, an easy-to-use tool that enables a more flexible environmental annotation of biodiversity data. We hope that STOAT lowers the barriers for exploring the issues of scale and uncertainty in the environmental characterization of biodiversity data and will foster a broader awareness around these issues.</p>

    <p>Dear Dr Jetz,</p>
    <p>Thank you very much for submitting your manuscript "A cloud-based toolbox for the versatile environmental annotation of biodiversity data" for consideration as a Methods and Resources paper at PLOS Biology. Your manuscript has been evaluated by the PLOS Biology editors, an Academic Editor with relevant expertise, and by two independent reviewers.</p>
    <p>You'll see that both reviewers are broadly positive about your study, but each raises some concerns that will need to be addressed before further consideration. Reviewer#1's comments are mostly self-explanatory, but the Academic Editor asked me to reinforce the need to attend to reviewer #2's "main question", namely can you add an analysis of how much STOAT improves upon the "do nothing" approach or the current state-of-the-art? This may also help address an indirect criticism in reviewer #1's third major comment about "few quantitative contributions of this manuscript."</p>
    <p>In light of the reviews (below), we will not be able to accept the current version of the manuscript, but we would welcome re-submission of a much-revised version that takes into account the reviewers' comments. We cannot make any decision about publication until we have seen the revised manuscript and your response to the reviewers' comments. Your revised manuscript is also likely to be sent for further evaluation by the reviewers.</p>
    <p>We expect to receive your revised manuscript within 3 months. </p>
    <p>Please email us (<email>plosbiology@plos.org</email>) if you have any questions or concerns, or would like to request an extension. At this stage, your manuscript remains formally under active consideration at our journal; please notify us by email if you do not intend to submit a revision so that we may end consideration of the manuscript at PLOS Biology.</p>
    <p>**IMPORTANT - SUBMITTING YOUR REVISION**</p>

    <p>*****************************************************</p>
    <p>REVIEWERS' COMMENTS:</p>
    <p>Reviewer #1:</p>
    <p>[identifies himself as Christopher Anderson]</p>
    <p>In this work, Li et al. describe a new cloud-based system for annotating spatially-explicit species occurrence records and range map data with multi-scale, remotely-sensed environmental data. STOAT provides a browser-based UI and an open source R package, making this work accessible to a range of user expertise, and supports the analysis of custom user datasets. This system was designed to overcome several of the issues introduced by spatial and temporal scaling dynamics that affect nearly all analyses of ecological data by helping users explore a range of spatiotemporal buffering options. It is likely to become an important tool for the ecological research and biodiversity monitoring communities, and I commend the authors and developers. At this point I believe there are a few key edits to the manuscript that the authors should make in order to clarify some important issues for readers. These relate to the terminology used throughout, the potential uses of this system, and a reconsideration of the spatial scaling analysis.</p>
    <p>First, I think it will be critical for the authors to clearly define what "annotation" refers to. I read the manuscript all the way through the first time without every discovering what it meant. It only became clear to me after I visited the R package README and read through the Github repository. It is a clear and appropriate term once the reader understands what it means, but it is not in common usage (at least within the literature I'm familiar with). I suppose I colloquially refer to it as feature extraction, or simply as zonal statistics, but these don't quite address the more comprehensive process developed for STOAT. I believe there is an opportunity for the authors to clearly define biodiversity data annotation, to state why it is important to explore data that has been annotated with multi-scale features, and to discuss the potential insights to be gleaned that will improve our understanding of biodiversity change.</p>
    <p>The manuscript includes a strong introduction to the challenges posed by common and beguiling problems related to pattern and scale in ecology, and STOAT addresses many of them from an interesting conceptual and technological standpoint. In that sense, what the system does is clearly described. Yet it wasn't clear to me how these annotated data would be used. I had neither a sense for what other analyses these annotations would support (e.g. are these features to be included in species distribution models?) nor how the annotated data could be exported or used (the web tool appears, at the moment, to just show maps and graphs). I can imagine a few potential uses of these data - and I'm sure the authors have imagined more - but my sense was that the paper focuses more on describing the technical challenges it overcomes and less on how overcoming those challenges addresses broader problems for the community. I recommend balancing these topics.</p>
    <p>Finally, I recommend reconsidering or reanalyzing the section characterizing variation across spatial grains; one of the few quantitative contributions of this manuscript. The proposed analysis (evaluating shifts in vegetation growth patterns (here, EVI) across spatial scales to quantify how species-environment relationships change with buffer size) is interesting and worth performing. However, from what I can tell, the author's analysis introduced a major source of variation: comparing EVI from two separate satellite sources. I suspect this is actually driving the results as presented, and needs to be addressed in a revision. There are a few sources of variation I'd like to point out.</p>
    <p>- It is not easy to directly compare Landsat and MODIS EVI calculations, even when using harmonized ARD products. Beyond differences in radiometric calibration, signal-to-noise ratios, wavelength centers, spectral resolution and sensor-specific EVI coefficients, a major difference is in the native spatial resolution of each sensor. Due to complex radiative transfer processes, the at-sensor radiance patterns measured by a satellite changes non-linearly as the grain size of a sensor increases. In other words, resampling a group of 30x30 m measurements to 250x250 m grid cells will not necessarily match a direct 250x250m measurement over the same area. This introduces a systematic bias that is not addressed.</p>
    <p>- The spatial uncertainty assumed by the authors (~100 m) is greater than the grain size of the fine scale measurements (30 m), meaning it's likely that many observations annotated with nearest-neighbor data are not precisely labeled. This is probably fine to a degree (first law of geography and such), and would probably average out with enough samples, but is likely to introduce a broad distribution of residuals that make it look like there's more disagreement than there really is. This is what I see when I look at the Delta EVI histogram in Figure 6.</p>
    <p>- Oh, and there are (likely small) differences in horizontal positional accuracy (i.e. pixel location uncertainty), as well as differences introduced by the spatial projections of the data processing streams (WRS-2 for Landsat, Sinusoidal for MODIS) that would further balloon residual distributions.</p>
    <p>I did not feel the temporal grain analysis suffered from the same issue, however, as they analyzed a consistent data source.</p>
    <p>I recommend running a similar analysis that isolates differences between grain sizes by analyzing data that's been resampled from fine to coarse scales from a single sensor (e.g. resampling 30 m -&gt; 240 m Landsat EVI (as the closest round multiple to 250 m)). This would obviate the differences introduced by radiometric calibration differences / etc. and create a comparison that isolates scale effects. I would probably be willing to let the spatial uncertainty issue slide if this analysis were done well and if the issue was clearly addressed in the text as a caveat.</p>
    <p>The authors have developed a valuable cloud-based tool that I expect will be received well by the community. After revisions, I suspect this manuscript will be as well.</p>
    <p>Below are some minor notes that don't need to be specifically addressed, but may be useful feedback for the authors.</p>
    <p>- The R package page and the Github repository are not linked in the paper. It seems like they should be.</p>
    <p>- Based on exploring the web UI, it looks like STOAT is optimized for working with GBIF data. I think the authors would do well to explicitly call that out to orient the reader to which ecosystem of tools this system fits into (outside of the obvious MoL connection).</p>
    <p>- GBIF has an API, right? It seems a future version could just hook up to that instead of having users manually filter, download the csv files, then trim the fields to prepare for upload. I found this manual process to be a bit arduous and confusing (e.g., in the field reconciliation process).</p>
    <p>- Requiring (instead of making optional) a license for uploads seems like the wrong choice: I suspect the majority of users will come here with GBIF records, which they do not have the right to assign a license to. Seems like there should be more flexibility here.</p>
    <p>- Assuming 100 m spatial accuracy for records seems generous, but of course will vary based on the source (cell phones vs. museum records). The authors discuss this as an issue, but how it effects the interpretation of results could be more clear.</p>
    <p>- The discussion of the EVI differences is hard to interpret. The range of values is relatively small, and not tied to any directly interpretable biophysical pattern. I felt I could use more guidance as a reader in how to understand the meaning of a median difference of 0.06 EVI.</p>
    <p>- The last paragraph of the introduction to the discussion (l. 436-441) could be fleshed out more - it's a bit vague.</p>
    <p>Reviewer #2:</p>
    <p>I enjoyed the introductory section entitled Matching the respective scales of observations, uncertainty, and process. It was an excellent review in clear language without jargon, but a bit duplicative.</p>
    <p>This section had me expecting that STOAT would allow integration of data with different spatiotemporal attributes with the environmental data layers but this is not the its function. Perhaps that can be modeled into future products to make use of more data for species with less data. STOAT seeks to properly match the spatiotemporal attributes of the biodiversity spatial data and the environmental data layers. This is important and if not done can lead to misinterpretation as stated by the authors. Any solution that makes data annotation for fitness for use easier is welcomed and STOAT appears to work well. The discussion provides realistic expectation of the data analysis which is appreciated. There is no overselling of the procedure.</p>
    <p>My main question is: What would the data for the two case studies look like if it had not been filtered through STOAT? There is no comparison on the two case studies to a "dirty" analysis with raw data. What results would that give? This could be a strong selling point for the paper.</p>

    </p>
    <p>Dear Dr Jetz,</p>
    <p>Thank you for submitting your revised Methods and Resources paper entitled "A cloud-based toolbox for the versatile environmental annotation of biodiversity data" for publication in PLOS Biology. I've now obtained advice from one of the original reviewers and have discussed their comments with the Academic Editor. </p>
    <p>Based on the reviews, we will probably accept this manuscript for publication, provided you satisfactorily address the following requests.</p>
    <p>IMPORTANT:</p>
    <p>a) I wonder if you could choose a somewhat more informative title? Maybe "A cloud-based toolbox for the versatile annotation of large-scale biodiversity data with environmental information" or some such (if that's accurate).</p>
    <p>b) We understand that the data and code required to recreate Figs 5AB, 6, 7, 8AB are in the Zenodo deposition <ext-link xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5208219" ext-link-type="uri">https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5208219</ext-link> - please could you cite this location clearly in each of the respective legends (e.g. "The data underlying this Figure may be found at <ext-link xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5208219" ext-link-type="uri">https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5208219</ext-link>") - you might want to include <ext-link xlink:href="https://mol.org/stoat" ext-link-type="uri">https://mol.org/stoat</ext-link> too, if relevant. Make sure to include the Zenodo URL in the Data Availability Statement too.</p>
    <p>As you address these items, please take this last chance to review your reference list to ensure that it is complete and correct. If you have cited papers that have been retracted, please include the rationale for doing so in the manuscript text, or remove these references and replace them with relevant current references. Any changes to the reference list should be mentioned in the cover letter that accompanies your revised manuscript.</p>
    <p>We expect to receive your revised manuscript within two weeks. </p>
    <p>To submit your revision, please go to <ext-link xlink:href="https://www.editorialmanager.com/pbiology/" ext-link-type="uri">https://www.editorialmanager.com/pbiology/</ext-link> and log in as an Author. Click the link labelled 'Submissions Needing Revision' to find your submission record. Your revised submission must include the following:</p>
    <p>-  a cover letter that should detail your responses to any editorial requests, if applicable, and whether changes have been made to the reference list</p>
    <p>-  a Response to Reviewers file that provides a detailed response to the reviewers' comments (if applicable)</p>
    <p>-  a track-changes file indicating any changes that you have made to the manuscript. </p>
    <p>NOTE: If Supporting Information files are included with your article, note that these are not copyedited and will be published as they are submitted. Please ensure that these files are legible and of high quality (at least 300 dpi) in an easily accessible file format. For this reason, please be aware that any references listed in an SI file will not be indexed. For more information, see our Supporting Information guidelines:</p>

    </p>
    <p>*Published Peer Review History*</p>
    <p>Please note that you may have the opportunity to make the peer review history publicly available. The record will include editor decision letters (with reviews) and your responses to reviewer comments. If eligible, we will contact you to opt in or out. Please see here for more details:</p>

    </p>
    <p>*Early Version*</p>
    <p>Please note that an uncorrected proof of your manuscript will be published online ahead of the final version, unless you opted out when submitting your manuscript. If, for any reason, you do not want an earlier version of your manuscript published online, uncheck the box. Should you, your institution's press office or the journal office choose to press release your paper, you will automatically be opted out of early publication. We ask that you notify us as soon as possible if you or your institution is planning to press release the article.</p>
    <p>*Protocols deposition*</p>
    <p>To enhance the reproducibility of your results, we recommend that if applicable you deposit your laboratory protocols in protocols.io, where a protocol can be assigned its own identifier (DOI) such that it can be cited independently in the future. Additionally, PLOS ONE offers an option for publishing peer-reviewed Lab Protocol articles, which describe protocols hosted on protocols.io. Read more information on sharing protocols at <ext-link xlink:href="https://plos.org/protocols?utm_medium=editorial-email&amp;utm_source=authorletters&amp;utm_campaign=protocols" ext-link-type="uri">https://plos.org/protocols?utm_medium=editorial-email&amp;utm_source=authorletters&amp;utm_campaign=protocols</ext-link></p>
    <p>Please do not hesitate to contact me should you have any questions.</p>
    <p>Sincerely,</p>

    <p>REVIEWERS' COMMENTS:</p>
    <p>Reviewer #1:</p>
    <p>[identifies himself as Christopher B. Anderson]</p>
    <p>Li et al. have clearly addressed my comments from the previous review, and I believe this paper will be a valuable contribution to the field. I find the new structure of the introduction much easier to read, and the analysis easier to understand. Thank you for your work, and for your consideration.</p>

    <p>Dear Dr Jetz,</p>
    <p>On behalf of my colleagues and the Academic Editor, Andrew Tanentzap, I'm pleased to say that we can in principle offer to publish your Methods and Resources "A cloud-based toolbox for the versatile environmental annotation of biodiversity data" in PLOS Biology, provided you address any remaining formatting and reporting issues. These will be detailed in an email that will follow this letter and that you will usually receive within 2-3 business days, during which time no action is required from you. Please note that we will not be able to formally accept your manuscript and schedule it for publication until you have made the required changes.</p>
    <p>Please take a minute to log into Editorial Manager at <ext-link xlink:href="http://www.editorialmanager.com/pbiology/" ext-link-type="uri">http://www.editorialmanager.com/pbiology/</ext-link>, click the "Update My Information" link at the top of the page, and update your user information to ensure an efficient production process.</p>
    <p>PRESS: We frequently collaborate with press offices. If your institution or institutions have a press office, please notify them about your upcoming paper at this point, to enable them to help maximise its impact. If the press office is planning to promote your findings, we would be grateful if they could coordinate with <email>biologypress@plos.org</email>. If you have not yet opted out of the early version process, we ask that you notify us immediately of any press plans so that we may do so on your behalf.</p>
    <p>We also ask that you take this opportunity to read our Embargo Policy regarding the discussion, promotion and media coverage of work that is yet to be published by PLOS.
