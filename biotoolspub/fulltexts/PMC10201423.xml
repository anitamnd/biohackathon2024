      <title>Abstract</title>
      <p>The functions of non-coding RNAs usually depend on their 3D structures. Therefore, comparing RNA 3D structures is critical in analyzing their functions. We noticed an interesting phenomenon that two non-coding RNAs may share similar substructures when rotating their sequence order. To the best of our knowledge, no existing RNA 3D structural alignment tools can detect this type of matching. In this article, we defined the RNA 3D structure circular matching problem and developed a software tool named CircularSTAR3D to solve this problem. CircularSTAR3D first uses the conserved stacks (consecutive base pairs with similar 3D structures) in the input RNAs to identify the circular matched internal loops and multiloops. Then it performs a local extension iteratively to obtain the whole circular matched substructures. The computational experiments conducted on a non-redundant RNA structure dataset show that circular matching is ubiquitous. Furthermore, we demonstrated the utility of CircularSTAR3D by detecting the conserved substructures missed by regular alignment tools, including structural motifs and conserved structures between riboswitches and ribozymes from different classes. We anticipate CircularSTAR3D to be a valuable supplement to the existing RNA 3D structural analysis techniques.</p>

    <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
    <p>The 3D structure of non-coding RNAs is one of the primary determinants of their functions. Comparing their structures can help researchers understand their functional and evolutionary relationships. A variety of RNA 3D alignment algorithms have been developed. One of the popular strategies is to represent RNA 3D structures by one-dimensional sequences consisting of structural alphabets (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1–3</xref>), dihedral angles (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>) or unit vectors (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Then dynamic programming methods developed for sequence alignment are applied to the serialized data. The other group of methods takes into consideration the RNA base pairing interactions. For example, ARTS (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>) identifies a conserved stack consisting of two base pairs, followed by a global extension process. STAR3D (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>) and LocalSTAR3D (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>) detect maximal sets of compatible conserved stacks and use them to guide the alignment of the remaining part of the RNA structures. SETTER splits RNAs into GSSUs (generalized secondary structure units) and uses the highly conserved units to guide the alignment (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). RMalign (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>) and RNA-align (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>) combine sequence and secondary structure alignments and calculate size-independent scores to choose the best alignments.</p>
    <p>Most of the existing RNA 3D structural alignment methods rely on sequence order. However, consistency of the sequence orders in the input RNAs is not required for structural similarity. As illustrated in Figure <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, the multiloops colored red in three subfigures can form the same 3D structure, while their sequence orders are different. In each subfigure, the strands in double-helix regions are labeled in their sequence order. For the RNA structure in Figure <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">1A</xref>, when reading from the 5′ end, the order of the strands is A1–A2–A3–A4–A5–A6. Taking the RNA structure in Figure <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">1A</xref> as the reference, the corresponding strands are B3–B4–B5–B6–B1–B2 in Figure <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">1B</xref> and C5–C6–C1–C2–C3–C4 in Figure <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">1C</xref>. It should be noted that the orders of the strands in Figure <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">1B</xref> and <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">C</xref> are rotated. We define a pair of RNA 3D structures as a <italic toggle="yes">circular match</italic> if their 3D structures can be aligned when the sequence order is rotated in one of the RNAs. The terms circular match, circular alignment and rotated match are used interchangeably in this study. The circular matching problem for RNA structural motifs has been solved by aligning loop regions independently by using motif alignment tools such as RNAMotifScan and concatenating them in different ways (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13–16</xref>). This method does not work for global or local RNA 3D structure alignment because most of the RNA motifs are hairpin loops, internal loops or multiloops, while larger RNA structures may contain many loops and stacks. The number of ways in which these can be selected and concatenated increases exponentially with the number of loops and stacks.</p>

    <p>In recent years, circularly permutated RNA 3D structures, especially ribozymes, have drawn a lot of attention from researchers. For example, circularly permutated versions of group II introns were found in multiple bacterial phyla (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). A circularly permutated ribozyme scaffold was designed for engineering aptazymes and riboswitches (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). In addition to the circularly permutated RNA 3D structures, bioinformatics methods are employed to predict hairpin ribozymes in circular RNAs (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). Circularly comparing the RNA 3D structures can facilitate these studies. However, there is still a lack of computational tools that can find circular matches between RNA 3D structures.</p>
    <p>In this study, we report an RNA 3D structural alignment tool for circular matching, named CircularSTAR3D, to handle the circular matching problem. For a pair of RNAs, CircularSTAR3D outputs all the circular matches between them. It is important to note that the alignment procedure only relies on the structural information of the input RNAs. CircularSTAR3D first searches rotated matched internal loops and multiloops that are closed by conserved stacks. It then iteratively extends the stack sets and aligns the loop regions under the guidance of the aligned stacks. CircularSTAR3D has been tested on a non-redundant dataset, showing that circular matching is a common phenomenon in RNA 3D structures. We further examined three applications of circular matching, namely structural motifs, riboswitches and ribozymes.</p>

    <title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title>
    <sec id="SEC2-1">
      <title>Detect the conserved stack pairs</title>
      <p>CircularSTAR3D takes a pair of RNA 3D structures as input in PDB or PDBx/mmCIF format. CircularSTAR3D uses DSSR v1.5.3 (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>) to annotate the base pairing interactions. From the base pairing annotation and the atomic coordinates, CircularSTAR3D detects the conserved stacks between the input RNAs. The terms conserved stack and conserved stack pair are used interchangeably in this study. A stack is formed by a set of consecutive nested base pairs. A conserved stack pair is a pair of stacks with root mean square deviation (RMSD) lower than a threshold (the default value is 4  Å). Similar to STAR3D and LocalSTAR3D, CircularSTAR3D uses the conserved stacks to guide the alignment. Different from STAR3D and LocalSTAR3D, CircularSTAR3D allows circular matching when detecting the conserved stacks. An example is shown in Step 1 of Figure <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>. The circular matching in conserved stacks is indicated by red dashed lines. Stack 1 in RNA <italic toggle="yes">A</italic> and stack II in RNA <italic toggle="yes">B</italic> form a circular match. Stack 5 in RNA <italic toggle="yes">A</italic> and stack I in RNA <italic toggle="yes">B</italic> also form a circular match.</p>

In Step 2, the arrows indicate the stacks that close the corresponding loops. In Step 3, the secondary structures are represented by circular diagrams, where each arc in the diagram represents a stack. In Step 4, stack pairs 3–IV and 4–V are added into the alignment during local extension. In Step 5, the rotated matched RNA 3D structures between RNA <italic toggle="yes">A</italic> and RNA <italic toggle="yes">B</italic> are colored red.</p>

    <sec id="SEC2-2">
      <title>Identify matched loops closed by conserved stacks pairs</title>
      <p>For a pair of input RNAs, CircularSTAR3D may detect as many as a million conserved stacks due to partially overlapped stacks. STAR3D and LocalSTAR3D consider top-ranked conserved stacks with the longest length and the lowest RMSD. To achieve a short running time and high sensitivity for circular matched substructures, CircularSTAR3D considers all the stacks that close the internal and multiloops. Specifically, CircularSTAR3D first extracts the internal loops and multiloops from DSSR’s annotation for both input RNAs. Then it identifies the closing base pairs of each loop. The conserved stacks containing the closing base pairs are kept. Thus, a set of matched loops closed by conserved stacks are generated. In the example shown in Step 2 of Figure <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, loop <italic toggle="yes">A1</italic> is closed by stacks 1, 5 and 2, while loop <italic toggle="yes">B1</italic> is closed by stacks II, I and III. Conserved stack pairs 1–II, 5–I and 2–III are detected in Step 1. Therefore, loop <italic toggle="yes">A1</italic> and loop <italic toggle="yes">B1</italic> form a matched loop. For the same reason, loop <italic toggle="yes">A2</italic> and loop <italic toggle="yes">B2</italic> form a matched loop.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="SEC2-3">
      <title>Select the the rotated matched seed loops</title>
      <p>CircularSTAR3D focuses on circular matches between the input RNAs. Therefore, from the matched loops identified in the last subsection, it only keeps the potential rotated matched loop pairs as seed loops. The potential rotated matched seed loops are the loop pairs that are closed by at least one rotated matched stack pair. As shown in Step 3 of Figure <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, loop pair <italic toggle="yes">A1</italic>–<italic toggle="yes">B1</italic> is selected as a rotated matched seed loop because it is closed by rotated matched stack pairs 1–II and 5–I. Loop pair <italic toggle="yes">A2</italic>–<italic toggle="yes">B2</italic> is discarded.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="SEC2-4">
      <title>Local extension</title>
      <p>To find the consensus of conserved stacks, STAR3D and LocalSTAR3D construct compatible graphs by using juxtaposing and enclosing relationships, where each node represents a conserved stack. STAR3D calculates the maximum clique in the compatible graphs to generate a compatible stack pair set. To generate the local alignment, LocalSTAR3D adds adjacency constraints to the compatible graph and calculates the maximal subgraphs that are cliques with the compatible edges and connected components with the adjacency edges.</p>
      <p>Using the same idea, for each rotated matched seed loop, CircularSTAR3D calculates the maximal compatible stack pair sets. The initial conserved stack sets contain the conserved stacks closing the seed loops. Then new conserved stacks are added to the sets iteratively. Here we define a new type of topology relationship that allows circular matching. When adding a new conserved stack pair, it must be at the same interval as in the existing stack pairs. Figure <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> shows examples of compatible and incompatible stack pairs. The initial stack pair set includes the stack pairs 1–I, 2–II and 3–III. They divide both RNAs into intervals that are labeled with letters from <italic toggle="yes">a</italic> to <italic toggle="yes">f</italic>. The corresponding intervals in each RNA are labeled with the same letters. Now we evaluate the compatibility of the candidate conserved stack pair 4–IV with the initial stack pairs. For example, in Figure <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3A</xref>, the strands of both stack 4 and IV are at intervals <italic toggle="yes">d</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">f</italic>. Therefore conserved stack pair 4–IV in Figure <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3A</xref> is considered compatible with the initial conserved stack pairs. In Figure <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3C</xref>, the strands of stack 4 are at intervals <italic toggle="yes">d</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">f</italic>, while those of stack IV are at intervals <italic toggle="yes">b</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">f</italic>. Therefore conserved stack pair 4–IV in Figure <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3C</xref> is considered not to be compatible with the initial conserved stack pairs. Besides the compatibility requirement in topology, the RMSD for each set of compatible stack pairs must be lower than a threshold (the default value is 4  Å). This topology relationship takes into consideration the stack pairs that form pseudoknots. As shown in Figure <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3B</xref>, CircularSTAR3D allows crossed stacks, which is not supported by STAR3D and LocalSTAR3D.</p>
      <fig position="float" id="F3">

          <p>Examples of compatible and incompatible stack pairs. Each RNA has a counterclockwise 5′ to 3′ orientation. 1–I, 2–II and 3–III are the stack pairs selected in previous iterations. 4–IV is a candidate stack pair that needs to check the compatibility with the existing stack pairs.</p>
        </caption>
        <graphic xlink:href="gkad222fig3" position="float"/>
      </fig>
      <p>With the aforementioned topology relationship, CircularSTA3D uses a traversal strategy based on the Bron–Kerbosch algorithm to generate the maximal compatible stack pair sets (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). CircularSTAR3D iteratively searches for conserved stack pairs within a fixed distance from the outermost stack pairs. The default distance is 15 nucleotides, which is the same as the default value of LocalSTAR3D’s adjacent constraint. An example of one iteration is shown in Step 4 in Figure <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>. In the local extension phase, CircularSTAR3D does not remove the initial stack pairs during traceback to make sure that the rotated matched seed loops are always in the alignment. A rotated matched seed loop may associate with multiple stack pair sets because two loops may have circular matches in different ways, as illustrated in Figure <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. In the development of CircularSTAR3D, an alternative topology relationship was evaluated, which considers the compatibility for each triplet of conserved stack pairs. However, we found that pre-computing the triplet relationship was more time-consuming and required different processing methods for internal loops and multiloops.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="SEC2-5">
      <title>Assemble the circular matches</title>
      <p>STAR3D and LocalSTAR3D construct a tree-like consensus of conserved stack pairs. The mapping of the loop intervals in the input RNAs is obtained by traversing the tree-like consensus. CircularSTAR3D follows a similar process with two major differences. First, by using the new compatibility definition illustrated in Figure <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, CircularSTAR3D constructs a circular consensus. The conserved stack pairs divide the other regions in the RNA structures into circular ordered loop intervals. The mapping of the loop intervals can be obtained by traversing the circle. The second major difference is in the loop alignment. Modifications are made in CircularSTAR3D to allow circular matching for each loop pair. As the example shows in Step 4 in Figure <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, the hairpin loop closed by stack 5 in RNA <italic toggle="yes">A</italic> maps to the dangling ends linked to stack I in RNA <italic toggle="yes">B</italic>. Taking the sequence order in RNA <italic toggle="yes">A</italic> as the reference, CircularSTAR3D will align the 3′ end before the 5′ end in RNA <italic toggle="yes">B</italic>.</p>
      <p>Similar to LocalSTAR3D (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>), after aligning the stacks and the loop regions, CircularSTAR3D assembles them into candidate local alignments and filters the candidates with RMSD greater than a threshold (the default value is 4  Å). For each local alignment, CircularSTAR3D calculates an alignment score based on the number of aligned, deleted and inserted nucleotides. The local alignments in the output are first sorted by the alignment scores, and then by the RMSD values.</p>

      <title>Alignment quality assessment with the R-FSCOR dataset</title>
      <p>We use the R-FSCOR dataset to evaluate the alignment quality of CircularSTAR3D. The R-FSCOR dataset is a non-redundant RNA structure list that has been used as the benchmark dataset in previous RNA 3D structure alignment studies (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). In this study, the implementation of CircularSTAR3D was tested on a Linux desktop with an Intel Core i7-8700 CPU. We used CircularSTAR3D to generate the all-to-all alignments for the RNAs in the R-FSCOR dataset. The combination of the 192 RNAs in the R-FSCOR dataset generates 18 336 RNA pairs in total (we do not compare an RNA with itself). CircularSTAR3D output circular alignments for 2966 RNA pairs (16.2% of total RNA pairs). CircularSTAR3D did not output alignments when there is no conserved stack or no rotated matched loop detected in the input RNA pairs.</p>
      <p>We noticed that local RNA structural alignment tools may generate fragmented alignments. In these cases, it is not suitable to evaluate the alignments using the total number of aligned nucleotides or base pairs. When evaluating our local alignment tool LocalSTAR3D (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>), we defined Aligned Connected Structure (ACS), Percentage of Connected Structural Identity (PCSI) and Percentage of aligned Connected Secondary Structure (PCSS). An ACS is an aligned substructure where for each nucleotide, there is a nucleotide in this substructure which either is within a distance threshold from it (five nucleotides in our study) or forms a base pair with it. Based on the definition of ACS, PCSI is defined as the percentage of aligned nucleotides within 4  Å in the largest ACS with respect to the length of the shorter sequence, and PCSS is defined as the percentage of aligned base pairs within 4 Å in the largest ACS with respect to the smaller number of base pairs in the input RNAs. In this study, we followed the evaluation methods in LocalSTAR3D and used the same metrics (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>).</p>
      <p>To the best of our knowledge, there are no existing tools that can find the rotated matched RNA 3D structures. Therefore, we cannot assess CircularSTAR3D’s alignment quality by comparing it with other tools. CircularSTAR3D calculates the alignment by a ‘two-step’ strategy, identification of rotated matched seed loops and the local extension. Here we investigated the quality of each step’s results by using PCSI and PCSS. Similar to LocalSTAR3D, CircularSTAR3D was designed to report more than one aligned region between an input RNA pair. Therefore, we assessed the seed loops and the alignments after the local extension in the top two alignments for each input RNA pair.</p>
      <p>The cumulative frequencies of the PCSI and PCSS for the best alignments are shown in Figure <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>. In the best alignments, the average PCSI and PCSS values of the seed loops are 0.118 and 0.095 (red curves). The average PCSI and PCSS values of the alignments after the local extension are 0.363 and 0.325 (blue curves). The PCSI and PCSS values of the alignments after the local extension are about three times those of the seed loops. The cumulative frequencies of the PCSI and PCSS for the second best alignments are shown in Supplementary Figure S1. In the second best alignments, the average PCSI and PCSS values are 0.114 and 0.091 for the seed loops (red curves) and 0.348 and 0.306 for the alignments after local extension (blue curves). The differences in average PCSI and PCSS between the best alignments and the second best alignments are small (0.017 and 0.019), which suggests that the second best alignments are also potential candidates for circular match analysis.</p>

      <title>Structural alignments for motifs</title>
      <p>Kink-turn motifs are well-known RNA internal loop motifs with sharp turns (kinks) (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). For example, in the <italic toggle="yes">Haloarcula marismortui</italic> 23S rRNA (PDB 1s72, chain 0), nine instances of kink-turn motifs have been identified (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). By using a kink-turn 3D structure (PDB 4bw0, chain A) (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>) as the query, LocalSTAR3D found six out of the nine kink-turn motif instances (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Using the same query, CircularSTAR3D found two additional kink-turn motif instances. CircularSTAR3D and LocalSTAR3D found eight out of nine kink-turn motif instances in total. The additional two instances found by CircularSTAR3D are shown in Supplementary Figure S2.</p>
      <p>In addition to the internal loop motifs, CircularSTAR3D can also detect circular matching instances for multiloop motifs. An example is shown in Figure <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>. This multiloop motif was first discovered by aligning loop regions with RNAMotifScan and enumerating different ways to concatenate them (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). The motif instances can be found in an env22 twister ribozyme (PDB 4rge, chain B) (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>) and rRNAs. Twister is a small self-cleaving ribozyme that can be found in many bacteria and eukaryota (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). The main component of the twister ribozyme is a three-way multiloop. Interestingly, this three-way multiloop can be rotated matched to a substructure present in rRNAs. Figure <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">5</xref> shows the instance in <italic toggle="yes">H. marismortui</italic> 23S rRNA (PDB 1s72, chain 0). The instances in three other rRNAs are shown in Supplementary Figure S3. In the alignments of these motif instances, only two of the three conserved stacks are detected and used as anchors. However, CircularSTAR3D still includes the whole multiloop in the alignment, illustrating the robustness of our method. Compared with the alignments generated by RNAMotifScan (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>), CircularSTAR3D aligns not only the multiloops but also the substructures around them. More importantly, CircularSTAR3D’s alignments contain the self-cleavage sites, U5 and A6 in the twister ribozyme, which are colored green in the 3D structures. The self-cleavage sites adopt a splayed-apart conformation that is important to cleavage catalysis and structural integrity. The corresponding sites in rRNAs share a similar splayed-apart conformation, suggesting potential functional relationships.</p>

      <title>Structural alignments for riboswitches</title>
      <p>Riboswitches are metabolite-binding RNAs that are important in gene expression regulation (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). Distinct classes of riboswitches are established based on the sequence and structure conservation (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). In most riboswitch classes, the aptamer domains are more conserved than the gene control platform domains. This is because the aptamer domain must fold into a specific structure to bind to the metabolites. For example, the aptamer domain in SAM-II has a classical or H-type pseudoknot structure (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>).</p>
      <p>We downloaded the riboswitch structures in the ‘Representative Sets of RNA 3D Structures’ list (version 3.141) on the BGSU RNA site by using ‘riboswitch’ as the search filter (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). The dataset contains 59 representative riboswitch structures. CircularSTAR3D was used to perform all-to-all alignment for the structures in this dataset. We found 68 alignments that contain circular matches with positive alignment scores and further obtained 50 alignments that have better coverage than the best alignments generated by LocalSTAR3D (see <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table S1</xref>). It should be noted that all these alignments are between different riboswitch classes. An example is shown in Figure <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>, where the blue tube is a cobalamin riboswitch (PDB 4frn, chain B) (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>) and the red tube is an FMN riboswitch (PDB 3f2x, chain X) (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). Both RNA structures are in the ligand-binding status. Although these two riboswitches bind different metabolites and only share 56.8% sequence identity, the 3D structures of their aptamer domains are surprisingly similar to each other. Figure <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">6A</xref> shows the CircularSTAR3D’s alignment for these two riboswitches. The alignment contains 55 nucleotides and has an RMSD of 3.21  Å. This similarity may suggest common features in the aptamer domain across different riboswitch classes. Interestingly, the similarity can only be detected by circular matching. The best alignment generated by LocalSTAR3D is shown in Figure <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">6B</xref>, which only includes a small portion of each riboswitch. Another example of the circular match in riboswitches we found is between a yybP–ykoY riboswitch from <italic toggle="yes">Escherichia coli</italic> (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>) and a PRPP riboswitch from <italic toggle="yes">Thermoanaerobacter mathranii</italic> (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). This alignment is shown in Supplementary Figure S4. The yybP–ykoY riboswitch binds Mn<sup>2+</sup> and protects cells against Mn<sup>2+</sup> toxicity by regulating a P-type ATPase (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). The PRPP riboswitch binds a different ligand, phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate (PRPP). These two riboswitches share a similar multiloop structure that contains 63 nucleotides and has an RMSD of 3.70  Å. The common structure contains their aptamer domains and can only be found by circular matching.</p>

      <title>Structural alignments for ribozymes</title>
      <p>Ribozymes are RNA molecules that have catalytic functions. Circular matching may help researchers study naturally occurring ribozymes as well as design synthetic ribozymes. A circularly permutated ribozyme was designed to study the structure and function of a lariat capping ribozyme (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). We used CircularSTAR3D and LocalSTAR3D to compare the original ribozyme and its circularly permutated version. As shown in Supplementary Figure S5, LocalSTAR3D only captured the non-rotated match, while CircularSTAR3D aligned the whole ribozymes as expected.</p>
      <p>To comprehensively identify the circular matches in ribozymes, we downloaded a set of ribozyme structures in the ‘Representative Sets of RNA 3D Structures’ list (version 3.141) (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>), which contains 34 ribozyme structures. CircularSTAR3D was used to find the conserved circular matches among these ribozyme structures. CircularSTAR3D generated 27 circular alignments with positive alignment scores, out of which 16 alignments have better coverage than the best alignments of LocalSTAR3D (see <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table S2</xref>). An example of the alignments is shown in Figure <xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>, where the red tube is a class I ligase ribozyme (PDB 3hhn, chain E) (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>) and the blue tube is a hammerhead ribozyme (PDB 2qus, chain A) (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). CircularSTAR3D found a circular match of 35 nucleotides around a rotated matched multiloop (two out of three stems are aligned). In addition, we found that the active sites of both ribozymes are at almost the same positions in the multiloop (colored violet in the class I ligase ribozyme and cyan in the hammerhead ribozyme). This similarity may suggest common features across different classes of ribozymes. LocalSTAR3D found a non-rotated match of 33 nucleotides. However, the match does not include the active sites.</p>

    <title>DISCUSSION</title>
    <p>In this study, we presented a novel computational tool for circular matching, named CircularSTAR3D. It can detect the circular matches between the input RNA structures. CircularSTAR3D first identifies the rotated matched internal loops and multiloops in the input RNAs. Then it extends from all the conserved stack pairs that close these loops. This ‘two-step’ strategy is derived based on two observations. First, internal loops and multiloops can have circular matches when concatenating the loop regions in different ways. The hairpin loops only have one loop region and do not have circular alignment. Second, a pair of rotated matched loops are closed by at least one rotated matched stack pair. By integrating these two properties into the design, we developed CircularSTAR3D as a new ‘stack-based’ RNA 3D structure alignment algorithm. By using the aligned stacks as anchors, CircularSTAR3D avoids the all-to-all loop matching and enumerating different ways in which concatenation can occur. In most cases, the current implementation can find all rotated regions between two RNA 3D structures in 10 s on a modern desktop. We provide CircularSTAR3D and LocalSTAR3D in one software package so that users can generate both rotated and non-rotated matches.</p>
    <p>Besides the alignment examples we have shown in the Results, a potential application is to integrate it into RNA clustering pipelines along with STAR3D and LocalSTAR3D. CircularSTAR3D outputs an alignment score to sort the aligned regions in a pair of RNA 3D structures. For clustering applications, we need to compare the alignments from different pairs of input RNAs, and a size-independent score should be used for that purpose, such as RMscore (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>) and TM-score (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Another direction is to integrate the long-range interaction into the local extension process. Similar to LocalSTAR3D, CircularSTAR3D considers a circular match as a collection of adjacent rotated matched stacks and loops. We can replace the sequential adjacency constraint with the spatial adjacency constraint to enable the detection of conserved components with long-range interactions, even the conserved interactions between different molecules.</p>
