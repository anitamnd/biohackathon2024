      <p id="P1">Acquired genomic structural variants (SVs) are major hallmarks of the cancer genome, but they are challenging to reconstruct from short-read sequencing data. Here, we exploit the long-reads of the nanopore platform using our customized pipeline, <italic>Picky</italic> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/TheJacksonLaboratory/Picky">https://github.com/TheJacksonLaboratory/Picky</ext-link>), to reveal SVs of diverse architecture in a breast cancer model. We identified the full spectrum of SVs with superior specificity and sensitivity relative to short-read analyses and uncovered repetitive DNA as the major source of variation. Examination of the genome-wide breakpoints at nucleotide-resolution uncovered micro-insertions as the common structural features associated with SVs. Breakpoint density across the genome is associated with propensity for inter-chromosomal connectivity and enriched in promoters and transcribed regions of the genome. Furthermore, an over-representation of reciprocal translocations from chromosomal double-crossovers was observed through phased SVs. We demonstrated that <italic>Picky</italic> analysis is an effective tool to uncover comprehensive SVs in cancer genomes from long-read data.</p>

    <title>Introduction</title>
    <p id="P2">Genomic structural variation is prevalent in the human genome<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> and includes deletions, insertions, duplications, inversions, and translocations. Collectively, these structural variants (SVs) account for a significant portion of genome heterogeneity between individuals<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> and human populations<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>. Many cancer genomes have been found to harbor significant structural variation, and specific SVs are considered to be instrumental in promoting tumor progression by disrupting gene structures, dysregulating gene expression, creating fusing transcription units or increasing gene copy number<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>–<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>. The detection of specific SVs can be used as the basis for tumor classification and potentially of prognostic value for tumor severity and therapeutic response<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>–<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>. However, the molecular organization of various SV classes and the mechanisms that generate them are not well understood.</p>
    <p id="P3">Advances in sequencing technology coupled with improvements in computational algorithms have greatly enhanced our understanding of the abundance, diversity, and molecular features of SVs across human populations<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> and disease<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>. However, short-read sequencing approaches, although perform well on subset of SVs types<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>, are limited to fully disclose the complexity and spectrum of SVs<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>. Specifically, paired-end short reads are not sufficiently sensitive to detect small SVs, and lack the nucleotide-level of detail for analysis of the breakpoints that flank SVs. They are also unable to decipher complex SV patterns. Therefore, long-read sequencing approaches and analytic methods are essential to facilitate comprehensive and unbiased SV profiling, particularly useful for resolving complex structural rearrangements in cancer genomes<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>–<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>.</p>
    <p id="P4">Recent progress in nanopore single-molecule sequencing offers to extend sequencing read length and throughput<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>–<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>. Here we introduce a computational analysis pipeline, named <italic>Picky</italic>, to detect the full spectrum of SVs and characterize their genomic breakpoints with high specificity and sensitivity. Applying <italic>Picky</italic> to a moderate coverage of nanopore sequences in a well-studied breast cancer cell line HCC1187<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>, we classified a wide range of SVs and characterized the breakpoints in detail.</p>

      <title>Applying nanopore long read sequencing and <italic>Picky</italic> analysis pipeline to detect SVs</title>
      <p id="P5">We performed total of 15 MinION runs and generated 7.9 Gb of the aligned 2D reads of different sizes (3–4 Kb and 12 Kb) for the HCC1187 genome (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 1</xref>, see Online Methods). Details of the read length distribution, yield and accuracy of nanopore long read sequencing were provided in <xref rid="SD3" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Note</xref>. <italic>Picky</italic> probes long reads in three consecutive steps: read alignment to a reference genome, optimal alignment merge/selection, and SV classification (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>). <italic>Picky</italic> was designed to enable SV calls from alignments from different aligners including NGMLR<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> and minimap2<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/TheJacksonLaboratory/Picky/wiki/Using-an-Alternative-Aligner">https://github.com/TheJacksonLaboratory/Picky/wiki/Using-an-Alternative-Aligner</ext-link>). Here, we adopts LAST<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> to perform genome alignment. Alignments for each read were then evaluated for their quality and spurious alignments were filtered out based on poor alignment score or low percentage identity. Next, alignments for different segments of a long read were picked and merged. We applied a greedy seed-and-extension algorithm to stitch segments together and then combined segments that maximized coverage for each long read. Only reads with ≥ 70% genome alignments across their total length were used for further analysis. Based on the order and the distance between the non-contiguous alignments, <italic>Picky</italic> assigned split reads into seven classes of SVs: inversion (INV), translocation (TLC), tandem duplication (TD), complete tandem duplication resided within a read segment (TDC) or a duplication junction spanned across a read segment (TDJ), simple insertion (INS) or deletion (DEL), and INDEL (both INS and DEL resided within a read segment) (see Online Methods).</p>
      <p id="P6">We applied <italic>Picky</italic> to 796,029 2D reads to detect and classify SVs (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>). From 53,701 split reads, <italic>Picky</italic> detected a total of 34,100 unique SVs and their corresponding 66,660 breakpoints, classified them into 220 inversions, 1,911 translocations, 3,567 tandem duplications and 28,402 insertions, deletions and INDEL (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Tables 2 and 3</xref>). The percentage of reads containing breakpoints (i.e. split reads) positively correlated with DNA read lengths (<xref rid="SD3" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>). Furthermore, 4% (2,177 of 53,701) of split reads contained more than two breakpoints, which indicates the presence of multiple SVs on the same chromosomes. This phasing information is uniquely provided by long read sequencing. In contrast to short read SV callers such as LUMPY<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup>, which assumes no more than two uniquely mapped segments and one breakpoint per split read, <italic>Picky</italic> incorporates an algorithmic rationale to interpret long reads spanning multiple breakpoints that may even encompass the entire SV. Examples of a 0.9-Kb dinucleotide (TA)<sub>n</sub> microsatellite TD (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>) and a complex TLC identified by <italic>Picky</italic> but were either misclassified or undetected by short-read based analysis (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>). Through examination of adjacent SVs via multiple breakpoints within individual long reads, we found 67 co-occurring translocations (TLC-TLC), representing an enrichment of 3.09 (obs/exp) over the background (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 2a,b</xref>). Interestingly, 25 of these dual-translocation events were reciprocal (i.e. chromosome A-B-A), suggesting that double-crossovers between two non-homologous chromosomes could be a common mode to generate translocation.</p>

      <title>The accuracy of <italic>Picky</italic> in SV detection</title>
      <p id="P7">To confirm the accuracy of <italic>Picky</italic>, we validated over 200 SV events via PCR across either identified breakpoint junctions (TLCs, INVs and TDJs) or full-length rearranged regions (INSs, DELs and TDCs) (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 3a–f</xref> and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 4</xref>, see Online Methods). 100% and 79% of the predicted SVs supported by multiple and single reads were validated, respectively (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 4a</xref>). We also observed multiple PCR fragments amplified from both normal and rearranged haplotypes, suggesting the presence of heterozygosity in SV containing loci (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 5a</xref>). To quantify the extent of heterozygosity, we examined 50 randomly selected rearranged loci covered by multiple reads from each SV class and determined the number of loci spanned by reads from both the normal and variant haplotypes found in the same locus (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 5b</xref>). We observed extensive heterozygosity of SVs among different classes, ranging from 44% in TDC to 100% in INV, INDEL and TLC (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 5c</xref>). Using the 176 validated SVs as the reference data set, we further compared the specificity between nanopore long read and short read analyses. As shown, short-read sequencing analysis by LUMPY could only accurately detect a subset of SV classes (TLC, TDJ and DEL) given sufficient coverage (&gt; 30X), but drastically underperformed in classifying short-span TDs (TDC) and inversions, and was unable to unambiguously define insertion events (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 4b</xref>). To evaluate the sensitivity of <italic>Picky</italic>, we compared SV detected between the nanopore long-read (LR) and illumina short-read (SR) data in HCC1187 at either lower depth (10X)<sup><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 4c</xref>) or higher depth (102X) (SRA accession SRX969058). Comparing with the SVs found by high depth SR data, we observed that vast majority (93%–95%) of SVs found in the long-read data were unique and LR specific SVs exhibit distinct features like short span size (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 6a, b</xref>).</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="S5" sec-type="methods">
      <title>Comparison of <italic>Picky</italic> with other long-read based SV analysis tools</title>
      <p id="P8">Next, we compared <italic>Picky</italic> to two long-read SV analysis tools NanoSV<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> and Sniffles<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> to evaluate their relative sensitivity as well as accuracy. <italic>Picky</italic> comprises unique features in both the alignment scheme and SV detection (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 7</xref>). We analyzed the nanopore data from the well-studied NA12878 human genome<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> and used the insertions and deletions determined by the PacBio long-read data from the same genome<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> as the reference call sets. We focused our assessment based on: 1) the sensitivity and precision of <italic>Picky</italic> to recall known SVs; 2) the ability of <italic>Picky</italic> to uncover new SVs. Under the identical comparison parameters (see Online Methods), <italic>Picky</italic> recalls 5,246 (66%) of the 7,903 reference deletion calls, comparable to 5,251 (66%) and 5,102 (65%) deletions recalled by Sniffles and NanoSV, respectively. While the deletions recalled by each of the three programs were largely overlapped, <italic>Picky</italic> recaptured highest numbers of deletions not found by other two methods across different thresholds (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref>), suggesting its highly sensitive nature in deletion detection. This was also evident by the total numbers of deletions called by each of the pipelines. <italic>Picky</italic> detected 338,701 deletions, 3- and 13-fold higher than the numbers of deletions uncovered by Sniffles and NanoSV. Of which, 77% of them were <italic>Picky</italic>-specific, significantly higher than the 36% and 11% of the Sniffles- and NanoSV-specific deletions. In insertions, <italic>Picky</italic> recalled 3,222 (28%) of the reference INS, while the Sniffles and NanoSV called 4,429 (39%) and 3,815 (33%), respectively. The slightly lower number of INS supported by <italic>Picky</italic> was resulted from the priority of SV classification used by different programs when multiple types of SVs were detected within the same locus (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 7</xref>). In <italic>Picky</italic>, TD was assigned over INS while in NanoSV and Sniffles, INS was chosen over duplication. When all the INS and TD were combined from each program, <italic>Picky</italic> again showed better sensitivity with 5–8-fold more calls than Sniffles and NanoSV. Majority of the TD and DUP (72–78%) detected by NanoSV and Sniffles overlapped with those found in <italic>Picky</italic>, while 87% of the <italic>Picky</italic> calls were new.</p>

      <title>Nanopore long reads uncovered short-span SVs enriched in repetitive DNA sequences</title>
      <p id="P9">SVs identified in HCC1187 genome exhibit a broad span distribution, ranging from 20 bp up to 100 Mb (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref> and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 3</xref>). Comparing to the short-read analysis, <italic>Picky</italic> uniquely detects short SVs through long reads spanning across the entire variable regions. Vast majority of the INSs, DELs and TDCs span less than 1Kb with notable peaks around 300 bp (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref> and <xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 8a</xref>), suggesting that they are enriched with repetitive sequences. When we examined their repeat content, simple INSs, DELs and TDCs exhibited a bimodal distribution based on the fraction of the SVs overlapping with repetitive sequence regions (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>) and the SINE and simple repeats are the predominant enriched repeat classes (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c</xref> and <xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 8b,c</xref>). Therefore, small-size INSs, DELs and TDs account for the majority of the SVs detected in HCC1187 genome and they are predominantly copy number variation in repetitive sequence regions.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="S7">
      <title>Micro-insertion is a prevalent structural feature found within breakpoint junctions</title>
      <p id="P10">Nanopore split reads aligned across SV junctions enable us to characterize breakpoint junctions in their entirety at nucleotide-resolution. We observed additional non-aligned inserted sequences within the 66,660 breakpoints from different SV types, ranged from 57% (DELs) to 14% (TLCs) (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3d</xref>). The majority of these inserted sequences was less than 500 bp, although some of them can be as long as 6 Kb (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3d</xref>), and their validity was confirmed by PacBio SMRT sequencing method (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 9a,b</xref>, see Online Methods). BLASTing these insertions against the NCBI non-redundant nucleotide database reveals that 90% of the inserted DNA pieces are completely novel with no homology to any known sequences. The small size of these sequences and their lack of significant homology with known sequences, are consistent with the “genomic shards” resulted from non-templated DNA synthesis at the rearrangement junctions observed in a few selective rearrangement events<sup><xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup>. Besides the micro-insertions, short stretches (usually 2–6 nucleotides) of identical sequence, known as overlapping microhomology<sup><xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup>, were frequently spotted at SV breakpoint junctions (highlighted in <xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>). The microhomology, together with the micro-insertions, resided within breakpoint junctions suggest that <italic>de novo</italic> DNA synthesis is a potential mechanism used in the non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) during genomic rearrangement repair process.</p>

    <sec id="S8" sec-type="background">
      <title>Breakpoint landscapes is associated with chromatin organization and transcriptional regulation</title>
      <p id="P11">The distribution of the large numbers of SVs reflects the highly jumbled nature of HCC1187 genome (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref>). High frequency translocations between t(2;19), t(2;17), t(1;8) and t(10:13) were consistent with the translocations previously described by SKY (spectral karyotyping)<sup><xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup>. The density of breakpoint was found to associate with the fraction of genome annotated with gene coding regions. Using 1 Mb genomic span as the bin size, the top 10% breakpoint dense regions have a significantly higher percent of nucleotides coding for genes than the bottom 10% breakpoint poor regions (<italic>P</italic> = 2.2e-16) (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b</xref>); suggesting high transcription activity could be one of the mechanisms impacting genome fragility. Interestingly, two of the hyper-density breakpoint loci (2q21.3–2q22.1; 65 breakpoints/Mb and 4q35; 139 breakpoints/Mb; highlighted in <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref>) had very high (within top 10 percentile) inter-chromosomal contact probability (ICP) values, the propensity of a region to form inter-chromosomal contacts within interphase nucleus<sup><xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup>, found in the GM12878 cell line. Further analysis on the whole genome level indicated a positive correlation between ICP and breakpoint count (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4c</xref>). This correlation raises the possibility that chromosome regions with frequent exposure to other chromosome and/or residing at the exterior of a chromosome territory, could be more prone to chromosomal breaks compared to the protected regions deeper inside the chromosome territory. These observations further support that intermingling of chromatin organization directly influences the structural properties associated with elevated frequency of DNA double strand breaks<sup><xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup>.</p>

Interestingly, repeat-rich versus repeat-poor TDs exhibited contrasting distribution patterns (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 10b</xref>). SVs occurring in promoters/regulatory elements can selectively lead to oncogene activation or tumor suppressor gene inactivation, which are likely to be cancer specific. To test this, we determined the expressions of genes affected by the SVs from 113 TNBC and 851 non-TNBC tissues of the breast carcinoma (BRCA) dataset within the cancer genome atlas (TCGA)<sup><xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup>. In contrast to the data from the permutation and the control genes, the expression of 1,260 coding genes disrupted by the major SV classes (DEL, INDEL and TD) effectively distinguished TNBC from non-TNBC types (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4e</xref> and <xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 11</xref>), highlighting the functional impacts of SV analysis and its link to tumor molecular classification.</p>

    <title>Discussion</title>
    <p id="P13">Existing short read sequencing and SV analysis tools are limited in resolving complex structural variation and delineating molecular structures of breakpoints, particularly within repetitive regions.</p>
    <p id="P14">Our breakpoint analysis suggests the linkage between the propensity of inter-chromosomal connectivity and frequency of genomic lesions. Nuclear regions with high transcriptional activity are shown to have extensive inter-chromatin contacts<sup><xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup>. Therefore, the accessibility and conformation in the active chromatin domains may provide the structural basis of genome fragility. The enrichment of breakpoints in the regulatory repertoire of the genome further implicates that genome rearrangement can reconfigure the transcriptional program in the cancer transformation process. Expanding the high-resolution of SV analysis should further our understanding of the homeostasis between genome architecture, variation and carcinogenesis.</p>
    <p id="P15">Long-read sequencing possesses many unique features that improve from the current state of SV detection. Yield and accuracy from nanopore has been dramatically improved for the past year, including a new basecaller Scrappie<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>. Given the superior alignment specificity, higher resolution and broader utility of single molecule long-read data, we anticipate that there will be soon a paradigm shift on the sequencing approaches for genome-wide, haplotype-specific structural analysis; which will reveal new insights in the diversity and complexity of human genome variation and the mechanisms of their generation during tumorigenesis.</p>

      <p id="P16">High molecular weight DNA was extracted from HCC1187 cells by MagAttract HMW DNA Kit (Qiagen, 67563) followed the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, 1 × 10<sup>6</sup> frozen cells were lysed with 220 μL of Buffer ATL, 20 μL Proteinase K and incubated overnight at 56°C with 900 rpm. 4 μL RNase A was added to cleave RNA. 150 μL Buffer AL, 280 μL Buffer MB and 40 μL MagAttract Suspension G beads were then added to capture the HMW DNA. Next, the beads were cleaned up by 700 μL Buffer MW1, Buffer PE and NFW followed by elution with 150 μL Buffer AE. Nanopore sequencing libraries were prepared according to the target size and the sequencing kits supplied by Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 5</xref>). HMW genomic DNA was fragmented by either miniTUBE Blue (Covaris, 520065, for 3 Kb), miniTUBE Red (Covaris, 520066, for 5 Kb) or g-TUBE (Covaris, 520079, for 8 Kb and 12 Kb). For libraries targeted at 12 Kb, size selection was performed for sheared fragments larger than 10 Kb using 0.75% agarose cassette (Sage Science, BLF7510) by Blue Pippin<sup>™</sup> DNA Size Selection System. For libraries of less than 10 Kb, AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter, A63881) were used for clean-up. Next, libraries were prepared according to recommendation by ONT. Briefly, NEBNext FFPE RepairMix (NEB, M6630) was added to repair nicks in the DNA. Then end-repair and dA-tailing were performed using NEBNext Ultra II End-Repair/dA-tailing Module (NEB, E7546). For 2D libraries (WTD01-WTD13), we prepared the ligation reaction as below: 38 μL water (DNA), 10 μL Adapter Mix (AMX), 2 μL Hairpin Adapter (HPA) and 50 μL Blunt/TA Ligase Master Mix (New England Biolabs, M0367). Ligation was performed at room temperature for 15 minutes. 1 μL Hairpin Tether (HPT) was added to the reaction and incubated at room temperature for 15 minutes. Then 50 μL MyOne C1 beads (Thermo Fisher, 65001) beads were prewashed twice with 100 μL Bead Binding Buffer (BBB). The MyOne C1 beads resuspended in 100 μL BBB were added to the ligated DNA reaction and incubated on a rotator at room temperature for 15 minutes. The beads were washed twice with 150 μL BBB and eluted in 25 μL Elution Buffer (ELB). For 1D libraries (WTD14-WTD15), we prepared the ligation reaction as below: 30 μL water (DNA), 20 μL Adapter Mix (AMX) and 50 μL Blunt/TA Ligase Master Mix (New England Biolabs, M0367). Ligation was also performed at room temperature for 15 minutes. The AMPure XP beads were resuspended at room temperature by vortex. 40 μL of beads were added into the ligation product. The beads were washed twice with 140 μL Adapter Bead Binding (ABB) buffer and eluted in 25 μL Elution Buffer (ELB). The eluted product was the adaptor-ligated library as the Pre-sequencing Mix (PSM) used in nanopore sequencing.</p>

Real-time basecalling was performed on EPI2ME cloud platform (ONT). Read sequences were extracted from base-called fastf5 files by Poretools (version 0.5.1) to generate fastq file. All 2D reads from WTD01-13 (2D ligation libraries) and all 1D reads from WTD14 and WTD15 (1D ligation libraries) were used for subsequent analysis.</p>

      <p id="P18">High molecular weight DNA was mechanically sheared and size selected followed by dividing into two aliquots; one was used to prepare template for PacBio sequencing on RSII and one was used to prepare template for nanopore sequencing on MinION. The PacBio genomic DNA library prep was performed according to the manufacturer’s instruction (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.pacb.com/support/documentation/">http://www.pacb.com/support/documentation/</ext-link>). In brief, 2 μg of purified DNA was taken into library construction by the SMRTbellTM Template Prep Kit 1.0 (Pacific Biosciences). DNA fragments were repaired using the DNA damage repair solution at 37°C for 60 minutes and at 4°C for 1 minute. DNA ends were end-repaired by adding 2.0 μL End Repair Mix to the reaction, which was incubated at 25°C for 5 minutes and at 4°C for 1 minute, followed by a 0.55X AMPure XP purification step. 32 μL End-repaired DNA was added 1.0 μL 20 μM Annealed Blunt Adapter, 4.0 μL Template Prep Buffer, 2.0 μL 1 mM ATP low and 1.0 μL 30 U/μL Ligase. The reaction was incubated at 25°C for 16 hours (overnight) and then at 65°C for 10 minutes to inactive the ligase. To remove failed ligation fragments, 1.0 μL 100 U/μL Exo III and 1.0 μL 10 U/μL Exo VII were directly added to the ligation product incubated at 37°C for 60 minutes and at 4°C for 1 minute. A 0.55X AMPure XP purification step was performed to remove all adapter dimers and contaminants, then followed additional two 0.4X AMPure XP purification steps to remove the fragments less than 2 Kb. The profile of the library was checked by Agilent High Sensitivity DNA chip (Agilent Technologies). The library was sequenced on PacBio RS II instrument using MagBead OneCellPerWell protocol (movie length of 300 minutes, on-plate loading concentration of 0.15 nM). The PacBio sequencing data was processed by the PacBio SMRT Portal pipeline of Read of Insert with the parameters “Minimum Number of Passes = 0” and “Minimum Predicted Accuracy = 0.75”.</p>

      <title><italic>Picky</italic> pipeline for SV detection</title>
      <p id="P19">The reads (in fastq format) were processed with an in-house assembled analysis pipeline <italic>Picky</italic> (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>). Briefly, <italic>Picky</italic> is composed of three steps: aligning nanopore reads to the reference genome, picking the best alignments and calling structural variants (SVs).</p>
      <p id="P20"><italic>Picky</italic> uses the LAST aligner (last755)<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> to produce all high-scoring segment pairs (HSPs) of each nanopore read against the human genome (hg19). For high sensitivity, we adopted the scoring scheme (reward = 1, penalty = −1, gap open = 0, gap extension = 2) used in NCBI megaBLAST (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK279678/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK279678/</ext-link>).</p>
      <p id="P21">Next, <italic>Picky</italic> (command: selectRep) produces the read alignment by stitching the segments from LAST with a greedy seed-and-extend strategy to maximize the coverage of the read by the selected co-linear segments. Spurious aligned segments (%Identity &lt; 55 or EG2 &gt; 1.7e-12) were discarded. EG2 is defined by LAST as the expected number of alignments with greater or equal score, between two randomly-shuffled sequences of length 1 billion each. The remaining segments were ranked according to probability of random hit and alignment score. <italic>Picky</italic> selectRep then performed the seed-and-extend process by selecting as seed candidate alignment a highest ranked segment among the remaining segments, and linking this seed candidate alignment with the remaining segments whose read coordinates were in the vicinity of the candidate seed alignment read coordinates. The linking of segment(s) produced a linked alignment extension, equivalent to a read alignment, when its total coverage spanned ≥ 70% of the read. The seed-and-extend process repeated until all segments had been selected as seed candidate alignment. Linked alignment extensions with a combined score within 90% of the best combined score were all consider putative read alignments. The implementation specifics can be found in public site <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/TheJacksonLaboratory/Picky/wiki">https://github.com/TheJacksonLaboratory/Picky/wiki</ext-link>.</p>
      <p id="P22">Finally, SV calling was performed with <italic>Picky</italic>’s callSV command. Read with a single putative read alignment with linked segment(s), known as split-read, contains putative SV. <italic>Picky</italic> computed the distances between adjacent pair of segments in a split-read in both the reference genome-coordinate (sDiff) and the read-coordinates (qDiff). The distances sDiff and qDiff along with chromosome and alignment strand was used to detect the SV present as in <xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 12</xref>. <italic>Picky</italic> assigned split reads into seven classes of SVs: inversion (INV): segments aligned to the same chromosome but in different orientations; translocation (TLC): segments aligned to different chromosomes; tandem duplication (TD): segments contain a complete duplicated region (TDC) or only span across a duplication junction (TDJ); simple insertion (INS) or deletion (DEL), segments correspond to the same chromosomal region in the same orientation but either flank a sequence that does not match the reference genome or lack an intervening sequence observed in the reference genome, respectively; and (INDEL), segments indicate both INS and DEL for the same split read. Full list of called SVs can be found in <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 3</xref>.</p>
      <p id="P23"><italic>Picky</italic> is also conscious of the homopolymer undercalling issue observed in nanopore sequences decoded by the Metrichor RNN basecalling algorithm. Specifically, homopolymers beyond five identical bases in all four nucleotide contexts (A<sub>n</sub>, T<sub>n</sub>, C<sub>n</sub> and G<sub>n</sub>) were significantly underrepresented relative to expectation (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 13a</xref>), an observation commonly reported in nanopore sequences base-called by RNN basecaller<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>. The underrepresentation of homopolymer in these reads was a major source of false positives in deletion detection (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 13b</xref>). To remove the false positive deletions defined within the compressed homopolymer regions, we implemented an optional filtering step to annotate and remove the homopolymer-associated deletions. As a result of this adjustment, the numbers of SVs classified as insertions, deletions or INDEL decreased from 29,977 to 28,402. This filter/flag is an optional step and the standard <italic>Picky</italic> should be used directly with the homopolymer-aware basecaller like <italic>Scrappie</italic> without additional post-flag/filtering.</p>
