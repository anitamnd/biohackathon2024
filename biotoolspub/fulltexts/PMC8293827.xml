However, the identification of these tissue-specific functional cell states remains challenging. Although a plethora of computational approaches have been successful in detecting cell types and subtypes, they fail in resolving tissue-specific functional cell states. To address this issue, we present FunRes, a computational method designed for the identification of functional cell states. FunRes relies on scRNA-seq data of a tissue to initially reconstruct the functional cell–cell communication network, which is leveraged for partitioning each cell type into functional cell states. We applied FunRes to 177 cell types in 10 different tissues and demonstrated that the detected states correspond to known functional cell states of various cell types, which cannot be recapitulated by existing computational tools. Finally, we characterize emerging and vanishing functional cell states in aging and disease, and demonstrate their involvement in key tissue functions. Thus, we believe that FunRes will be of great utility in the characterization of the functional landscape of cell types and the identification of dysfunctional cell states in aging and disease.</p>

    <title>Introduction</title>
    <p>In multicellular organisms, the functional specification of cell types arises during development and is further shaped by signals from other cells. In particular, the exchange of these signals through receptor–ligand-mediated cell–cell communication networks determines a distribution of different functional cell states that are collectively relevant for tissue functioning [<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Thus, cell types are composed of a variety of functional cell states that are shaped by their tissue environment. More specifically, in response to different stimuli, cells of the same cell type can exhibit different phenotypes defined by physical, molecular and functional characteristics, called functional cell states. Great efforts have been devoted to characterize tissue-specific functional differences imparted by cell–cell interactions, which has led to the identification of functional cell states in various cell types. For instance, comparison of tissue-resident macrophages in different organs revealed functionally relevant differences in their gene expression programs [<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. While ileal and colonic macrophages showed higher expression of CD74 compared to other tissue-resident macrophages, TGFB2 is exclusively expressed by peritoneal macrophages [<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Moreover, transplantation of these macrophages to other organs reprograms their expression profile towards tissue-resident cells, which demonstrates that the observed differences are largely imparted by their environment [<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. In addition, previous studies investigated the effect of the environment on the functional specification of stem cells with respect to their activity and the tissue compartment in which they reside. For example, neural stem cells in the subgranular and subventricular zones show subtle phenotypic differences driven by the niche. While subgranular zone stem cells express the transcription factor (TF) HES5, which is induced by Notch signaling, subventricular zone stem cells express Id proteins, which are induced by BMP signaling, to maintain their function [<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Although these studies have enabled the characterization of certain functional cell states determined by cell–cell interactions in specific cell types, the development of computational methods would greatly aid the systematic identification and characterization of such states.</p>
    <p>The identification of cell types and subtypes has been traditionally performed by molecular biology approaches based on the shape and size of cells, while, more recently, these populations have been characterized by their expression of cellular membrane proteins. However, due to the limited number of surface proteins, it is likely that important functional differences between cell states cannot be described by combinations of these proteins alone. Advances in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technologies have provided an unprecedented view on the cellular heterogeneity within individual cell types. However, the exploitation of these datasets requires computational tools for processing and clustering the data. A plethora of computational tools have been developed in recent years for the unsupervised clustering of scRNA-seq profiles [<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5–8</xref>]. Although these tools have enabled the identification of several novel cell subtypes, they do not specifically consider the effect of cell–cell interactions on tissue-specific functional processes, and therefore fail in resolving the heterogeneity in functional states of different cell types.</p>
    <p>In order to address this challenge, we present FunRes, a computational method for the identification of tissue-specific functional cell states that are induced by receptor–ligand-mediated cell–cell interactions. FunRes employs single-cell RNA-seq data to reconstruct the cell–cell communication network among cell types. In particular, FunRes exclusively detects interactions that are functionally relevant to each cell type by warranting the compatibility of the signal with the intracellular signaling and transcriptional network. Next, FunRes leverages this network to identify functional cell states by partitioning cell types based on cell–cell interactions and the functional annotation of downstream target TFs. We applied FunRes to 177 cell types in 10 different tissues and demonstrate that the detected states correspond to known functional cell states of various immune and non-immune cell types, including macrophages, NK and endothelial cells, which cannot be recapitulated by existing computational tools. Moreover, comparison of the identified functional cell states of the same cell types in different tissues showed conserved states carrying out essential cell-type functions as well as the existence of states with unique functionalities. Finally, we assessed the effect of aging and disease on the composition of functional cell states. Although the overall number of functional cell states does not significantly change, certain cell types, such as enterocytes of the large intestine, hepatic sinusoidal epithelial cells and pancreatic alpha cells, display vast differences in their composition of functional states. Moreover, we validate the detected functional cell states in aged and pathologic tissues by providing evidence for their involvement in pathological tissue functions.</p>
    <p>In summary, FunRes constitutes the first computational method specifically designed for identifying functional cell states induced by receptor-ligand mediated cell–cell interactions and complements current clustering methodologies that successfully detect cell types and subtypes. We demonstrate that FunRes is applicable to a wide range of tissue conditions and can accurately detect functional cell states. Thus, we believe that FunRes will be of great utility in the characterization of the functional landscape of cell types and the identification of dysfunctional cell states in aging and disease.</p>

      <title>Assembly of cell–cell communication scaffolds, intracellular signaling and TF-gene regulatory interactions</title>
      <p>A cell–cell communication scaffold was generated for human and mouse on the basis of a previously published dataset including manually curated, validated and predicted intercellular interactions (<xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>) [<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. These interactions have been collected from different databases, i.e. DLRP [<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], HPMR [<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], IUPHAR [<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], HPRD [<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and String DB [<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] or manually validated in previous studies. The interactions were further filtered based on UniProt [<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] annotations to include only ligands annotated to be ‘Secreted’. Since the original dataset only consists of human data, these interactions were mapped to mouse orthologs using BioMart from Ensembl [<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p>
      <p>The intracellular signaling network is composed of pathway interactions included in Omnipath [<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], Reactome [<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] and MetaCore from Thomson Reuters. In particular, all pathways from MetaCore were obtained including all signal transduction interactions while discarding transcriptional gene regulatory interactions. MetaCore objects were mapped to gene symbols using the provided mapping table. In case MetaCore objects of the regulator or regulated gene mapped to multiple gene symbols, all possible interactions between the associated gene symbols were generated using a mapping table provided by MetaCore.</p>
      <p>Gene regulatory interactions were obtained from MetaCore from Thomson Reuters, a manually curated resource of gene–gene interactions, on 01 April 2019 for human and mouse genes. Only transcriptional regulatory interactions with known effects, i.e. activation or inhibition, were selected by filtering for ‘direct interactions’ with reported effects ‘activation’ or ‘inhibition’. MetaCore objects were again mapped to gene symbols using the provided mapping table. As in case of the intracellular signaling network, if MetaCore objects of the regulator or regulated gene mapped to multiple gene symbols, all possible interactions between the associated gene symbols were generated using an in-house script.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec4">
      <title>Selection of preserved TFs</title>
      <p>To select preserved TFs, FunRes identifies transcription factors that are expressed in at least a user-defined fraction of cells. For the analysis presented in this manuscript, we selected a permissive cutoff of 10% for all samples. For that, FunRes transforms the expression data into a binary format in which TFs with at least one count become ‘1’ while not-expressed TFs become ‘0’ and aggregates the binary data by cell type. Finally, FunRes selects in each subpopulation the TFs that are expressed in the top five-percentile of cells.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec5">
      <title>Detecting receptors inducing preserved TFs</title>
      <p>To detect receptors inducing the expression of the selected TFs, FunRes employs a Markov Chain model of intracellular signaling, called SigHotSpotter, to identify high-probability intermediate molecules (<xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>) [<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. In brief, SigHotSpotter uses single-cell RNA-seq data of a subpopulation and the assembled intracellular signaling network to create a state transition matrix representing the traversal of a signal through the network. The state transition matrix represents a finite discrete Markov Chain and is subsequently evolved to create the stationary distribution. The stationary distribution displays the intermediate molecules exhibiting the highest steady state probabilities. Afterwards, SigHotSpotter connects the intermediate molecules to interface TFs, i.e. the first transcription factors in the signal transduction chain, and characterizes the compatibility with their downstream targets. Calculating all shortest paths from high-probability intermediate molecules to downstream preserved TFs defines a compatibility score that classifies each molecule as being active or inactive. Here, a high-probability gene is deemed compatible with its downstream target if the expression of the gene and target TF agrees with the sign of the interaction path, i.e. an even number of inhibitions is an activating path while all other paths are inhibiting. In case of an activation, the intermediate and target genes have to be expressed whereas, in case of an inhibition, the target gene must not be expressed. Next, a gene is compatible, if a significant number of its targets is compatible. Significance is assessed using a hypergeometric test with <italic toggle="yes">P</italic>-value cutoff 0.05. Following the same rationale, receptors are identified that target the compatible high-probability intermediates.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec6">
      <title>Inference of the cell–cell communication network</title>
      <p>The main algorithm consists of four steps. First, preserved TFs and the receptors regulating them are selected in each cell population, as described before. Second, ligands expressed in a user-defined fraction of cells are selected in each cell population. For this study, a fraction of 10% was selected. Third, ligand–receptor interactions are established between two cell populations if (i) the receptor was selected in the first step for the first population, (ii) the ligand was selected in the second step for the second population and (iii) the receptor-ligand interaction is contained in cell–cell communication scaffold. Every interaction between receptor <italic toggle="yes">r</italic> in subpopulation <italic toggle="yes">p1</italic> and ligand <italic toggle="yes">l</italic> in subpopulation <italic toggle="yes">p2</italic> is augmented with an interaction strength <inline-formula><tex-math id="M1">\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

      <p>Informally, the score is the product of average non-zero receptor expression values and average non-zero ligand expression values with respect to the receptor <italic toggle="yes">r</italic> and its expressing population <italic toggle="yes">p1</italic> as well as to the ligand <italic toggle="yes">l</italic> and its expressing population <italic toggle="yes">p2</italic>.</p>
      <p>Significance of each interaction is determined by comparing the score of an interaction between two cell types against a background distribution of scores between these cell types based on all interactions in the scaffold. Interactions in the 90th percentile that have at least one significant downstream TF target are retained in the final cell–cell communication network.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec7">
      <title>Identification of functional cell states</title>
      <p>After inferring the cell–cell communication network, FunRes creates an incidence matrix of receptor/downstream TF expression for each cell type (<xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). In particular, each cell in the cell type under study is represented by a binary vector in which each entry corresponds to a receptor/downstream TF pair. If both the receptor and downstream TF are expressed in a cell, the corresponding entry in the vector will be ‘1’ and ‘0’ otherwise. Hierarchical clustering is performed on the resulting incidence matrix using the ‘hclust’ R function with Euclidean distance and complete linkage. The optimal number of clusters is computed based on the Dunn index, an internal cluster evaluation metric comparing within-cluster with the between-cluster distances. Finally, Gene Ontology [<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] enrichment of biological processes is performed using the DOSE R package (<xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>) [<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Terms with false discovery rate lower than 0.01 are considered significant. Clusters having identical functional annotations are subsequently merged. The resulting clusters constitute the identified functional cell states. Importantly, FunRes does not require the proteins within the enriched GO terms to be identical, but only the terms themselves.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec8">
      <title>Comparison with state-of-the-art clustering methods</title>
      <p>We selected Seurat [<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], SC3 [<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and SINCERA [<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] for assessing their ability to detect functional cell states. All methods were employed in a standard workflow with default parameters in R. In particular, for Seurat, the 2000 most variable genes were detected using the ‘FindVariableFeatures’ method with selection method ‘vst’. Subsequently, the data were scaled (‘ScaleData’ function) and principal component analysis (PCA) (‘RunPCA’ function) was performed. Finally, the data were clustered by employing the ‘FindNeighbors’ and ‘FindClusters’ functions on the first 10 principal components. SC3 was invoked using the ‘sc3’ function and the maximum number of clusters was set to 10. SINCERA was invoked without specific pre-processing steps. All analyses were carried out in R v3.6.1.</p>

An optimal number of clusters is determined, which will be subjected to functional enrichment analysis. If two clusters are enriched in the same processes, they will be merged.

      <title>Identification of functional cell states based on cell–cell communication networks</title>
      <p>For the purpose of identifying niche-induced functional cell states, FunRes initially reconstructs the cell–cell communication networks among all cell types in a dataset (<xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). In particular, it integrates transcriptional and signaling networks with extracellular ligand–receptor interactions following a bottom-up approach by first selecting transcription factors (TFs) whose expression is preserved across cells. Next, FunRes identifies receptors that regulate these preserved TFs by employing a previously introduced Markov Chain model that assesses signal transduction probabilities from receptors to their co-expressed TFs [<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Finally, FunRes finds cognate ligands for these receptors from a previously curated set of ligand–receptor interactions [<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Based on a previous study about the proportions of functional cell states in heterogeneous T cell populations, we required throughout this study both the ligands and receptors to be expressed in more than 10% of cells of the secreting and receiving cell population, respectively [<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p>
      <p>After reconstructing the functional cell–cell communication network, FunRes partitions each cell type into different functional cell states based on the identified cell–cell interactions and their downstream TF targets (<xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). More specifically, hierarchical clustering is performed to group cells by their function based on the downstream effect of cell–cell interactions they are participating in. Finally, the optimal number of functional states in each cell type is determined by evaluating cluster consistency. Notably, the optimal number of states could be equal to one, which results in no partitioning of the cell type under consideration, suggesting no niche-induced functional heterogeneity.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec11">
      <title>Functional evaluation of niche-induced cell states</title>
      <p>We employed FunRes to identify niche-induced functional cell states of 177 cell types in 10 mouse tissues from Tabula Muris Senis [<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. On average, each cell type was partitioned into 2.49 functional states (median: 2), with a maximum of nine identified states in enterocytes of the intestinal epithelium and pancreatic alpha cells (<xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). Nevertheless, the vast majority of cell types is partitioned into at most three functional cell states with 16% of cell types remaining unpartitioned.</p>

      <p>To assess the performance of our method, we evaluated the function of the identified cell states with known cell state markers compiled from literature and compared the performance of FunRes against current clustering methods. As a result, we were able to collect evidence for multiple functional cell states in the heart, kidney and liver. Firstly, we identified functional cell states of cardiac coronary vascular endothelial cells. As a result, FunRes detected two clusters differentiated by Bmpr2 signaling. While the Bmpr2-positive state corresponds to quiescent coronary vascular endothelial cells, the Bmpr2-negative state consists of activated cells undergoing endothelial mesenchymal transition, which is required for cardiac functioning [<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. In this regard, FosB is activated by Bmpr2 according to FunRes and is downregulated in active vascular endothelial cells [<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Thus, Bmpr2 and FosB serve as markers for quiescent and active coronary vascular endothelial cells. In order to assess the ability of current clustering methods in identifying functional cell states, we compared the results from FunRes against Seurat [<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], SC3 [<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and SINCERA [<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. As a result, SINCERA and SC3 detected 19 and 9 clusters, respectively, none of which could be distinguished using the marker genes of active and quiescent endothelial cells. Similar to FunRes, Seurat detected three clusters. However, no significant difference in the expression of these cell state markers could be detected. Consequently, none of the clusters corresponds to the functional cell states identified by FunRes (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S1</xref>).</p>
      <p>Secondly, we assessed the functional cell states of kidney macrophages and identified two states that are differentiated based on Nrp1 signaling. In particular, the first cluster expresses Nrp1 and Il10, all of which are known markers of M2 macrophages, an immunosuppressive cell state necessary for wound healing and cessation of the inflammatory response to pathogens (<xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>) [<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Previous reports showed that activation of Nrp1, which is involved in the cell–cell interactions differentiating the two clusters, induces this functional state, which underscores the accuracy of FunRes in detecting functionally relevant cell–cell interactions. In addition, the other functional cell state is characterized by active Tlr2 and Tlr4 signaling, which results in the polarization into M1 macrophages [<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Indeed, cells belonging to this cluster express the M1 markers Nfatc1, Tnfsf9 and Il16 [<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30–32</xref>]. Thus, the identified cell states correspond to M1 and M2 polarization of macrophages, respectively. In contrast, current clustering methodologies cannot resemble this finding. Seurat was unable to cluster the data due to the failure of PCA with default parameters as the number of kidney macrophage cells is below the number of principal components to be computed. Sincera partitioned the cells into 35 different clusters having on average 1.09 cells whereas SC3 was the only tool providing a reasonable number of clusters. However, these populations do not correspond to M1 and M2 macrophages as known marker genes are expressed across clusters (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S2</xref>).</p>
      <p>Thirdly, we investigated the functional states of liver B cells and identified two states that are distinguished by IL4R signaling [<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Previous studies elucidated the role of IL4R signaling and found that it induces autophagy, a key mechanism for the maintenance of B cell memory against pathogens and synthesis of antigens, such as IgE [<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Moreover, B cells with active IL4R signaling express the conventional B cell genes Tnfrsf13b and Tnfrsf13c (<xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>) [<xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, <xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. In contrast, the other identified cell state is deficient of IL4R signaling and express the plasma cell markers Sec61a1 (<xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>) [<xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Comparison of the cell states identified by FunRes to current clustering methodologies reveals that all of the other methods fail to detect the underlying functional heterogeneity. While Seurat was unable to perform clustering due to the failure of PCA with default parameters as the number of liver B cells is below the number of principal components to be computed, Sincera partitioned the data such that each cell belongs to a different cluster. In addition, SC3 did not detect any functional heterogeneity in liver B cells and leaves the data unpartitioned (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S3</xref>).</p>
      <p>Finally, we applied our method to liver NK cells and detected two functional NK cell states defined by differential downstream signaling targets. In particular, cells of the second cluster specifically activate Ikzf3 (<xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>), whereas other downstream signaling targets, such as Stat3, Stat1 and Ets1, are commonly activated in both clusters. Indeed, the second cluster is characterized by Ikzf2 and Ikzf3 expression, two markers of peripheral NK cells (<xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>) [<xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. In contrast, the first cluster shows high expression of the adaptive NK cell markers Klrc1 and Klrc2 (<xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>) [<xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>, <xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Similar to the case of kidney macrophages, Sincera produced an excess of clusters with, on average, only 1.38 cells whereas Seurat produced no clusters due to the failure of PCA with default parameters as the number of liver NK cells is below the number of principal components to be computed. Although SC3 detected 2 clusters like FunRes, they could not be attributed to different functional NK cell states (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S4</xref>).</p>
      <p>In summary, FunRes was able to dissect the functional heterogeneity of cell types in various tissues and accurately identified known functional states, while current clustering methods failed to provide satisfactory results. Moreover, comparison of the clusterings identified by each method shows only a moderate agreement between the functional cell states detected by FunRes and the results of Seurat, SC3 and SINCERA (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S5</xref>).</p>

    <sec id="sec12">
      <title>Comparison of functional cell states in different tissues</title>
      <p>Next, we set out to characterize the niche-induced functional states of macrophages and B cells in different tissues. As expected, we detected conserved functional states of kidney and limb muscle macrophages with activated Tlr2, Tlr4 and Tnfrsf1a signaling pathways, which constitute the key signaling cascades for the recognition of antigens and the activation of macrophages [<xref rid="ref41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>, <xref rid="ref42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. However, while kidney macrophages show an Nrp1-positive subpopulation corresponding to M2 polarization, Nrp1 signaling is inactive in all limb muscle macrophages. However, a subset of cells in the limb muscle display activity of the Il1 decoy receptor Il1r2, which is unique to M2 polarized macrophages. Moreover, these cells display an activated Il6 signaling pathway, which has been previously shown to be an alternative mechanism for M2 macrophage polarization [<xref rid="ref43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. This demonstrates that M2 macrophages reside in both tissues, but are alternatively activated.</p>
      <p>In contrast to macrophages, B cells were detected in the spleen, liver, limb muscle and lung having vastly different functional states that greatly differ between the spleen and liver/limb muscle/lung tissues (<xref rid="f3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). In particular, the identified functional B cell states in the liver and limb muscle are commonly characterized by Il2 receptor signaling activity, which is involved in B cell proliferation and plasma cell differentiation [<xref rid="ref44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>, <xref rid="ref45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. However, unique functional cell states are acquired through Il4ra and Cxcr4 signaling activity in these tissues. As previously described, Il4ra promotes B cell autophagy required for memory maintenance and antigen presentation [<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. In contrast, Cxcr4 signaling is uniquely activated in the functional state of limb muscle B cells demonstrating the differentiation of these cells into plasma cells [<xref rid="ref46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. While B cells lose their responsiveness to Cxcl12, the cognate ligand of Cxcr4, during development, they regain their sensitivity upon differentiation into mature B cells [<xref rid="ref46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Due to the involvement of Il4ra and Cxcr4 in plasma cell differentiation, we compared the downstream targets of these signaling cascades identified by FunRes and found Foxo1 to be the only common TF. Previous studies already revealed the key role of Foxo1 in plasma cell function and differentiation as an activator of Prdm1, a plasma cell master regulator [<xref rid="ref47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Therefore, the identified functional B cell states unique to liver and limb muscle tissue, respectively, induce plasma cell differentiation through distinct signaling pathways. Opposed to liver and limb muscle tissues, the functional B cell states in the lung are characterized by Il2 and interferon gamma signaling, which is the only commonality with B cells from the spleen. Whereas a B cell state expressing Ifngr1 was detected in both spleen and lung tissues, their functions vary due to the presence of co-stimulatory signals. As expected, the identified functional B cell states in the spleen are characterized by active Cd40 and interferon gamma signaling corresponding to a proliferative state [<xref rid="ref48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. In contrast, no co-stimulatory signals were detected in pulmonary B cell states, which suggests an inhibition of B cell activity [<xref rid="ref48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. This finding is consistent with the second functional state identified in pulmonary B cells, which shows Il2 receptor signaling activity as well as the absence of interferon gamma signaling, similar to the functional states of limb muscle and liver B cells [<xref rid="ref44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>, <xref rid="ref45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>].</p>

      <title>Functional heterogeneity underlying aging and disease identifies emerging cell states</title>
      <p>Finally, we investigated the influence of different tissue conditions, such as aging and disease, on the functional states of cell types. In order to interrogate how aging affects the functional cell states of macrophages, we compared the identified states in kidney and limb muscle tissue in young and old mice. Based on our analysis, we observed a significant decline in macrophage polarization due to the inactivation of Nrp1 and Il6r signaling pathways. In particular, while a functional state of kidney macrophages exists in old mice that is characterized by the ability to respond to antigens through Tlr2 signaling, the capacity of limb muscle macrophages to antigen response is significantly reduced. Moreover, the heterogeneous activation pattern of macrophages in young tissues has generally declined, which results in more homogeneous, quiescent states. This observation is consistent with previous studies reporting a significant decline of macrophage activation during aging, which is mediated by reduced Tlr signal transduction capacity due to dysfunctional MyD88 [<xref rid="ref49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>].</p>
      <p>In order to determine whether the loss of niche-induced functional states is a general characteristic of aging tissues, we compared the number of identified functional states for each cell type (<xref rid="f3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). However, no statistically significant difference could be detected (two-sided Wilcoxon-signed-rank test, <italic toggle="yes">P</italic>-value: 0.64). While in more than 85% of cell types, the number of states differed by at most two, three cell types differed in more than six niche-induced functional states. For example, the increase of detected functional states in hepatic sinusoidal endothelial cells is largely driven by the specific activation of the transcription factors Mef2c, Nr3c1 and Jun through distinct signaling cascades of the same receptors. Indeed, these TFs carry out protective functions in hepatic endothelial cells by stimulating cellular survival, modulating the immune response and preventing the breakdown of the extracellular matrix [<xref rid="ref50" ref-type="bibr">50–52</xref>]. Similarly, an increase in niche-induced functional states can be observed in pancreatic alpha cells due to an elevated selectivity in the activation of Bmpr1a, Itgav and Ddr1. These receptors regulate key functions of alpha cells, such as glucagon secretion [<xref rid="ref53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>], even though their combinatorial effect remains elusive. Furthermore, we observe a few of cellular processes unique to young and old tissues, respectively (<xref rid="f3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C and D</xref>). In contrast to hepatic sinusoidal endothelial and pancreatic alpha cells, enterocytes of the large intestinal epithelium show a marked reduction of heterogeneity with age, which is associated to the impairment of key signaling pathways, including protective signals, such as Lpa and Somatostatin, as well as fat uptake through the sortilin receptor.</p>
      <p>Likewise, we investigated the effects of pathologic tissue conditions on the functional states of cell types exemplified in a dataset of human liver cirrhosis [<xref rid="ref54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Hepatic cirrhosis is a chronic disease characterized by the progressive formation of permanent scar tissue through fibrosis. Hepatocytes are the main parenchymal cells of the liver, making up 50–60% of the tissue and are involved in key functions, such as lipid synthesis and detoxification. However, their dysregulation in the context of liver fibrosis and the functional states they attain remains elusive. Therefore, we applied FunRes, to healthy and cirrhotic human liver samples for identifying the functional states of hepatocytes. As a result, our method detected two functional states in healthy liver tissue characterized by Sdc1 and Cd74 signaling. Indeed, Sdc1 is necessary for the uptake and degradation of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins in the liver and is therefore involved in a key function of the liver [<xref rid="ref55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. In addition, Cd74 is a key component of the response to acute liver injury by antigen processing and host defense [<xref rid="ref56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. In contrast, a great diversity of functional states can be observed in cirrhotic liver tissue. In total, FunRes identified six functional states that are characterized by interferon gamma, leptin receptor, Cxcr4, Tnf, Cd40 and Caveolin-1 signaling (<xref rid="f3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>). While two functional states show a highly pro-inflammatory phenotype mediated by interferon gamma, Tnfrsf1a and Cxcr4, three states are characterized by Lepr, Cd40 and Cav1 signaling. The function of leptin receptor in the context of cirrhosis has been subject to previous studies that demonstrated the production of Tnf and Il1 due to leptin signaling activation [<xref rid="ref57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. Moreover, in a rat model of liver cirrhosis, no significant changes in the expression of Lepr have been found, which is consistent with our data. Nevertheless, FunRes only detects significant signaling activity in pathologic livers highlighting the significance of this method. On the contrary, previous studies suggested that the functional hepatocyte state characterized by active Cd40 signaling likely amplifies Fas-dependent apoptosis, thus contributing to the progressive formation of scar tissue in response to injury [<xref rid="ref58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. Finally, functional states with Caveolin-1 signaling activity regulate endocytosis, energy metabolism and fatty acid uptake as well as inhibit NOS3, which promotes liver fibrosis [<xref rid="ref59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>].</p>

    <title>Discussion and Conclusion</title>
    <p>In this study, we presented FunRes, a computational method for resolving tissue-specific functional cell states that are determined by receptor–ligand-mediated cell–cell interactions. This method accounts for the effect of cell–cell interactions on specific cellular processes, which have been shown to play a fundamental role in the specification of functional cell states [<xref rid="ref60" ref-type="bibr">60–62</xref>]. Namely, FunRes identifies functional cell states based on the downstream target genes of cell–cell interactions and the cellular processes they participate in. Hence, our approach is conceptually different from current clustering methods solely relying on differences in the expression of the most variable genes regardless of their cellular function. As a result, unlike other methods, FunRes was able to resolve functional states of various cell types. Importantly, the cell–cell interactions underlying functional cell states were largely supported by previous studies, indicating that FunRes can inform about the cues inducing these states.</p>
    <p>The validation of our method was further corroborated by the comparison of functional cell states in different tissues and tissue conditions. In particular, FunRes identified previously reported differences in the functional states of macrophages and B cells, including the appearance of specific functional cell states, such as wound-healing macrophages in the limb muscle. Furthermore, we applied FunRes to several examples of aging and disease to disentangle the composition of functional cell states in these conditions. For instance, in the case of liver cirrhosis, results show the emergence of novel functional hepatocyte states sustained by Caveolin-1 and Leptin signaling that are characterized by dysregulated metabolic processes contributing to pathological tissue functioning.</p>
    <p>A limitation of FunRes is that it solely considers receptor–ligand-mediated cell–cell interactions whereas it ignores other ways of cellular communication, such as via exosomes. In addition, this method does not incorporate the effect of environmental factors, such as metabolites, on the functional cell states [<xref rid="ref63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. In this regard, the method could be extended to overcome some of these limitations.</p>
    <p>In summary, FunRes is the first computational method that systematically resolves tissue-specific functional cell states, thereby providing a functional characterization of the identified states. Thus, we believe FunRes will be of great utility in the characterization of the tissue-specific functional landscape and in the identification of dysfunctional cell states underlying aging and disease.</p>
