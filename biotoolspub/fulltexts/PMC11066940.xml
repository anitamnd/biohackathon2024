      <title>Abstract</title>
      <p>Cancer is a complex cellular ecosystem where malignant cells coexist and interact with immune, stromal and other cells within the tumor microenvironment (TME). Recent technological advancements in spatially resolved multiplexed imaging at single-cell resolution have led to the generation of large-scale and high-dimensional datasets from biological specimens. This underscores the necessity for automated methodologies that can effectively characterize molecular, cellular and spatial properties of TMEs for various malignancies. This study introduces SpatialCells, an open-source software package designed for region-based exploratory analysis and comprehensive characterization of TMEs using multiplexed single-cell data. The source code and tutorials are available at <ext-link xlink:href="https://semenovlab.github.io/SpatialCells" ext-link-type="uri">https://semenovlab.github.io/SpatialCells</ext-link>. SpatialCells efficiently streamlines the automated extraction of features from multiplexed single-cell data and can process samples containing millions of cells. Thus, SpatialCells facilitates subsequent association analyses and machine learning predictions, making it an essential tool in advancing our understanding of tumor growth, invasion and metastasis.</p>

    <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
    <p>Cancer presents an intricate cellular ecosystem, which plays a critical role in tumor development, progression and therapeutic outcomes. The spatial organization of cells and their interactions within the tumor microenvironment (TME) contain essential insights into the course of tumor growth and progression. Characterizing molecular, cellular and spatial properties of TMEs across diverse malignancies has gained substantial attention [<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p>
    <p>Recent technological breakthroughs in spatially resolved multiplexed imaging at single-cell resolution, such as CODEX and CyCIF, are highly effective in studying TMEs and intratumoral heterogeneity within solid tumors [<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3–6</xref>]. However, the lack of systematic computational methodologies to leverage the large volume of data generated by these technologies poses a significant challenge for their scalable deployment in clinical settings.</p>
    <p>Currently, the available tools for handling multiplexed imaging data are designed to address specific aspects of multiplexed imaging data analysis. Some tools focus on converting multi-channel whole-slide images into single-cell data (e.g. MCMICRO [<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]), while others prioritize preprocessing, cell type phenotyping and visualizing the obtained single-cell data (e.g. SCIMAP [<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]). Spatial analysis of single-cell data represents only a small portion of the functions in HALO [<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] and often demands manual annotation. Furthermore, this platform is proprietary and not freely available for public use. Another toolkit, Squidpy, specializes in neighborhood graph construction and analysis [<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Consequently, the capability of these tools to effectively conduct comprehensive spatial analysis remains limited.</p>
    <p>Furthermore, the considerable progress in leveraging machine learning for predictive tasks presents a critical consideration for clinical outcomes. However, these algorithms often require substantial sample sizes to achieve robust performance. Overall, the high-dimensional, heterogeneous and complicated dependency structures inherent in multiplexed single-cell data, coupled with the need for large sample sizes in machine learning algorithms, present challenges to conventional manual annotation and statistical techniques. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop computational methodologies to analyze multiplexed single-cell data in a scalable manner and enable the development of forecasting models that would inform clinical decision-making and enhance our understanding of disease progression.</p>
    <p>In this study, we introduce SpatialCells, an open-source software package designed to perform region-based exploratory analysis and characterization of TMEs using multiplexed single-cell data. This tool is equipped to efficiently analyze tissue samples containing millions of cells and automatically extract quantitative features, enabling subsequent association analyses and machine learning predictions at scale.</p>

    <title>IMPLEMENTATION</title>
    <sec id="sec5">
      <title>Overview</title>
      <p>This study is grounded in existing literature on tumor and immune parameters associated with cancer progression and patient survival. Our primary goal is to develop automated methodologies for quantifying these parameters with spatially resolved single-cell data. By integrating clinicopathologic features extracted from electronic medical records, we will be equipped to perform comprehensive association analyses or make predictions about patient outcomes, as illustrated in <xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A and B</xref>. We have provided detailed tutorials on data exploration, tumor cell-centric analysis, immune cell-oriented analysis and others.</p>

SpatialCells incorporates several main modules to facilitate its functionality, such as tumor proliferation index, immune infiltration score and tumor-immune distance.</p>

        <graphic xlink:href="bbae189f1" position="float"/>
      </fig>
      <p>SpatialCells is featured by its capability to define regions of interest (ROIs) based on any group of cells and subsequently conduct region-based analyses. <xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref> presents the main modules incorporated into SpatialCells. Our workflow starts with developing a Spatial module, including functions to establish regional boundaries and annotate each cell with the corresponding region in which it is located. The Measurements module contains functions to extract properties of tumor cells and tumor-immune cell interactions, including tumor proliferation index, immune infiltration score and tumor-immune cell distance. These properties can be assessed for the whole tissue or local regions. Importantly, our methods can efficiently process datasets containing millions of cells.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec6">
      <title>Spatially resolved single-cell data</title>
      <p>SpatialCells takes spatially resolved multiplexed data at single-cell resolution as input (<xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). Our collaborators commonly utilize cyclic immunofluorescence imaging (CyCIF) [<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] to generate such data. <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 1</xref> outlines the data generation process and the data format. For each tissue specimen, multi-channel images are first generated by CyCIF. This procedure is followed by cell segmentation and quantification using MCMICRO [<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Based on relative protein expression levels of cells, most cells can be assigned to specific cell types [<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. This process produces data that include spatial coordinates, marker intensity values and cell types for up to 10<sup>7</sup> cells.</p>

          <p>ROI-level cell composition. Whole-slide tissues often have a significant amount of blank background. SpatialCells computationally defines ROIs and removes background in a standardized manner across all tissues in the study cohort. This is accomplished by initially calculating the tumor boundary and then extending this boundary by a specified distance (a user-defined parameter).</p>

      <title>Tumor cell-centric analysis</title>
      <p>Tumor cell-centric analysis focuses on the characterization and study of tumor cells to gain insights into their biology, heterogeneity and behavior within the TME. Specifically, the American Joint Committee on Cancer/Union for International Cancer Control (AJCC/UICC) staging system provides guidelines for classifying the extent of cancer spread, considering factors such as tumor size and depth of invasion [<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14–16</xref>]. Additionally, the mitotic rate of various tumors is highly relevant in predicting patient outcomes [<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17–19</xref>]. In this analysis, we have emphasized the following tumor characteristics that may be linked to patient prognosis:</p>

Building on this work, SpatialCells provides a function for calculating an MPI of a given cell type, including tumor cells. The input of this function includes two marker lists of interest: (1) mitosis/proliferation markers (e.g. Serine-10 phosphorylated histone H3, Ki67, PCNA and MCM2) and (2) cell cycle arrest markers (e.g. p21 and p27). Adapted from the definition in the work by Gaglia <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>. [<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], the MPI is defined as follows:</p>

      <p>The TME is a spatially organized landscape characterized by the presence of lymphocytes, macrophages and other cell types located both within the central region and at the invasive margin of the tumor. Understanding the TME composition is essential for developing effective cancer therapies and predicting patient prognosis.

MEL1 was imaged using CyCIF [<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] with 30 antibody markers (e.g. SOX10, Keratin, CD31, CD3D, CD8A, CD11C, MITF and Ki67) and preprocessed using MCMICRO [<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], which transforms multi-channel whole-slide images into single-cell data.

      <p>Tumor margins are exposed to cell infiltration, physical contact and diffusible chemotactic gradients from the stromal regions and vice versa. Therefore, defining tumor and stromal boundaries allows us to more specifically assess the complex interplay between invasive melanoma tumor cells and the microenvironment and to identify novel markers [<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. In <xref rid="f5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>, the overall ROI is divided into four distinct subregions: Tumor (T), which represents the core tumor region; Tumor border (Tb), which is the transitional area immediately adjacent to the tumor; Stroma border (Sb), marking the border between tumor and stroma; and Stroma (S), situated farther from the tumor. These subregions are defined based on specific distances from the tumor boundary, with the tumor region boundary set at 100 microns, the stroma border region boundary at 200 microns and the boundary for the overall ROI at 800 microns away from the tumor boundary. Importantly, users have the flexibility to customize these distances.

    <title>DISCUSSION AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS</title>
    <p>SpatialCells represents a significant advance in the field of spatial analysis for multiplexed single-cell image data, enabling the computational quantification and standardized analyses of critical features within the TME. Its functionalities encompass various aspects of TME analysis, such as region-based cell composition, tumor proliferation index, tumor isolation index, immune cell infiltration and tumor-immune distance. By providing these analytical tools, SpatialCells empowers researchers to gain deeper insights into the intricate spatial relationships and characteristics of cells within the TME.</p>
    <p>One of the limitations of the SpatialCells software is that the cell segmentation provided by upstream imaging data preprocessing tools, such as MCMICRO [<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], may introduce errors in the cell counts. However, SpatialCells is a customizable software that can analyze multiple samples within a study in a consistent and standardized manner. This capability involves applying similar settings and parameters across all samples, thus mitigating some of the variability introduced by cell segmentation. Another limitation of the SpatialCells software is the reliance on the quality of gating and calling cell types, which involve converting continuous marker expression levels into binary variables. This binary conversion introduces subjectivity, leading to variability in cell count. Finally, the adaptability of SpatialCells, with its support for user-defined parameters, affords users the freedom to configure settings based on their specific needs. However, this flexibility can also be a source of errors, as suboptimal parameter choices may impact the accuracy of the analysis.</p>
    <p>In the future, we will continue to improve this software and provide clear guidelines to users on best practices for parameter selection. We will include more functions as well as tutorials, particularly for multimodal analyses within the field of spatial biology. For example, we will provide functions for migrating ROIs from other modalities, such as hematoxylin and eosin stain imaging and spatial transcriptomics, to multiplexed imaging, allowing integrative analyses across different modality data.</p>

      <title>Abstract</title>
      <p>Cancer is a complex cellular ecosystem where malignant cells coexist and interact with immune, stromal and other cells within the tumor microenvironment (TME). Recent technological advancements in spatially resolved multiplexed imaging at single-cell resolution have led to the generation of large-scale and high-dimensional datasets from biological specimens. This underscores the necessity for automated methodologies that can effectively characterize molecular, cellular and spatial properties of TMEs for various malignancies. This study introduces SpatialCells, an open-source software package designed for region-based exploratory analysis and comprehensive characterization of TMEs using multiplexed single-cell data. The source code and tutorials are available at <ext-link xlink:href="https://semenovlab.github.io/SpatialCells" ext-link-type="uri">https://semenovlab.github.io/SpatialCells</ext-link>. SpatialCells efficiently streamlines the automated extraction of features from multiplexed single-cell data and can process samples containing millions of cells. Thus, SpatialCells facilitates subsequent association analyses and machine learning predictions, making it an essential tool in advancing our understanding of tumor growth, invasion and metastasis.</p>

    <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
    <p>Cancer presents an intricate cellular ecosystem, which plays a critical role in tumor development, progression and therapeutic outcomes. The spatial organization of cells and their interactions within the tumor microenvironment (TME) contain essential insights into the course of tumor growth and progression. Characterizing molecular, cellular and spatial properties of TMEs across diverse malignancies has gained substantial attention [<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p>
    <p>Recent technological breakthroughs in spatially resolved multiplexed imaging at single-cell resolution, such as CODEX and CyCIF, are highly effective in studying TMEs and intratumoral heterogeneity within solid tumors [<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3–6</xref>]. However, the lack of systematic computational methodologies to leverage the large volume of data generated by these technologies poses a significant challenge for their scalable deployment in clinical settings.</p>
    <p>Currently, the available tools for handling multiplexed imaging data are designed to address specific aspects of multiplexed imaging data analysis. Some tools focus on converting multi-channel whole-slide images into single-cell data (e.g. MCMICRO [<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]), while others prioritize preprocessing, cell type phenotyping and visualizing the obtained single-cell data (e.g. SCIMAP [<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]). Spatial analysis of single-cell data represents only a small portion of the functions in HALO [<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] and often demands manual annotation. Furthermore, this platform is proprietary and not freely available for public use. Another toolkit, Squidpy, specializes in neighborhood graph construction and analysis [<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Consequently, the capability of these tools to effectively conduct comprehensive spatial analysis remains limited.</p>
    <p>Furthermore, the considerable progress in leveraging machine learning for predictive tasks presents a critical consideration for clinical outcomes. However, these algorithms often require substantial sample sizes to achieve robust performance. Overall, the high-dimensional, heterogeneous and complicated dependency structures inherent in multiplexed single-cell data, coupled with the need for large sample sizes in machine learning algorithms, present challenges to conventional manual annotation and statistical techniques. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop computational methodologies to analyze multiplexed single-cell data in a scalable manner and enable the development of forecasting models that would inform clinical decision-making and enhance our understanding of disease progression.</p>
    <p>In this study, we introduce SpatialCells, an open-source software package designed to perform region-based exploratory analysis and characterization of TMEs using multiplexed single-cell data. This tool is equipped to efficiently analyze tissue samples containing millions of cells and automatically extract quantitative features, enabling subsequent association analyses and machine learning predictions at scale.</p>

      <title>Overview</title>
      <p>This study is grounded in existing literature on tumor and immune parameters associated with cancer progression and patient survival. Our primary goal is to develop automated methodologies for quantifying these parameters with spatially resolved single-cell data. By integrating clinicopathologic features extracted from electronic medical records, we will be equipped to perform comprehensive association analyses or make predictions about patient outcomes, as illustrated in <xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A and B</xref>. We have provided detailed tutorials on data exploration, tumor cell-centric analysis, immune cell-oriented analysis and others.</p>

      <p>SpatialCells is featured by its capability to define regions of interest (ROIs) based on any group of cells and subsequently conduct region-based analyses. <xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref> presents the main modules incorporated into SpatialCells. Our workflow starts with developing a Spatial module, including functions to establish regional boundaries and annotate each cell with the corresponding region in which it is located. The Measurements module contains functions to extract properties of tumor cells and tumor-immune cell interactions, including tumor proliferation index, immune infiltration score and tumor-immune cell distance. These properties can be assessed for the whole tissue or local regions. Importantly, our methods can efficiently process datasets containing millions of cells.</p>

      <title>Spatially resolved single-cell data</title>
      <p>SpatialCells takes spatially resolved multiplexed data at single-cell resolution as input (<xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). Our collaborators commonly utilize cyclic immunofluorescence imaging (CyCIF) [<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] to generate such data. <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 1</xref> outlines the data generation process and the data format. For each tissue specimen, multi-channel images are first generated by CyCIF. This procedure is followed by cell segmentation and quantification using MCMICRO [<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Based on relative protein expression levels of cells, most cells can be assigned to specific cell types [<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. This process produces data that include spatial coordinates, marker intensity values and cell types for up to 10<sup>7</sup> cells.</p>
      <p>While our experiments primarily focus on CyCIF data, SpatialCells can be applied to analyzing other spatially resolved omics data, such as 10X Genomics Visium data and iterative indirect immunofluorescence imaging (4i) data [<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p>

      <title>Data exploration</title>
      <p>In the data exploration, we have incorporated measurement and visualization tools that can provide initial insights into samples. These include:</p>
      <list list-type="bullet">
        <list-item>
          <p>Whole-slide-level cell composition. This involves assessing the percentages of different cell types present in the samples, such as tumor cells and immune cells.</p>
        </list-item>
        <list-item>
          <p>ROI-level cell composition. Whole-slide tissues often have a significant amount of blank background. SpatialCells computationally defines ROIs and removes background in a standardized manner across all tissues in the study cohort. This is accomplished by initially calculating the tumor boundary and then extending this boundary by a specified distance (a user-defined parameter).</p>
        </list-item>
        <list-item>
          <p>Region-based cell composition. SpatialCells provides the capability for the geometric partition of tissues in various ways. For instance, it can divide the tumor region into subregions based on distance from the centroid or angle from the zero degree. Following the partitioning, SpatialCells can enumerate cell types within each tissue subregion for detailed compositional analysis.</p>
        </list-item>
        <list-item>
          <p>Region-based clustering. Similarly, after partitioning, SpatialCells provides the ability to cluster cells within a specific region.</p>

    </sec>
    <sec id="sec8">
      <title>Tumor cell-centric analysis</title>
      <p>Tumor cell-centric analysis focuses on the characterization and study of tumor cells to gain insights into their biology, heterogeneity and behavior within the TME. Specifically, the American Joint Committee on Cancer/Union for International Cancer Control (AJCC/UICC) staging system provides guidelines for classifying the extent of cancer spread, considering factors such as tumor size and depth of invasion [<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14–16</xref>]. Additionally, the mitotic rate of various tumors is highly relevant in predicting patient outcomes [<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17–19</xref>]. In this analysis, we have emphasized the following tumor characteristics that may be linked to patient prognosis:</p>
      <list list-type="bullet">
        <list-item>
          <p>Tumor area and tumor cell density. SpatialCells offers functions for defining regions based on user-specified markers and calculating the area of a region and the density of any cell type within the region.</p>
        </list-item>
        <list-item>
          <p>Tumor multivariate proliferation index (MPI). Gaglia <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> demonstrated the effectiveness of an MPI in differentiating proliferating from non-proliferating tumor cells [<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Building on this work, SpatialCells provides a function for calculating an MPI of a given cell type, including tumor cells. The input of this function includes two marker lists of interest: (1) mitosis/proliferation markers (e.g. Serine-10 phosphorylated histone H3, Ki67, PCNA and MCM2) and (2) cell cycle arrest markers (e.g. p21 and p27). Adapted from the definition in the work by Gaglia <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>. [<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], the MPI is defined as follows:</p>

Instead of computing a single MPI for the whole tissue, SpatialCells enables calculating MPI for subregions of interest within the tissue sample. We demonstrate this method by applying a sliding window of a user-defined size over the tissue and computing the MPI for each subregion.</p>
      <list list-type="bullet">
        <list-item>
          <p>Tumor isolation index. Categorizing tumors into immune hot, immune suppressed and immune cold/isolated groups has considerable prognostic value in various malignancies [<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Here, we focus on defining a tumor isolation index, which is the fraction of tumor cells in the region without immune cells over all tumor cells. This index is accomplished by dividing the overall ROI (whole-slide tissue with background removed) into two subregions: immune-rich region and region with almost no tumor-infiltrating immune cells.</p>

      <title>Immune cell-oriented analysis</title>
      <p>The TME is a spatially organized landscape characterized by the presence of lymphocytes, macrophages and other cell types located both within the central region and at the invasive margin of the tumor. Understanding the TME composition is essential for developing effective cancer therapies and predicting patient prognosis. Here, we have conducted macro-region and micro-region analyses, along with cell-to-cell interactions:</p>
      <list list-type="bullet">
        <list-item>
          <p>Macro-region analysis. The overall ROI, which encompasses the whole-slide tissue with the background removed, is divided into four subregions: tumor, tumor border, stroma border and stroma, as illustrated in <xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>. We subsequently evaluate the cell compositions within each region, with a particular focus on immune cells.</p>
        </list-item>
        <list-item>
          <p>Micro-region analysis. This analysis focuses on small regions, defined as micro-regions, within the tumor area, as illustrated in <xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>. By identifying these micro-regions, we can perform detailed characterizations of cells within them, enabling a finer-grained understanding of the cellular landscape.</p>

        <list-item>
          <p>Cell-to-cell interactions. An important aspect of our analysis involves investigating the interactions between various cell types within the TME. For instance, SpatialCells can be applied to quantify the interactions between tumor cells and immune cells. As shown in <xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>, we assess the degree of tumor immune infiltration by measuring the distance between a tumor cell and its nearest immune cell. This information provides valuable insights into the interplay between different cell populations within the TME.</p>

    <p>Our analyses involve publicly available multiplexed imaging data of a cutaneous melanoma sample (MEL1) consisting of 1 110 585 cells [<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. MEL1 was imaged using CyCIF [<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] with 30 antibody markers (e.g. SOX10, Keratin, CD31, CD3D, CD8A, CD11C, MITF and Ki67) and preprocessed using MCMICRO [<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], which transforms multi-channel whole-slide images into single-cell data. The output of MCMICRO is the input of SpatialCells. Additional details of this sample can be found in the provided reference [<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].</p>

      <p>SpatialCells is a versatile tool for region-based data exploration, particularly for assessing cell composition or clustering within whole-slide images or specific regions of interest. <xref rid="f3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref> illustrates how SpatialCells can be applied to compute cell compositions for three different types of regions within the MEL1 sample.</p>

      <p>The principal tumor (T) category for invasive melanoma is defined as the maximum tumor thickness measured with a calibrated ocular micrometer at a right angle to the adjacent normal skin to the deepest point of tumor invasion [<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. In this case, the MEL1 section shows fragmentation artifacts at the deep aspect of the invasive front. To ensure accurate measurements of the distance from the centroid or the epidermis to the tumor boundary, we excluded the fragmented area with SOX10+ cells and focused on the main tumor area. If we included these separate fragments of SOX10+ cells along with the intervening empty spaces, the measurements would have been artificially increased.</p>
      <p><xref rid="f3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A and B</xref> presents the expression levels of related markers, including keratin, SOX10, MITF and CD3D, within the imaging data. SOX10 expression is a sensitive and specific marker for melanoma tumor cells. MITF is an important melanoma oncogene and plays a role in determining therapeutic resistance [<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. CD3D is a marker commonly associated with immune cells, particularly T lymphocytes (or T cells). <xref rid="f3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref> shows the boundary of the main tumor area as identified by SpatialCells. In <xref rid="f3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>, the subregions are defined based on the distance from the centroid of the main tumor area. In <xref rid="f3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>, the subregions are based on their angles from the zero-degree reference. The percentage of MITF+SOX10+ cells within each subregion is computed. The two barplots in <xref rid="f3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D and E</xref> demonstrate the gradient of MITF+ tumor cells. <xref rid="f3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref> provides cell composition within subregions, which are defined based on their distance from the epidermis. The centroid (start point) and the epidermis (start line) are computationally determined.

In <xref rid="f5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>, the overall ROI is divided into four distinct subregions: Tumor (T), which represents the core tumor region; Tumor border (Tb), which is the transitional area immediately adjacent to the tumor; Stroma border (Sb), marking the border between tumor and stroma; and Stroma (S), situated farther from the tumor. These subregions are defined based on specific distances from the tumor boundary, with the tumor region boundary set at 100 microns, the stroma border region boundary at 200 microns and the boundary for the overall ROI at 800 microns away from the tumor boundary. Importantly, users have the flexibility to customize these distances. In <xref rid="f5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>, the corresponding counts of tumor cells, T cells and other cells are presented for each of the four defined regions. <xref rid="f5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref> further provides insights by illustrating the cell fraction among all cells within each defined region. <xref rid="f5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref> displays micro-regions within the tumor area. Each micro-region is indexed, enabling users to pinpoint specific micro-regions of interest. <xref rid="f5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref> offers a closer look at these micro-regions. In <xref rid="f5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5F</xref>, every micro-region boundary is extended and contracted (offset = 30 microns) to define ‘In’, ‘Border inside’ and ‘Border outside’ subregions, as visually demonstrated in <xref rid="f5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5H</xref>. The cell compositions within these three subregions for each micro-region are presented in <xref rid="f5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5G</xref>.</p>
      <p>The Stroma region in <xref rid="f5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref> includes some SOX10+ tumor cells on the right side of the image. This is due to the presence of fragmentation artifacts in this sample [<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. In practice, users may need to analyze the data separately for each area, as was the case in the provided reference [<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. In our tutorials, we include detailed instructions on how to perform these analyses.</p>

      <title>Experimental results on spatial omics data</title>
      <p>To demonstrate the broad utility of SpatialCells for analyzing other spatial omics data modalities, we further conducted experiments on a public Visium dataset of a human lymph node sample [<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The data were deconvoluted following the standard Cell2location protocol and analyzed with SpatialCells [<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The details are available in our tutorials, with results presented in <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 2</xref>. SpatialCells can automate the identification of all germinal centers and delineate their region boundaries that are consistent with the authors’ manual annotation, eliminating the necessity of manual annotation that could introduce significant bias.</p>

    <title>DISCUSSION AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS</title>
    <p>SpatialCells represents a significant advance in the field of spatial analysis for multiplexed single-cell image data, enabling the computational quantification and standardized analyses of critical features within the TME. Its functionalities encompass various aspects of TME analysis, such as region-based cell composition, tumor proliferation index, tumor isolation index, immune cell infiltration and tumor-immune distance. By providing these analytical tools, SpatialCells empowers researchers to gain deeper insights into the intricate spatial relationships and characteristics of cells within the TME.</p>
    <p>One of the limitations of the SpatialCells software is that the cell segmentation provided by upstream imaging data preprocessing tools, such as MCMICRO [<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], may introduce errors in the cell counts. However, SpatialCells is a customizable software that can analyze multiple samples within a study in a consistent and standardized manner. This capability involves applying similar settings and parameters across all samples, thus mitigating some of the variability introduced by cell segmentation. Another limitation of the SpatialCells software is the reliance on the quality of gating and calling cell types, which involve converting continuous marker expression levels into binary variables. This binary conversion introduces subjectivity, leading to variability in cell count. Finally, the adaptability of SpatialCells, with its support for user-defined parameters, affords users the freedom to configure settings based on their specific needs. However, this flexibility can also be a source of errors, as suboptimal parameter choices may impact the accuracy of the analysis.</p>
    <p>In the future, we will continue to improve this software and provide clear guidelines to users on best practices for parameter selection. We will include more functions as well as tutorials, particularly for multimodal analyses within the field of spatial biology. For example, we will provide functions for migrating ROIs from other modalities, such as hematoxylin and eosin stain imaging and spatial transcriptomics, to multiplexed imaging, allowing integrative analyses across different modality data.</p>

    <title>CONCLUSIONS</title>
    <p>In summary, SpatialCells is a novel software solution for spatially analyzing the TME using multiplexed imaging data in a streamlined fashion with the capacity to process samples containing millions of cells. This software is of critical importance in the analysis of the TME and in furthering our understanding of the factors leading to tumor progression as it facilitates subsequent association analyses and machine learning predictions.</p>

      <title>Abstract</title>
      <p>Cancer is a complex cellular ecosystem where malignant cells coexist and interact with immune, stromal and other cells within the tumor microenvironment (TME). Recent technological advancements in spatially resolved multiplexed imaging at single-cell resolution have led to the generation of large-scale and high-dimensional datasets from biological specimens. This underscores the necessity for automated methodologies that can effectively characterize molecular, cellular and spatial properties of TMEs for various malignancies. This study introduces SpatialCells, an open-source software package designed for region-based exploratory analysis and comprehensive characterization of TMEs using multiplexed single-cell data. The source code and tutorials are available at <ext-link xlink:href="https://semenovlab.github.io/SpatialCells" ext-link-type="uri">https://semenovlab.github.io/SpatialCells</ext-link>. SpatialCells efficiently streamlines the automated extraction of features from multiplexed single-cell data and can process samples containing millions of cells. Thus, SpatialCells facilitates subsequent association analyses and machine learning predictions, making it an essential tool in advancing our understanding of tumor growth, invasion and metastasis.</p>

    <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
    <p>Cancer presents an intricate cellular ecosystem, which plays a critical role in tumor development, progression and therapeutic outcomes. The spatial organization of cells and their interactions within the tumor microenvironment (TME) contain essential insights into the course of tumor growth and progression. Characterizing molecular, cellular and spatial properties of TMEs across diverse malignancies has gained substantial attention [<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p>
    <p>Recent technological breakthroughs in spatially resolved multiplexed imaging at single-cell resolution, such as CODEX and CyCIF, are highly effective in studying TMEs and intratumoral heterogeneity within solid tumors [<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3–6</xref>]. However, the lack of systematic computational methodologies to leverage the large volume of data generated by these technologies poses a significant challenge for their scalable deployment in clinical settings.</p>
    <p>Currently, the available tools for handling multiplexed imaging data are designed to address specific aspects of multiplexed imaging data analysis. Some tools focus on converting multi-channel whole-slide images into single-cell data (e.g. MCMICRO [<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]), while others prioritize preprocessing, cell type phenotyping and visualizing the obtained single-cell data (e.g. SCIMAP [<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]). Spatial analysis of single-cell data represents only a small portion of the functions in HALO [<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] and often demands manual annotation. Furthermore, this platform is proprietary and not freely available for public use. Another toolkit, Squidpy, specializes in neighborhood graph construction and analysis [<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Consequently, the capability of these tools to effectively conduct comprehensive spatial analysis remains limited.</p>
    <p>Furthermore, the considerable progress in leveraging machine learning for predictive tasks presents a critical consideration for clinical outcomes. However, these algorithms often require substantial sample sizes to achieve robust performance. Overall, the high-dimensional, heterogeneous and complicated dependency structures inherent in multiplexed single-cell data, coupled with the need for large sample sizes in machine learning algorithms, present challenges to conventional manual annotation and statistical techniques. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop computational methodologies to analyze multiplexed single-cell data in a scalable manner and enable the development of forecasting models that would inform clinical decision-making and enhance our understanding of disease progression.</p>
    <p>In this study, we introduce SpatialCells, an open-source software package designed to perform region-based exploratory analysis and characterization of TMEs using multiplexed single-cell data. This tool is equipped to efficiently analyze tissue samples containing millions of cells and automatically extract quantitative features, enabling subsequent association analyses and machine learning predictions at scale.</p>

      <title>Overview</title>
      <p>This study is grounded in existing literature on tumor and immune parameters associated with cancer progression and patient survival. Our primary goal is to develop automated methodologies for quantifying these parameters with spatially resolved single-cell data. By integrating clinicopathologic features extracted from electronic medical records, we will be equipped to perform comprehensive association analyses or make predictions about patient outcomes, as illustrated in <xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A and B</xref>. We have provided detailed tutorials on data exploration, tumor cell-centric analysis, immune cell-oriented analysis and others.</p>

      <p>SpatialCells is featured by its capability to define regions of interest (ROIs) based on any group of cells and subsequently conduct region-based analyses. <xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref> presents the main modules incorporated into SpatialCells. Our workflow starts with developing a Spatial module, including functions to establish regional boundaries and annotate each cell with the corresponding region in which it is located. The Measurements module contains functions to extract properties of tumor cells and tumor-immune cell interactions, including tumor proliferation index, immune infiltration score and tumor-immune cell distance. These properties can be assessed for the whole tissue or local regions. Importantly, our methods can efficiently process datasets containing millions of cells.</p>

    <sec id="sec6">
      <title>Spatially resolved single-cell data</title>
      <p>SpatialCells takes spatially resolved multiplexed data at single-cell resolution as input (<xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). Our collaborators commonly utilize cyclic immunofluorescence imaging (CyCIF) [<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] to generate such data. <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 1</xref> outlines the data generation process and the data format. For each tissue specimen, multi-channel images are first generated by CyCIF. This procedure is followed by cell segmentation and quantification using MCMICRO [<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Based on relative protein expression levels of cells, most cells can be assigned to specific cell types [<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. This process produces data that include spatial coordinates, marker intensity values and cell types for up to 10<sup>7</sup> cells.</p>
      <p>While our experiments primarily focus on CyCIF data, SpatialCells can be applied to analyzing other spatially resolved omics data, such as 10X Genomics Visium data and iterative indirect immunofluorescence imaging (4i) data [<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p>

    <sec id="sec7">
      <title>Data exploration</title>
      <p>In the data exploration, we have incorporated measurement and visualization tools that can provide initial insights into samples. These include:</p>
      <list list-type="bullet">
        <list-item>
          <p>Whole-slide-level cell composition. This involves assessing the percentages of different cell types present in the samples, such as tumor cells and immune cells.</p>
        </list-item>
        <list-item>
          <p>ROI-level cell composition. Whole-slide tissues often have a significant amount of blank background. SpatialCells computationally defines ROIs and removes background in a standardized manner across all tissues in the study cohort. This is accomplished by initially calculating the tumor boundary and then extending this boundary by a specified distance (a user-defined parameter).</p>
        </list-item>
        <list-item>
          <p>Region-based cell composition. SpatialCells provides the capability for the geometric partition of tissues in various ways. For instance, it can divide the tumor region into subregions based on distance from the centroid or angle from the zero degree. Following the partitioning, SpatialCells can enumerate cell types within each tissue subregion for detailed compositional analysis.</p>
        </list-item>
        <list-item>
          <p>Region-based clustering. Similarly, after partitioning, SpatialCells provides the ability to cluster cells within a specific region.</p>
        </list-item>
      </list>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec8">
      <title>Tumor cell-centric analysis</title>
      <p>Tumor cell-centric analysis focuses on the characterization and study of tumor cells to gain insights into their biology, heterogeneity and behavior within the TME. Specifically, the American Joint Committee on Cancer/Union for International Cancer Control (AJCC/UICC) staging system provides guidelines for classifying the extent of cancer spread, considering factors such as tumor size and depth of invasion [<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14–16</xref>]. Additionally, the mitotic rate of various tumors is highly relevant in predicting patient outcomes [<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17–19</xref>]. In this analysis, we have emphasized the following tumor characteristics that may be linked to patient prognosis:</p>
      <list list-type="bullet">
        <list-item>
          <p>Tumor area and tumor cell density. SpatialCells offers functions for defining regions based on user-specified markers and calculating the area of a region and the density of any cell type within the region.</p>
        </list-item>
        <list-item>
          <p>Tumor multivariate proliferation index (MPI). Gaglia <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> demonstrated the effectiveness of an MPI in differentiating proliferating from non-proliferating tumor cells [<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Building on this work, SpatialCells provides a function for calculating an MPI of a given cell type, including tumor cells. The input of this function includes two marker lists of interest: (1) mitosis/proliferation markers (e.g. Serine-10 phosphorylated histone H3, Ki67, PCNA and MCM2) and (2) cell cycle arrest markers (e.g. p21 and p27). Adapted from the definition in the work by Gaglia <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>. [<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], the MPI is defined as follows:</p>
        </list-item>

Instead of computing a single MPI for the whole tissue, SpatialCells enables calculating MPI for subregions of interest within the tissue sample. We demonstrate this method by applying a sliding window of a user-defined size over the tissue and computing the MPI for each subregion.</p>
      <list list-type="bullet">
        <list-item>
          <p>Tumor isolation index. Categorizing tumors into immune hot, immune suppressed and immune cold/isolated groups has considerable prognostic value in various malignancies [<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Here, we focus on defining a tumor isolation index, which is the fraction of tumor cells in the region without immune cells over all tumor cells. This index is accomplished by dividing the overall ROI (whole-slide tissue with background removed) into two subregions: immune-rich region and region with almost no tumor-infiltrating immune cells.</p>

      <title>Immune cell-oriented analysis</title>
      <p>The TME is a spatially organized landscape characterized by the presence of lymphocytes, macrophages and other cell types located both within the central region and at the invasive margin of the tumor. Understanding the TME composition is essential for developing effective cancer therapies and predicting patient prognosis. Here, we have conducted macro-region and micro-region analyses, along with cell-to-cell interactions:</p>
      <list list-type="bullet">
        <list-item>
          <p>Macro-region analysis. The overall ROI, which encompasses the whole-slide tissue with the background removed, is divided into four subregions: tumor, tumor border, stroma border and stroma, as illustrated in <xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>. We subsequently evaluate the cell compositions within each region, with a particular focus on immune cells.</p>
        </list-item>
        <list-item>
          <p>Micro-region analysis. This analysis focuses on small regions, defined as micro-regions, within the tumor area, as illustrated in <xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>. By identifying these micro-regions, we can perform detailed characterizations of cells within them, enabling a finer-grained understanding of the cellular landscape.</p>
        </list-item>
        <list-item>
          <p>Cell-to-cell interactions. An important aspect of our analysis involves investigating the interactions between various cell types within the TME. For instance, SpatialCells can be applied to quantify the interactions between tumor cells and immune cells. As shown in <xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>, we assess the degree of tumor immune infiltration by measuring the distance between a tumor cell and its nearest immune cell. This information provides valuable insights into the interplay between different cell populations within the TME.</p>

    <p>In this section, we demonstrate the functionality of SpatialCells by presenting results in data exploration, tumor cell–centric analysis and immune cell-oriented analysis. Additional analyses can be found in tutorials, providing researchers with a comprehensive toolkit for in-depth investigations.</p>
    <p>Our analyses involve publicly available multiplexed imaging data of a cutaneous melanoma sample (MEL1) consisting of 1 110 585 cells [<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. MEL1 was imaged using CyCIF [<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] with 30 antibody markers (e.g. SOX10, Keratin, CD31, CD3D, CD8A, CD11C, MITF and Ki67) and preprocessed using MCMICRO [<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], which transforms multi-channel whole-slide images into single-cell data. The output of MCMICRO is the input of SpatialCells. Additional details of this sample can be found in the provided reference [<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].</p>

      <p>SpatialCells is a versatile tool for region-based data exploration, particularly for assessing cell composition or clustering within whole-slide images or specific regions of interest. <xref rid="f3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref> illustrates how SpatialCells can be applied to compute cell compositions for three different types of regions within the MEL1 sample.</p>

      <p>The principal tumor (T) category for invasive melanoma is defined as the maximum tumor thickness measured with a calibrated ocular micrometer at a right angle to the adjacent normal skin to the deepest point of tumor invasion [<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. In this case, the MEL1 section shows fragmentation artifacts at the deep aspect of the invasive front. To ensure accurate measurements of the distance from the centroid or the epidermis to the tumor boundary, we excluded the fragmented area with SOX10+ cells and focused on the main tumor area. If we included these separate fragments of SOX10+ cells along with the intervening empty spaces, the measurements would have been artificially increased.</p>
      <p><xref rid="f3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A and B</xref> presents the expression levels of related markers, including keratin, SOX10, MITF and CD3D, within the imaging data. SOX10 expression is a sensitive and specific marker for melanoma tumor cells. MITF is an important melanoma oncogene and plays a role in determining therapeutic resistance [<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. CD3D is a marker commonly associated with immune cells, particularly T lymphocytes (or T cells). <xref rid="f3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref> shows the boundary of the main tumor area as identified by SpatialCells. In <xref rid="f3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>, the subregions are defined based on the distance from the centroid of the main tumor area. In <xref rid="f3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>, the subregions are based on their angles from the zero-degree reference. The percentage of MITF+SOX10+ cells within each subregion is computed. The two barplots in <xref rid="f3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D and E</xref> demonstrate the gradient of MITF+ tumor cells. <xref rid="f3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref> provides cell composition within subregions, which are defined based on their distance from the epidermis. The centroid (start point) and the epidermis (start line) are computationally determined.

      </fig>
      <p>Tumor margins are exposed to cell infiltration, physical contact and diffusible chemotactic gradients from the stromal regions and vice versa. Therefore, defining tumor and stromal boundaries allows us to more specifically assess the complex interplay between invasive melanoma tumor cells and the microenvironment and to identify novel markers [<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. In <xref rid="f5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>, the overall ROI is divided into four distinct subregions: Tumor (T), which represents the core tumor region; Tumor border (Tb), which is the transitional area immediately adjacent to the tumor; Stroma border (Sb), marking the border between tumor and stroma; and Stroma (S), situated farther from the tumor. These subregions are defined based on specific distances from the tumor boundary, with the tumor region boundary set at 100 microns, the stroma border region boundary at 200 microns and the boundary for the overall ROI at 800 microns away from the tumor boundary. Importantly, users have the flexibility to customize these distances. In <xref rid="f5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>, the corresponding counts of tumor cells, T cells and other cells are presented for each of the four defined regions. <xref rid="f5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref> further provides insights by illustrating the cell fraction among all cells within each defined region. <xref rid="f5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref> displays micro-regions within the tumor area. Each micro-region is indexed, enabling users to pinpoint specific micro-regions of interest. <xref rid="f5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref> offers a closer look at these micro-regions. In <xref rid="f5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5F</xref>, every micro-region boundary is extended and contracted (offset = 30 microns) to define ‘In’, ‘Border inside’ and ‘Border outside’ subregions, as visually demonstrated in <xref rid="f5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5H</xref>. The cell compositions within these three subregions for each micro-region are presented in <xref rid="f5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5G</xref>.</p>
      <p>The Stroma region in <xref rid="f5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref> includes some SOX10+ tumor cells on the right side of the image. This is due to the presence of fragmentation artifacts in this sample [<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. In practice, users may need to analyze the data separately for each area, as was the case in the provided reference [<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. In our tutorials, we include detailed instructions on how to perform these analyses.</p>

      <title>Experimental results on spatial omics data</title>
      <p>To demonstrate the broad utility of SpatialCells for analyzing other spatial omics data modalities, we further conducted experiments on a public Visium dataset of a human lymph node sample [<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The data were deconvoluted following the standard Cell2location protocol and analyzed with SpatialCells [<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The details are available in our tutorials, with results presented in <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 2</xref>. SpatialCells can automate the identification of all germinal centers and delineate their region boundaries that are consistent with the authors’ manual annotation, eliminating the necessity of manual annotation that could introduce significant bias.</p>

    <title>DISCUSSION AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS</title>
    <p>SpatialCells represents a significant advance in the field of spatial analysis for multiplexed single-cell image data, enabling the computational quantification and standardized analyses of critical features within the TME. Its functionalities encompass various aspects of TME analysis, such as region-based cell composition, tumor proliferation index, tumor isolation index, immune cell infiltration and tumor-immune distance. By providing these analytical tools, SpatialCells empowers researchers to gain deeper insights into the intricate spatial relationships and characteristics of cells within the TME.</p>
    <p>One of the limitations of the SpatialCells software is that the cell segmentation provided by upstream imaging data preprocessing tools, such as MCMICRO [<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], may introduce errors in the cell counts. However, SpatialCells is a customizable software that can analyze multiple samples within a study in a consistent and standardized manner. This capability involves applying similar settings and parameters across all samples, thus mitigating some of the variability introduced by cell segmentation. Another limitation of the SpatialCells software is the reliance on the quality of gating and calling cell types, which involve converting continuous marker expression levels into binary variables. This binary conversion introduces subjectivity, leading to variability in cell count. Finally, the adaptability of SpatialCells, with its support for user-defined parameters, affords users the freedom to configure settings based on their specific needs. However, this flexibility can also be a source of errors, as suboptimal parameter choices may impact the accuracy of the analysis.</p>
    <p>In the future, we will continue to improve this software and provide clear guidelines to users on best practices for parameter selection. We will include more functions as well as tutorials, particularly for multimodal analyses within the field of spatial biology. For example, we will provide functions for migrating ROIs from other modalities, such as hematoxylin and eosin stain imaging and spatial transcriptomics, to multiplexed imaging, allowing integrative analyses across different modality data.</p>

    <title>CONCLUSIONS</title>
    <p>In summary, SpatialCells is a novel software solution for spatially analyzing the TME using multiplexed imaging data in a streamlined fashion with the capacity to process samples containing millions of cells. This software is of critical importance in the analysis of the TME and in furthering our understanding of the factors leading to tumor progression as it facilitates subsequent association analyses and machine learning predictions.</p>
