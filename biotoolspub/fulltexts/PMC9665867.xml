        <title>Summary</title>
        <p>Several high-throughput protein–DNA binding methods currently available produce highly reproducible measurements of binding affinity at the level of the <italic toggle="yes">k-</italic>mer. However, understanding where a <italic toggle="yes">k-</italic>mer is positioned along a binding site sequence depends on alignment. Here, we present Top-Down Crawl (TDC), an ultra-rapid tool designed for the alignment of <italic toggle="yes">k-</italic>mer level data in a rank-dependent and position weight matrix (PWM)-independent manner. As the framework only depends on the rank of the input, the method can accept input from many types of experiments (protein binding microarray, SELEX-seq, SMiLE-seq, etc.) without the need for specialized parameterization. Measuring the performance of the alignment using multiple linear regression with 5-fold cross-validation, we find TDC to perform as well as or better than computationally expensive PWM-based methods.</p>

    <title>1 Introduction</title>
    <p>High-throughput <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> binding methods, such as protein binding microarrays (<xref rid="btac653-B3" ref-type="bibr">Berger <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>), SELEX-seq (<xref rid="btac653-B7" ref-type="bibr">Riley <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>; <xref rid="btac653-B9" ref-type="bibr">Slattery <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>) and SMiLE-seq (<xref rid="btac653-B6" ref-type="bibr">Isakova <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>), have given researchers the ability to precisely quantify transcription factor (TF) binding in a controlled environment using unbiased pools of DNA. For each of these methods, the enrichment of each individual probe is not as informative as the enrichment of <italic toggle="yes">k-</italic>mers. While each full-length probe may occur a few times within a sample, shorter <italic toggle="yes">k-</italic>mers will occur more frequently, providing highly reproducible measures of binding affinity. Since <italic toggle="yes">k-</italic>mer enrichment is inherently context-free, it is common to see a high level of enrichment for <italic toggle="yes">k-</italic>mers that only covers a portion of the binding site. Determining which part of the binding site a <italic toggle="yes">k-</italic>mer covers depends on alignment. Alignment allows researchers to pinpoint TF–DNA interactions along the binding site and is a necessary step in the application of conventional machine learning approaches such as multiple linear regression (MLR). Previously described approaches, such as MEME (<xref rid="btac653-B2" ref-type="bibr">Bailey &amp; Elkan, 1994</xref>), BEESEM (<xref rid="btac653-B8" ref-type="bibr">Ruan <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>) and SelexGLM (<xref rid="btac653-B11" ref-type="bibr">Zhang <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2018</xref>) are designed to generate position weight matrices (PWMs) which can subsequently be used to align <italic toggle="yes">k-</italic>mer level data, but they were not developed for this purpose. Furthermore, using a PWM to summarize binding preferences for a TF is an unnecessary abstraction from the original <italic toggle="yes">k-</italic>mer level data and results in the loss of information regarding interdependencies between positions of the binding site. It is already known that DNA shape is dependent on local interactions across several base pairs (bp) and plays a significant role in protein–DNA binding for many TFs (<xref rid="btac653-B10" ref-type="bibr">Yang <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>). Here, we describe a new approach called Top-Down Crawl (TDC), which can rapidly align large sets of <italic toggle="yes">k-</italic>mer level quantitative binding data in a rank-dependent manner that does not depend on experiment-specific parameterization.</p>
  </sec>
  <sec>
    <title>2 TDC implementation</title>
    <p>TDC was developed with one goal in mind: the usage of high-affinity sequences to describe the binding of similar, but lower-affinity sequences. Then, use those sequences to align other similar sequences. More specifically, the algorithm starts by assigning the <italic toggle="yes">k-</italic>mer with the largest binding metric a shift of 0 bp and is set as the first reference. All unaligned <italic toggle="yes">k-</italic>mers that are one single bp mutation away from the reference are then added to the alignment and assigned a shift equal to that of the reference (0 in this case). All unaligned <italic toggle="yes">k-</italic>mers overlapping the reference by up to <italic toggle="yes">k</italic>−2 bp are then added to the alignment with a shift equal to that of the reference ±1 or 2 bp depending on if that sequence is overlapping on the 5′ or 3′ end of the reference (<xref rid="btac653-F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). For example, the sequence AGTAAAC would overlap with the 5′ end of GTAAACA with a shift of −1 bp. After this round, the reference sequence is marked as ‘complete’ and the next reference is determined as the most enriched <italic toggle="yes">k</italic>-mer amongst those which have been aligned, excluding sequences already marked as complete. As before, the new reference is used as a starting point for the addition of more <italic toggle="yes">k</italic>-mers to the alignment, so long as they have not been added previously. This process is terminated when all sequences added to the alignment have been marked as ‘complete’. Detailed pseudocode of this process is made available in <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table S1</xref>.</p>

    <p>TDC is provided through a freely accessible webserver and requires only a list of sequences with their corresponding binding measurements as input. After processing the upload, the user is given a summary of the alignment as well as a representative PWM, weighting each sequence by its associated binding metric. This is most appropriate for SELEX-seq data, for which the relative enrichment is expected to approximate the relative binding affinity (<xref rid="btac653-B7" ref-type="bibr">Riley <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>; <xref rid="btac653-B9" ref-type="bibr">Slattery <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>). The alignment itself is provided as a tab-delimited file where gaps are represented by the ‘_’ character. The output is stored for 48 h and can be accessed using a unique link generated for the submission. TDC can also be run locally as a python package available through pip.</p>
  </sec>
  <sec>
    <title>3 Results and comparisons</title>
    <p>Given a PWM from a motif-generating method such as MEME, BEESEM or SelexGLM, <italic toggle="yes">k-</italic>mers can be assigned to their most likely ‘shift’ relative to the reference, similar to TDC. This is done by padding a given PWM with neutral positions on the 5′ and 3′ ends, then sliding each <italic toggle="yes">k-</italic>mer along every window along the PWM to see which shift results in the highest score. The alignments generated by these methods can then be directly compared with those provided by TDC. A generalizable workflow for PWM-based <italic toggle="yes">k</italic>-mer alignment and evaluation is provided at <ext-link xlink:href="https://github.com/bhcooper/TDC_evaluation" ext-link-type="uri">https://github.com/bhcooper/TDC_evaluation</ext-link>.</p>
    <p>MEME is a well-established method for the alignment of sequences, but it does not take quantitative data as input. Therefore, every sequence is weighted equivalently in the construction of the PWM. For this reason, we run MEME using only <italic toggle="yes">k-</italic>mers with a log enrichment two standard deviations above the mean. The resulting PWM can then be used for the alignment of all <italic toggle="yes">k-</italic>mers as described above. Alternatively, BEESEM was made specifically for creating PWMs from SELEX-seq data but is computationally limited to producing motifs no longer than 10 bp and relies on subsampling for particularly large datasets (<xref rid="btac653-B8" ref-type="bibr">Ruan <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>). Although SelexGLM is able to generate much longer PWMs (<xref rid="btac653-B11" ref-type="bibr">Zhang <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2018</xref>), the currently available implementation has considerable memory requirements (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table S2</xref>, <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. S1</xref>), and the output depends on the specification of several hyperparameters.</p>
    <p>To compare TDC with alternate alignment methods, we include the analysis of 12 SELEX-seq datasets that have previously been published (<xref rid="btac653-B1" ref-type="bibr">Abe <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>; <xref rid="btac653-B5" ref-type="bibr">Dantas Machado <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2020</xref>; <xref rid="btac653-B11" ref-type="bibr">Zhang <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2018</xref>). We use a <italic toggle="yes">k-</italic>mer length of 10 bp, which covers the known binding site for most of the TFs considered and contains more information about suboptimal binding sites compared to longer <italic toggle="yes">k-</italic>mers. Although the goal of TDC is alignment rather than PWM generation, we can generate a logo from each alignment, weighting each sequence by its relative enrichment (<xref rid="btac653-F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>, <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. S2</xref>). We found the resulting PWMs to be most similar to those generated by BEESEM, with additional information outside the center of the binding site, covering about 15 informative positions for the androgen and glucocorticoid receptor binding sites (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. S2</xref>).</p>
    <p>For a more in-depth comparison, we determine what percent of significantly enriched 10-mers are assigned to the same shift, using TDC as the reference. TDC showed a high level of agreement with BEESEM, followed by MEME and SelexGLM (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table S3</xref>, <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. S1</xref>). To evaluate the quality of each alignment, an MLR model was trained to predict the log enrichment of aligned 10-mers which were significantly enriched. Base pairs were one-hot encoded for each position, and the predicted minor groove width and electrostatic potential were included to account for interdependencies between positions (<xref rid="btac653-B4" ref-type="bibr">Chiu <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>). For MLR to perform well, sequences need to be aligned such that position-specific permutations along the binding site predictably modulate binding affinity. We found TDC to exhibit the best average performance as measured by the median <italic toggle="yes">R<sup>2</sup></italic> using 5-fold cross validation (<xref rid="btac653-F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>, <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table S4</xref>). Comparing the wall-clock times, BEESEM was the slowest, requiring hours to complete, whereas TDC only takes seconds (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table S5</xref> and <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. S1</xref>). SelexGLM was faster than BEESEM but required a large amount of memory in the tests performed (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table S2</xref> and <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. S1</xref>). The primary reason these methods are more computationally demanding is because they work at the level of the full-length read rather than at the level of the <italic toggle="yes">k</italic>-mer. Since MEME was only used to align <italic toggle="yes">k-</italic>mers with a log enrichment two standard deviations above the means, its wall-clock time was dependent on the number of sequences passing this threshold. While the quickest batch, including 653 sequences, was aligned in about 5 s, the slowest batch, including just 4889 sequences took 18 min, demonstrating a 216-fold increase in wall-clock time for a 7.5-fold increase in the number of sequences aligned (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table S5</xref>). Finally, we tested the MLR performance of various length <italic toggle="yes">k</italic>-mers aligned with TDC and found the optimal length to be 10 bp (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. S3</xref>).</p>
  </sec>
  <sec>
    <title>4 Conclusions</title>
    <p>Although we demonstrate TDC’s speed and performance using SELEX-seq data, the alignment framework is highly flexible as it only depends on the rank of the sequences provided. This allows for the alignment of binding data from a variety of experimental approaches used today and those that are produced in the future.</p>
