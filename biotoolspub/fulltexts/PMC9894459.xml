    <abstract>
      <p>Environmental factors affect the growth of microorganisms and therefore alter the composition of microbiota. Correlative analysis of the relationship between metagenomic composition and the environmental gradient can help elucidate key environmental factors and establishment principles for microbial communities. However, a reasonable method to quantitatively compare whole metagenomic data and identify the primary environmental factors for the establishment of microbiota has not been reported so far. In this study, we developed a method to compare whole proteomes deduced from metagenomic shotgun sequencing data, and quantitatively display their phylogenetic relationships as metagenomic trees. We called this method <underline>M</underline>etagenomic <underline>P</underline>hylogeny by <underline>A</underline>verage <underline>S</underline>equence <underline>S</underline>imilarity (MPASS). We also compared one of the metagenomic trees with dendrograms of environmental factors using a comparison tool for phylogenetic trees. The MPASS method correctly constructed metagenomic trees of simulated metagenomes and soil and water samples. The topology of the metagenomic tree of samples from the Kirishima hot springs area in Japan was highly similarity to that of the dendrograms based on previously reported environmental factors for this area. The topology of the metagenomic tree also reflected the dynamics of microbiota at the taxonomic and functional levels. Our results strongly suggest that MPASS can successfully classify metagenomic shotgun sequencing data based on the similarity of whole protein-coding sequences, and will be useful for the identification of principal environmental factors for the establishment of microbial communities.

    <title>Introduction</title>
    <p>The growth of microorganisms in nature is influenced by environmental factors, such as temperature, pH, carbon and nitrogen sources, and trace metal elements, and altered along with their gradient. Thus, correlation analysis of the transition between the composition of the microbiota and their environmental conditions (e.g., soil or water quality) can help to elucidate the establishment principles of microbial communities. Isolation and analysis of 16S rRNA sequences by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis [<xref rid="pone.0281288.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], which has been widely used for taxonomic composition analysis of microorganisms, has been largely replaced by amplicon sequencing using next-generation sequencers [<xref rid="pone.0281288.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0281288.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Furthermore, the improved performance of sequencing technologies, the reduced cost of sequencing, and the development of bioinformatic methods have led to the development of whole metagenomic shotgun sequencing for the analysis of complicated microbiota [<xref rid="pone.0281288.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0281288.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Whole sequencing data include not only taxon-relating genes but also other functional genes that are involved in biological processes such as metabolism, signal transduction, and transport of ions and other chemicals. Therefore, metagenomic shotgun sequencing analysis can detect unique metabolic pathways, new species, and novel functional genes in addition to taxonomic identification. These multidimensional data have been integrated into publicly available databases such as KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) [<xref rid="pone.0281288.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], MAPLE (microbiome analysis pipeline) [<xref rid="pone.0281288.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], and KMAP (KAUST metagenomic analysis platform) [<xref rid="pone.0281288.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] for functional analysis.</p>
    <p>Although shotgun metagenomic sequence data are informative and make it possible to classify microorganisms with high taxonomic resolution, the data are complicated and methods for quantitative comparisons among whole metagenomic data are still being developed. For example, in the taxonomic assignment-based method proposed by Mitra <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pone.0281288.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] the distance matrix of metagenomes is reconstructed based on the taxonomic profiles and ecological indices. The MEGAN Community Edition offers a wide variety of analysis options and can classify metagenomes based on taxonomic and functional assignments [<xref rid="pone.0281288.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The Community-Analyzer developed by Kuntal <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pone.0281288.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] is based on the pair-wise correlation of abundance of taxonomic groups. PhyloPhlAn3 uses sequences of highly conserved core genes to infer metagenomic phylogeny [<xref rid="pone.0281288.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. These methods can provide the precise composition of taxonomic and functional groups of microorganisms in addition to the distance between metagenomes. However, taxonomy- and function-based distances are not always the same as genomic distance. Indeed, a recent comprehensive analysis of 13,174 public metagenomic datasets across 14 major habitats indicated that most species-level genes and protein families were rare and the rates of positive selection for species-specific genes were low [<xref rid="pone.0281288.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p>
    <p>Another quantitative comparison method is the assignment-free <italic toggle="yes">k</italic>-tuple method [<xref rid="pone.0281288.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. A <italic toggle="yes">k</italic>-tuple (also called <italic toggle="yes">k</italic>-word or <italic toggle="yes">k</italic>-mer) is a segment of consecutive nucleotide bases of length <italic toggle="yes">k</italic>. When two genomes are closely related, the relative <italic toggle="yes">k-</italic>tuple frequencies will be more similar than those between distantly related genomes [<xref rid="pone.0281288.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Dissimilarity in <italic toggle="yes">k</italic>-tuple frequencies between metagenomes has been used as the metagenomic distance for comparing and clustering metagenomic samples, and sophisticated parameters for metagenomic dissimilarities, such as d<sup>S</sup><sub>2</sub> and d*<sub>2</sub>, have also been developed and used for clustering metagenomes [<xref rid="pone.0281288.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0281288.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. However, although <italic toggle="yes">k</italic>-tuple frequencies are influenced by gene density and codon bias in genomes, these factors are not directly related to the function of the genes. Here, we propose a function-related and assignment-free method based on phylogenomic considerations. Phylogenomics can identify evolutionary trajectories of organisms by comparing their genomic information. Several phylogenomic methods have been proposed, including concatenation of many alignments, construction of a supertree (consensus tree) from phylogenetic trees of each gene, and construction of a distance matrix from the averaged similarity of whole genes between genomes [<xref rid="pone.0281288.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The concatenation-based and supertree methods use traditional molecular phylogenetic techniques (e.g., maximum likelihood and maximum parsimony) to reconstruct the trees. Although the averaged sequence similarity method for constructing a distance matrix cannot use such traditional techniques, all the genetic information in the genome can be used and tree construction is performed automatically [<xref rid="pone.0281288.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0281288.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Human decisions, such as trimming of sequence alignments and selection of genomes and genes, are not required.</p>
    <p>In this study, we developed a novel method for comparing whole protein-coding genes between metagenomic data that we named <underline>M</underline>etagenomic <underline>P</underline>hylogeny by <underline>A</underline>verage <underline>S</underline>equence <underline>S</underline>imilarity (MPASS) (<xref rid="pone.0281288.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>). The MPASS method is derived from the average sequence similarity method. We applied MPASS to analyze simulated, soil, and aquatic microbiota datasets. We also analyzed the relationship between the metagenomic tree of samples from the Kirishima hot springs area in Japan and dendrograms of environmental parameters for this area [<xref rid="pone.0281288.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] using a comparison tool for phylogenetic trees.</p>

      <title>Metagenomic tree analysis detected group relationships among simulated metagenomic datasets</title>
      <p>We applied MPASS (<xref rid="pone.0281288.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>) to analyze two simulated metagenomic datasets of five bacterial species: <italic toggle="yes">Sulfolobus islandicus</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Proteus mirabilis</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Nitrosospira multiformis</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Bacteroides fragilis</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">Acidobacterium capsulatum</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0281288.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. In the first simulation, we varied the original bacterial amounts so that the species with high values were lower and the species with low values were higher (<xref rid="pone.0281288.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref>) and all values in each original vector converged. Thirty simulated metagenomic data samples, which were generated by mixing randomly sampled short reads from the five bacterial species, were divided into three groups (G1–3) based on the original bacterial composition. The metagenomic tree of these samples was reconstructed by MPASS (<xref rid="pone.0281288.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B</xref>). The constructed tree reflected the three groups of metagenomic samples. The relationship between branching order and composition of the five bacterial species in the metagenomic samples was then examined in more detail. Within each group, the samples with the original bacterial composition were branched at the end of the clusters, whereas the samples with the greatest changes in bacterial composition (i.e., G1-9, G1-10, G2-7, G2-8, G3-9, G3-10) were deeply branched off. Because these deeply branched samples had lost their specific composition, this branching pattern of the tree is reasonable.</p>

      <p>In the second simulation, we generated another 30 metagenomic data samples with random addition of Gaussian noise (<xref rid="pone.0281288.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A</xref>). In the metagenomic tree of these samples (<xref rid="pone.0281288.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3B</xref>), almost all the samples separated into the corresponding clusters; the exceptions were G1-2 and G2-10, which were clustered in G2 and G1, respectively. The bacterial compositions of these two metagenomes were significantly different from those of the other metagenomes in each group (<xref rid="pone.0281288.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A</xref>). Therefore, the branching pattern of this tree was congruent with the simulated metagenomic data. The results of the two simulation analyses strongly suggest that MPASS can reflect similarities of bacterial compositions among metagenomes.</p>

      <title>Metagenomic tree analysis detected group relationships among soil metagenomes</title>
      <p>We applied MPASS to analyze the soil metagenomic data that Song <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0281288.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] used to validate their microbiome clustering method. The 16 metagenomic data samples were derived from distinct geographic locations and ecological biomes, including hot deserts, cold deserts, forests, prairie, and tundra [<xref rid="pone.0281288.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The metagenomic tree of these samples clearly separated them into cold desert, hot desert, and green biomes (forest, prairie, tundra) (<xref rid="pone.0281288.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4</xref>). Song <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pone.0281288.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] found that the main factor for differentiation of soil microbiota was the soil pH value. For example, tropical forest (PE6) and Arctic tundra (TL1) samples were from soils with the lowest pH values (pH 4.12 and pH 4.58) among all the samples, and they clustered together in the tree. Our metagenomic tree also had subclusters within the three main clusters (cold desert, hot deserts, green biomes) that reflected similarities of soil pH values. The three metagenomic samples from soils with the lowest pH values, PE6, TL1, and boreal forest sample (BZ1), formed a subcluster in the main green biomes cluster. We found that geographic location also affected the clustering of the metagenomic samples; two cold (polar) desert samples (EB019 and EB026) and two hot desert samples (MD3 and SV1) from closely related locations formed subclusters in the two main clusters. These results indicate that MPASS can successfully cluster microbiota according to their environment and geographic location.</p>

      <p>In the seawater cluster, the 15 samples formed three subclusters with distinct geographic locations (<xref rid="pone.0281288.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref>). Among the three metagenomic samples from the <italic toggle="yes">Tara</italic> Ocean project [<xref rid="pone.0281288.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], TarOc3 was the most deeply branched, and TarOc1 and TarOc2 were closely related. TarOc1 and TarOc2 were both derived from deep seawater (188 m), whereas TarOc3 was from surface water (5 m). The sampling sites of TarOc1 and TarOc2 also had lower temperatures and higher chlorophyll contents than the sampling site of TarOc3 (BioSample ID: SAMEA2622021 for TarOc1 and TarOc2, BioSample ID: SAMEA2621990 for TarOc3).</p>
      <p>Among the four metagenomic samples from the Okhotsk Sea, WSP1 was most deeply branched, WSP5 was branched off, and WSP2 and WSP3 were closely related (<xref rid="pone.0281288.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref>). This topology is consistent with a previously reported 16S rRNA-based clustering data analysis [<xref rid="pone.0281288.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], which showed differences in the prokaryotic community composition; two groups of <italic toggle="yes">Alphaproteobacteria</italic> (<italic toggle="yes">Rhodobacterales</italic>) and one group of <italic toggle="yes">Gammaproteobacteria</italic> (<italic toggle="yes">Oceanospirillales</italic>) were more abundant in the WSP2, WSP3, and WSP5 samples than they were in the WSP1 sample.</p>
      <p>Submarine hydrothermal systems contain hydrogen sulfide, methane, and hydrogen gasses and harbor chemolithoautotrophic bacteria and archaea [<xref rid="pone.0281288.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0281288.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. In the microbiota of a hydrothermal vent around Kueishantao Island, <italic toggle="yes">Epsilonproteobacteria</italic> including <italic toggle="yes">Campylobacteria</italic>, which are classified as sulfur-reducing chemolithoautotrophic <italic toggle="yes">Nautiliales</italic>-like bacteria, was found to be a dominant group in the vent sites [<xref rid="pone.0281288.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], whereas the abundance of <italic toggle="yes">Epsilonproteobacteria</italic> was much lower in the seawaters that were far from the hydrothermal vent. Our metagenomic tree showed that the two samples (W_outside and Y_outside) that were furthest from the hydrothermal vent formed a subcluster, but the other metagenomic samples did not cluster according to the distance from the hydrothermal vent (<xref rid="pone.0281288.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref>). This may be because the locations from which the metagenomic samples were derived reflected dynamic changes in the atmospheric environment between the hydrothermal vent and its surroundings.</p>
      <p>In the freshwater cluster, the 20 samples clearly separated into lake and hot spring subclusters (<xref rid="pone.0281288.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref>). Although the metagenomic samples from the Kirishima hot springs area were not separated from the central India hot spring samples at the root of these branches, the Kirishima samples formed a single cluster. In the lake subculture, the four metagenomic samples from the boreal lake in Finland were taken from water layers at different depths; sari1b, sari2b, sari3b, and sari4b were from water layers at 0.1 m, 1.1 m, 1.6 m, and 2.1 m, respectively [<xref rid="pone.0281288.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. In this lake, although the oxygen concentration was constant from the surface water to a depth of 1 m, it rapidly decreased at a depth of 2 m. The methane and carbon dioxide concentrations were almost the same in all four layers. The branching pattern of these samples in our metagenomic tree did not reflect the depths of the sampling areas; sari3b was most deeply branched, sari2b was branched off, and sari1b and sari4b, were most closely related. This branching pattern may be caused by other environmental factors.</p>
      <p>In the hot springs subcluster, all the samples from central India [<xref rid="pone.0281288.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] except the TAT-1 sample, were branched off in order of temperature (<xref rid="pone.0281288.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref>). Samples CAN (43.5°C) and CAP (52.1°C) from the lowest temperature sites were the most deeply branched, then BAN (55°C) and TAT-2 (61.5°C) were branched off. The remaining three metagenomic samples formed a subcluster in which TAT-1 (98°C) branched off first and TAT-3 (67°C) and TAT4 (69°C) were most closely related. The TAT-3 and TAT-4 samples had lower amounts of proteobacteria than the other metagenomic samples.</p>
      <p>The branching pattern of the Kirishima samples in our metagenomic tree (<xref rid="pone.0281288.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref>) correlated with the turbidity and pH of the sampling sites. The four deeply branched samples, N1, K1, Y1, and M1, were taken from the hot springs with the higher pH and lower turbidity [<xref rid="pone.0281288.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], whereas the other five samples were from the hot springs with the lower pH and higher turbidity. The N1 sample, which taken from the hot spring at 68°C, was most deeply branched, then the K1, Y1, and M1 were branched off. <italic toggle="yes">Sulfolobaceae</italic>, which is in superkingdom Archaea, was included in the K2, I1, T1, G1, and N2 samples. Archaea in this family are known to be adapted to high temperature and low pH environments; therefore, it is likely that the branching pattern of the Kirishima subcluster is related to the pH, turbidity, and temperature of the sampling sites. Together, these results show that the branching patterns of these aquatic metagenome samples reflect their environmental factors, microbial communities, and geographic locations, and indicate the suitability of MPASS for the clustering of microbiota.</p>

      <title>Metagenomic tree topology was similar to that of dendrograms of highly influential environmental factors</title>
      <p>Quantifying the relationship between metagenomic transitions and changes in environmental parameters, including geology and water quality, can indicate the extent of the influence of the environment on the microbiota. We used the branches for the Kirishima samples in our metagenomic tree (<xref rid="pone.0281288.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref>) as a model case. We applied the TREEDIST program [<xref rid="pone.0281288.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], which is used to compare the topologies of two phylogenetic trees, to quantitatively compare our metagenomic tree with dendrograms of previously reported environmental parameters. The environmental parameters for the Kirishima metagenomic samples reported by Nishiyama <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pone.0281288.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] were as follows: M1, K2, I1, T1, G1, and N2 were derived from a hot spring with high turbidity, low pH, high concentration of sulfate, copper and zinc ions, and relatively high total organic carbon and total nitrogen, whereas K1, Y1, and N1 were derived from transparent and medium pH environments. These properties of hot springs are related to their microbiota; <italic toggle="yes">Crenarchaeota</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">Aquificae</italic> were dominant in the former and latter hot springs, respectively. We constructed 41 dendrograms based on the environmental parameters of the Kirishima samples.</p>
      <p><xref rid="pone.0281288.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6</xref> shows the topological similarity between the metagenomic tree and the 41 dendrograms for the environmental parameters. The similarity was quantified as symmetric difference, which is based on the number of branching points with identical topology [<xref rid="pone.0281288.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. A low symmetric difference implies that two trees are very similar. Our metagenomic tree was similar to the dendrograms constructed based on oxidation-reduction potential, total nitrogen, total organic nitrogen, dissolved organic nitrogen, particulate organic nitrogen, and concentration of sulfate (SO<sub>4</sub>) and vanadium ions. <italic toggle="yes">Crenarchaeota</italic> is aerobic and known to dominate in sulfate-rich hot springs [<xref rid="pone.0281288.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0281288.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], and <italic toggle="yes">Aquificae</italic> is anaerobic [<xref rid="pone.0281288.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0281288.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Oxidation-reduction potential is strongly related to oxygen concentration, and therefore the low symmetric differences for oxidation-reduction potential and SO<sub>4</sub> and vanadium ion concentrations suggest that these environmental parameters are strongly related to the establishment of microbiota in the Kirishima area.</p>

      <title>Metagenomic tree topology reflected the dynamics of microbiota at the organismal and genetic levels</title>
      <p>In phylogenomic trees, closely related genomes share many orthologs and distantly related genomes share a small number of orthologs, including house-keeping genes, paralogs, and other genes. We analyzed our MPASS-based metagenomic tree to determine how many species and genes were distributed across the various metagenomes on the same lineage and how many genes were shared between closely related metagenomes. We choose 1,000 high-coverage protein sequences in the I1 and N1 metagenomes, which are at opposite ends of the Kirishima metagenomic subcluster in <xref rid="pone.0281288.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref>, and calculated the existence probability of these proteins in the other Kirishima metagenomic samples. The evolutionary distances for each gene were obtained using the same calculation procedures as were used in MPASS without averaging the gene distances in the metagenomic samples, and were used as the existence probability. The results are shown in the heatmaps in <xref rid="pone.0281288.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7A and 7B</xref>. As mentioned in the previous section, the composition of microorganisms and environmental properties of I1 were relatively similar to those of M1, K2, T1, G1, and N2 [<xref rid="pone.0281288.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], whereas those of N1 were similar to those of K1 and Y1. <xref rid="pone.0281288.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7A</xref> shows that almost all of the homologous proteins of the I1 proteins existed only in the K2, G1, and T1 samples, and most of the homologous proteins of the N1 proteins existed mainly in the K1 and Y1 samples (<xref rid="pone.0281288.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7B</xref>). Unexpectedly, the N2 and Y1 samples contained many homologous proteins of both the I1 and N1 proteins. We selected 454 and 515 I1 and N1 proteins, respectively, that showed similar distribution patterns as the I1 and N1 samples in the MPASS-based metagenomic tree (Pearson correlation coefficient &gt;0.7) for further analysis. These results indicate that approximately 50% of the 1,000 high-coverage protein sequences were distributed across the various metagenomes on the same lineage as the metagenomic tree.</p>

      <p>The composition of microorganisms estimated from the selected I1 or N1 proteins is shown in <xref rid="pone.0281288.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7C and 7D</xref>. In the I1 protein group, three phyla of archaea, <italic toggle="yes">Crenarchaeota</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Nanoarchaeota</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">Candidatus Thermoplasmatota</italic>, and two groups of viruses were found (<xref rid="pone.0281288.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7C</xref>). The <italic toggle="yes">Crenarchaeota</italic> proteins were the most numerous and accounted for 71% of the I1 proteins. In the N1 protein group a variety of bacteria, archaea, and viruses was found (<xref rid="pone.0281288.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7D</xref>). The <italic toggle="yes">Aquificae</italic> proteins accounted for 91% of the N1 proteins. These results are consistent with the previously reported taxonomic composition of microorganisms based on 16S rRNA sequences [<xref rid="pone.0281288.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], and strongly suggest that MPASS can successfully elucidate metagenomic dynamics among various microbiota.</p>
      <p>As reported previously [<xref rid="pone.0281288.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], the N1 protein group contained a NapA protein and two Sox proteins, SoxB and SoxZ (<xref rid="pone.0281288.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4 Table</xref>). NapA is involved in nitrogen fixation and nitrification and SoxB and SoxZ are involved in the sulfur metabolism pathway. We also found differences in the types of transporter proteins between the I1 and N1 protein groups; metal transporters were frequently found in the N1 proteins (<xref rid="pone.0281288.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7F</xref>) but rarely found in the I1 proteins (<xref rid="pone.0281288.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7E</xref>). This result suggests that the N1 metagenome may consist of more diverged microorganisms that can use various metal elements that are imported from the environment by metal transporters. Low pH conditions, such as that for the N1 sample, can increase the solubility of metals [<xref rid="pone.0281288.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Therefore, the ability to use metal ions might be needed for a microorganism to become dominant in the N1 microbiome.</p>
      <p>In this study, we have shown that the gradients of both major bacterial species and environmental factors are closely related to the establishment of microbiota and their communities. We also discovered a new environmental factor for Kirishima microbiota; namely, the gradient of vanadium concentration, which was highly correlated with the topology of our metagenomic tree (<xref rid="pone.0281288.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6</xref>). Our results show that the MPASS method has the potential to discover new environmental factors and to detect their effect on microbiome formation.</p>

    <title>Discussion</title>
    <p>Quantitative comparisons between metagenomes can detect influential environmental factors for microbiota, discover useful or harmful microorganisms, and define the interaction of microbiota with their environments. Such comparisons present difficult challenges because genetic and non-genetic sequences from numerous organisms are present in metagenomic sequence data, and their functions are also diverse. In this study, we focused on the protein-coding genes in metagenomes, compared the amino acid sequences of whole proteins among metagenomes, quantitatively compared the coverage of protein sequences with the similarity between metagenomes, and clustered metagenomic data as a phylogenetic tree. These processes were defined as the MPASS method, which we applied to analyze three metagenomic datasets of simulated, soil, and aquatic samples. We showed that MPASS accurately clustered each of these datasets.</p>
    <p>Furthermore, because phylogenetic trees can be used to infer the evolution of organisms with their adaptation processes, we used our metagenomic tree to infer the transition of microbiota in response to environmental factors. We showed that the branching orders of the metagenomic samples in the hot springs and hydrothermal vent clusters correlated well with increases in both the temperature of the sampling sites and their distance from the hydrothermal sources (<xref rid="pone.0281288.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref>). In the cluster of the samples from the <italic toggle="yes">Tara</italic> Ocean project, a sea surface-derived sample first branched off, and a subcluster of deep-sea samples was located at the end of our metagenomic tree. Thus, the MPASS-based metagenomic tree successfully represented transitions in microbiota that occurred concomitantly with the environmental gradients. The MPASS-based tree and TREEDIST program [<xref rid="pone.0281288.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] quantified the relationships between the microbiota and their environmental factors as shown in <xref rid="pone.0281288.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6</xref>.</p>
    <p>Other phylogenomic methods have been proposed [<xref rid="pone.0281288.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], such as concatenation of many alignments and construction of a supertree (consensus tree) from many phylogenetic trees on each gene. Our MPASS method is based on the average sequence similarity method [<xref rid="pone.0281288.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0281288.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0281288.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], which can reconstruct phylogenomic trees without the need for human decisions, such as trimming of alignments and selection of genomes and genes. We also used MPASS to compare the extremely different I1 and N1 metagenomes that do not share any genes as shown in <xref rid="pone.0281288.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7A and 7B</xref>. According to a previously reported 16S rRNA analysis, K2, I1, T1, and G1 metagenomic samples contain <italic toggle="yes">Crenarchaeota</italic> species but not <italic toggle="yes">Aquificae</italic> species [<xref rid="pone.0281288.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. In such a case, concatenated alignments and supertrees cannot be reconstructed because construction of alignment and phylogenetic trees require a set of common genes. Our MPASS method can reconstruct a metagenomic tree, regardless of the number of shared genes between metagenomes. Furthermore, genes that exist in only one of two metagenomes can also be used to estimate metagenomic distances, which is important for the construction of accurate phylogenomic trees [<xref rid="pone.0281288.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. In this study, we integrated the coverage of each gene into our previous method [<xref rid="pone.0281288.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] as a new parameter. The topology of the metagenomic trees of simulated metagenomic datasets (Figs <xref rid="pone.0281288.g002" ref-type="fig">2</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0281288.g003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>), soil (<xref rid="pone.0281288.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4</xref>), and aquatic samples (<xref rid="pone.0281288.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref>) detected reliable group relationships, however, the integration of the coverage of each gene into metagenomic distances will require further theoretical consideration in future studies.</p>
    <p>Visualization of inter-microbiome interactions is also important for the study of microbial ecosystems. Principal coordinates analysis plots [<xref rid="pone.0281288.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] and phylogenetic networks [<xref rid="pone.0281288.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] have been used to represent one-to-many and many-to-many interactions between microbiota. We used the classical binary tree-like representation method because, although this method is restrictive, sophisticated phylogenetic techniques can be used to analyze the resultant tree-like structures. We also used the TREEDIST program [<xref rid="pone.0281288.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] to compare the branching patterns between our metagenomic tree and dendrograms that were reconstructed with environmental factors, and successfully elucidated influential environmental factors for the microbiota (<xref rid="pone.0281288.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6</xref>). The best choice of methods may be solved by the introduction of comparison methods for the topology and branching pattern of network-like graphs.</p>
    <p>In this study, we showed that the inventory of protein-coding genes was a useful character for comparisons between microbiomes and their environment. Although MPASS can use datasets that are larger than those of 16S amplicon-based methods, reduced memory usage and improved processing speed can be achieved by replacing the bioinformatics tools; for example, metaSPAdes [<xref rid="pone.0281288.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] and BLASTP [<xref rid="pone.0281288.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] can be replaced with MEGAHIT [<xref rid="pone.0281288.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] and MMseqs2 [<xref rid="pone.0281288.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>], respectively. Furthermore, MetaPlatanus [<xref rid="pone.0281288.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>] is useful for the assembly of long reads or mate-paired reads, and therefore, long-read and cost-effective sequencing technology using Nanopore sequencers will fit our method better and make MPASS easier to use.</p>

      <title>Preparation of two simulated metagenomic datasets</title>
      <p>Simulated short-read metagenomic datasets were obtained using NeSSM software [<xref rid="pone.0281288.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>] and the genomic sequences of five bacterial species, <italic toggle="yes">Sulfolobus islandicus</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Proteus mirabilis</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Nitrosospira multiformis</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Bacteroides fragilis</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">Acidobacterium capsulatum</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0281288.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. For the first simulation, we prepared three relative abundance vectors of these species (0.297, 0.507, 0.116, 0.058, 0.022), (0.345, 0.244, 0.281, 0.088, 0.042), and (0.526, 0.320, 0.042, 0.066, 0.046) according to the simulation method of Jiang <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pone.0281288.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. From these abundance vectors, we generated 30 vectors in which each of the five values was increase or decrease by 5%, and used them to generated 30 metagenomic samples by mixing the randomly sampled short reads from the five bacteria using NeSSM [<xref rid="pone.0281288.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>].</p>
      <p>In the second simulation, we generated 30 vectors from the original species abundance vectors used for the first simulation. These 30 vectors were generated by adding to each component the absolute value of one-fifth Gaussian noise, with mean zero and standard deviation equal to the value of that component. Each species abundance vector was randomized and renormalized 10 times, and the 30 vectors, which belonged to three groups with 10 vectors in each group, were obtained (<xref rid="pone.0281288.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref>). These vectors were used to generate 30 metagenomic samples as was done in the first simulation.</p>

      <title>Soil metagenomic dataset</title>
      <p>We used 16 soil metagenomic datasets from various sites and biota from Song <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pone.0281288.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]: hot deserts, cold (polar) deserts, and green biomes (forests, prairie grassland, tundra). Sequence data were downloaded from the MG-RAST server [<xref rid="pone.0281288.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>].

      <title>Aquatic metagenomic and environmental datasets</title>
      <p>The aquatic metagenomic dataset includes 35 microbiome samples from fresh and seawater, hot springs, and a hydrothermal vent [<xref rid="pone.0281288.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0281288.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0281288.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].

The accession numbers for the downloaded sequences are given in <xref rid="pone.0281288.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Table</xref>. The environmental dataset for the Kirishima hot spring area are from Nishiyama <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pone.0281288.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].

      <title>Quantification of similarity between metagenomic tree topology and gradients of various environmental parameters</title>
      <p>The similarity of tree topologies between the metagenomic tree and the dendrograms based on environmental factors reported by Nishiyama <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pone.0281288.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], including pH, temperature, turbidity, and concentrations of carbon, nitrogen, and various ions, was determined using the TREEDIST program [<xref rid="pone.0281288.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. The similarity between the tree and dendrograms was quantified as symmetric difference, which is based on the number of branching points with identical topology [<xref rid="pone.0281288.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>].</p>

      <title>Correlation analysis between conservation of each gene and the topology of the metagenomic tree</title>
      <p>Conservation of high-coverage protein sequences in the I1 and N1 metagenomic samples in other metagenomic samples was estimated based on the metagenomic distance S, which was calculated using the formula given above. We used the e-values of each protein sequence instead of T, the normalized average similarity of proteomes. To avoid using unreliable putative proteins in this analysis, we chose the top 1,000 proteins with high <italic toggle="yes">k</italic>-tuple coverage from the I1 and N1 samples. Then, we calculated Pearson correlation coefficients for each protein between the metagenomic distance S and branch length in the MPASS-based tree for the aquatic microbiota. Distance S of each protein in the I1 and N1 samples was sorted with the corresponding Pearson correlation coefficient, and plotted as heatmaps using the Morpheus web-based tool (<ext-link xlink:href="https://software.broadinstitute.org/morpheus/" ext-link-type="uri">https://software.broadinstitute.org/morpheus/</ext-link>).</p>
      <p>Proteins with correlation coefficients &gt;0.7 were taxonomically and functionally annotated by BLASTP searches against the nr-aa (non-redundant amino acid sequence) database with an e-value cutoff of 10<sup>−20</sup>. Species names and protein functions of the top hit were used for the annotation.</p>

    <p>Dear Dr. Satoh,</p>
    <p>Thank you for submitting your manuscript to PLOS ONE. After careful consideration, we feel that it has merit but does not fully meet PLOS ONE’s publication criteria as it currently stands. Therefore, we invite you to submit a revised version of the manuscript that addresses the points raised during the review process.</p>
    <p>==============================<!-- </div> --><!-- <div> -->As you can see the two reviewers gave completely opposite answers, I found your paper potentially interesting, however, the important technical flaws highlighted by one of the reviewers should be addressed.<!-- </div> --><!-- <div> -->==============================</p>
    <p>Please submit your revised manuscript by Nov 27 2022 11:59PM. If you will need more time than this to complete your revisions, please reply to this message or contact the journal office at <email>plosone@plos.org</email>. When you're ready to submit your revision, log on to <ext-link xlink:href="https://www.editorialmanager.com/pone/" ext-link-type="uri">https://www.editorialmanager.com/pone/</ext-link> and select the 'Submissions Needing Revision' folder to locate your manuscript file.</p>
    <p>Please include the following items when submitting your revised manuscript:<!-- </div> --><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>A rebuttal letter that responds to each point raised by the academic editor and reviewer(s). You should upload this letter as a separate file labeled 'Response to Reviewers'.</p></list-item><list-item><p>A marked-up copy of your manuscript that highlights changes made to the original version. You should upload this as a separate file labeled 'Revised Manuscript with Track Changes'.</p></list-item><list-item><p>An unmarked version of your revised paper without tracked changes. You should upload this as a separate file labeled 'Manuscript'.</p></list-item></list></p>
    <p>If you would like to make changes to your financial disclosure, please include your updated statement in your cover letter. Guidelines for resubmitting your figure files are available below the reviewer comments at the end of this letter.</p>
    <p>If applicable, we recommend that you deposit your laboratory protocols in protocols.io to enhance the reproducibility of your results. Protocols.io assigns your protocol its own identifier (DOI) so that it can be cited independently in the future. For instructions see: <ext-link xlink:href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/submission-guidelines#loc-laboratory-protocols" ext-link-type="uri">https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/submission-guidelines#loc-laboratory-protocols</ext-link>. Additionally, PLOS ONE offers an option for publishing peer-reviewed Lab Protocol articles, which describe protocols hosted on protocols.io. Read more information on sharing protocols at <ext-link xlink:href="https://plos.org/protocols?utm_medium=editorial-email&amp;utm_source=authorletters&amp;utm_campaign=protocols" ext-link-type="uri">https://plos.org/protocols?utm_medium=editorial-email&amp;utm_source=authorletters&amp;utm_campaign=protocols</ext-link>.</p>
    <p>We look forward to receiving your revised manuscript.</p>
    <p>Kind regards,</p>
    <p>Alfonso Esposito, PhD</p>
    <p>Academic Editor</p>
    <p>PLOS ONE</p>
    <p>Journal Requirements:</p>
    <p>When submitting your revision, we need you to address these additional requirements.</p>
    <p>1. Please ensure that your manuscript meets PLOS ONE's style requirements, including those for file naming. The PLOS ONE style templates can be found at</p>
    <p><ext-link xlink:href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/file?id=wjVg/PLOSOne_formatting_sample_main_body.pdf" ext-link-type="uri">https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/file?id=wjVg/PLOSOne_formatting_sample_main_body.pdf</ext-link> and</p>
    <p>
      <ext-link xlink:href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/file?id=ba62/PLOSOne_formatting_sample_title_authors_affiliations.pdf" ext-link-type="uri">https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/file?id=ba62/PLOSOne_formatting_sample_title_authors_affiliations.pdf</ext-link>
    </p>
    <p>2. We note that you have included the phrase “data not shown” in your manuscript. Unfortunately, this does not meet our data sharing requirements. PLOS does not permit references to inaccessible data. We require that authors provide all relevant data within the paper, Supporting Information files, or in an acceptable, public repository. Please add a citation to support this phrase or upload the data that corresponds with these findings to a stable repository (such as Figshare or Dryad) and provide and URLs, DOIs, or accession numbers that may be used to access these data. Or, if the data are not a core part of the research being presented in your study, we ask that you remove the phrase that refers to these data.</p>
    <p>3. In your Data Availability statement, you have not specified where the minimal data set underlying the results described in your manuscript can be found. PLOS defines a study's minimal data set as the underlying data used to reach the conclusions drawn in the manuscript and any additional data required to replicate the reported study findings in their entirety. All PLOS journals require that the minimal data set be made fully available.

    <p>Reviewer #1: Clear and well-written manuscript. The introduction is relevant and theory based. The methods are generally appropriate. The results are clear. The authors make a systematic contribution to the research literature in this area of investigation.</p>
    <p>Reviewer #2: This paper describes a new method called MPASS to compare whole proteomes of shotgun metagenomic sequencing data. However, the methodology is not bioinformatically adequate and tool code is not provided. The reviewer doesn't think this paper is a scientifically sound bioinformatics paper.</p>
    <p>Representative points of the authors must be reconsidered are as follows.</p>
    <p>Line 383:</p>
    <p>When calculating const1 and const2, the reviewer was surprised that the authors do not conduct any correction for multiple substitutions in the same site. Since uncorrected methods tend to underestimate genetic distance, especially for the comparison between distantly related taxa (See molecular evolution textbook), the authors must correct multiple substitutions. Estimating const1 and const2 without correcting multiple substitutions is nonsense.</p>
    <p>Line 402:</p>
    <p>Ref. 26 does not say these taxa inhabit soils. Taxa choices are not adequate.</p>
    <p>To my knowledge, some of them do not inhabit soils.</p>
    <p>Sulfolobus islandicus: thermophilic archaea, habitat is hot springs</p>
    <p>Proteus mirabilis: pathogen, habitat is mammal gut but can be found in polluted soil</p>
    <p>Nitrosospira multiformis: habitat is soil. OK.</p>
    <p>Bacteroides fragilis: a very famous human gut microbe</p>
    <p>Acidobacterium capsulatum: habitat is soil. OK.</p>
    <p>Figure S1:</p>
    <p>This figure does not indicate substitution rates but just sequence identities.</p>
    <p>Provide the program code for MPASS. Otherwise other researchers cannot use MPASS. Maybe MPASS is a pipeline, so provide complete code is difficult. But at least the authors should provide some shell scripts that are merged some steps of MPASS processes in Fig. 1.</p>
    <p>These comments are only representative of methodologies. The reviewer has many other comments related to the metagenomic analysis results of this paper, but before the analysis results, using adequate methodology is necessary.</p>

    </p>
    <p>Dr. Alfonso Esposito</p>
    <p>Academic Editor</p>
    <p>PLOS ONE</p>
    <p>Dear Dr. Alfonso Esposito,</p>
    <p>We would like to thank you and the reviewers for your handling our manuscript and also for the valuable comments. We agreed with most of the comments by you and all reviewers and extensively revised our manuscript. Responses to the “Journal requirements” and the reviewer’s comments are indicated below and in the attached MS word file “Response to Reviewers_SSatoh.docx”. The parts of the attached manuscript that have been revised are highlighted in red (RevisedMS_Track_Changes_SSatoh.docx).</p>
    <p>According to the reviewer’s comments, we improved our methodology by the application of a new calculation method, and provided the merged program code for almost all of the steps in MPASS processes and the additional Perl script for the automatic prefiltering of fastq files. We reconstructed all metagenomic trees and their related data with the improved program. We also corrected the sentences including the phrase “data not shown” in the manuscript, and provided the minimal data set for the results described in the manuscript according to the journal requirements of PLOS ONE. Although almost all reconstructed metagenomic trees and their related data were identical to those of the previous version of the manuscript, minor corrections associated with these reconstructed data in the manuscript are highlighted in red. We also highlighted the slight descriptive errors and correction of the format of the manuscript in red. I hope that these revisions are sufficient to make our manuscript suitable for publication in PLOS ONE.</p>
    <p>Sincerely yours,</p>
    <p>Soichirou Satoh</p>
    <p>[Journal requirements]</p>
    <p>First requirement; </p>
    <p>2. We note that you have included the phrase “data not shown” in your manuscript. Unfortunately, this does not meet our data sharing requirements. PLOS does not permit references to inaccessible data. We require that authors provide all relevant data within the paper, Supporting Information files, or in an acceptable, public repository. Please add a citation to support this phrase or upload the data that corresponds with these findings to a stable repository (such as Figshare or Dryad) and provide and URLs, DOIs, or accession numbers that may be used to access these data. Or, if the data are not a core part of the research being presented in your study, we ask that you remove the phrase that refers to these data.</p>
    <p>Second requirement; </p>
    <p>3. In your Data Availability statement, you have not specified where the minimal data set underlying the results described in your manuscript can be found. PLOS defines a study's minimal data set as the underlying data used to reach the conclusions drawn in the manuscript and any additional data required to replicate the reported study findings in their entirety. All PLOS journals require that the minimal data set be made fully available. For more information about our data policy, please see <ext-link xlink:href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/data-availability" ext-link-type="uri">http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/data-availability</ext-link>.</p>
    <p>Answer to the first requirement; </p>
    <p>Line 323 in Page 19 (Discussion):</p>
    <p>We deleted the phrase “data not shown” and added the following sentence; </p>
    <p>The topology of the metagenomic trees of simulated metagenomic datasets (Figs. 2 and 3), soil (Fig. 4), and aquatic samples (Fig.5) detected reliable group relationships, however, the integration of the coverage of each gene into metagenomic distances will require further theoretical consideration in future studies.</p>
    <p>Line 374 in Page 22 (Materials and Methods):</p>
    <p>We deleted the following sentence;</p>
    <p>The removal of short protein sequences contributed to the reconstruction of congruent trees (data not shown).</p>
    <p>Answer to the second requirement; </p>
    <p>We attached the original data for the metaphylogenomic trees and their related analyses as supporting information files (S1File.zip).</p>
    <p> </p>
    <p>[Answers to the comment of Reviewer 2]</p>
    <p>Thank you for your critical and careful reading. These comments are valuable for improving our manuscript and I greatly appreciate them. We have revised our manuscript according to your suggestions. I hope you will satisfy our revision. The followings are the answers to your comments.</p>
    <p>Comment; </p>
    <p>Line 383:</p>
    <p>When calculating const1 and const2, the reviewer was surprised that the authors do not conduct any correction for multiple substitutions in the same site. Since uncorrected methods tend to underestimate genetic distance, especially for the comparison between distantly related taxa (See molecular evolution textbook), the authors must correct multiple substitutions. Estimating const1 and const2 without correcting multiple substitutions is nonsense.</p>
    <p>Answer to the comment; </p>
    <p>We fully agreed with your comment that correction for multiple substitutions in the same site is very important. As this suggestion, we improved our methodology by adopting the Poisson-corrected substitution rate for the calculation of the metagenomic distances, and reconstructed all metagenomic trees and their related data with this new calculation method. Although almost all reconstructed metagenomic trees reproduced the same topology as that of trees constructed with the previous MPASS program, we think that our method is improved by your suggestions.</p>
    <p>Comment; </p>
    <p>Line 402:</p>
    <p>Ref. 26 does not say these taxa inhabit soils. Taxa choices are not adequate.</p>
    <p>To my knowledge, some of them do not inhabit soils.</p>
    <p>Sulfolobus islandicus: thermophilic archaea, habitat is hot springs</p>
    <p>Proteus mirabilis: pathogen, habitat is mammal gut but can be found in polluted soil</p>
    <p>Nitrosospira multiformis: habitat is soil. OK.</p>
    <p>Bacteroides fragilis: a very famous human gut microbe</p>
    <p>Acidobacterium capsulatum: habitat is soil. OK.</p>
    <p>Answer to the comment; </p>
    <p>We replaced the phrase “five soil bacteria species” with “five bacteria species”.</p>
    <p>Comment;</p>
    <p>Figure S1:</p>
    <p>This figure does not indicate substitution rates but just sequence identities.</p>
    <p>Answer to the comment; </p>
    <p>We calculated the Poisson-corrected substitution rates between 16S rRNA genes of various organisms, and showed the relationship of them to distances from the comparison of metagenomes in Fig. S1.</p>
    <p>Comment;</p>
    <p>Provide the program code for MPASS. Otherwise other researchers cannot use MPASS. Maybe MPASS is a pipeline, so provide complete code is difficult. But at least the authors should provide some shell scripts that are merged some steps of MPASS processes in Fig. 1. These comments are only representative of methodologies. The reviewer has many other comments related to the metagenomic analysis results of this paper, but before the analysis results, using adequate methodology is necessary.</p>
    <p>Answer to the comment; </p>
    <p>We fully agreed with your comment that the availability of the MPASS program by other researchers is also very important. I also hope that this program is used by many researchers to study various metagenomes. According to this suggestion, we provided two Perl scripts. First, we provided automatic program code for the down-sampling, assembling, gene prediction, and calculation of the metagenomic distances in the MPASS pipeline. Second, we also provided another Perl script for the automatic prefiltering of multiple pairs of fastq files by using the Trimmomatic software. We uploaded these two scripts (MPASS.pl, FilteringFastq_for_MPASS.pl) and a refined version of the previous script MPASS_core.pl (only for the metagenomic distance calculation) on the GitHub website (<ext-link xlink:href="https://github.com/s0sat/MPASS" ext-link-type="uri">https://github.com/s0sat/MPASS</ext-link>), and wrote this URL in the manuscript. By using MPASS.pl and FilteringFastq_for_MPASS.pl, the researchers can construct the metagenomic distance matrices from their paired-end fastq files or those downloaded from public databases, automatically.</p>
