    <abstract>
      <p>With the advent of next-generation sequencing, -omics fields such as transcriptomics have experienced increases in data
throughput on the order of magnitudes. In terms of analyzing and visually representing these huge datasets, an intuitive and
computationally tractable approach is to map quantified transcript expression onto biochemical pathways while employing datamining
and visualization principles to accelerate knowledge discovery. We present two cross-platform tools: MAPT (Mapping and
Analysis of Pathways through Time) and PAICE (Pathway Analysis and Integrated Coloring of Experiments), an easy to use
analysis suite to facilitate time series and single time point transcriptomics analysis. In unison, MAPT and PAICE serve as a visual
workbench for transcriptomics knowledge discovery, data-mining and functional annotation. Both PAICE and MAPT are two
distinct but yet inextricably linked tools. The former is specifically designed to map EC accessions onto KEGG pathways while
handling multiple gene copies, detection-call analysis, as well as UN/annotated EC accessions lacking quantifiable expression. The
latter tool integrates PAICE datasets to drive visualization, annotation, and data-mining.</p>

    <title>Background</title>
    <p>With next-generation sequencing becoming a mainstay in
molecular biology, transcriptomics research will continue to
make ever-growing leaps and bounds. Genomic coverage, not
to mention advances in gene expression and gene copies are
now at our fingertips. Just as our knowledge of highthroughput
experiments continues to progress, so too will our
understanding of annotated biochemical pathways. Databases
such as KEGG [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R01">1</xref>] 
and Reactome provide a visual means of
exploring functional enzyme activity within biological
pathways. Numerous tools are actively in use which interface -
omics data with KEGG: Paintomics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R02">2</xref>], Genoscape 
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R03">3</xref>], and
KEGGanim [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R04">4</xref>]. 
The Caleydo software [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R05">5</xref>] utilizes KEGG to
provide a means of visualizing gene expression in a 3D manner,
equipped with capabilities such as hierarchal clustering and a
user-driven GUI to assist pathway exploration and analysis.
The above tools provide useful features and are built with solid
capabilities, however we found that these tools are organism
dependent or have minimal features for processing time series
data and handling of multiple gene copies. We present MAPT
and PAICE, tools to provide an organism independent
transcriptomics workbench. Equipped with time series analysis,
visualization and data-mining capabilities, both tools provide a
low-resource and user friendly environment to drive
knowledge discovery, data-mining and time-series analysis.</p>
  </sec>
  <sec id="s2">
    <title>Software input/output</title>
    <p>PAICE and MAPT are cross-platform standalone applications
built using Python 2.7. The former tool requires the Python
‘suds’ SOAP client to facilitate KEGG pathway querying, while
the latter tool requires ‘PyQt’ and ‘matplotlib’ to enable GUI and
graphing capabilities respectively. Running PAICE is the first
step to initiate analysis within this suite. In order to do so, a
populated four-column tab-delimited text file is required. Each
row in this file represents the necessary values for each of the
four columns: an EC accession, a numerical experimental and
control expression value, and a unique reference identifier (i.e.
gene loci or chromosomal coordinates). PAICE utilizes the
KEGG web-service to map EC accessions onto biochemical
pathways, a service heavily studied with numerous resultant
manuscripts and tools. PAICE however introduces additional
features designed to deal with the complexities of todays -omics
datasets. First is its handling of multiple EC gene copies: if a set
of isoforms differ in expression such that some copies are
induced while others are suppressed, each member in this set
will be flagged. This feature provides insight into individual
isoform quantification, useful when investigating gene
duplication or alternative splicing as some copies may differ in
expression more than others. Secondly, rather than adopting
static coloring schemes whereby green and red represent
induced and suppressed respectively, isoform expression is
statistically stratified (lightly expressed, moderately expressed,
heavily expressed).</p>
    <p>This stratification translates to color gradients whereby each
stratum has a unique color. Lastly, two additional strata are
further allocated, one for accessions failing to pass a userdefined
fold-change cutoff, and another for annotated
accessions that lack expression. This latter strata serves the goal
of highlighting accessions which are annotated but do not have
quantifiable expression, hence failing to map onto any pathway.</p>
    <p>Upon PAICE completion, a collection of KEGG pathways will
be generated whereby all mapped EC accessions are colored
based on their applicable strata. These pathways are then fed
into MAPT, a graphical interface for sifting through expression-
Overlaid pathways. Numerous analytical tools like MAPT have
been developed: CPTRA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R06">6</xref>], 
GeneVestigator [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R07">7</xref>], and TRAM 
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R08">8</xref>].
MAPT differs from the above tools by bundling biological
pathways with quantified expression whilst providing an
organism-independent data-mining and transcriptomics
analysis platform. There are two analytical views to make such
analysis possible: single and multi time point view. The single
time point view within MAPT is ideal for analyzing a single
timepoint or PAICE dataset, equipped with features such as
functional annotation, k-Means clustering and pathway
similarity analysis. On the contrary, multiple timepoint view
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>) 
visualizes gene copy expression per time point as
well as additional analyses into gene copy expression levels;
useful in cases where X copies are induced but Y copies are
suppressed across differing loci.</p>

  <sec id="s3">
    <title>Conclusions</title>
    <p>MAPT and PAICE are two tools designed for visualization and
analysis of transcriptomics datasets. PAICE utilizes the proven
and successful KEGG web-service to map numerical expression
onto biochemical pathways, while MAPT provides an analytical
framework to dissect such datasets and ultimately accelerate
knowledge discovery through visualization and data-mining.
Both MAPT and PAICE are actively in use throughout
numerous research projects, e.g. in understanding the hostpathogen
interactions within Soybean (Glycine max).</p>

  <sec id="s4">
    <title>Future Improvement</title>
    <p>PAICE and MAPT are continuously being worked on and
improved. We welcome user feedback and suggestions as we
strive to make them easier to use and intuitive in nature.</p>
