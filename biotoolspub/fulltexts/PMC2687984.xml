      <p><bold>Motivation:</bold> Identifying transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) encoding complex regulatory signals in metazoan genomes remains a challenging problem in computational genomics. Due to degeneracy of nucleotide content among binding site instances or motifs, and intricate ‘grammatical organization’ of motifs within <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory modules (CRMs), extant pattern matching-based <italic>in silico</italic> motif search methods often suffer from impractically high false positive rates, especially in the context of analyzing large genomic datasets, and noisy position weight matrices which characterize binding sites. Here, we try to address this problem by using a framework to maximally utilize the information content of the genomic DNA in the region of query, taking cues from values of various biologically meaningful genetic and epigenetic factors in the query region such as clade-specific evolutionary parameters, presence/absence of nearby coding regions, etc. We present a new method for TFBS prediction in metazoan genomes that utilizes both the CRM architecture of sequences and a variety of features of individual motifs. Our proposed approach is based on a discriminative probabilistic model known as conditional random fields that explicitly optimizes the predictive probability of motif presence in large sequences, based on the joint effect of all such features.</p>
      <p><bold>Results:</bold> This model overcomes weaknesses in earlier methods based on less effective statistical formalisms that are sensitive to spurious signals in the data. We evaluate our method on both simulated CRMs and real <italic>Drosophila</italic> sequences in comparison with a wide spectrum of existing models, and outperform the state of the art by 22% in F1 score.</p>

    <title>1 INTRODUCTION</title>
    <p>Deciphering the gene control circuitry encoded in the genome is a fundamental problem in developmental biology (Michelson, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">2002</xref>). In multi-cellular eukaryotic organisms such as the metazoans, the time- and tissue-specific expression of essential genes during various developmental and physiological processes is carried out by an intricate interplay between the transcriptional factors (TFs), and their regulatory mechanisms which control the binding of the factors to recognition sites, known as TF binding sites (TFBSs), or motifs, within the regions of the DNA sequence called gene regulatory regions (Davidson, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">2001</xref>). Motifs often appear as recurring, degenerate short string patterns (noisy copies of each other) in the non-coding, regulatory regions of the genome. It has been shown that in higher eukaryotes, instances of TFBS of each TF usually occurs clustered in several small regions of the genome (usually 200–2000 bp) known as <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory modules (CRMs) near the coding region of the gene being regulated. Each CRM typically contains more than one type of TFBS for implementing the logic required to regulate the gene correctly throughout the life of the organism (Davidson, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">2001</xref>).</p>
    <p>Due to the degeneracy of the nucleotide content among motif instances, pattern matching-based <italic>in silico</italic> motif search in higher eukaryotes remains a difficult problem, even when using formalisms such as the position weight matrix (PWM) (or nucleotide distributions at each position of the motif).</p>
    <p>The ‘grammatical organization’ of motifs within CRMs that encode complex spatio-temporal regulatory information can further complicate motif search compared with similar tasks in simpler organisms such as yeast (Frith <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">2002</xref>). Extant methods based on simple pattern matching scores often yield a large number of false positives (FPs) (Sandve and Drablos, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">2006</xref>), especially when the sequence to be examined spans a long region (e.g. tens of thousands of basepairs) beyond the basal promoters, where possible enhancers and CRMs could be located.</p>
    <p>In this article, we concern ourselves with searching for instances of motifs and CRMs in higher eukaryotic genome based on not only a given description of the motif sequence patterns, such as the PWMs, but also additional features that distinguish a putative motif from the background. Our proposed approach is based on a discriminative probabilistic model known as <italic>conditional random field</italic> (CRF) that explicitly optimizes the predictive probability of motif presence in a large background, rather than the joint probability of both motif and background sequence under a generative model, as in many of the current methods reviewed below, whose predictive power can be seriously compromised when the amount of background sequence significantly dominates that of the motifs. See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref> for a schematic workflow.
<fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Fig. 1.</label><caption><p>A schematic view of the workflow.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="btp230f1"/></fig></p>
    <p>Numerous efforts have been made to predict CRMs comprising of a cluster of TFBSs (Berman <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">2002</xref>), or to use cluster-based analyses to assist TFBS prediction. Some methods directly count the number of matches of some minimal strength to given motif patterns within a certain window of DNA sequence (Donaldson <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">2005</xref>; Rajewsky <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">2002</xref>; Rebeiz <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">2002</xref>; Sharan <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">2003</xref>). From a modeling point of view, this family of algorithms assumes that motifs are uniformly and independently distributed within a fixed size window. Such methods are conceptually straightforward and often simple to implement and computationally efficient. In practice, setting the optimal window size can be difficult and optimal parameters may not be robust on input data and may require careful analysis to calculate (Lin <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">2008</xref>). Further, an i.i.d. distribution of motifs is now known to be an unrealistic assumption (Bulyk <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">2002</xref>).</p>
    <p>A second major class of methods adopt a generative formalism to model the occurrences of motifs and CRMs as the output of some hidden stochastic processes, such as a first-order hidden Markov model (HMM), which removes the necessity of modeling the window size. The hidden-state transition matrix within the HMM usually corresponds to a set of soft constraints on the expected CRM length and the inter-CRM distance in terms of geometric distributions. HMMs that capture motif distributions, as well as intra-CRM and inter-CRM backgrounds, have been used in several prediction algorithms, e.g. Cister (Frith <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">2002</xref>), and Cluster-Buster (Frith <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">2003</xref>). Further extensions have been made to include distinct motif-to-motif transition probabilities in programs such as Stubb (Sinha <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">2006</xref>), Module Sampler (Thompson <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">2004</xref>) and BayCis (Lin <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">2008</xref>), which also employs generalized, hierarchical HMMs. These extended models often require a significant amount of training data. Moreover, logical rules have recently been applied in a model on yeast data (Noto and Craven, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">2007</xref>) in order to try and capture regulatory logic models in the spirit of Davidson (Davidson, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">2001</xref>). While the HMMs and HMM-like models are capable of describing the architecture and properties of CRMs to a certain degree, the expressive power of HMMs is insufficient in that they cannot support complex representations for motifs such as non-local, sequence–composition based or epigenetic features surrounding the motif. As a result, their performances on complex CRMs such as those of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> early developmental genes are still unsatisfactory.</p>
    <p>Phylogenetic conservation has been historically one of the most commonly used features used besides binding specificity to detect TFBSs (Loots <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">2002</xref>; Moses <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">2004</xref>). However, these algorithms are restricted to very closely related organisms [no more than 50 million years to the most recent common ancestor (Ray <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">2008</xref>)], because non-coding sequences are difficult to align across large evolutionary distances due to commonplace evolutionary forces like duplication and shuffling in the regulatory genome, hence making orthology prediction difficult (Davidson, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">2001</xref>). Several comparative genomic methods have been applied to CRM and motif prediction (Ray <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">2008</xref>; Siddharthan <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">2004</xref>; Sinha and He, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">2007</xref>; Sinha <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">2004</xref>). In this article, we concern ourselves only with motif detection within a single species, but we try and use additional features which use phylogenetic data from other species to analyze the effect of multi-species data on motif discovery.</p>
    <p>A key motif representation used in all the above methods to score possible motif occurrence in an input DNA sequence is the PWM (Staden, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">1984</xref>), also known as position-specific scoring matrix (PSSM) (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/btp230/DC1">Supplementary Material</ext-link> for details). Several motif detection algorithms work based on designing hard constraints on features associated with motifs, like distance to transcription start site (TSS) (Sinha <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">2008</xref>). Recently, there has been a number of works in the literature that focus on refining predictive models for individual TFBS by using a wide range of features that have been shown to correlate well with regulatory regions in general and with TFBSs in particular, without necessarily modeling the CRM structure (Narlikar <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">2007</xref>; Naughton <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">2006</xref>; Pudimat <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">2004</xref>; Sharon and Segal, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">2007</xref>). Using biologically motivated features like presence or absence of CpG islands, nucleosome sites, and helical structures, they appear to be able to significantly outperform models based on PWM motif representation alone. Pudimat <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">2004</xref>) models a variety of features to assist in predicting binding sites, but selects the set of features in a greedy fashion, and models the features as nodes of a generic graphical model, causing topology selection of the graphical model to be NP-hard (Pearl, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">1988</xref>). Sharon and Segal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">2007</xref>) uses Markov networks to associate specific features with subsets of TFBS positions, causing the difficult problem of estimating the network structure to arise. Ernst (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">2008</xref>) analyzes a set of features to derive informative priors for TFBS prediction, using logistic regression-based classifiers for the choice of each feature. Such discriminative, integrative models have also achieved some success on other problems like protein fold recognition (Damoulas and Girolami, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">2008</xref>).</p>
    <p>In this article, we present DISCOVER : DIScriminative COnditional random field for motif recoVERy in metazoan genomes. DISCOVER is a discriminative method for motif detection in higher eukaryotic genomes that enjoys the dual advantage of modeling CRM architecture of sequences and features of individual motifs. It is a CRF model (Lafferty <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">2001</xref>), which incorporates a wide range of both CRM structure-based and individual motif-based features. CRFs have previously been used in sequence analysis, most notably in gene prediction (DeCaprio <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">2007</xref>; Gros <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">2007</xref>), since coding regions are much better characterized in terms of sequence level features with respect to regulatory regions. Bockhurst and Craven (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">2005</xref>) has applied a similar scheme to identify regulatory signals in prokaryotic sequences; but their model employs a simple feature set to resolve the motif sequence overlap problem, and also requires a pre-screening of motif scores via basic PWM-based models.</p>
    <p>Our method is important in several respects in the context of the literature. First, it is a discriminative model explicitly tailored towards maximizing the conditional likelihood of predicting motifs, rather than maximizing the joint likelihood—which often confounds the analysis in the case of generative models. Secondly, it employs a comprehensive set of features carefully selected from the literature designed to capture a variety of characteristics of the motif and CRM patterns. Thirdly, it is an integrative model that allows sequence-specific features to be added at will to enhance the prediction scheme. Further, since feature scores are computed offline, it is easier to incorporate scores involving complicated computation and long computation times as well as long-range dependencies.</p>
    <p>We evaluate the CRF model on both simulated CRMs and actual biologically validated transcription regulatory sequences of <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, in comparison with a wide spectrum of existing models including, Cister (Frith <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">2002</xref>), Cluster-Buster (Frith <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">2003</xref>), BayCis (Lin <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">2008</xref>), MSCAN (Alkema <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">2004</xref>), Ahab (Rajewsky <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">2002</xref>) and Stubb (Sinha <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">2006</xref>). The results suggest that our proposed method significantly outperforms others on real <italic>Drosophila</italic> sequences.</p>
    <p>The remainder of the article is outlined as follows: we discuss the model and feature design in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="SEC2">Section 2</xref>. In <xref ref-type="sec" rid="SEC2.1">Section 2.1</xref>, we describe how to learn the model from data. and then we briefly mention the inference algorithm given the model. Biological and empirical justifications for the features, experimental setup and results are presented in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="SEC3">Section 3</xref>. We finish by some discussion on the scope of the model in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="SEC4">Section 4</xref>.</p>

    <title>2 METHODS</title>
    <p>The conventional PWM representation for TFBSs is not discriminative enough to distinguish true binding sites from false binding sites. We desire a model for TFBSs and genomic sequence that supports a more complex motif representation without losing the ability to characterize sequence wide properties, which means a flexible feature design. The CRF model—a feature-based log-linear model in which features are easily incorporated—is an appropriate model choice under the circumstances. The basic inputs to such a computational model is a set of genetic sequences, a set of feature values corresponding to every nucleotide in the sequences and the PWMs of TFs that are being predicted. The output of the model is a prediction of a set of TFBSs which are being predicted, ranked in order of decreasing likelihood. The CRM boundaries can also be similarly predicted, but in this article we focus on the analysis of the TFBS predictions.</p>
    <p>A CRF model that describes a conditional probability distribution of a genomic sequence is defined as:
<disp-formula id="M1"><label>(1)</label><graphic xlink:href="btp230m1.jpg" position="float"/></disp-formula>
<disp-formula id="M2"><label>(2)</label><graphic xlink:href="btp230m2.jpg" position="float"/></disp-formula>
where we use <italic>x</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> to represent the type of the observed nucleotide at site <italic>i</italic> in a sequence, and <italic>y</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> to represent the hidden state associated with <italic>x</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>, which corresponds to the functionality of the site in the genomic sequence. The value of a hidden state is also called a state label. Vector <bold>x</bold> = {<italic>x</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> : <italic>i</italic> = 1, 2,…, <italic>L</italic>}, and vector <bold>y</bold> = {<italic>y</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> : <italic>i</italic> = 1, 2,…, <italic>L</italic>}, where <italic>L</italic> is the length of the sequence. Vector <bold>F</bold> is the set of features, each element <italic>F</italic> of which is the sum of feature scores of a particular feature category (where feature scores refer to the numerical value of the feature). Vector <bold>λ</bold> corresponds to the feature weights assigned to the set of features, and is learnt from data to decide which features may be more important in predicting TFBSs. <italic>Z</italic> is a partition function that normalizes the pdf and is a function of <bold>x</bold> and <bold>λ</bold>. The value space for each <italic>x</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> is {A,C,G,T}. The values represent the four types of nucleotide in DNA, <italic>adenine</italic>, <italic>cytosine</italic>, <italic>guanine</italic> and <italic>thymine</italic>, respectively. The value space for hidden states <italic>y</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>, however, is not so straightforward, and it will be defined subsequently.</p>
    <p><bold>State design:</bold> we design a set of hidden states based on the possible functionality of each nucleotide in the genomic sequence being analyzed.We incorporate each motif type as a state since this is our prediction goal. We number the types of motifs and name the state for the <italic>m</italic>-th motif type <bold>M</bold><sup>(<italic>m</italic>)</sup>. Representationwise, a hidden state <italic>y</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> being state M<sup>(<italic>m</italic>)</sup> implies that a motif of the <italic>m</italic>-th type is located starting at site <italic>i</italic> of the sequence. Those states are all that we need to represent binding sites. Next, we know that TFs are usually working together to regulate genes, especially in genomes of higher organisms. In order to work together, different types of TFBSs often lie close to each other in the range of hundreds of base pairs forming a so-called CRM (Davidson, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">2001</xref>). We use state <bold>C</bold> to represent all nucleotides in the CRM regions except those binding sites which have already been labeled as Ms. The nucleotides which are still unlabeled after the first two rounds are set to state <bold>G</bold>, which represents a global background in the genomic sequence. Hence, the set of hidden states for modeling the functionality at a nucleotide position is given by <bold>S</bold>={<bold>G</bold>,<bold>C</bold>,<bold>M</bold><sup>(1)</sup>,…,<bold>M</bold><sup>(<italic>N</italic><sub><italic>M</italic></sub>)</sup>}, where <italic>N</italic><sub><italic>M</italic></sub> is the number of motif types. We do not allow two motifs to share the same starting position, but such occurrences are infrequent. It is still an improvement on HMM-based approaches where modeling even partial overlap of motifs causes a combinatorial increase in the state space. Overlapping of starting positions of TFBSs can be accommodated in our model by using marginal probabilities in the prediction step.</p>
    <p><bold>Feature design:</bold> each element <italic>F</italic>(<bold>y</bold>, <bold>x</bold>) of vector <bold>F</bold>(<bold>y</bold>, <bold>x</bold>) in Equation (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="M1">1</xref>) is the sum of feature scores of a particular feature category, where feature score simply refers to the numerical value of the feature. It sums up feature function <italic>f</italic>'s over the sequence, which have a common meaning and share the same weight. An example is shown in Equation (16) of <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/btp230/DC1">Supplementary Material</ext-link>, after we see some concrete features. The design of <italic>f</italic>'s is a critical part of CRF models. We include a rich set of features, most of which are introduced in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="SEC3">Section 3</xref>. The set of features includes conventional features (TFBS sequence specificity, state transition probability) as well as evolutionary features (like presence of repeats, and of conservation across species), structural and epigenetic features (like melting temperature, nucleosome occupancy), features related to the protein coding mechanism (like distance to TSS, presence in 3<sup>′</sup>-UTR region), and additional discriminative features (like reverse complementarity of a site, and conservation symmetry). Their formal definitions can be found in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/btp230/DC1">Supplementary Material</ext-link>.</p>
    <p>Features with a one-to-one correspondence with nucleotide base pairs can be easily integrated into the framework by defining as:
<disp-formula id="M3"><label>(3)</label><graphic xlink:href="btp230m3.jpg" position="float"/></disp-formula>
where <italic>S</italic>(<italic>i</italic>, <bold>x</bold>) is the feature score, All features are in the form of <italic>f</italic>(<bold>y</bold>, <bold>x</bold>), but as for now, they have a simpler common form of <italic>f</italic>(<italic>y</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>, <italic>y</italic><sub><italic>i</italic>+1</sub>, <bold>x</bold>), which we called a chain structure CRF model.</p>
    <p><bold>Model Parameters:</bold> feature weights constitute the set of model parameters, some of which are fixed and some are free to be estimated. More free parameters make the CRF model more complex, which might be harder to learn. The set of free parameters are modeled to avoid redundant parameters, which will not make any contribution. Also, parameters that are not likely to be properly estimated from training data should never be included, because including them will only increase the chance of overfitting the model. Our focus is on the weight of state transition features, because they account for a large proportion of the whole parameter set and good estimation of the weights are critical for successfully predicting TFBSs. A detailed analysis is presented in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/btp230/DC1">Supplementary Material</ext-link>.</p>
    <p>In the CRF model, we assign a parameter as a weight to each of the features defined previously which are collectively the vector <bold>λ</bold> in Equation (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="M1">1</xref>). Not all of these parameters are free parameters. Among state transition parameters, we constrain an M state to be only directly reachable from a C state, and not from a G state, since motifs are not present outside CRMs. Thus, state transition features corresponding to taboo transitions have a weight −∞ (a low enough number in practice), meaning that the transitions never occur in the CRF model. However, we want to have a reasonable number of free model parameters as more free parameters increase the expressibility of the model. With increase in the number of free parameters, the hardness of estimating model parameters increase, the running time of the learning algorithm also rises and some parameters may overfit due to data scarcity for corresponding features.</p>

      <title>2.1 Model training and inference</title>
      <p>In this section, we briefly describe the model training and inference procedures in which feature weights of the CRF model are learnt from training data and subsequently used to make TFBS predictions. A more thorough exposition is presented in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/btp230/DC1">Supplementary Material</ext-link>.</p>
      <p><bold>Model training:</bold> First, a learning criterion is set up, which can either be to maximize likelihood or maximize posterior probability. It is then converted to a convex optimization problem, and finally a Quasi–Newton method is applied (Avriel, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2003</xref>). Our goal here is to learn the best setting for <bold>λ</bold>, the weights of features in the CRF model given a set of sequences as training data with their nucleotide types <bold>x</bold> and state labels <bold>y</bold>. The value of feature functions <bold>f</bold> can be computed given necessary hyper-parameters. A reasonable criteria to learn the feature weights <bold>λ</bold> from nucleotide types <bold>x</bold> and state labels <bold>y</bold> (or more precisely from feature values <bold>f</bold>) in a CRF model is to maximize likelihood of <bold>λ</bold> wrt <bold>y</bold> conditioned on <bold>x</bold>, which equals the probability of state labels <bold>y</bold> given feature weights <bold>λ</bold> conditioned on nucleotide types <bold>x</bold>, because the probability model itself is defined in this conditional scheme. The max likelihood estimator of <bold>λ</bold> can be expressed as:
<disp-formula><graphic xlink:href="btp230um1.jpg" position="float"/></disp-formula>
<disp-formula><graphic xlink:href="btp230um2.jpg" position="float"/></disp-formula></p>
      <p><bold>Inference:</bold> the learnt feature weights of the CRF model are used to predict TFBSs on a new genomic sequence—the inference step. There are two categories of prediction schemes analogous to the popular inference schemes for HMMs: sequence decoding by <italic>Viterbi</italic> algorithm and marginal decoding by forward–backward algorithm. We choose the marginal probability rank scheme as it enables us to predict overlapping TFBSs. Marginal decoding considers one hidden state at a time, making predictions based on the marginal probability, <italic>P</italic>(<italic>y</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>∣<bold>x</bold>, <bold>λ</bold>), which can be computed by the dynamic programming forward–backward algorithm in a chain structure CRF model (Lafferty <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">2001</xref>; Sha and Pereira, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">2003</xref>). Variants on the marginal decoding scheme include maximum a posteriori decoding (MAP) where we predict a TFBS if the marginal probability of it is the highest among all state labels
<disp-formula id="M4"><label>(4)</label><graphic xlink:href="btp230m4.jpg" position="float"/></disp-formula>
Alternatively, we make a positive prediction whenever the marginal probability is above a threshold, known as threshold decoding. It is a flexible method, but a good threshold is hard to set in practice. We use a similar scheme that takes advantage of thresholding by choosing a threshold automatically by limiting the number of predictions. Thus we calculate a list of TFBS and marginal probability pairs, sort them by probability in descending order and output the top <italic>P</italic> ones as predictions, <italic>P</italic> being the number of desired predictions. We make <italic>P</italic> for each sequence proportional to its length <italic>L</italic>, as a longer sequence tends to contain more TFBSs. The coefficient <italic>k</italic> = <italic>P</italic>/<italic>L</italic> is called <italic>prediction factor</italic>. We call this rank decoding.</p>

    <title>3 RESULTS</title>
    <p>We evaluate our method of TFBS prediction on a set of real genomic transcription regulatory sequences (TRSs) of <italic>D.melanogaster</italic>, as well as a set of synthetic TRSs. The prediction performance is compared with six popular published methods for supervised discovery of motifs/CRMs based on a wide spectrum of models: Cister (Frith <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">2002</xref>), Cluster-Buster (Frith <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">2003</xref>), BayCis (Lin <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">2008</xref>), Stubb (Sinha <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">2006</xref>), Ahab (Rajewsky <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">2002</xref>) and MSCAN (Johansson <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">2003</xref>). In general, the prediction performance of the CRF model is superior or competitive wrt all the chosen benchmark methods on this comprehensive selection of real <italic>D.melanogaster</italic> dataset.</p>
    <p>The semi-synthetic dataset was generated by artificially simulated CRM structures with a third-order Markov model for background sequences and planting real TFBSs from the TRANSFAC database (Wingender <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">2000</xref>) into the simulated background sequences based on the generative model for the HMM-based TFBS prediction tool Baycis and published in Lin <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">2008</xref>). It involves 30 20 kbp-long sequences, containing 887 TFBSs of 10 types. The real <italic>D.melanogaster</italic> binding site data were obtained from the <italic>Drosophila</italic> Cis-regulatory Database at National University of Singapore (Narang <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">2006</xref>). The PWM and CRM boundary data were obtained independently of the binding site database from the REDfly CRM database (Gallo <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">2006</xref>). This TRS dataset was previously published in Lin <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">2008</xref>). The dataset contains 97 CRMs pertaining to 35 early developmental genes of <italic>D.melanogaster</italic> (in 35 sequences). Each of the 35 sequences contains 1–4 CRMs. The lengths of sequences range from 10 000 bp to 16 000 bp, except two extremely long sequences whose lengths are 40 kb and 79 kb, respectively. There are 700 TFBSs of 44 types labeled in the dataset in all. It is worthwhile noticing that 12 out of the 44 types appear in only one sequence, which account for 10% of the binding sites. A visualization of the dataset illustrating the locations of TFBSs and CRMs is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>.

      <title>3.1 Input features</title>
      <p>We include a rich set of features in our model, based on previous findings in the literature as well as some derived features which empirical evidence suggests are more discriminative than the original features from which they were derived. Most of the feature scores are accurately or heuristically calculated based solely on the sequence data, but some require external annotation (like translated and transcribed regions, and TSS). It is also easy to change feature values from sequence-derived heuristic values to actual experimental results should they become available. See the work schematic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>) for a visual schema of feature calculation. CRFs adjust feature weights based on training data, so it is also interesting to try new features to check if they improve the predictive power of the model. The rigorous mathematical definitions corresponding to the non-trivial feature definitions is presented in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/btp230/DC1">Supplementary Material</ext-link>. Binding site positioning and characterization of the nucleotide content of binding sites in terms of binding site specificity have been the most standard features which have been used in motif finding, especially in generative models like HMMs. This is based on sound biological validation of the fact that specificity of binding sites and CRM ‘architecture's, are pervasive in regulatory regions (Davidson, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">2001</xref>).</p>
      <p><bold>PWM constraints:</bold> the basic feature we use is the PWM constraint, which implements the information present in the PWM of a motif. It represents the binding specificities of the DNA binding domain(s) of the TF in question as an ordered set of multinomials, and is an indicator of the level of evolutionary constraint and hence selection each nucleotide is under. Some PWMs tend to be more constrained (under greater purifying selection) than others. Some PWMs also tend to suffer from noisy data. Because of this, the discriminative power of the PWM constraints feature varies from PWM to PWM. For PWMs with poor discriminative power, additional features are critical for improving predictability. The PWM score provides a good baseline measure for the CRF model in motif prediction, though it is not an essential feature in our model.</p>
      <p><bold>State transition:</bold> state transition features are an effort to model the architecture of the regulatory region. The state transition feature models the relationship between the functionality of neighboring nucleotides, which correspond to neighboring states in the CRF and is based on the differing likelihoods of the hidden CRF states transitioning from one to the other. Details of the mathematical modeling of this feature is provided in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/btp230/DC1">Supplementary Material</ext-link>.</p>
      <p>Evolutionary conservation and presence or absence of evolutionary events like duplication and repeats can also play a role in identifying TFBS, as evidenced by the large body of work in phylogenetic motif finding. The basic premise in such cases is that functionally relevant nucleotides like TFBS would be under selection, and would hence be distinguishable from surrounding sequence on the basis of evolutionary parameters. While we do not explicitly use multiple species sequence data, we implicitly use evolutionary data in terms of feature data.</p>
      <p><bold>Presence of repeats:</bold> Interspersed repeats and low complexity DNA sequences are common elements in the genome, often near coding regions and inside regulatory sequences. The repeat feature is a simple single nucleotide-based feature indicative of whether that nucleotide is part of a repeat as predicted by RepeatMasker using the repeat database RepBase (Jurka <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">2005</xref>). On one hand, repeats with motif-like patterns may lead to a large number of FP results, but repeats have also been reported to have been under purifying selection (Britten, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">1994</xref>) and to have been harnessed into the regulatory machinery (Kamal <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">2006</xref>). Thus, instead of masking out repeats to lower the FP rate, we choose to identify repeats in the sequence in a bid to find locational correlations with TFBSs.</p>
      <p><bold>PhastCons score and related features:</bold> We use the PhastCons score as an evolutionary score-based feature. PhastCons (Margulies <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">2003</xref>) is a phylogenetic 2-state HMM which predicts if nucleotide positions in a multiple alignment are in an evolutionarily conserved state or not. The PhastCons score at a nucleotide position is merely the posterior probability that the nucleotide was generated from the conserved state based on the 15-way Multiz (Blanchette <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">2004</xref>) alignment of the <italic>Drosophilae</italic> species, <italic>Apis mellifera</italic>, <italic>Anopheles gambiae</italic> and <italic>Tribolium castaneum</italic>. We also use two other derived binary features which we feel to be discriminative based on an empirical analysis of PhastCons score distributions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>): ‘Is PhastCons score &lt;0.05’ and ‘Is PhastCons score &gt;0.95’. We also keep an additional feature indicating whether PhastCons data are available or not for bookkeeping purposes.
<fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Fig. 3.</label><caption><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Means of two discriminative features plotted for GC content and PhastCons score for Motifs, CRMs and background nucleotides, (<bold>b</bold>) distribution of PhastCons scores in motifs versus non-motifs and (<bold>c</bold>) multimodal empirical distribution of feature values for the transformed distance to TSS feature.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="btp230f3"/></fig></p>
      <p>It is well established in the literature that the distance of the TFBS to the TSS plays an important role of the efficacy of the TFBS in regulating the gene (Defrance and Touzet, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">2006</xref>; Kim <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">2008</xref>; Tharakaraman <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">2005</xref>), and of the nature of function of the TFBS (Elnitski <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">2006</xref>). We therefore incorporate several features which contain information of the distance to the TSS, the locations of the transcribed and translated regions, and the positioning of binding site with respect to the gene transcription–translational direction.</p>
      <p><bold>Distance to TSS and translated:</bold> TFBS are typically present near coding sequences, and we utilize two features indicative of that fact. The binary feature ‘Translated’ indicates at each nucleotide position whether it is translated or not by the gene translation/transcription machinery. It has also been shown that TFBSs are not uniformly distributed wrt their distance from the TSS (Defrance and Touzet, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">2006</xref>), and the Distance to TSS feature is a score of the distance of each nucleotide from the TSS in question.</p>
      <p><bold>5′-UTR and 3′-UTR:</bold> The position of the TFBS wrt directionality of the gene being coded has been shown to be a discriminative feature for identifying TFBS. We use two binary features indicative of this fact, the ‘5′UTR’ feature indicates for each nucleotide if it is located in the 5′ untranslated region, and the ‘3′UTR’ feature indicates likewise for the 3′ untranslated region.</p>
      <p>Recent work in the literature has approached the TFBS prediction problem as a non-binary classification problem, instead choosing to model the affinity of a TF to bind to a particular oligonucleotide sequence with an affinity score (Ward and Bussemaker, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">2008</xref>). This has led to the realization that TFBSs may also be effective gene regulators in cases of low binding affinity but high chromatin stability and accessibility (Ozsolak <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">2007</xref>). While we model our TFBS prediction as a sort of classification problem, we still incorporate the notions of chromatin accessibility and stability.</p>
      <p><bold>GC content and melting temperature:</bold> The GC content feature of a genomic sequence or the fraction of G+C bases in a sequence is a simple heuristic which can be used to estimate several factors reflective of the stability of the chromatin structure like the melting temperature and in higher eukaryotes is a determining factor for identifying CpG islands (Zhang, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">2007</xref>), thus being indicative of how easy it might be for a TF to actually bind in the locality. The window size <italic>w</italic> for the genomic neighborhood over which to estimate the GC content is a hyperparameter that must be determined ahead of time, and is usually chosen to be of the order of magnitude of the binding site. The melting temperature feature is defined as the temperature for which half the DNA strands of an oligonucleotide are in the double helical structure, while the other half are in a random coil formation. It corresponds strongly to chromatin stability, and has been shown as a feature to correlate well with TFBS (Ponomarenko <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">1999</xref>).</p>
      <p><bold>Nucleosome occupancy:</bold> Recent research has suggested that nucleosome occupancy has a strong correlation with binding preference of TFs (Segal <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">2006</xref>). This is due to the non-feasibility of access to the chromatin by the TF when a nucleosome is already bound there. Some research has successfully used nucleosome occupancy scores to improve TFBS predictions (Narlikar <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">2007</xref>).</p>
      <p>We also tried several other features directly computable from sequence information, and found that the following features can help in discriminating between TFBS and non-TFBS. The cause of the discriminative power of these tracks may stem from the nature of the binding specificities of the TFs in question, and a closer investigation is warranted.</p>
      <p><bold>Reverse complementarity and conservation symmetry:</bold> We also try two additional features for the CRF based on symmetry of the oligonucleotide in question. The reverse complementarity feature indicates as a fraction between 0 and 1 how similar a nucleotide sequence is to its reverse complement. It is exactly 1 only when an oligonucleotide sequence is identical to its reverse complement. The conservation symmetry feature models how symmetric the degree of conservation in the PWM is wrt the center of the binding site. This is based on the empirical observation that DNA binding domain binding specificities often have symmetric sequence conservation profiles.</p>
      <p>The design of new features has exciting new possibilities. Long-range regulatory effects have been reported in the literature (Carroll <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">2005</xref>). The CRF model also readily enables us to model long-range dependencies if we deviate from the chain structured CRF structure. It can also be used as a form of ensemble learning by incorporating predictions by other independent tools as features. Other features which have been shown in the literature to correlate well with the data and which are candidates for future inclusion on this and other datasets include the presence of the nucleotide in the first intron of the regulated gene, and presence of the nucleotide in the neighborhood of a CpG island.</p>
      <p>We tested the discriminative nature of these features on the dataset in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>a shows the difference in mean values for background, CRM and motif nucleotides for two of the most discriminative features: GC content and PhastCons score. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>b shows the distribution of PhastCons scores in motif versus non-motif nucleotides, with the most discriminative bins being at either end of the score range, which offered us some insight as to how to define a derived feature which is more discriminative than the original one. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>c shows the interesting multimodal distribution of the normalized and transformed values of the feature distance to the TSS, suggesting a complicated, non-uniform distribution worth additional investigation.</p>

    <sec id="SEC3.2">
      <title>3.2 Experimental setup</title>
      <p>In this part, we include biological and empirical bases for selection of some features, data preparation, hyper-parameter setting, test scheme and evaluation scheme. For training data, we use a part of the sequences with ground truth labels. For testing, the required hyper-parameters in the CRF model are the window size used in GC percentage calculation and pseudo-counts used to smooth the probabilities in PWMs to allow for greater tolerance in motif discovery. We set the window size of GC percentage to 8 bps (approximately the average length of a motif) and pseudo-count for smoothing PWM probabilities to 0.5.</p>
      <p>Our evaluation is based on a leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) scheme. Each time we take all but one sequences as training data, and predict on the remaining sequence by the model with parameters learnt from the training data. We use the rank decoding scheme with the prediction factor <italic>k</italic> set to 0.0015 by default. This threshold is obtained by analyzing the empirical density of TFBSs in training data. Varying the value of the threshold results in increasing one of the performance metrics of precision (P) or recall (R) at the cost of the other. For evaluating performance, we use the standard definitions of P, R and the F1 score using counts of TP, FP and false negative (FN) prediction instances. The exact method of calculating the evaluation metrics is given in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/btp230/DC1">Supplementary Material</ext-link>.</p>
      <p>Specificity scores and ROC curves are not shown as these evaluation schemes are inappropriate in the context of motif detection. True negative (TN) instances in ground truth for motif data is rare as instances labeled as negatives in the ground truth may be discovered to contain motifs in the future. Also, the number of positive instances and number of predictions are much smaller than the number of total instances, causing the specificity to be very close to 1 almost always.</p>

      <title>3.3 Tests on features</title>
      <p>We have empirically established the discriminative nature of our feature set, but we also examine the soundness of the designed features in the context of the CRF model after incorporating some basic features, before including all of them in the model to test for feature redundancy and compatibility in the CRF framework. The state transition features and sequence conservation features are fundamental, so we check the validity of the other features based on predictions made by a basic model consisting of only state transition features and sequence conservation features. The soundness of additional feature is shown by comparing the distributions of the set of TPs and the set of FPs as predicted by the basic model.</p>
      <p>We learn a CRF model using the two kinds of fundamental features, and use it to get a set of predictions of TFBSs, which contains both TP predictions and FP predictions. We split the predictions into two groups, TP group and FP group, and compute the GC percentage score, reverse complementary score and conservation symmetry score for each of the instances in the two groups. We can show the soundness of a feature by a statistical analysis on the difference between scores of the two groups. There are 193 instances in TP group and 499 instances in FP group. Comparisons of cumulative distribution function (CDF) curves between TP group and FP group on GC percentage scores, reverse complementary scores and conservation symmetry scores are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>. The scores plotted are raw scores without an offset, such as <italic>p</italic>, <italic>s</italic> and <italic>cs</italic> in Equations (9), (11) and (13) of <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/btp230/DC1">Supplementary Material</ext-link>. We can see that the CDF curve of TP group is almost always lower than that of FP group in GC percentage score and reverse complementary score, while the CDF curve of TP group is almost always higher than that of FP group in conservation symmetry score.
<fig id="F4" position="float"><label>Fig. 4.</label><caption><p>On (<bold>a</bold>) GC percentage score, (<bold>b</bold>) reverse complementary score and (<bold>c</bold>) conservation symmetry score, a comparison of CDF curves between TP group and FP group.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="btp230f4"/></fig></p>
      <p>For the feature of GC percentage, the scores in TP group have a mean at 0.4641 and sample variance at 0.0043, and the scores in FP group have a mean at 0.4323 and sample variance at 0.0065. Assuming that they both follow Gaussian distributions, we have a difference between means at 0.0318 with a SD at 0.0059, which gives us a confidence value at 1–4 × 10<sup>−8</sup> that the mean of TP group is bigger than the mean of FP group. It is credible that GC percentage feature is informative. Following a similar analysis, for the feature of reverse complementarity, the mean TP score is 0.3041 and sample variance 0.0349, and the mean FP score is 0.2413 and sample variance 0.0360. With a difference between means at 0.0159 with a SD at 0.0059, we have a confidence value at 1–4 × 10<sup>−5</sup> that the mean of TP group is bigger than the mean of FP group. For the feature of conservation symmetry, the TP scores have mean 0.5215 and sample variance 0.0541, and the FP scores have a mean 0.5950 and sample variance 0.0666. The confidence value that TP group has a smaller average score than FP group is 1–1.5 × 10<sup>−4</sup>.</p>

      <title>3.4 Performances on TFBS prediction</title>
      <p><bold>Synthetic dataset:</bold> We compare the CRF model with BayCis, ClusterBuster and Cister on the synthetic TRS dataset. CRF model outperforms ClusterBuster and Cister but not BayCis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>a) on the synthetic dataset. BayCis has an advantage over the other tools having the same background model as the simulation scheme, but we outperform Baycis on the real dataset.

      <p><bold><italic>Drosophila</italic> dataset:</bold> We compare the CRF model with BayCis, Ahab, Cluster-Buster, Cister, Mscan and Stubb on the real <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> TRS dataset. The overall F1 scores of the CRF model and six comparing methods are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>. All the algorithms are set to default configurations. The feature-based CRF model outperforms all other methods on the F1 score measure. It is 22% higher than the best competing tool. We also show the P–R curves of the our methods and BayCis, as well as points in the P–R landscape for other tools in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>. We plot P-R curves of the CRF model by varying the prediction factor <italic>k</italic> (from 0.0005 to 0.0040). For BayCis, we plot a P-R curve resulting from different thresholds for predictions, in addition to its default MAP setting. The CRF model outperforms BayCis, Ahab, ClusterBuster and Stubb in their default settings. The other two methods strike extremely different balances between P and R in their default output. MSCAN focuses on very high P predictions, while Cister is geared towards high values of R. It is noticeable that Stubb's performance is much below the rest, possibly because it uses distinct motif-to-motif transition probabilities, which can only be properly learned without overfitting from datasets richer in scope than the present one. Addition of further non-redundant features like other epigenetic feature scores is expected to improve performance further. A set of predictions by the CRF model with default setting comparing with that of Cluster-Buster is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>. While they have comparable TP predictions, CRF model makes much less FP predictions than Cluster-Buster does. In a way, the performance gap between the CRF model and the HMM-based models may be looked upon as a combination of two factors: the discriminative nature of the analysis, and the availability of features besides PWM and transition data.</p>

    <title>4 DISCUSSION</title>
    <p>We propose DISCOVER, a discriminative model using CRFs for motif discovery. Among advantages of the CRF model are the facts that the user can incorporate new features at will (with the model automatically adjusting feature weights to weed out uninformative features) and can configure our publicly available tool to add new genetic and epigenetic features. It can even be used for ensemble learning by incorporating predictions from other models as features. In the future, a Bayesian version of the work can be tried by putting priors on parameters as long as they do not break the concavity of the target function. We will model higher order CRFs by moving beyond chain structure CRFs with only edges between neighboring hidden states to incorporating feature functions with long-range dependencies to handle features like motif co-occurrence, distance models for CRM lengths and inter-motif spacer runs. A detailed discussion on the scope of the model can found in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/btp230/DC1">Supplementary Material</ext-link>.</p>
