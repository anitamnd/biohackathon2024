    <abstract>
      <p><italic>Campylobacter jejuni</italic> is currently the leading cause of bacterial gastroenteritis in humans. Comparison of multiple <italic>Campylobacter</italic> strains revealed a high genetic and phenotypic diversity. However, little is known about differences in transcriptome organization, gene expression, and small RNA (sRNA) repertoires. Here we present the first comparative primary transcriptome analysis based on the differential RNA–seq (dRNA–seq) of four <italic>C. jejuni</italic> isolates. Our approach includes a novel, generic method for the automated annotation of transcriptional start sites (TSS), which allowed us to provide genome-wide promoter maps in the analyzed strains. These global TSS maps are refined through the integration of a SuperGenome approach that allows for a comparative TSS annotation by mapping RNA–seq data of multiple strains into a common coordinate system derived from a whole-genome alignment. Considering the steadily increasing amount of RNA–seq studies, our automated TSS annotation will not only facilitate transcriptome annotation for a wider range of pro- and eukaryotes but can also be adapted for the analysis among different growth or stress conditions. Our comparative dRNA–seq analysis revealed conservation of most TSS, but also single-nucleotide-polymorphisms (SNP) in promoter regions, which lead to strain-specific transcriptional output. Furthermore, we identified strain-specific sRNA repertoires that could contribute to differential gene regulation among strains. In addition, we identified a novel minimal CRISPR-system in <italic>Campylobacter</italic> of the type-II CRISPR subtype, which relies on the host factor RNase III and a trans-encoded sRNA for maturation of crRNAs. This minimal system of <italic>Campylobacter</italic>, which seems active in only some strains, employs a unique maturation pathway, since the crRNAs are transcribed from individual promoters in the upstream repeats and thereby minimize the requirements for the maturation machinery. Overall, our study provides new insights into strain-specific transcriptome organization and sRNAs, and reveals genes that could modulate phenotypic variation among strains despite high conservation at the DNA level.</p>

      <title>Author Summary</title>
      <p>Many species have evolved into diverse strains with phenotypic and genotypic variations that facilitate adaptation to different ecological niches and, in the case of pathogens, to different hosts. Whereas comparison of genome sequences reveals differences and similarities among strains, the consequences of genomic variations can be tracked by studying the functional output from the genome. RNA sequencing has been revolutionizing transcriptome analyses of both pro- and eukaryotes. However, the bioinformatics-based analysis is still lagging behind, and transcriptome features are often manually annotated, which is laborious and time-consuming. This is even more compounded for the analyses of multiple strains. Here we compared the primary transcriptomes of four isolates of <italic>Campylobacter jejuni</italic>, the leading cause of bacterial gastroenteritis in humans, and provide genome-wide transcriptional start site (TSS) maps using a novel automated annotation method. Our comparative RNA–seq showed that most TSS are conserved in multiple strains, but we also observed SNP–dependent promoter usage. Furthermore, we identified a novel minimal RNA–based CRISPR immune system as well as strain-specific small RNA repertoires. Our automated, comparative TSS annotation will facilitate and improve transcriptome annotation for a wider range of organisms and provides insights into the contribution of transcriptome differences to phenotypic variation among closely related species.</p>

    <title>Introduction</title>
    <p>Deep RNA–sequencing (RNA–seq) has been revolutionizing transcriptome analyses of both pro- and eukaryotes <xref rid="pgen.1003495-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003495-Croucher1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Several recent RNA–seq studies have revealed an unexpectedly complex transcriptional output from bacterial genomes and have been successfully used for the global identification of small RNA (sRNA) genes as well transcriptional start sites (TSS) <xref rid="pgen.1003495-Croucher1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003495-vanVliet1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. For example, our recently developed differential RNA–seq (dRNA–seq) approach, which is selective for the analysis of primary transcriptomes, allowed us to provide a genome-wide map of TSS in <italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic>
<xref rid="pgen.1003495-Sharma1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. In addition, a steadily growing number of studies report <italic>cis-</italic>encoded antisense RNAs as a widespread layer of gene-expression control in bacteria <xref rid="pgen.1003495-Thomason1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003495-Georg1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Despite this rapid accumulation of transcriptome data, the bioinformatics-based data mining is still lagging behind. Thus, in most cases transcriptome features such as TSS and novel non-coding RNAs still have to be manually annotated, which is laborious and time-consuming. The problem is compounded for comparative transcriptomics of several species within a genus. Therefore, most RNA–seq studies have been limited to single bacterial strains so far (reviewed in <xref rid="pgen.1003495-Croucher1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003495-vanVliet1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>). However, a comparative approach would not only allow for refining the transcriptome annotation of the individual species by integrating the information from multiple strains but can also reveal differences in transcriptome organization or gene expression among strains for which different phenotypes cannot be explained by the genome sequences alone.</p>
    <p>Epsilonproteobacteria, including several important human pathogens such as <italic>H. pylori</italic> and <italic>Campylobacter jejuni</italic>, show a significant strain-to-strain variability on the phenotypic and genomic level and, thus, represent good model organisms for such a comparative approach. For example, multilocus sequence typing (MLST) analysis revealed that <italic>C. jejuni</italic>, the most prevalent food-borne bacterial pathogen in the industrialized world to date <xref rid="pgen.1003495-Dasti1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003495-Young1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, is genetically diverse, with a weakly clonal population structure and high rates of intraspecies recombination <xref rid="pgen.1003495-Suerbaum1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003495-Dingle1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. It has been suggested that this extensive genetic diversity could lead to different clinical outcomes and facilitate adaptation to and persistence in the host <xref rid="pgen.1003495-Linz1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003495-Suerbaum2" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003495-Wassenaar1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Since comparison among multiple species or strains has mainly been examined at the genomic level, the differences in transcriptome structure that have an impact on phenotypic flexibility remain currently unknown <xref rid="pgen.1003495-Fouts1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003495-Parker1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>.</p>
    <p><italic>C. jejuni</italic> is a commensal of chicken but leads to gastroenteritis in humans, where it has also been associated with the development of secondary autoimmune disorders such as the Guillain-Barré or Miller-Fisher syndromes <xref rid="pgen.1003495-Wassenaar2" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Except for a cytolethal distending toxin (CDT) <xref rid="pgen.1003495-LaraTejero1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref> and homologs of a type-IV secretion system on the pVir plasmid of strain 81–176 <xref rid="pgen.1003495-Bacon1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <italic>C. jejuni</italic> lacks most classical virulence factors of other gastrointestinal pathogens. Therefore, it has been suggested that mainly the motility and metabolic capabilities of <italic>Campylobacter</italic> are required for virulence and colonization of the host <xref rid="pgen.1003495-Wassenaar2" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003495-Hofreuter1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>.</p>
    <p>Besides the lack of classical virulence determinants, little is known about the transcriptome structure of <italic>Campylobacter</italic>. The 1.6 megabase A/T-rich (∼31% G+C content) genome of <italic>C. jejuni</italic> encodes only three sigma factors and a few transcriptional regulators <xref rid="pgen.1003495-Parkhill1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, indicating additional layers of gene regulation. Bacterial sRNAs are an emerging class of post-transcriptional gene expression regulators which have been implicated in bacterial stress response and virulence regulation <xref rid="pgen.1003495-Storz1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. As do 50% of all bacteria, <italic>Campylobacter</italic> lacks a homolog of the RNA chaperone Hfq, which is a key player in sRNA–mediated regulation in enterobacteria <xref rid="pgen.1003495-Vogel1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003495-Chao1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Despite the prediction of five sRNA candidates in <italic>C. jejuni</italic> NCTC11168 using conventional, strand-insensitive RNA–seq combined with predictions of conserved RNA structures <xref rid="pgen.1003495-Chaudhuri1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, knowledge about post-transcriptional regulation in this pathogen is still very limited. Furthermore, a global TSS map including sRNA and antisense RNA promoters is still missing. However, such sRNA regulators could also contribute to phenotypic diversity by mediating strain-specific gene regulation.</p>
    <p>To gain insight into the sRNA repertoires as well as differences in primary transcriptomes among multiple strains of one bacterial species, we applied the dRNA–seq approach in a comparative manner to four <italic>C. jejuni</italic> isolates. In addition, we introduce a novel automated, comparative TSS annotation method for a fast and accurate generation of genome-wide TSS maps. Using this method we identified conserved and strain-specific TSS, some of which carry SNPs in promoter regions. Moreover, we detected 15 conserved and 24 strain-specific sRNA candidates, highlighting differential sRNA expression among strains. Furthermore, expression and conservation analysis reveals the presence of a minimal CRISPR system, an RNA–based immune system, in <italic>C. jejuni</italic>. Overall, defining the <italic>Campylobacter</italic> transcriptome structure including genome-wide promoter maps provides new insights into gene regulation and transcriptome evolution not only in this species but also in other pathogens.</p>

      <p>The determination of exact transcript boundaries and identification of novel transcripts facilitates genome annotation and also the discovery of regulatory elements which control gene expression. Our recently developed dRNA–seq approach allows for an efficient global TSS annotation by differential sequencing of two cDNA libraries which discriminate primary and processed 5′ ends: one library (−) is generated from untreated total RNA, whereas the second library (+) is generated after treatment with terminator exonuclease (TEX) which specifically degrades processed RNAs with a 5′-mono-phosphate <xref rid="pgen.1003495-Sharma1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>.</p>

      <p>Upon construction of two sets of dRNA–seq libraries from biological replicates of mid-log growth RNA samples for each of the four strains, we sequenced between 2.3 to 5.5 Mio cDNA reads per library which were subsequently mapped to the individual genome sequences (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003495.s001">Table S1</xref>). Sequencing of dRNA–Seq libraries leads to a characteristic enrichment of cDNA reads at TSS in the TEX-treated sample <xref rid="pgen.1003495-Sharma1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. These enrichment patterns allowed us to determine TSS in the four strains, and in many cases we observed an enrichment of cDNA reads at a given TSS in all four strains (for an example see Figure S2 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003495.s015">Text S1</xref>, <italic>rpsL</italic>). Moreover, our comparative dRNA–seq data showed that homologous genes might share the same TSS, even if the promoter regions are not conserved. Thus, based on sequence information alone it can be unclear whether a gene is expressed in the individual strains, whereas the comparative dRNA–seq data can provide this information. However, for several homologous genes, a clear TSS enrichment pattern (more than twofold in TEX+ <italic>vs.</italic> TEX−) was observed in only some of the strains despite highly conserved promoter regions (Figure S2 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003495.s015">Text S1</xref>, Cj1380). Nevertheless, a sharp flank in the cDNA distribution for all four strains indicates that transcription starts at exactly the same position. Without the comparative information from the other strains such cases could not unambiguously be defined as a TSS. Overall, a combination of sequence conservation and comparative TSS enrichment pattern analyses can be used to refine global TSS maps.</p>

      <title>Automated and comparative TSS analysis using a SuperGenome approach</title>
      <p>Manual annotation of TSS is labor- and time-consuming for a single strain and impractical for the analysis of multiple strains or larger genomes. To facilitate TSS comparisons, we mapped the four dRNA–seq data sets to a common coordinate system, the so-called SuperGenome <xref rid="pgen.1003495-Herbig1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, derived from a multiple whole genome alignment of the four strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003495-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). Overall, 65% of the 2,115,275 SuperGenome positions were identical among the four strains (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003495.s002">Table S2</xref>). The SuperGenome allows for a parallel visualization of the individual TEX+ and TEX- cDNA distributions of the four strains in a genome browser and thereby for a direct comparison of TSS enrichment patterns. The comparative dRNA–seq data show that the majority of TSS are enriched and detected in multiple strains (for an example locus see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003495-g001">Figure 1B</xref>, black arrows) but that there are also differences among strains. For example, we observed a TSS within <italic>kpsM</italic>, which encodes for one of the capsule export genes, in only two of the strains and a TSS upstream of homologs of Cj1456c only in strain 81116 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003495-g001">Figure 1B</xref>, red arrow and blue arrows, respectively), indicating that there is strain-specific transcriptional output.</p>

      <p>To automatically annotate TSS in a comparative manner, a two-step algorithm was employed: 1) TSS were detected independently for each strain based on dRNA–seq enrichment patterns and 2) TSS were mapped to the SuperGenome to allow for comparison and assignment of TSS among strains. Subsequently, all TSS of the individual strains were automatically classified as primary TSS (pTSS; main promoter of a gene) or secondary TSS (sTSS; alternative promoter upstream of pTSS of a gene), internal TSS (iTSS; promoter within gene), antisense TSS (asTSS; promoter antisense to a gene +/−100 nts) or orphan TSS (no association with annotation) according to their location relative to annotated genes (Figure S3A in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003495.s015">Text S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref> section). Our comparative approach enabled the annotation of a total of 3,377 TSS positions in the SuperGenome. 1,035 of the TSS were detected (but not necessarily enriched) in all four strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003495-g002">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1003495-t002">Table 2</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003495.s003">Table S3</xref>). Between 1,905 and 2,167 TSS were detected in the individual strains, including ∼300 strain-specific TSS (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003495.s004">Table S4</xref>). The overall higher number of 2,167 TSS and 450 strain-specific TSS in RM1221 are mainly derived from TSS within its prophage elements (CMLP1, CJIE2-4) to which only cDNA reads from RM1221 were mapped in the SuperGenome (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1003495-t001">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003495-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). On the two large plasmids, pVir (∼35 kB) and pTet (∼45 kB), of <italic>C. jejuni</italic> 81–176 we detected 70 and 58 TSS, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003495.s005">Table S5</xref>). Approximately 60% of the conserved TSS are classified as pTSS or sTSS and in most cases drive transcription of mRNA genes. In contrast, only 21–31% of the strain-specific TSS are pTSS or sTSS and the majority of the strain-specific TSS (47–54%) are classified as antisense TSS (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1003495-t002">Table 2</xref>).</p>

      <title>Comparative analysis of regulatory elements</title>
      <p>Using <italic>MEME</italic>
<xref rid="pgen.1003495-Bailey1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref> we analyzed the promoter regions (−50 to +1 of all TSS) upstream of the total number of 8,019 TSS in all four strains for sequence motifs of at least 45 nt. This revealed a periodic A/T-rich pattern instead of a clear −35 box followed by an extended −10 box (<italic>TGxTATAAT</italic>) for ∼89% of the promoter regions in the four strains as a consensus motif for the housekeeping sigma factor, σ<sup>70</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003495-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). This motif fits with a previously predicted consensus sequence for a smaller number of <italic>Campylobacter</italic> promoters and for σ<sup>70</sup> in <italic>H. pylori</italic> based on dRNA–seq, indicating that transcription predominantly initiates at an extended −10 box in Epsilonproteobacteria <xref rid="pgen.1003495-Sharma1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003495-Petersen1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. Moreover, we identified motifs which resemble the consensus binding sites for the alternative sigma factors, σ<sup>28</sup> (FliA) and σ<sup>54</sup> (RpoN), for 141/8,019 (1.8%) and 36/8,019 (0.4%) TSS, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003495-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). Separate analyses of the four strains indicated that there is no strong variation in their general promoter patterns among strains (Figure S4 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003495.s015">Text S1</xref>). Since some genes that are known to be regulated by the alternative sigma factors were missed in our <italic>MEME</italic> searches, we defined a consensus motif based on nine and eight TSS from strain NCTC11168 with a previously described FliA- and RpoN-dependent promoter, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003495.s006">Table S6</xref>). Pattern searches with this consensus motif revealed additional 138 and 26 TSS fitting the FliA and RpoN motifs, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003495.s007">Table S7</xref>).</p>
      <p>Approximately 35% of all TSS in each strain are pTSS and around 10% are classified as sTSS (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1003495-t002">Table 2</xref> and Figure S3 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003495.s015">Text S1</xref>). The majority of the 3,241 5′UTRs defined by pTSS and sTSS of mRNA genes have a length between 20 and 50 nt (Figure S5A in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003495.s015">Text S1</xref>). <italic>MEME</italic> searches detected an “AAGGA”-motif with an upstream A/T-rich sequence as a consensus for the ribosome binding site in 2,990 out of the 3,158 5′UTRs with a length ≥8 nt.</p>
      <p>Pairwise comparison of the 5′UTR lengths of genes with at least one ortholog in one of the other strains showed that the majority of the conserved genes have the same 5′UTR length but revealed also several length variations among strains (Figure S5B in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003495.s015">Text S1</xref>). Despite a correction - where possible - for differences in start codon annotations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003495.s008">Tables S8</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003495.s009">S9</xref>), many of the 5′UTR length differences are due to different 5′ ends of the CDS of the respective genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003495.s010">Table S10</xref>). In some cases, different 5′UTR lengths result from insertion of new genes upstream of the start codon and the acquisition of new promoters in certain strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003495-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). For example, in three of the strains, a gene encoding for a restriction modification (RM) enzyme (CJE1195, C8J_0992, <italic>cjeI</italic>) is inserted upstream of <italic>npdA</italic>, encoding a NAD-dependent deacetylase, which is transcribed from a pTSS that was probably acquired together with <italic>cjeI</italic>. In contrast, strain 81–176 lacks the RM enzyme as well as the downstream promoter and <italic>npdA</italic> is co-transcribed as a polycistronic mRNA from a TSS upstream of <italic>murC</italic>.</p>
      <p>Besides insertions of new upstream genes with a novel promoter, different promoters can lead to 5′UTR length variation among strains. For example, different TSS sets were detected in the four strains for homologs of a putative transporter, Cj0339 (Figure S6A in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003495.s015">Text S1</xref>). Moreover, it has previously been reported that the <italic>asnA</italic> gene of strain 81–176 has acquired a sec-dependent secretion signal to the otherwise cytoplasmic asparaginase found in NCTC11168 and facilitates asparagine utilization in this strain <xref rid="pgen.1003495-Hofreuter1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Our dRNA–seq data indicate that the different <italic>asnA</italic> forms are transcribed from strain-specific promoters with ∼100-fold higher cDNA read counts for the secreted asparaginase compared to the cytoplasmic form (Figure S6B in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003495.s015">Text S1</xref>).</p>

      <title>SNP–dependent strain-specific promoter usage</title>
      <p>Comparison of promoter motifs for conserved and strain-specific TSS revealed no difference in the general promoter patterns (Figure S7 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003495.s015">Text S1</xref>). However, our comparative TSS detection allowed us to identify regions with strain-specific promoter usage, e.g., regions for which we detected a TSS in only some of the strains although the region is present in the SuperGenome in all strains (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003495.s003">Table S3</xref>, compare columns “mapCount” and “detCount”). We observed that in many cases single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) lead to disruption of promoters in a subset of strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003495-g003">Figure 3</xref>). For example, the pTSS of <italic>pnk</italic>, encoding an inorganic polyphosphate/ATP-NAD kinase, is enriched and conserved in all four strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003495-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). In contrast an iTSS within <italic>pnk</italic> is only detected in RM1221 and NCTC11168. In strains 81–176 and 81116 a C to T exchange in the “CGATTT” σ<sup>28</sup> consensus seems to be sufficient to abolish transcription initiation from this TSS. Additional examples for mutations within conserved promoter elements are shown in Figure S8 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003495.s015">Text S1</xref>. Moreover, we noted that mutations within the periodic A/T-rich pattern upstream of the −10 box could also affect transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003495-g003">Figure 3B</xref> and Figure S9 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003495.s015">Text S1</xref>). For example, in strain NCTC11168, the Cj0004c and Cj0005c genes encode a monoheme cytochrome <italic>c</italic> and molybdopterin oxidoreductase, respectively, which allows <italic>C. jejuni</italic> to use sulphite as a respiratory electron donor <xref rid="pgen.1003495-Myers1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. This bi-cistronic operon along with the σ<sup>70</sup> −10 box is conserved in all four strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003495-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). However, mutations in the A/T rich upstream pattern of its pTSS in strain 81116 coincide with a loss of transcription either due to disturbing transcription initiation or binding of some regulatory factor. In line with this, we observed cytochrome <italic>c</italic> reduction as a measure for sulphite oxidation in only three of the strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003495-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). This indicates, that although genes are conserved among strains and show high conservation in promoter regions, they may not necessarily be transcribed in all of them.</p>

      <title>The non-coding RNA repertoire of <italic>C. jejuni</italic>

      <p>In addition to mRNA TSS, we identified many candidates for non-coding RNAs by our comparative dRNA–seq. For example, ∼45% of the TSS for each strain were classified as antisense TSS (asTSS) and 445 of the asTSS were detected in all four strains, indicating a large fraction of antisense transcription (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1003495-t002">Table 2</xref>, Figures S3 and S10 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003495.s015">Text S1</xref>).

Northern blot profiling under different growth phases confirmed expression of most of these sRNA candidates. Some sRNAs, such as CJnc60 or CJnc140, are highly conserved and show similar expression patterns in all strains. In contrast, some of the other conserved sRNAs, such as CJnc180 and CJnc190, which are encoded antisense to each other, show differential expression patterns among strains. Moreover, our Northern blots confirmed strain-specific sRNAs, such as CJnc30, which is only present in NCTC11168, or CJnc20, which is missing in RM1221. Most of our candidate sRNAs are transcribed from their own TSS, but we also found examples of sRNA candidates generated by processing, e.g., from 3′ ends of mRNAs (Figure S11 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003495.s015">Text S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003495.s011">Table S11</xref>).

      <p>Our dRNA–seq analysis shows that the crRNAs and TracrRNA are actively transcribed and share a stretch of perfect complementarity in <italic>C. jejuni</italic> which allows for RNase III-dependent processing of the crRNAs. In line with this, we observe an accumulation of processed ∼38-nt spacer-repeat units and processed ∼62 nt TracrRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003495-g006">Figure 6B</xref>). Only weak CRISPR expression was detected in strain RM1221. Conservation analysis showed that the <italic>cas9</italic> gene, which is required for the stability of crRNAs and cleavage of target DNA <xref rid="pgen.1003495-Deltcheva1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003495-Jinek1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, carries a stop mutation in strain RM1221 leading to a truncated protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003495-g006">Figure 6C</xref>). In strain 81–176 the CRISPR region is replaced by two genes with very low G/C content compared to the flanking genomic regions.</p>
      <p>The RNase III/TracrRNA–dependent processing leads to a cleavage event within the repeat region of the crRNAs <xref rid="pgen.1003495-Deltcheva1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. Surprisingly, the mature spacer-repeat units are enriched in our TEX-treated libraries, indicative of primary transcripts starting at position five within each spacer. Moreover, the 3′ end of each repeat ends with “GGTAAAAT” resembling an extended −10 box. Thus, <italic>C. jejuni</italic> apparently employs promoter sequences within each repeat to initiate transcription of the associated spacer unit, so that only one processing event mediated by RNase III and TracrRNA in the repeat sequence is required to generate the 3′ end of the mature crRNA. In line with this model, we observed accumulation of longer transcripts upon deletion of RNase III (Figure S13 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003495.s015">Text S1</xref>). Primer extension analysis confirmed that these longer transcripts start at the proposed TSS within each spacer and that most of the TracrRNA species are transcribed from these upstream promoters. Thus, in contrast to other type-II systems, where the crRNAs are transcribed together with a leader sequence from one upstream promoter, each repeat in the <italic>C. jejuni</italic> CRISPR carries its own promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003495-g006">Figure 6D</xref>).</p>

    <title>Discussion</title>
    <p>Here we present the first comparative primary transcriptome analysis of four different <italic>C. jejuni</italic> strains including a novel automated TSS annotation method, which revealed strain-specific promoter usage and sRNA repertoires. The observed strain-specific transcriptional output reveals candidate genes which could contribute to phenotypic variation among strains or facilitate adaptation to different hosts or niches.</p>
    <p>Previously, the generation of global TSS maps from RNA–seq data has mainly been performed on a manual or semi-automated basis <xref rid="pgen.1003495-Sharma1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003495-Mitschke1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003495-Albrecht1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003495-Jager1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003495-Filiatrault1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003495-Schluter1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003495-Wurtzel1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003495-Wurtzel2" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>. These strategies are typically very laborious and time-consuming with limited reproducibility and require even more effort for the comparison of transcriptomes from multiple conditions or strains. Therefore, we have developed a model-based TSS prediction method based on criteria used for manual TSS annotations. It provides detailed values (such as number of read starts, enrichment factor etc.) as well as classifications (pTSS, sTSS, asTSS, iTSS) for each TSS candidate which allows the user to review the underlying thresholds for TSS detection. Benchmarking of our TSS prediction method using the manually annotated TSS from <italic>H. pylori</italic>
<xref rid="pgen.1003495-Sharma1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref> showed that our approach achieved a sensitivity of 82% and a precision rate of 75%. Since our comparative approach allows for the integration of data sets from different strains or conditions, its performance can generally be increased by the inclusion and comparison of multiple data sets and replicates. Moreover, the TSS annotation will be further improved by adjusting the parameters to additional training sets based on experimental validation. Recently, Schmidtke <italic>et al.</italic> presented a fully automated approach for TSS annotation of a single genome based on read count data and a sophisticated statistical model, which calculates p-values for TSS candidates and thereby provides a confidence estimation for observing a TSS <xref rid="pgen.1003495-Schmidtke1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>. However, the specific properties of the TSS candidates, such as expression height and dRNA–seq enrichment factor, cannot be directly inferred from the resulting p-values. In future, a combination of both approaches would be promising especially for very weak TSS candidates. Furthermore, our automated TSS method also allows for a comparative TSS annotation among dRNA–seq libraries from multiple strains by the integration of the SuperGenome approach. Considering the rapidly increasing number of genome sequences as well as RNA–seq studies, our approach will facilitate a systematic TSS annotation among different strains or growth conditions and can also be adapted to the analyses of eukaryotic transcriptomes.</p>
    <p>Comparative genomics of multiple <italic>Campylobacter</italic> strains or species provided the core genome of the genus and also revealed differences in genome content and structure which could support adaptation to different hosts <xref rid="pgen.1003495-Fouts1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003495-Parker1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003495-Hofreuter2" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003495-Poly1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003495-Friis1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>. Furthermore, comparison of genetically closely related <italic>C. jejuni</italic> strains isolated from different hosts indicated that <italic>Campylobacter</italic> uses high phenotypic flexibility and genetic microdiversity to reversibly adapt to changing environments <xref rid="pgen.1003495-Gripp1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>. In addition, variation in contingency loci contributes to rapid adaptation to novel hosts <xref rid="pgen.1003495-Jerome1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>. This genetic flexibility among strains might be supported by differences in transcription among strains and post-transcriptional regulation which we observed in our comparative dRNA–seq data. For this first comparative analysis we have selected widely used laboratory strains with available genome sequence. However, our comparative approach can be easily adapted to the analysis of multiple isolates from different hosts or isolation sources. For example, the use of our single-nucleotide resolution approach could help to understand the transcriptomic and phenotypic differences that were previously observed during the analysis of the genome-sequenced and original isolate of <italic>C. jejuni</italic> NCTC11168 <xref rid="pgen.1003495-Gaynor1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>.</p>
    <p>Our comparative dRNA–seq approach allowed us to annotate between 1,905 and 2,167 TSS in the four <italic>C. jejuni</italic> strains. We observed that the majority of TSS are conserved among multiple strains, but we also found many examples where SNPs in promoter regions apparently resulted in strain-specific promoter usage. Thus, although some promoters are highly conserved and show almost perfect overlap to promoter consensus motifs - which would be indicative for active transcription - the respective genes are not necessarily expressed at the same level among strains. Therefore, comparative transcriptomics facilitates the identification of differences in the functional output from genomes which cannot be directly inferred from closely related DNA sequences.</p>
    <p>SNPs can be adaptive and, thereby, lead to niche expansion <xref rid="pgen.1003495-Perutz1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>. In addition, point mutations in ORFs or rRNA genes can mediate antibiotics resistances in bacteria including <italic>Campylobacter</italic>
<xref rid="pgen.1003495-Alfredson1" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>. In bacterial pathogens, a variety of pathoadaptive mutations have been described which can affect cell binding, host tissue tropism or virulence regulation <xref rid="pgen.1003495-WilmesRiesenberg1" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003495-Horstmann1" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003495-VanStelten1" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003495-Weissman1" ref-type="bibr">[57]</xref>. Furthermore, point mutations in ORFs could lead to truncated or non-functional proteins or changes in protein activity <xref rid="pgen.1003495-Choi1" ref-type="bibr">[58]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003495-Seshu1" ref-type="bibr">[59]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003495-Vega1" ref-type="bibr">[60]</xref> and have also been shown to discriminate mRNA targets of bacterial sRNAs <xref rid="pgen.1003495-Papenfort1" ref-type="bibr">[61]</xref>. Even single regulatory genes or promoter inversions can be sufficient to alter bacterial host specificity <xref rid="pgen.1003495-Mandel1" ref-type="bibr">[62]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003495-Somvanshi1" ref-type="bibr">[63]</xref> and promoter SNPs have been associated with overproduction of virulence genes <xref rid="pgen.1003495-Liang1" ref-type="bibr">[64]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003495-Okuda1" ref-type="bibr">[65]</xref>. Based on our global TSS maps, we identified several examples where SNPs disrupt conserved positions in promoter motifs recognized by the three sigma factors. Furthermore, we found several examples for disruptive SNPs in the A/T-rich upstream regions, indicating that this region is also required for transcription initiation in Epsilonproteobacteria. These promoters with SNPs might be good hints to genes which contribute to adaptation to different environments or hosts. For example, in strain 81116 we observed mutations in the promoter for monoheme cytochrome <italic>c</italic> and a molybdopterin oxidoreductase, which allow <italic>C. jejuni</italic> to use sulphite as a respiratory electron donor <xref rid="pgen.1003495-Myers1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. This indicates that strain 81116 has lost the ability to transcribe this operon and perhaps even lost the ability to respire sulphite (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003495-g003">Figure 3</xref>). <italic>C. jejuni</italic> is unable to metabolize glucose since it lacks the enzyme phosphofructokinase. Instead, it has a complex branched respiratory chain and can utilize a variety of electron donors like formate, lactate, or sulphite. Sulphite respiration might also help <italic>C. jejuni</italic> to survive in sulphite-rich niches and foods, and might also be used for detoxification. Furthermore, a strain lacking the molybdopterin oxidoreductase has been shown to have a reduced ability to infect Caco-2 cells <xref rid="pgen.1003495-Tareen1" ref-type="bibr">[66]</xref>.</p>
    <p>Since the SNPs in promoter regions could also interfere with binding of a transcriptional regulator and thereby affect transcription, such promoters with strain-specific expression patterns represent good candidates to fish for novel DNA-binding proteins. For example, a SNP in the Fur-binding site of the <italic>sodB</italic> promoter of certain <italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic> strains has been shown to affect direct binding of apo-Fur <xref rid="pgen.1003495-Carpenter1" ref-type="bibr">[67]</xref>. The global map of TSS and promoter SNPs may give hints as to how <italic>C. jejuni</italic> and other microbes with compact genomes and few transcription factors could adapt gene expression according to different environmental conditions.</p>
    <p>Our comparative approach allowed us to annotate TSS by combining the dRNA–seq data from multiple strains. This approach improves the annotation accuracy of the individual strains by integrating the information from multiple transcriptomes and also reveals differences among strains. Previously, bacterial RNA–seq studies mainly focused on the analyses of single strains (reviewed in <xref rid="pgen.1003495-Croucher1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>) or were not strand-specific <xref rid="pgen.1003495-YoderHimes1" ref-type="bibr">[68]</xref>. Two recent comparative transcriptome analyses using strand-specific cDNA sequencing mainly focused on the divergence of sRNA expression as well as long antisense RNAs <xref rid="pgen.1003495-Wurtzel2" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003495-Bernick1" ref-type="bibr">[69]</xref>.

    <p>Our global transcriptome maps revealed several candidates for conserved and strain-specific sRNAs. Small regulatory RNAs have been implicated as key regulators in metabolic pathways and during pathogenesis <xref rid="pgen.1003495-Papenfort2" ref-type="bibr">[73]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003495-Beisel1" ref-type="bibr">[74]</xref>. The newly identified sRNAs could contribute to virulence gene regulation and host adaptation by modulating metabolic pathways which are important for host colonization in <italic>C. jejuni</italic>
<xref rid="pgen.1003495-Hofreuter1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. A study based on conventional, non strand-specific RNA–seq predicted five sRNAs in <italic>C. jejuni</italic>
<xref rid="pgen.1003495-Chaudhuri1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. In our strand-specific dRNA–seq data, we observed expression for four of them (Figure S11 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003495.s015">Text S1</xref>). Moreover, a dRNA–seq study of <italic>C. jejuni</italic> NCTC11168 compared the transcriptome organization between <italic>C. jejuni</italic> and <italic>H. pylori</italic>
<xref rid="pgen.1003495-Sharma1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref> and identified around 20 trans-encoded sRNA candidates in <italic>C. jejuni</italic>, most of which are also detected in our study (I. Porcelli and A. van Vliet, personal communication). The majority of our sRNA candidates are expressed as independent transcripts. However, we also detected examples of processed sRNA species, which can be generated from the 3′ end of mRNAs. Recently, such 3′-end derived transcripts have been shown to stably associate with the RNA chaperone Hfq in <italic>Salmonella</italic> and to act as regulatory RNAs on <italic>trans-</italic>encoded mRNAs <xref rid="pgen.1003495-Chao2" ref-type="bibr">[75]</xref>. Since <italic>Campylobacter</italic> lacks Hfq, it will be interesting to see whether its sRNAs require a different RNA chaperone for their activity and stability or whether they act independently of an auxiliary protein. Moreover, future studies will be required to uncover the target genes and physiological roles of sRNAs in <italic>Campylobacter</italic>.</p>
    <p>The most abundant sRNA in strain NCTC11168 corresponds to TracrRNA, which is required together with RNase III for maturation of CRISPR RNAs <xref rid="pgen.1003495-Deltcheva1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. Due to the high variability of the spacer sequences, CRISPR loci have been used for strain genotyping including <italic>Campylobacter</italic> species <xref rid="pgen.1003495-Schouls1" ref-type="bibr">[76]</xref>. Surprisingly, we found that the crRNAs in <italic>C. jejuni</italic> are transcribed from individual promoters within each repeat unit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003495-g006">Figure 6</xref>). In other prokaryotes, the crRNAs are transcribed from a leader sequence and several processing steps are required to generate the mature crRNAs. Therefore, the CRISPR locus of <italic>Campylobacter</italic> with its individual crRNA promoters and only three <italic>cas</italic> proteins represents a “minimal” system of the type-II subtype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003495-g006">Figure 6D</xref>) which requires only one processing event by RNase III within the repeats to generate the mature crRNAs. A similar CRISPR organization was also identified in <italic>Neisseria menigitidis</italic> (N. Heidrich and J. Vogel, personal communication). Furthermore, in strain RM1221, the crRNAs and TracrRNA were only weakly expressed probably due to a stop-mutation in <italic>cas9</italic>, while strain 81–176 completely lacks the CRISPR locus. Interestingly, these two strains carry prophages or plasmids, indicating that these horizontally acquired genetic elements could be mutually exclusive with an active CRISPR system. Conservation analysis in additional strains showed that strains with plasmids or integrated elements very often carry degenerated CRISPR loci (Figure S14 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003495.s015">Text S1</xref>). Moreover, it has recently been shown that ganglioside-like LOS structures of GBS-associated <italic>C. jejuni</italic> strains can confer efficient bacteriophage resistance and that the presence of sialyltransferases correlates significantly with an apparently non-functional CRISPR system <xref rid="pgen.1003495-Louwen1" ref-type="bibr">[77]</xref>. Further studies of the influence of the CRISPR system on pathogenicity of <italic>Campylobacter</italic> will be required. Moreover, since components of type-II CRISPR systems have recently been adapted for genome editing in humans <xref rid="pgen.1003495-Mali1" ref-type="bibr">[78]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003495-Cong1" ref-type="bibr">[79]</xref>, the minimal type-II systems might be useful for further improvements of such genome editing tools.</p>
    <p>Overall our high-resolution transcriptome map revealed regulatory elements and their conservation in multiple <italic>Campylobacter jejuni</italic> strains on a genome-wide scale. The comparison of multiple strains improves annotation of transcriptome features such as TSS maps and reveals strain-specific TSS usage as well as sRNA repertoires. These strain-specific transcription patterns will provide new insights into genes which could promote phenotypic differences despite high conservation at the genome level. Our novel automated TSS annotation can easily be applied to a wider range of strains or conditions and may also be used for to the annotation of eukaryotic transcriptomes.</p>

      <title>Transcriptional start site (TSS) annotation and SuperGenome approach</title>
      <p>A whole genome alignment of the four <italic>C. jejuni</italic> strains was computed with <italic>Mauve</italic>
<xref rid="pgen.1003495-Darling1" ref-type="bibr">[83]</xref>. Based on this global alignment a common genomic coordinate system, the SuperGenome was defined into which all positional information can be projected that relates to the single genomes <xref rid="pgen.1003495-Herbig1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. This resulted in a consensus sequence with the coordinates of the complete alignment and a mapping of each position of each single genome to a position in the alignment. Next, all genome-specific data (expression height graphs derived from mapped read data, genomic annotations, and sequences) were mapped to the common coordinate system.</p>
      <p>Our automated TSS prediction approach, which uses this SuperGenome mapping for comparative analyses, consists of several steps: The initial detection of TSS in the single strains is based on the localization of positions, where a significant number of reads start. Thus, for each position i in the RNA–seq graph corresponding to the TEX+ library the algorithm calculates e(i)-e(i-1), where e(i) is the expression height at position i (Figure S15 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003495.s015">Text S1</xref>). In addition, the factor of height change is calculated, i.e. e(i)/e(i-1). To evaluate if the reads starting at this position are originating from primary transcripts, the enrichment factor is calculated as e<sub>TEX+</sub>(i)/e<sub>TEX−</sub>(i). For all positions where these values exceed the threshold (see Supplementary Material) a TSS candidate is annotated.</p>
      <p>The TSS prediction procedure is applied to both replicates of each strain. TSS candidates, which are not detected in both replicates with a maximal positional difference of one nucleotide, are discarded. Afterwards, TSS candidates that are in close vicinity are grouped into a cluster and only the TSS candidate with the highest expression is kept. In the next step, the TSS candidates of each strain are mapped to the SuperGenome to assign each TSS to the corresponding TSS in the other strains. The final TSS annotations are then characterized on the SuperGenome level with respect to their occurrence in the different strains and in which strains they appear to be enriched. In the context of the individual strains the TSS are further classified according to their location relative to annotated genes. For this we used a similar classification scheme as previously described <xref rid="pgen.1003495-Sharma1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Thus, for each TSS it is decided if it is the <italic>primary</italic> or <italic>secondary</italic> TSS of a gene, if it is an <italic>internal</italic> TSS, an <italic>antisense</italic> TSS or if it cannot be assigned to one of these classes (<italic>orphan</italic>). A TSS is classified as <italic>primary</italic> or <italic>secondary</italic> if it is located ≤300 bp upstream of a gene. The TSS with the strongest expression considering all strains is classified as <italic>primary</italic>. All other TSS that are assigned to the same gene are classified as <italic>secondary</italic>. <italic>Internal</italic> TSS are located within an annotated gene on the sense strand and <italic>antisense</italic> TSS are located inside a gene or within ≤100 bp on the antisense strand. These assignments are indicated by a 1 in the respective column of <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003495.s004">Tables S4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003495.s005">S5</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003495.s006">S6</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003495.s007">S7</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003495.s008">S8</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003495.s009">S9</xref>. <italic>Orphan</italic> TSS, which are not in the vicinity of an annotated gene, are indicated by “0” in all four columns.</p>
      <p>To validate our automated TSS detection we applied it to the previously generated dRNA–seq data of <italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic> grown under five different conditions <xref rid="pgen.1003495-Sharma1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. In this study, we had manually annotated the TSS based on enrichment patterns in the TEX+ compared to TEX- libraries. We used these hand-curated TSS positions as benchmark and compared it to the results of the automated detection. We allowed a difference of up to one nucleotide when comparing an automatically detected TSS to a manually annotated TSS. With this threshold, the automated approach achieves a sensitivity of 82% and a precision rate of 75%. The parameters used for the TSS annotation in <italic>C. jejuni</italic> were selected according to this benchmarking with the manual TSS set of <italic>H. pylori</italic> (see also Supplementary Methods in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003495.s015">Text S1</xref>).</p>

        <p>5′UTR comparisons. For all possible combinations of the four strains, the CDS (coding sequence) length and 5′UTR length of orthologous genes were compared. Genes were considered as orthologous if they were best reciprocal hits in a BLAST search on DNA level (i.e. <italic>blastn</italic>) in two compared strains. The gene names, lengths of the CDS of the two genes, the type of the TSS (pTSS = both primary; sTSS = both secondary; mixed_pTSS_sTSS = one of two orthologs has a primary TSS, the other ortholog has a secondary TSS), and the lengths of the 5′UTR of each gene of a homolog pair as well as the comparison status of these (“equal” or “different”) are listed.</p>
