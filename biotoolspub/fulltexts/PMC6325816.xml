    <title>Background</title>
    <p id="Par2">RNA viruses, including HIV, influenza, West Nile, and Zika, pose significant threats to public health worldwide. Part of this burden stems from their ability to rapidly evolve within hosts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Generation of intrahost genetic diversity allows virus populations to evade host immune responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], alter the severity of disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], and adapt to changing environments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Studying virus populations, both within naturally infected hosts and during experimental evolution, can therefore lead to breakthroughs in our understanding of virus-host interactions and novel approaches for outbreak response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p>
    <p id="Par3">In many cases, however, accurately measuring intrahost RNA virus diversity using deep sequencing remains a significant challenge. Multiple factors, such as virus titer, sample preparation, sequencing errors, and computational inferences, can bias measures of genetic diversity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Moreover, for many clinical samples, low ratios of viral to host RNA often necessitate enrichment of viral nucleic acid to recover sufficient templates for deep sequencing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. This is especially true for Zika virus, where low viremias (&lt; 1000 copies/μL of RNA) are often detected during natural and experimental infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. PCR amplification of virus nucleic acid is a common approach to overcome this challenge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], although it can introduce biases by altering the composition of intrahost genetic variants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Therefore, to ensure accuracy, comprehensive validation of deep sequencing approaches should accompany diversity measures from biological samples.</p>
    <p id="Par4">We previously developed a multiplex primer design tool (“Primal Scheme”) coupled to a laboratory protocol (“PrimalSeq”) to sequence RNA viruses directly from clinical samples in a way that is cheap, accurate, and scalable under resource-limited conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Versions of PrimalSeq have been used to sequence the majority of Zika virus genomes from the epidemic in the Americas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], yellow fever virus in Brazil [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], and West Nile virus in the USA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. PrimalSeq has also been used to characterize Zika virus during infection of non-human primates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. While PrimalSeq was shown to be superior to other methods for obtaining consensus sequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], it has yet to be validated for measuring intrahost diversity.</p>
    <p id="Par5">In this study, we benchmarked PrimalSeq for sequencing diverse virus populations, highlighting its limitations and providing recommendations for accurately measuring intrahost single-nucleotide variants (iSNVs) from both Illumina and Oxford Nanopore data. We used these results to develop comprehensive laboratory protocols and a computational tool (iVar), and further tested PrimalSeq to characterize Zika virus populations generated from cell culture, mosquito, non-human primate, and human clinical samples. We demonstrate the utility of PrimalSeq for other viruses by designing an amplicon scheme for West Nile virus and measuring genetic diversity from field-collected mosquitoes and birds. Our data show that virus diversity can be significantly impacted by the experimental and biological systems, and we provide a framework to uncover the underlying mechanisms. PrimalSeq and iVar provide a scalable platform for viruses other than Zika and West Nile that can be applied to discover ecological, epidemiological, and immunological drivers of virus evolution in a variety of systems.</p>

      <title>Virus concentration and sequencing depth impact intrahost variant calling</title>
      <p id="Par6">We previously developed Primal Scheme (Quick et al.; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://primal.zibraproject.org/">primal.zibraproject.org</ext-link>), a multiplex primer design tool for amplicon-based sequencing of RNA virus genomes directly from clinical samples [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Our Zika virus PrimalSeq protocol generates 35 overlapping amplicons of ~ 400 base pairs from two multiplexed PCR reactions, an approach similar to “RNA jackhammering,” which was developed to sequence HIV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. The process of PCR amplification to generate sufficient templates for high-throughput sequencing, however, may bias the measurements of intrahost virus diversity through differential amplification efficiencies for divergent virus haplotypes present in a population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>].</p>
      <p id="Par7">Given the potential biases that may be introduced during PCR amplification, we sought to assess the accuracy of PrimalSeq for iSNV detection. Through a series of experiments, we determined that at least 1000 RNA virus copies are needed to detect iSNVs at greater than 3% frequency, when sequenced to a coverage depth of at least 400× (i.e., the number of sequenced nucleotides per targeted genome position, Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). To set up these experiments, we created genetically diverse Zika virus populations by mixing two divergent virus strains: Zika virus #1 isolated from Puerto Rico in 2015 (Genbank KX087101) and virus #2 isolated from Cambodia in 2010 (Genbank KU955593). Using gold-standard untargeted metagenomic sequencing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>], we determined that there were 159 fixed consensus sequence differences between the viruses located throughout the 10,807 nucleotide genome of virus #1 and #2 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Measurement intrahost variant frequencies are more accurate at high frequencies and are susceptible to input concentrations and coverage depths. <bold>a</bold> We created genetically diverse virus populations by mixing two Zika virus isolates with 159 consensus nucleotide differences to test the effects of PCR amplification prior to sequencing to measure intrahost single-nucleotide variant (iSNV) frequencies. For these initial experiments, we amplified three ~ 400 bp regions of the Zika virus genome using primers without any mismatches to either of the mixed virus (shown as amplicons 5, 24, and 33). "Amplicon 5" contains 5 iSNV sites, "amplicon 24" contains 8 iSNV sites, and "amplicon 33" contains 5 iSNV sites. <bold>b</bold> We created virus populations containing 50%, 25%, 14%, 7%, 3%, 1.5%, and 0.8% virus #2 to test the impact of PCR amplification prior to sequencing on measuring ranges of iSNV frequencies. The data points represent individual iSNVs amplified and sequenced in triplicate from each population (colored by amplicon 5, 24, or 33 as shown in <bold>a</bold>. <bold>c</bold> We 10-fold serially diluted a mixed population containing 14% of virus #2 (expected, dotted line) from 100,000 to 10 copies to test the effects of input concentrations on accurate iSNV measurements. <bold>d</bold> We randomly downsampled the datasets generated from 1000 input virus RNA copies containing 3% virus #2 to set coverage depths (sequenced nucleotides [nt] per genome position) to determine the minimum coverage needed to yield accurate iSNV measurements.

      <p id="Par8">For our initial evaluation, we selected three of the 35 Zika virus primer sets that flanked at least five variable genome positions (amplicons 5, 24, and 33). We then made two sets of mixed virus populations: (1) altering the ratios of mixed viruses, while keeping the overall input concentration constant at 1000 virus RNA copies (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b) and (2) maintaining a constant ratio of 14% of virus #2 while altering the input concentrations of virus RNA used for cDNA synthesis (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>c). For each test, we measured the frequencies of the 18 iSNVs between virus #1 and #2 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a). We generated the amplicons independently three times and sequenced each using the Illumina MiSeq platform (“technical replicates”).</p>
      <p id="Par9">We found that the measured mean iSNV frequencies were accurate from populations containing 50%, 25%, 14%, 7%, and 3% of virus #2 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b). At 1.5% of virus #2, the standard deviation of our measured mean iSNV frequency (0.2–1.2%) fell below the expected frequency, indicating that we could not measure the true iSNV frequency at that dilution (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b). This demonstrates that the lower limit of accurate iSNV detection for PrimalSeq in this scenario is between 1.5 and 3%. When we altered input concentrations of a population containing 14% virus #2 from 100,000 to 10 virus RNA copies (10-fold serial dilutions), we found that the variances of measured frequencies became significantly higher from concentrations containing 100 or less copies (Levene’s test for variance, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05; Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>c). Therefore, input virus concentrations can dramatically alter iSNV detection, as others have also discovered [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. We conclude that a minimum of 1000 virus RNA copies should be used with PrimalSeq to accurately measure iSNVs greater than 3% frequency.</p>
      <p id="Par10">Sequencing coverage depth is another important factor for iSNV detection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], so we sought to define the level of sequencing coverage needed to accurately measure iSNVs. From our samples containing 1000 virus RNA copies with 97% virus #1 and 3% virus #2, we sequenced the targeted genome regions in triplicates to a coverage depth of ~ 3000×. We randomly downsampled these datasets to generate coverage depths of 1000, 600, 400, 200, 100, and 50× (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>d). We found that the variances of iSNV frequencies became significantly higher from coverage depths lower than 400× (i.e., at 200, 100, and 50×; Levene’s test for variance, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05; Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>d). Thus, we conclude that a minimum sequencing coverage depth of 400× is required to maintain iSNV measurement accuracy at the lower limit of frequency detection (3%) and input concentration (1000 virus RNA copies).</p>

      <title>Primer mismatches impact intrahost variant frequency measurements</title>
      <p id="Par11">A concern for using PCR-based sequencing protocols for measuring intrahost virus diversity is the potential for primer mismatches to alter PCR efficiency that can bias iSNV frequency measurements. Indeed, we found that primer mismatches, especially those close to the 3′ end, can alter iSNV frequencies in the generated amplicons (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). To make this assessment, we used (1) our Zika virus PrimalSeq strategy and (2) a mix containing 90% of virus #1 and 10% of virus #2 (“Mix10%”). Of the 159 consensus nucleotide differences between virus #1 and #2, 24 resulted in mismatches within the primer regions of 20 of the oligos used to generate 18 of the 35 PCR amplicons (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a, Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S1). In addition, at least one nucleotide difference occurred within each of the 18 amplicons (outside of the primer-binding region), which allowed us to assess the influence of primer mismatches on iSNV frequency measurements across the Zika virus genome.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Measures of intrahost variant frequencies are sensitive to primer mismatches. <bold>a</bold> To assess the impacts of primer mismatches on accurately measuring intrahost single-nucleotide variants (iSNVs), we sequenced a mixed Zika virus population using 35 overlapping PCR amplicons (see “Amplicon scheme” above panel). The virus population contained 10% virus #2 (Expected) and 1000 virus RNA copies were amplified and sequenced in triplicate. The amplicons and iSNVs are colored according to the number of mismatches in the primer sequences used to generate that amplicon. Data shown as means and ranges. <bold>b</bold> To account for unequal iSNV sites within each amplicon, the iSNV frequencies on each amplicon were averaged to produce a haplotype frequency for virus #2 mixed at 10% (Expected). Data shown as means and ranges. <bold>c</bold> We calculated the deviations between the measured and expected virus #2 haplotype frequencies (absolute value of the log<sub>2</sub> fold change) to assess the bias introduced during PCR of amplicons containing primer mismatches to virus #2 (*, Welch’s <italic>t</italic> test, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). Data shown as means and standard deviations. <bold>d</bold> We plotted the deviations from expected haplotype frequencies by the distance of mismatches from the 3′ end of the primer to investigate the impact of mismatch location. If more than one mismatch was present on a primer pair (orange), the data is shown using the closest mismatch to the 3′ end. Mismatches closer to the 3′ end of the primer are more likely decrease the accuracy of iSNV or haplotype measurements from that amplicon (correlation by Pearson <italic>r</italic>, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05).

      <p id="Par12">We amplified the Mix10% virus population (1000 RNA copies) independently three times and sequenced each replicate to a minimum coverage depth of 1000× using the Illumina MiSeq. We measured iSNV frequency at each site and calculated the mean iSNV frequency of all iSNVs within an amplicon to estimate the computed virus #2 haplotype frequency (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b). We found that iSNV frequencies measured from amplicons without primer mismatches were significantly closer to the expected value of 10% than amplicons with one or more mismatches in the primer regions (Welch’s <italic>t</italic> test, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05, Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>c). Moreover, we found that mismatches closer to the 3′ end of the primer were more likely to lead to inaccurate frequency measurements (Pearson <italic>r</italic>, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05, Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>d). Overall, our data demonstrate that the accuracy of intrahost virus diversity measures is highly impacted by primer mismatches during PCR. Thus, when iSNVs are detected from amplicons with mismatches in the primer binding sites, the resulting diversity data from those amplicons should be interpreted with caution.</p>

      <title>Removal of false positive intrahost variants with replicate sequencing</title>
      <p id="Par13">Measurements of virus intrahost genetic diversity are sensitive to PCR and sequencing errors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. These factors, combined with others such as virus concentration and sequencing coverage (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>), can lead to erroneous iSNV detection (i.e., false positives) and bias measures of genetic diversity. To improve accurate iSNV detection, we examined the distribution of false positive iSNV calls and investigated methods to remove them during analysis. We found that (1) the distribution of false positive iSNVs more closely matched the profile of sequencing errors than PCR errors and that (2) the majority of false iSNV &gt; 3% could be removed by replicate sequencing (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>).</p>
      <p id="Par14">To investigate false positive iSNV calls, we amplified our Mix10% virus population (1000 RNA copies) individually three times and sequenced each on the Illumina MiSeq. We limited our analysis to only those amplicons with perfect primer matches. Within these regions, we analyzed 54 sites with expected 10% iSNVs (true positives) and 4173 sites that were invariable in our mixed virus population. We considered any iSNVs detected &gt; 0.1% frequency at the invariable sites as false positives. We found that on average, 631 of the 4173 expected invariable sites (16%) had false positive iSNVs at a &gt; 0.1% frequency cutoff. We observed false positive iSNVs on every amplicon but found that they were unevenly distributed across the 250 nucleotide long Illumina reads (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a, b). Specifically, we found that virus genome sites covered by sequencing reads at positions &gt; 150 nucleotides had significantly more false positives (Wilcoxon test, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05; Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a insert) at significantly higher frequencies (Mann-Whitney test, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05; Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>b insert) than positions &lt; 150 nucleotides into the read. Our data therefore show that false positive iSNVs are not evenly distributed across the Illumina sequencing reads, and that the profiles are consistent with published Illumina error rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. We found that the occurrence and iSNV frequency of false positives, decreased during the last 50 nucleotides of the Illumina reads (positions 200–250, Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a, b), which is due to overlapping (not merged) reads during paired-end sequencing of 400 bp amplicons (data not shown).<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>False positive intrahost variants caused by sequencing errors can be removed by technical replicates and frequency cutoffs.

This left us with 61 true positive (10% frequency) iSNV sites and 3940 sites not expected to be variable to investigate false positives (&gt; 0.1% frequency). <bold>a</bold> The locations of false positives on the sequencing read position were mapped and shown as the distribution within 25 nt bins by percent of sites with false positive iSNV calls.

      <p id="Par15">Knowing the general distribution of false positive iSNVs, we sought to remove them post sequencing. Based on previous investigations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>], we proposed to remove false positive iSNVs by (1) amplifying and sequencing each sample as technical replicates (at least twice) and (2) only calling iSNVs detected in all replicates. Using our Mix10% virus population, we analyzed each replicate in isolation or in combination and calculated the mean iSNV frequencies (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>c). From individually sequenced replicates, we found 1–2 false positive iSNVs per sample were within the frequency distribution of our true iSNVs (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>c, panel “1 replicate”), demonstrating that a simple frequency cutoff will either leave false positive or remove true positive iSNVs. When considering replicates in combination, however, we found that the percent of sites with a false positive iSNV call (above 0.1%) dropped from ~ 16% (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>c “1 replicate”) to ~ 9% (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>c “2 replicates”). More importantly, we found that all of the false iSNVs that passed the duplicate filter had frequencies below the 3% limit of accurate iSNV measurements (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b). This allowed us to use a secondary frequency cutoff (3%) to remove the remainder of the false positives, while maintaining all of the true (10%) iSNVs. We found that the addition of a third technical replicate only resulted in a moderate reduction of sites with false iSNVs above 0.1% (9 to 6%) and did not help us to decrease the frequency cutoff filter (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>c “3 replicates”). Using pseudo replicates (i.e., using the same replicate more than once, instead of using technical replicates) to filter variants, we found that this did not lead to an improvement in eliminating false positives (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S1). This finding shows that the elimination of false positives when using technical replicates is not due to an apparent increase in sequencing coverage, but rather is due the independent nature of each replicate sequencing library. We conclude that PrimalSeq can be used for accurate iSNV detection above 3% when using at least two technical replicates.</p>

      <title>The accuracy of PrimalSeq is comparable to metagenomic sequencing</title>
      <p id="Par16">The gold standard for virus sequencing is untargeted metagenomics—sampling all RNA or DNA present in a sample [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Compared to amplicon-based sequencing, metagenomic sequencing uses random priming and does not select for specific RNA sequences and is thus less biased. In addition, for virus sequencing in resource-limited conditions, the Oxford Nanopore MinION is gaining popularity due to its portability and low instrument cost [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>], which is enabling real-time outbreak tracking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. To compare iSNV calling accuracy across platforms and methods, we evaluated iSNV measurements using either: (1) metagenomic Illumina sequencing, (2) PrimalSeq with Illumina sequencing, and (3) PrimalSeq with Oxford Nanopore sequencing. We found that PCR amplification leads to more variable true iSNV frequency measurements, but that the overall accuracy of PrimalSeq is comparable to metagenomic sequencing (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). PrimalSeq using Nanopore sequencing can be used to detect iSNVs, but, as expected, high error rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>] makes it difficult to differentiate between true and false iSNVs (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>).<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><p>PCR amplification prior to sequencing leads to similar overall measurements of genetic diversity. <bold>a</bold> We compared our PrimalSeq that enriches for specific virus sequences to the current ‘gold standard’ for measuring intrahost genetic diversity, metagenomics; and we compared sequencing the amplicons using the Illumina and Oxford Nanopore platforms.

      <p id="Par17">To compare PrimalSeq and metagenomic sequencing approaches, as well as platforms (Illumina or Nanopore), for iSNV measurement accuracy, we generated triplicate sequencing libraries from our Mix10% virus population (1000 RNA copies). The triplicate amplicon libraries were sequenced using both Illumina MiSeq and Oxford Nanopore MinION platforms, while the metagenomics libraries were sequenced using the MiSeq (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>a). We found that compared to metagenomic sequencing, mean true positive iSNV frequencies generated from PrimalSeq were not significantly different when using the Illumina platform (Welch’s <italic>t</italic> test, <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05; Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>b, c). The variances of individual iSNV frequencies, however, were significantly higher using PCR amplification (Levene’s test for variance, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05; Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>c). Compared to Illumina sequencing, the mean iSNV frequencies measured using the Oxford Nanopore MinION were not significantly different (Welch’s <italic>t</italic> test, <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05; Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>b, c), however, variances of individual iSNV frequencies were significantly higher using Nanopore (Levene’s test for variance, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05; Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>c). To determine the discriminatory power of calling true negative and false positive iSNVs, we analyzed iSNV frequencies &gt; 3% (cutoff determined in Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>c) from 4173 sites expected to be invariable (i.e., true negatives). The &gt; 3% false positives using PCR amplification (1–2 per replicate) were similar to metagenomics (1–3 per replicate) when the libraries were sequenced on the Illumina platform (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>b), and importantly, none of the same &gt; 3% false positives were found in multiple replicates (see also Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>c).

      <title>High intrahost variant false discovery rate using Oxford Nanopore sequencing</title>
      <p id="Par18">To further explore Oxford Nanopore sequencing for measuring intrahost virus diversity, we examined if we could (1) differentiate between mixed genotypes within a virus population and (2) computationally remove false positive iSNVs. Though the mean iSNV frequencies measured from Nanopore were not significantly different from Illumina (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>) and we could assign reads to the correct haplotype (i.e., virus #1 or #2), we found it difficult to differentiate between true and false positive iSNVs (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). For this evaluation, we used our Nanopore data generated from the Mix10% Zika virus population (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>a).</p>
      <p id="Par19">First, using a reference database containing virus #1 and #2, plus two divergent Zika viruses (French Polynesia, 2007; Uganda, 1947), we determined if we could differentiate between virus haplotypes in a mixed population. We found that 92.38% of the aligned reads mapped to virus #1 and 7.35% mapped to virus #2, the roughly expected 90%:10% proportions (0.27% of reads mapped erroneously to haplotypes not present in the mixture). Overall, the results indicate that nanopore sequencing reads are useful for identifying highly divergent haplotypes within a mixture—as might be expected for some co-infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]—despite a high error rate. This approach, however, will be less useful for detecting co-infections if the divergence between the haplotypes is small or the haplotypes are unknown.</p>
      <p id="Par20">To attempt to differentiate between true and false positive iSNVs, we limited our analysis to regions only covered by perfect primer matches and analyzed 54 true positive and 4173 true negative sites, as we did above for the Illumina data (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). We filtered the sequencing data using technical replicates and a 3% frequency cutoff, which we demonstrated above could be used to remove false iSNV calls in our Illumina data (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>c). Using these filters, we found that &gt; 17% of the 4173 invariant sites had false iSNV calls in the Nanopore data, even when including all three replicates (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>a). This is because the majority of the false positive iSNVs had measured frequencies as high, or higher, than the 10% true positives (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>c), leading to a &gt; 93% false discovery rate (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>a). To investigate if the false discovery rate could be reduced using additional data within the sequencing reads, we trained a logistic regression model incorporating iSNV frequency and strand bias [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>] as features, and the presence or absence of known iSNVs as the response variable (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>b). Based on this analysis, we found that using a frequency and strand bias filter resulted in a higher true or false iSNV discriminatory power, as shown by its greater area under the curve, than the two features independently (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>b). Using this filter for individual replicates, we were able to reduce the number of false positive iSNVs from ~ 900 to 1000 (3% cutoff) to ~ 50–70 (frequency + strand bias) and the false discovery rate from ~ 95 to ~ 55% (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>a). By including replicate sequencing (either 2 or 3), we could further reduce the false discovery rate to &lt; 40% (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>a). Despite this significant reduction, the remaining false positive iSNVs still had high frequencies in our dataset (~ 5–25%, Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>d). It should be noted that because we are comparing two divergent viruses, the false discovery rates will likely increase when sequencing virus populations with fewer true iSNVs; however, applying the frequency and strand bias filter will still provide higher true or false iSNV discriminatory power. These findings show that estimating intrahost virus genetic diversity using the Oxford Nanopore platform will require additional technological and computational innovations for anything other than simple scenarios of co-infections with diverse virus haplotypes.</p>

We programmed iVar in C++ with minimal dependencies, and created the following functions to accurately call intrahost variants and generate virus consensus genomes from sequencing data across multiple replicates: (1) trimming of primers and low-quality bases, (2) consensus calling of virus sequences, (3) intrahost variant calling of iSNVs, insertions, and deletions, followed by a filtering step that uses variants called across multiple replicates to exclude false positives, and (4) identification of mismatches in primer sequences and exclusion of the corresponding reads from alignment files. We also created two pipelines using iVar to call intrahost variants from samples with or without known reference sequences, and prepared with or without technical replicates (with no limit on the number of technical replicates). When using iVar in combination with PrimalSeq, from our empirically-derived data we found that the following guidelines produced robust and reproducible results: (1) only call intrahost variants detected in two or more technical replicates greater than 3% frequency (Figs. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a and <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>c) and (2) remove reads from amplicons with mismatched primers to normalize comparisons of intrahost populations (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>).</p>
      <p id="Par23">We incorporated several functions into iVar for accurate intrahost variant calling that are currently not available in other software packages (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). First, iVar removes primer sequences from aligned reads in an input BAM file, based on a BED file with primer positions. This allows iVar to accurately trim primer sequences irrespective of potential mismatches in the aligned region of the sequencing reads and primer sequences. Following the trimming of primer sequences, iVar uses a sliding window approach to remove low quality bases based on phred score thresholds that can be specified by the user. During the trimming process, iVar stores primer sequences that were trimmed off as auxiliary data for each read in each input BAM file. Second, for virus consensus sequence generation, iVar uses the output of mpileup taking into account ambiguous nucleotides and a minimum threshold for base coverage that can be specified by the user. Third, to detect iSNVs, deletions, and insertions, iVar uses the output of mpileup taking into account a minimum threshold for base quality and a minimum threshold for variant frequency. iVar then uses the intrahost variants called across multiple technical replicates to exclude variants that may have been introduced into individual replicates due to amplification, library preparation, and/or sequencing errors (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>c). Fourth, to identify primer sequences with mismatches, iVar calls variants on an alignment of primer sequences and identifies those with mismatches to the reference. Reads with auxiliary data that matches these identified primers are selectively removed from the alignment. This ensures that varying primer binding efficiency will not bias the frequency of the intrahost variants called with iVar (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Thus, iVar provides an inclusive software package that integrates a set of critical functions for accurate primer and quality trimming, consensus calling, and intrahost variant detection from data generated using amplicon-based sequencing, including PrimalSeq.</p>
      <p id="Par24">We benchmarked iVar against the pre-existing tools VarScan2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>], MAFFT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>], Geneious [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>], Trimmomatic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>], and cutadapt [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>] to validate the trimming, consensus sequence generation, and intrahost variant calling functions in iVar. We found that iVar performed as well as, or better than, each of these tools (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figures S4-S6). We used two simulated datasets and two clinical Zika virus samples sequenced using PrimalSeq to validate iSNV calling, and found an almost perfect correlation between iVar and VarScan2 (Spearman’s <italic>ρ</italic> = 1; Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S4). We also found zero nucleotide differences in the consensus sequences called using iVar and Geneious at all four thresholds (0%, 25%, 50%, and 90%) and across the four datasets (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S5). We found that iVar was better than cutadapt at trimming primer sequences in amplicon-based sequencing datasets (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S6). This is because iVar uses primer positions specified in a BED file to soft clip the primer regions after alignment, whereas cutadapt trims sequencing reads by comparing the primer nucleotide sequence with the nucleotides at the 5′ end of each read, before alignment. As a result, iVar was able to trim sequencing reads that might not start, or end, exactly at the beginning of the primer sequence (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S6). Since cutadapt uses the actual primer sequences, which are assumed to be anchored at the 5′ or 3′ end to do the trimming, it misses these cases. We trimmed the length of the longest primer sequence (22 bp) from the 5′ end of all the sequenced reads using the “HEADCROP” option in Trimmomatic. This approach, however, is crude and will result in a loss of 22 bp from the 5′ end of all sequenced reads (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S6). Thus, iVar contains functionality that is critical for performing primer and quality trimming, consensus calling, and variant calling from datasets generated using amplicon-based protocols.</p>

      <title>PrimalSeq and iVar can be used to measure intrahost virus genetic diversity from primary samples</title>
      <p id="Par25">There are many sequencing options available to measure intrahost virus diversity from cell culture stocks (e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]) or infected animals with high titers (e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]). These approaches, however, often do not generate sufficient data when there is high host background RNA, or low virus copies, as is the case for many viruses, including Zika, during human and primate infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Using our validated PrimalSeq and iVar framework (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>), and by using Primal Scheme to create a new multiplexed primer set to amplify West Nile virus, we thoroughly evaluated our approaches to measure intrahost diversity from 36 Zika virus and West Nile virus populations (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). These samples came from a variety of laboratory and field-derived sample types and were each amplified, sequenced, and analyzed in duplicate (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S2, Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). To account for the influence of virus concentration on our measures of genetic diversity (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>c), all Zika virus and West Nile virus samples were normalized at 1000 and 10,000 RNA copies, respectively. We omitted (i.e., “masked”) from comparative genomic analysis regions of the virus genomes with iSNV mismatches in the primer binding regions (~ 2 per sample) or with sequencing coverage depth &lt; 400× (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S2, Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>, gray bands).<fig id="Fig7"><label>Fig. 7</label><caption><p>PrimalSeq can be used to measure intrahost variants from a variety of sample types. <bold>a</bold> We sequenced technical duplicates of Zika virus populations (1000 virus RNA copies each) to identify intrahost single-nucleotide variants (iSNVs) &gt; 3% within each sample.

For the in vitro and in vivo samples, where the reference population sequence is known, the iSNV frequencies were calculated by change in frequency from pre- to post-infection.

<italic>Culex</italic> mosquitoes and dead American crows were collected from San Diego County, CA, during 2015 to sequence West Nile virus from field samples (10,000 virus RNA copies each). The iSNV frequencies from the field samples are the minor allele frequencies (maximum frequency = 0.5) because the reference virus sequence was not known. For both (<bold>a</bold> and <bold>b</bold>), analysis was limited to regions of the genome with &gt; 400× coverage depth in the protein coding sequence and we masked amplicons with primer mismatches from our analysis (gray regions) for direct comparisons of intrahost genetic diversity</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13059_2018_1618_Fig7_HTML" id="MO7"/></fig></p>
      <p id="Par26">To demonstrate the types of analyses that can be performed with PrimalSeq and iVar, we compared the mosquito- and vertebrate-derived virus samples using several measures of intrahost diversity (Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>). We measured genetic richness (the number of iSNV sites; Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>a), complexity (uncertainty associated with randomly sampling an allele; Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>b), and distance (the sum of all iSNV frequencies; Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>c) of iSNVs &gt; 3% frequency. We did not analyze masked regions, so that only high confidence regions of the genome from all samples within the experiment were compared (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). We found that Zika virus genetic complexity and distance was significantly higher from populations derived from primate (Hela) cells than <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> (Aag2) cells (Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>). In vivo, however, our findings were reversed. Zika virus genetic richness and complexity were significantly higher in <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> bodies than primate (rhesus macaque) plasma (Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>). Furthermore, we found that the distribution of iSNV frequencies of the Zika virus populations was similar across different in vivo infections (Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>d). This finding indicates that the increased Zika virus diversity in mosquitoes was driven by more 3–20% iSNVs that were also common in macaques, and not by a few additional high frequency iSNVs. We found that from both Zika and West Nile virus field samples, genetic diversity was not significantly different between virus populations isolated from their mosquito vectors (<italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> or <italic>Culex</italic>) or vertebrate hosts (humans or birds), though the mosquito samples were more variable (Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>). We also compared measuring intrahost virus genetic diversity using a 3% iSNV cutoff (Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>) to using a 5% iSNV cutoff (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S2) and found the results mostly comparable, though some of the vector-host comparisons were no longer significant. Overall, our data suggest that virus diversity is highly dependent on the experimental and biological systems, and future uses of PrimalSeq will help identify the mechanisms underlying these evolutionary differences (Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>e).<fig id="Fig8"><label>Fig. 8</label><caption><p>Intrahost virus genetic diversity is dependent on the experimental and biological system.

    <title>Discussion</title>
    <p id="Par27">Understanding how RNA viruses evolve within hosts can help lead to breakthroughs in medicine and biology. Rapid developments in sequencing technologies are facilitating more research into these areas, yet usage of unvalidated tools and systematic biases can dramatically limit the utility of the results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. To address these concerns, we developed PrimalSeq [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] and validated it across different platforms and sample types. In our development of iVar we show that PrimalSeq can be used to accurately measure intrahost virus diversity from different viruses and samples with amplicon-based sequencing. Based on our experimental validations, we provide a detailed laboratory protocol (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>), and suggest the following best practices for measuring intrahost virus diversity when using amplicon-based sequencing approaches:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par28">Start with at least 1000 RNA copies of the virus for the initial cDNA synthesis step.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par29">Prepare the RNA from virus populations for sequencing in duplicate.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par30">Sequence each library to a depth of at least 400× at each genome position using the Illumina platform.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par31">Only call iSNVs greater than 3% frequency that are detected in both replicates (a lower frequency may be achievable with higher RNA quantities).</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par32">For multi-sample comparisons of genetic diversity, omit genome regions amplified with primers that contain iSNVs within the binding sites.</p></list-item></list></p>
    <p id="Par33">Several factors can alter the accuracy of measuring intrahost virus diversity. In particular, we found that input virus concentrations, sequencing coverage depths, and primer mismatches can have profound effects on iSNV estimations. Using the recommendations above, however, we could consistently and accurately detect iSNVs at 3% frequency and higher. We predict that the lower limit of iSNV detection can be improved with a higher effective sampling depth (i.e., more input virus and deeper coverage) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p>
    <p id="Par34">Given no primer mismatches to the virus sequences, we found that measures of iSNVs frequencies from PrimalSeq were nearly as accurate as an untargeted metagenomics approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Because iVar remove the primer sequences from downstream analysis and use overlapping amplicons, frequency measures of iSNVs within the primer regions themselves are not skewed. Instead, iSNVs within primer regions can alter the measured frequencies of other iSNVs within that particular amplicon. In these cases, results should be interpreted with caution, and we incorporated a step in iVar to mask out such regions for comparative analyses. It is plausible that using primers with degenerate nucleotides at mismatched iSNV positions could help alleviating this bias [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>].</p>
    <p id="Par35">False iSNV calls significantly influence measurements of intrahost virus diversity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. We found that the positive association of false positive iSNVs with sequencing read lengths better fit the profiles of Illumina sequencing errors, rather than PCR errors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. In fact, we estimate that the Illumina MiSeq error rate (~ 0.9% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]) is ~ 60× greater than the error rates during PCR in our approach (~ 0.02% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]). Therefore, PrimalSeq likely does not add significantly more error, and by extension false iSNVs, than what was already inherent to the Illumina sequencing platform. Indeed, we found that PrimalSeq was comparable to PCR-free metagenomic sequencing in estimating intrahost virus diversity.</p>
    <p id="Par36">The ease and portability of Oxford Nanopore technologies, particularly the MinION, are revolutionizing the way we sequence viruses, including its use in near real-time outbreak tracking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Our data indicate, however, that the Nanopore platform is not yet adequate for detection of minor alleles and measures of intrahost diversity. While it may provide value in tracking frequency changes of known iSNVs over time, we found that the high error rates (10–15% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]) makes it difficult to differentiate between true and false iSNV calls. We found that stringent post-filtering, such as combining iSNV frequencies and strand bias across comparing replicate samples, significantly reduce false positive iSNV calls, but there is still a high false discovery rate. Effectively using Nanopore sequencing for intrahost virus diversity measurements will require higher sequencing accuracy and base calling, exploitation of co-occurring variants (i.e., haplotyping) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>], or utilization of different molecular approaches, including the 1D<sup>2</sup> method (where template and complementary strands of each fragment are sequenced) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>], tandem repeat consensus techniques [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>] or unique molecular identifiers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>].</p>
    <p id="Par37">For viruses that utilize multiple hosts, like mosquito-borne viruses, being able to compare results from many samples types is critically important. A lack of standardization, however, means that the field does not yet have a consensus to whether the mosquito vector or the vertebrate host contributes the most to virus genetic diversity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>]. The development of PrimalSeq and iVar allows for such measurements to be performed across diverse environments, sample types, and experimental designs. Using PrimalSeq, for example, we found that in vitro Zika virus diversity was significantly greater in human cells, when compared to mosquito cells. However, we found that these results were reversed during in vivo studies. Furthermore, we did not detect significant differences in field-collected mosquito and vertebrate samples for both Zika and West Nile virus. A caveat for the field samples, however, is that we do not know the reference sequence and cannot account for consensus-changing mutations introduced through intrahost bottlenecks and genetic drift [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>]. In addition, a limitation for all of our samples is that we can only compare diversity measurements from iSNVs greater than 3% frequency, and iSNVs below this threshold may be important for the virus population structure and phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>]. Even still, our incongruent results among experimental designs help to explain why there is still debate about the relative impact of vectors and hosts on virus evolution, and further use of PrimalSeq will help to resolve these issues.</p>

    <title>Conclusions</title>
    <p id="Par38">We demonstrate that PrimalSeq can accurately measure intrahost virus genetic diversity if properly validated. We benchmarked our highly multiplexed and streamlined amplicon-based sequencing method using a series of experiments with mixed virus populations, developed an all-inclusive computational analysis tool (iVar), and showcase its utility by measuring intrahost virus diversity from cells, mosquitoes, primates, birds, and humans.

Overall, our detailed laboratory and computational approaches presented here can reveal important insights about intrahost virus evolution directly from clinical or experimental samples in a way that is cheap, accurate, and scalable.</p>

      <p id="Par45">Zika virus RNA copies were quantified using a qRT-PCR assay targeting the NS5 protein coding region of the genome using the BioRad One-step qRT-PCR for probes kit. In a 20-μL reaction, 2 μL of virus RNA was added to 10 μL of iTaq universal probes reaction mix, 0.5 μL of iScript RT, 6 μL of nuclease-free water, 0.5 μL of the forward primer (5′-AGTGCCAGAGCTGTGTGTAC-3′; genome positions 9007–9027), 0.5 μL of the reverse primer (5′-TCTAGCCCCTAGCCACATCT-3′; genome positions 9097–9117), and 0.5 μL of the 6-FAM labeled probe (5′-GGCAGCCGCGCCATCTGGT-3′; genome positions 9078–9096). The reactions were then amplified on a thermocycler with the following conditions: 50 °C for 10 min, 95 °C for 3 min, and followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C for 10 s and 57 °C for 10 s (fluorescence read at the end of the 57 °C step). To calculate the number of virus template copies using standard curves, we include 10-fold dilutions of partial Zika virus RNA genomes spanning the primer sites (10<sup>7</sup> to 10<sup>0</sup> copies per reaction). The Zika virus RNA standards were constructed by PCR amplifying a 848 bp segment of the Zika virus NS5 protein coding region (genome positions 8644 to 9492) with the following primers: forward containing a T7 promoter region (5′-TAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGATCAGGCTCCTGTCAAAACCC-3′; underlined = T7 promoter sequence; genome positions 8644–8664) and reverse primer (5′-AGTGACAACTTGTCCGCTCC-3′; genome positions 9472–9492). The amplified cDNA was converted into RNA to be used as standards using the Invitrogen MEGAscript T7 Transcription Kit.</p>
      <p id="Par46">The accuracy of measuring virus RNA copies by targeting one small genome region, in this case positions 9007–9117, is dependent on relatively equal proportions of the virus genome present in the sample. To address this, we used untargeted metagenomic sequencing of our 1000 RNA copy stocks of virus #1, virus #2, and three replicates of the Mix10% population. The normalized coverage shows that depth is consistent across the virus genome (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S3). The normalized coverage changes are consistent among virus samples and replicates, suggesting that coverage depth is more dependent on intrinsic factors of the virus genome influence replication efficiency (i.e., GC content [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>]) rather than significant RNA degradation leading to the loss of a fraction of the virus genome. Hence, we are confident that our qRT-PCR results are relatively informative for determining the virus RNA copy numbers across the whole genome.</p>
      <p id="Par47">For all Zika virus samples, 1000 virus RNA copies were used for sequencing, unless otherwise specified (e.g., Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>c). For all West Nile virus sample, 10,000 virus RNA copies were used. Normalizing input copy numbers allowed us to more accurately compare sequencing results.</p>

The cDNA was purified by Agencourt AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter) prior to library preparation using Nextera XT (Illumina) following the vendor’s protocols, but with less reagents.

After incubation, the reaction was stopped using 2.5 μL of Neutralize Tagment Buffer (one half recommended). The libraries were indexed and amplified using one half of the Nextera PCR reagents and primers in a 25-μL reaction. Agencourt AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter) were used for the final purification step (purified twice at a ratio of 0.7:1 beads to sample).

      <title>Illumina data processing and variant calling using iVar</title>
      <p id="Par51">We developed an open source software package to process virus sequencing data and call iSNVs from technical replicates, iVar (intrahost variant analysis from replicates), and detailed documentation can be found at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/andersen-lab/ivar">github.com/andersen-lab/ivar</ext-link> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>]. The tool is licensed under GNU General Public License v3.0 and the source code is available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/andersen-lab/ivar">github.com/andersen-lab/ivar</ext-link> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>]. The version of the code used in this paper is available at 10.5281/zenodo.2471612. A list of iVar commands and their brief descriptions are provided in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S5, and additional details about the options are available in the documentation and can also be accessed in the help menu distributed with the tool [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>]. iVar was used to write two pipelines for calling iSNVs from samples with or without the known reference sequence (i.e., experimental and field-collected samples, respectively; Fig. <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9</xref>). The software package was written in C++ and has two dependencies—HTSlib (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/samtools/htslib">github.com/samtools/htslib</ext-link>) and Awk (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~bwk/btl.mirror/">cs.princeton.edu/~bwk/btl.mirror/</ext-link>). Awk is generally available on most unix based operating systems and HTSlib has only one dependency—zlib (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://zlib.net/">zlib.net/</ext-link>). The output of `mpileup` command from the widely used SAMtools [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>] was used by the package to call iSNVs and generate a consensus sequence from an alignment. The computational pipeline was divided in four main sections: (1) alignment, (2) trimming, (3) constructing nucleotide matrices and scan for iSNVs within primer regions, and (4) statistical comparisons between replicate datasets. The paired-end reads were aligned to a provided reference genome using BWA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>]. The paired-end reads were not merged at any point in this process. The primer sequences were trimmed from the reads using a BED file, with the primer positions, followed by quality trimming. iSNVs above the frequency cutoff of 3% were then called using the `mpileup` command from SAMtools (maximum coverage depth cutoff was set to 0[“-d 0”], making the limit on depth the maximum limit of an signed 32 bit integer (i.e., 2,147,483,647). In addition to the frequency threshold, Fisher’s exact test was used to determine if the frequency of the iSNV is significantly higher than the mean error rate at that position (see contingency table, Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S6). Based on the iSNVs called, mismatches in the primer sequences were identified and the reads from the amplicon were removed. The variant calling step were repeated to remove any influence of the primer mismatch on iSNV frequencies.<fig id="Fig9"><label>Fig. 9</label><caption><p>Overview of iVar pipeline. iVar was used to construct two pipelines for calling intrahost single-nucleotide variants (iSNVs) from samples with and without a known reference sequence. The nodes in the chart are colored based on the usage of iVar, bwa, and SAMtools at each step. For samples with a known reference sequence, the primer sequences are trimmed from the sequenced reads, followed by quality trimming. A consensus sequence for the sample is called by merging the aligned BAM files from each replicate. The primer sequences are then aligned to this consensus sequence and mismatches are identified by iVar after performing variant calling on the aligned primers. The reads corresponding to the mismatched primers are removed from the aligned BAM file of each replicate to ensure that any bias introduced in the iSNV frequencies is removed. The iSNVs are then called for each replicate, individually, with a minimum frequency threshold of 3% and an intersection of the iSNVs across all the replicates are considered to be the “true” iSNVs. For samples with an unknown reference sequence, the iSNVs cannot be called directly using a reference sequence. In this case, after generating the consensus sequence, reads from each replicate are aligned back to this consensus sequence and these realigned BAM files are used for the same subsequent steps as in the case of samples with a known reference sequence</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13059_2018_1618_Fig9_HTML" id="MO9"/></fig></p>

      <title>Validation of iVar</title>
      <p id="Par52">iVar was validated against existing tools. (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S7, Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S4-S6). We validated iSNV calling in iVar against the `mpileup2snp` and `mpileup2indel` commands in VarScan2 (v2.3.9) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>] using four datasets—two simulated datasets and two clinical Zika virus samples, sequenced using PrimalSeq. We ran both tools with no thresholds and with a quality threshold of 20 and a minimum frequency threshold of 3%. We validated the consensus calling in iVar against the consensus calling available in Geneious (v11.1.4) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>] using four datasets—two simulated datasets and two clinical Zika virus samples, sequenced using PrimalSeq. We did the consensus calling at four different thresholds—0% (majority), 25%, 50% (strict), and 90%. We counted the mismatches between the resulting consensus sequences from iVar, Geneious and the reference sequence by performing a multiple sequence alignment using MAFFT (v7.388) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. While counting mismatches, we ignored mismatches when one sequence had a gap and the other had a “N,” since in either case. We validated primer trimming and quality trimming in iVar against anchored adapter trimming in cutadapt (v1.16) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>] and against Trimmomatic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. iVar uses a sliding window starting from the 5′ end and checks if the average quality within the window drops below the threshold. As soon as the quality drops below the threshold, it trims the sequence by soft clipping the read. This is different from the algorithm cutadapt uses to do quality trimming, but is similar to the sliding window approach used by Trimmomatic.

      <title>Oxford Nanopore sequencing and analysis</title>
      <p id="Par53">Using the same PCR amplicons used for amplicon-based Illumina sequencing, we sequenced three replicates of the mixed Zika virus population (90% virus #1, 10% virus #2) using the Oxford Nanopore GridION sequencer. Native, 1D barcode libraries (SQK-NSK007, Oxford Nanopore Technologies, UK) were prepared according to previously published methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], with three amplification replicates corresponding to barcodes 1, 2 and 3. The pooled sequencing library was sequenced on an R9.4 version flowcell (FLO-MIN106, Oxford Nanopore Technologies, UK). Reads were basecalled using Albacore 2.3.1 using the command-line read_fast5_basecaller.py -c r94_450bps_linear.cfg -i fast5 -o fastq -r -t 12. Reads were subsequently demultiplexed with Porechop 0.2.3_seqan2.1.1 using default (lenient) settings (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/rrwick/Porechop">github.com/rrwick/Porechop</ext-link>). A total of 2.4 million reads were generated which after alignment and trimming covered 95.66% of the reference genome (Genbank KX087101). For the purposes of assigning to genotypes (i.e., unique virus haplotypes), reads were assigned to individual strains using BWA-MEM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>] against a custom reference database comprising four Zika virus genomes: Genbank KX087101 (virus #1), KU955593 (virus #2), EU545988 (an Asian lineage virus isolated in 2007) and NC_012532 (MR766, an African lineage virus). Counts for each assignment were retrieved, ignoring multi-mapping reads using the shell command bwa mem -x ont2d | samtools view -h -F 256 - | samtools view -h -F 2048 - | cut -f 3 | sort | uniq -c. Next, each replicate was aligned to the PRVACB59 reference genome with BWA-MEM using setting -x ont2d. Primer binding sites and any residual adaptor sequence were masked in the resulting BAM alignment using the align_trim script from the Zibra pipeline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Allele frequencies and putative iSNVs (ignoring insertions or deletions) were extracted from BAM files using a Python script freqs.py (included in the accompanying code repository: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/nickloman/zika-isnv">github.com/nickloman/zika-isnv</ext-link> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref>]). This script utilizes the pileup functionality of samtools via the pysam Python interface module (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/pysam-developers/pysam">github.com/pysam-developers/pysam</ext-link>). Only predicted variants with more than 10 supporting forward and 10 supporting reverse reads were considered. The logistic regression model was trained and tested under a 10-fold cross validation scheme using the train function with the parameters method = “glm” and family = “binomial” from the caret (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/topepo/caret/">github.com/topepo/caret/</ext-link>) library in R.

For the Zika and West Nile virus field samples, where the ancestral virus sequence was not known, the derived iSNV frequencies were used for the population genetic analysis. Richness was calculated by the total number of iSNV sites per population (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>a).

      <title>Ethics approval and consent to participate</title>
      <p>Research on human subjects was conducted in compliance with existing regulations relating to the protection of human subjects and was evaluated and approved (#IRB-15-6664) by the Institutional Review Board/Ethics Review Committee at The Scripps Research Institute. Clinical samples were obtained from the Florida Department of Health (DOH) and Antibody Systems Inc. Samples collected in Florida were collected under a waiver of consent granted by the Florida DOH Human Research Protection Program. The work received a non-human subjects research designation (category 4 exemption) by the Florida DOH since this research was performed with leftover clinical diagnostic samples involving no more than minimal risk. Hence, written informed consent was not obtained. All samples were de-identified prior to receipt by the study investigators. The experimental methods used comply with the Helsinki Declaration.</p>
      <p>Research involving Indian origin rhesus macaques was conducted at the California National Primate Research Center, and experimental infections of mice upon which <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> mosquitoes fed were performed at the University of California, Davis, School of Veterinary Medicine. Both institutes are fully accredited by the Association for the Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International. Animals were cared for in accordance with the National Research Council Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and the Animal Welfare Act. Animal experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of UC Davis (protocols #19211 and #19695 for rhesus macaques, protocol #19404 for mice). All macaques samples used in this study were from approved studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>]; and none were generated specifically for this work.</p>

    <title>Background</title>
    <p id="Par2">RNA viruses, including HIV, influenza, West Nile, and Zika, pose significant threats to public health worldwide. Part of this burden stems from their ability to rapidly evolve within hosts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Generation of intrahost genetic diversity allows virus populations to evade host immune responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], alter the severity of disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], and adapt to changing environments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Studying virus populations, both within naturally infected hosts and during experimental evolution, can therefore lead to breakthroughs in our understanding of virus-host interactions and novel approaches for outbreak response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p>
    <p id="Par3">In many cases, however, accurately measuring intrahost RNA virus diversity using deep sequencing remains a significant challenge. Multiple factors, such as virus titer, sample preparation, sequencing errors, and computational inferences, can bias measures of genetic diversity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Moreover, for many clinical samples, low ratios of viral to host RNA often necessitate enrichment of viral nucleic acid to recover sufficient templates for deep sequencing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. This is especially true for Zika virus, where low viremias (&lt; 1000 copies/μL of RNA) are often detected during natural and experimental infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. PCR amplification of virus nucleic acid is a common approach to overcome this challenge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], although it can introduce biases by altering the composition of intrahost genetic variants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Therefore, to ensure accuracy, comprehensive validation of deep sequencing approaches should accompany diversity measures from biological samples.</p>
    <p id="Par4">We previously developed a multiplex primer design tool (“Primal Scheme”) coupled to a laboratory protocol (“PrimalSeq”) to sequence RNA viruses directly from clinical samples in a way that is cheap, accurate, and scalable under resource-limited conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Versions of PrimalSeq have been used to sequence the majority of Zika virus genomes from the epidemic in the Americas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], yellow fever virus in Brazil [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], and West Nile virus in the USA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. PrimalSeq has also been used to characterize Zika virus during infection of non-human primates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. While PrimalSeq was shown to be superior to other methods for obtaining consensus sequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], it has yet to be validated for measuring intrahost diversity.</p>
    <p id="Par5">In this study, we benchmarked PrimalSeq for sequencing diverse virus populations, highlighting its limitations and providing recommendations for accurately measuring intrahost single-nucleotide variants (iSNVs) from both Illumina and Oxford Nanopore data. We used these results to develop comprehensive laboratory protocols and a computational tool (iVar), and further tested PrimalSeq to characterize Zika virus populations generated from cell culture, mosquito, non-human primate, and human clinical samples. We demonstrate the utility of PrimalSeq for other viruses by designing an amplicon scheme for West Nile virus and measuring genetic diversity from field-collected mosquitoes and birds. Our data show that virus diversity can be significantly impacted by the experimental and biological systems, and we provide a framework to uncover the underlying mechanisms. PrimalSeq and iVar provide a scalable platform for viruses other than Zika and West Nile that can be applied to discover ecological, epidemiological, and immunological drivers of virus evolution in a variety of systems.</p>

      <title>Virus concentration and sequencing depth impact intrahost variant calling</title>
      <p id="Par6">We previously developed Primal Scheme (Quick et al.; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://primal.zibraproject.org/">primal.zibraproject.org</ext-link>), a multiplex primer design tool for amplicon-based sequencing of RNA virus genomes directly from clinical samples [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Our Zika virus PrimalSeq protocol generates 35 overlapping amplicons of ~ 400 base pairs from two multiplexed PCR reactions, an approach similar to “RNA jackhammering,” which was developed to sequence HIV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. The process of PCR amplification to generate sufficient templates for high-throughput sequencing, however, may bias the measurements of intrahost virus diversity through differential amplification efficiencies for divergent virus haplotypes present in a population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>].</p>
      <p id="Par7">Given the potential biases that may be introduced during PCR amplification, we sought to assess the accuracy of PrimalSeq for iSNV detection. Through a series of experiments, we determined that at least 1000 RNA virus copies are needed to detect iSNVs at greater than 3% frequency, when sequenced to a coverage depth of at least 400× (i.e., the number of sequenced nucleotides per targeted genome position, Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). To set up these experiments, we created genetically diverse Zika virus populations by mixing two divergent virus strains: Zika virus #1 isolated from Puerto Rico in 2015 (Genbank KX087101) and virus #2 isolated from Cambodia in 2010 (Genbank KU955593). Using gold-standard untargeted metagenomic sequencing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>], we determined that there were 159 fixed consensus sequence differences between the viruses located throughout the 10,807 nucleotide genome of virus #1 and #2 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Measurement intrahost variant frequencies are more accurate at high frequencies and are susceptible to input concentrations and coverage depths. <bold>a</bold> We created genetically diverse virus populations by mixing two Zika virus isolates with 159 consensus nucleotide differences to test the effects of PCR amplification prior to sequencing to measure intrahost single-nucleotide variant (iSNV) frequencies. For these initial experiments, we amplified three ~ 400 bp regions of the Zika virus genome using primers without any mismatches to either of the mixed virus (shown as amplicons 5, 24, and 33). "Amplicon 5" contains 5 iSNV sites, "amplicon 24" contains 8 iSNV sites, and "amplicon 33" contains 5 iSNV sites. <bold>b</bold> We created virus populations containing 50%, 25%, 14%, 7%, 3%, 1.5%, and 0.8% virus #2 to test the impact of PCR amplification prior to sequencing on measuring ranges of iSNV frequencies. The data points represent individual iSNVs amplified and sequenced in triplicate from each population (colored by amplicon 5, 24, or 33 as shown in <bold>a</bold>. <bold>c</bold> We 10-fold serially diluted a mixed population containing 14% of virus #2 (expected, dotted line) from 100,000 to 10 copies to test the effects of input concentrations on accurate iSNV measurements. <bold>d</bold> We randomly downsampled the datasets generated from 1000 input virus RNA copies containing 3% virus #2 to set coverage depths (sequenced nucleotides [nt] per genome position) to determine the minimum coverage needed to yield accurate iSNV measurements. For <bold>c</bold> and <bold>d</bold>, the Levene’s test was used to assess equality among variances of iSNV measurements from each coverage depth (ns, not significant; *, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). Data shown as means with standard deviations</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13059_2018_1618_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p>
      <p id="Par8">For our initial evaluation, we selected three of the 35 Zika virus primer sets that flanked at least five variable genome positions (amplicons 5, 24, and 33). We then made two sets of mixed virus populations: (1) altering the ratios of mixed viruses, while keeping the overall input concentration constant at 1000 virus RNA copies (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b) and (2) maintaining a constant ratio of 14% of virus #2 while altering the input concentrations of virus RNA used for cDNA synthesis (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>c). For each test, we measured the frequencies of the 18 iSNVs between virus #1 and #2 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a). We generated the amplicons independently three times and sequenced each using the Illumina MiSeq platform (“technical replicates”).</p>
      <p id="Par9">We found that the measured mean iSNV frequencies were accurate from populations containing 50%, 25%, 14%, 7%, and 3% of virus #2 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b). At 1.5% of virus #2, the standard deviation of our measured mean iSNV frequency (0.2–1.2%) fell below the expected frequency, indicating that we could not measure the true iSNV frequency at that dilution (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b). This demonstrates that the lower limit of accurate iSNV detection for PrimalSeq in this scenario is between 1.5 and 3%. When we altered input concentrations of a population containing 14% virus #2 from 100,000 to 10 virus RNA copies (10-fold serial dilutions), we found that the variances of measured frequencies became significantly higher from concentrations containing 100 or less copies (Levene’s test for variance, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05; Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>c). Therefore, input virus concentrations can dramatically alter iSNV detection, as others have also discovered [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. We conclude that a minimum of 1000 virus RNA copies should be used with PrimalSeq to accurately measure iSNVs greater than 3% frequency.</p>
      <p id="Par10">Sequencing coverage depth is another important factor for iSNV detection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], so we sought to define the level of sequencing coverage needed to accurately measure iSNVs. From our samples containing 1000 virus RNA copies with 97% virus #1 and 3% virus #2, we sequenced the targeted genome regions in triplicates to a coverage depth of ~ 3000×. We randomly downsampled these datasets to generate coverage depths of 1000, 600, 400, 200, 100, and 50× (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>d). We found that the variances of iSNV frequencies became significantly higher from coverage depths lower than 400× (i.e., at 200, 100, and 50×; Levene’s test for variance, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05; Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>d). Thus, we conclude that a minimum sequencing coverage depth of 400× is required to maintain iSNV measurement accuracy at the lower limit of frequency detection (3%) and input concentration (1000 virus RNA copies).</p>

    <sec id="Sec4">
      <title>Primer mismatches impact intrahost variant frequency measurements</title>
      <p id="Par11">A concern for using PCR-based sequencing protocols for measuring intrahost virus diversity is the potential for primer mismatches to alter PCR efficiency that can bias iSNV frequency measurements. Indeed, we found that primer mismatches, especially those close to the 3′ end, can alter iSNV frequencies in the generated amplicons (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). To make this assessment, we used (1) our Zika virus PrimalSeq strategy and (2) a mix containing 90% of virus #1 and 10% of virus #2 (“Mix10%”). Of the 159 consensus nucleotide differences between virus #1 and #2, 24 resulted in mismatches within the primer regions of 20 of the oligos used to generate 18 of the 35 PCR amplicons (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a, Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S1). In addition, at least one nucleotide difference occurred within each of the 18 amplicons (outside of the primer-binding region), which allowed us to assess the influence of primer mismatches on iSNV frequency measurements across the Zika virus genome.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Measures of intrahost variant frequencies are sensitive to primer mismatches. <bold>a</bold> To assess the impacts of primer mismatches on accurately measuring intrahost single-nucleotide variants (iSNVs), we sequenced a mixed Zika virus population using 35 overlapping PCR amplicons (see “Amplicon scheme” above panel). The virus population contained 10% virus #2 (Expected) and 1000 virus RNA copies were amplified and sequenced in triplicate. The amplicons and iSNVs are colored according to the number of mismatches in the primer sequences used to generate that amplicon. Data shown as means and ranges. <bold>b</bold> To account for unequal iSNV sites within each amplicon, the iSNV frequencies on each amplicon were averaged to produce a haplotype frequency for virus #2 mixed at 10% (Expected). Data shown as means and ranges. <bold>c</bold> We calculated the deviations between the measured and expected virus #2 haplotype frequencies (absolute value of the log<sub>2</sub> fold change) to assess the bias introduced during PCR of amplicons containing primer mismatches to virus #2 (*, Welch’s <italic>t</italic> test, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). Data shown as means and standard deviations. <bold>d</bold> We plotted the deviations from expected haplotype frequencies by the distance of mismatches from the 3′ end of the primer to investigate the impact of mismatch location. If more than one mismatch was present on a primer pair (orange), the data is shown using the closest mismatch to the 3′ end. Mismatches closer to the 3′ end of the primer are more likely decrease the accuracy of iSNV or haplotype measurements from that amplicon (correlation by Pearson <italic>r</italic>, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). Data shown as the mean from all three replicates</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13059_2018_1618_Fig2_HTML" id="MO2"/></fig></p>
      <p id="Par12">We amplified the Mix10% virus population (1000 RNA copies) independently three times and sequenced each replicate to a minimum coverage depth of 1000× using the Illumina MiSeq. We measured iSNV frequency at each site and calculated the mean iSNV frequency of all iSNVs within an amplicon to estimate the computed virus #2 haplotype frequency (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b). We found that iSNV frequencies measured from amplicons without primer mismatches were significantly closer to the expected value of 10% than amplicons with one or more mismatches in the primer regions (Welch’s <italic>t</italic> test, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05, Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>c). Moreover, we found that mismatches closer to the 3′ end of the primer were more likely to lead to inaccurate frequency measurements (Pearson <italic>r</italic>, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05, Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>d). Overall, our data demonstrate that the accuracy of intrahost virus diversity measures is highly impacted by primer mismatches during PCR. Thus, when iSNVs are detected from amplicons with mismatches in the primer binding sites, the resulting diversity data from those amplicons should be interpreted with caution.</p>

      <title>Removal of false positive intrahost variants with replicate sequencing</title>
      <p id="Par13">Measurements of virus intrahost genetic diversity are sensitive to PCR and sequencing errors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. These factors, combined with others such as virus concentration and sequencing coverage (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>), can lead to erroneous iSNV detection (i.e., false positives) and bias measures of genetic diversity. To improve accurate iSNV detection, we examined the distribution of false positive iSNV calls and investigated methods to remove them during analysis. We found that (1) the distribution of false positive iSNVs more closely matched the profile of sequencing errors than PCR errors and that (2) the majority of false iSNV &gt; 3% could be removed by replicate sequencing (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>).</p>
      <p id="Par14">To investigate false positive iSNV calls, we amplified our Mix10% virus population (1000 RNA copies) individually three times and sequenced each on the Illumina MiSeq. We limited our analysis to only those amplicons with perfect primer matches. Within these regions, we analyzed 54 sites with expected 10% iSNVs (true positives) and 4173 sites that were invariable in our mixed virus population. We considered any iSNVs detected &gt; 0.1% frequency at the invariable sites as false positives. We found that on average, 631 of the 4173 expected invariable sites (16%) had false positive iSNVs at a &gt; 0.1% frequency cutoff. We observed false positive iSNVs on every amplicon but found that they were unevenly distributed across the 250 nucleotide long Illumina reads (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a, b). Specifically, we found that virus genome sites covered by sequencing reads at positions &gt; 150 nucleotides had significantly more false positives (Wilcoxon test, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05; Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a insert) at significantly higher frequencies (Mann-Whitney test, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05; Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>b insert) than positions &lt; 150 nucleotides into the read. Our data therefore show that false positive iSNVs are not evenly distributed across the Illumina sequencing reads, and that the profiles are consistent with published Illumina error rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. We found that the occurrence and iSNV frequency of false positives, decreased during the last 50 nucleotides of the Illumina reads (positions 200–250, Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a, b), which is due to overlapping (not merged) reads during paired-end sequencing of 400 bp amplicons (data not shown).<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>False positive intrahost variants caused by sequencing errors can be removed by technical replicates and frequency cutoffs. We sequenced mixed Zika virus population containing 10% of virus #2 in triplicate, limited our analysis to the regions only covered by perfect PCR primer matches, and removed sites with intrahost single-nucleotide variant (iSNV) detected at &gt; 1% frequency in either of the Zika virus isolates. This left us with 61 true positive (10% frequency) iSNV sites and 3940 sites not expected to be variable to investigate false positives (&gt; 0.1% frequency). <bold>a</bold> The locations of false positives on the sequencing read position were mapped and shown as the distribution within 25 nt bins by percent of sites with false positive iSNV calls. Each color represents data from an independent replicate.

      <p id="Par15">Knowing the general distribution of false positive iSNVs, we sought to remove them post sequencing. Based on previous investigations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>], we proposed to remove false positive iSNVs by (1) amplifying and sequencing each sample as technical replicates (at least twice) and (2) only calling iSNVs detected in all replicates. Using our Mix10% virus population, we analyzed each replicate in isolation or in combination and calculated the mean iSNV frequencies (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>c). From individually sequenced replicates, we found 1–2 false positive iSNVs per sample were within the frequency distribution of our true iSNVs (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>c, panel “1 replicate”), demonstrating that a simple frequency cutoff will either leave false positive or remove true positive iSNVs. When considering replicates in combination, however, we found that the percent of sites with a false positive iSNV call (above 0.1%) dropped from ~ 16% (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>c “1 replicate”) to ~ 9% (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>c “2 replicates”). More importantly, we found that all of the false iSNVs that passed the duplicate filter had frequencies below the 3% limit of accurate iSNV measurements (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b). This allowed us to use a secondary frequency cutoff (3%) to remove the remainder of the false positives, while maintaining all of the true (10%) iSNVs. We found that the addition of a third technical replicate only resulted in a moderate reduction of sites with false iSNVs above 0.1% (9 to 6%) and did not help us to decrease the frequency cutoff filter (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>c “3 replicates”). Using pseudo replicates (i.e., using the same replicate more than once, instead of using technical replicates) to filter variants, we found that this did not lead to an improvement in eliminating false positives (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S1). This finding shows that the elimination of false positives when using technical replicates is not due to an apparent increase in sequencing coverage, but rather is due the independent nature of each replicate sequencing library. We conclude that PrimalSeq can be used for accurate iSNV detection above 3% when using at least two technical replicates.</p>

      <title>The accuracy of PrimalSeq is comparable to metagenomic sequencing</title>
      <p id="Par16">The gold standard for virus sequencing is untargeted metagenomics—sampling all RNA or DNA present in a sample [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Compared to amplicon-based sequencing, metagenomic sequencing uses random priming and does not select for specific RNA sequences and is thus less biased. In addition, for virus sequencing in resource-limited conditions, the Oxford Nanopore MinION is gaining popularity due to its portability and low instrument cost [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>], which is enabling real-time outbreak tracking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. To compare iSNV calling accuracy across platforms and methods, we evaluated iSNV measurements using either: (1) metagenomic Illumina sequencing, (2) PrimalSeq with Illumina sequencing, and (3) PrimalSeq with Oxford Nanopore sequencing. We found that PCR amplification leads to more variable true iSNV frequency measurements, but that the overall accuracy of PrimalSeq is comparable to metagenomic sequencing (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). PrimalSeq using Nanopore sequencing can be used to detect iSNVs, but, as expected, high error rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>] makes it difficult to differentiate between true and false iSNVs (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>).<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><p>PCR amplification prior to sequencing leads to similar overall measurements of genetic diversity. <bold>a</bold> We compared our PrimalSeq that enriches for specific virus sequences to the current ‘gold standard’ for measuring intrahost genetic diversity, metagenomics; and we compared sequencing the amplicons using the Illumina and Oxford Nanopore platforms.

      <p id="Par17">To compare PrimalSeq and metagenomic sequencing approaches, as well as platforms (Illumina or Nanopore), for iSNV measurement accuracy, we generated triplicate sequencing libraries from our Mix10% virus population (1000 RNA copies). The triplicate amplicon libraries were sequenced using both Illumina MiSeq and Oxford Nanopore MinION platforms, while the metagenomics libraries were sequenced using the MiSeq (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>a). We found that compared to metagenomic sequencing, mean true positive iSNV frequencies generated from PrimalSeq were not significantly different when using the Illumina platform (Welch’s <italic>t</italic> test, <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05; Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>b, c). The variances of individual iSNV frequencies, however, were significantly higher using PCR amplification (Levene’s test for variance, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05; Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>c). Compared to Illumina sequencing, the mean iSNV frequencies measured using the Oxford Nanopore MinION were not significantly different (Welch’s <italic>t</italic> test, <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05; Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>b, c), however, variances of individual iSNV frequencies were significantly higher using Nanopore (Levene’s test for variance, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05; Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>c). To determine the discriminatory power of calling true negative and false positive iSNVs, we analyzed iSNV frequencies &gt; 3% (cutoff determined in Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>c) from 4173 sites expected to be invariable (i.e., true negatives). The &gt; 3% false positives using PCR amplification (1–2 per replicate) were similar to metagenomics (1–3 per replicate) when the libraries were sequenced on the Illumina platform (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>b), and importantly, none of the same &gt; 3% false positives were found in multiple replicates (see also Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>c). More than 700 false positive iSNVs &gt; 3%, however, were detected in each PCR amplified library sequenced on the Nanopore platform (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>d). These findings show that while PCR amplification leads to more variable results for individual iSNVs, the overall measured diversity and false positive rates are comparable to metagenomic sequencing. Furthermore, we show that iSNV frequencies become even more variable when sequencing using the Oxford Nanopore platform, which is consistent with its higher error rate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>].<fig id="Fig5"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption><p>High false discovery rates of intrahost variants using Nanopore sequencing. <bold>a</bold> iSNV false discovery rates (FDR) from Oxford Nanopore sequencing data.

      <title>High intrahost variant false discovery rate using Oxford Nanopore sequencing</title>
      <p id="Par18">To further explore Oxford Nanopore sequencing for measuring intrahost virus diversity, we examined if we could (1) differentiate between mixed genotypes within a virus population and (2) computationally remove false positive iSNVs. Though the mean iSNV frequencies measured from Nanopore were not significantly different from Illumina (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>) and we could assign reads to the correct haplotype (i.e., virus #1 or #2), we found it difficult to differentiate between true and false positive iSNVs (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). For this evaluation, we used our Nanopore data generated from the Mix10% Zika virus population (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>a).</p>
      <p id="Par19">First, using a reference database containing virus #1 and #2, plus two divergent Zika viruses (French Polynesia, 2007; Uganda, 1947), we determined if we could differentiate between virus haplotypes in a mixed population. We found that 92.38% of the aligned reads mapped to virus #1 and 7.35% mapped to virus #2, the roughly expected 90%:10% proportions (0.27% of reads mapped erroneously to haplotypes not present in the mixture). Overall, the results indicate that nanopore sequencing reads are useful for identifying highly divergent haplotypes within a mixture—as might be expected for some co-infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]—despite a high error rate. This approach, however, will be less useful for detecting co-infections if the divergence between the haplotypes is small or the haplotypes are unknown.</p>
      <p id="Par20">To attempt to differentiate between true and false positive iSNVs, we limited our analysis to regions only covered by perfect primer matches and analyzed 54 true positive and 4173 true negative sites, as we did above for the Illumina data (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). We filtered the sequencing data using technical replicates and a 3% frequency cutoff, which we demonstrated above could be used to remove false iSNV calls in our Illumina data (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>c). Using these filters, we found that &gt; 17% of the 4173 invariant sites had false iSNV calls in the Nanopore data, even when including all three replicates (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>a). This is because the majority of the false positive iSNVs had measured frequencies as high, or higher, than the 10% true positives (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>c), leading to a &gt; 93% false discovery rate (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>a). To investigate if the false discovery rate could be reduced using additional data within the sequencing reads, we trained a logistic regression model incorporating iSNV frequency and strand bias [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>] as features, and the presence or absence of known iSNVs as the response variable (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>b). Based on this analysis, we found that using a frequency and strand bias filter resulted in a higher true or false iSNV discriminatory power, as shown by its greater area under the curve, than the two features independently (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>b). Using this filter for individual replicates, we were able to reduce the number of false positive iSNVs from ~ 900 to 1000 (3% cutoff) to ~ 50–70 (frequency + strand bias) and the false discovery rate from ~ 95 to ~ 55% (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>a). By including replicate sequencing (either 2 or 3), we could further reduce the false discovery rate to &lt; 40% (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>a). Despite this significant reduction, the remaining false positive iSNVs still had high frequencies in our dataset (~ 5–25%, Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>d). It should be noted that because we are comparing two divergent viruses, the false discovery rates will likely increase when sequencing virus populations with fewer true iSNVs; however, applying the frequency and strand bias filter will still provide higher true or false iSNV discriminatory power. These findings show that estimating intrahost virus genetic diversity using the Oxford Nanopore platform will require additional technological and computational innovations for anything other than simple scenarios of co-infections with diverse virus haplotypes.</p>

      <title>Accurate analysis of amplicon-based sequencing data using iVar</title>
      <p id="Par21">Using the above validation experiments, we generated a comprehensive experimental protocol (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>) and an open source computational tool, iVar (<italic>i</italic>ntrahost <italic>v</italic>ariant <italic>a</italic>nalysis of <italic>r</italic>eplicates; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/andersen-lab/ivar">github.com/andersen-lab/ivar</ext-link>) to accurately analyze data from amplicon-based sequencing (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). Our framework should be compatible with any PCR-based sequencing approach, but was specifically designed for use with PrimalSeq on the Illumina platform. For the experimental protocol, we added the following recommendations to PrimalSeq to measure intrahost virus diversity: (1) start with at least 1000 RNA copies of the virus (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>c), (2) prepare each sample as technical duplicates (Figs. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>c and <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>c), and (3) sequence to a depth of at least 400× (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>d).<fig id="Fig6"><label>Fig. 6</label><caption><p>Experimental and computational workflow for measuring intrahost virus diversity using PrimalSeq</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13059_2018_1618_Fig6_HTML" id="MO6"/></fig></p>
      <p id="Par22">Our computational package, iVar, contains functions broadly useful for viral amplicon-based sequencing that cannot be accomplished using currently existing tools. We programmed iVar in C++ with minimal dependencies, and created the following functions to accurately call intrahost variants and generate virus consensus genomes from sequencing data across multiple replicates: (1) trimming of primers and low-quality bases, (2) consensus calling of virus sequences, (3) intrahost variant calling of iSNVs, insertions, and deletions, followed by a filtering step that uses variants called across multiple replicates to exclude false positives, and (4) identification of mismatches in primer sequences and exclusion of the corresponding reads from alignment files. We also created two pipelines using iVar to call intrahost variants from samples with or without known reference sequences, and prepared with or without technical replicates (with no limit on the number of technical replicates). When using iVar in combination with PrimalSeq, from our empirically-derived data we found that the following guidelines produced robust and reproducible results: (1) only call intrahost variants detected in two or more technical replicates greater than 3% frequency (Figs. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a and <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>c) and (2) remove reads from amplicons with mismatched primers to normalize comparisons of intrahost populations (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>).</p>
      <p id="Par23">We incorporated several functions into iVar for accurate intrahost variant calling that are currently not available in other software packages (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). First, iVar removes primer sequences from aligned reads in an input BAM file, based on a BED file with primer positions. This allows iVar to accurately trim primer sequences irrespective of potential mismatches in the aligned region of the sequencing reads and primer sequences. Following the trimming of primer sequences, iVar uses a sliding window approach to remove low quality bases based on phred score thresholds that can be specified by the user. During the trimming process, iVar stores primer sequences that were trimmed off as auxiliary data for each read in each input BAM file. Second, for virus consensus sequence generation, iVar uses the output of mpileup taking into account ambiguous nucleotides and a minimum threshold for base coverage that can be specified by the user. Third, to detect iSNVs, deletions, and insertions, iVar uses the output of mpileup taking into account a minimum threshold for base quality and a minimum threshold for variant frequency. iVar then uses the intrahost variants called across multiple technical replicates to exclude variants that may have been introduced into individual replicates due to amplification, library preparation, and/or sequencing errors (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>c). Fourth, to identify primer sequences with mismatches, iVar calls variants on an alignment of primer sequences and identifies those with mismatches to the reference. Reads with auxiliary data that matches these identified primers are selectively removed from the alignment. This ensures that varying primer binding efficiency will not bias the frequency of the intrahost variants called with iVar (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Thus, iVar provides an inclusive software package that integrates a set of critical functions for accurate primer and quality trimming, consensus calling, and intrahost variant detection from data generated using amplicon-based sequencing, including PrimalSeq.</p>
      <p id="Par24">We benchmarked iVar against the pre-existing tools VarScan2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>], MAFFT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>], Geneious [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>], Trimmomatic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>], and cutadapt [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>] to validate the trimming, consensus sequence generation, and intrahost variant calling functions in iVar. We found that iVar performed as well as, or better than, each of these tools (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figures S4-S6). We used two simulated datasets and two clinical Zika virus samples sequenced using PrimalSeq to validate iSNV calling, and found an almost perfect correlation between iVar and VarScan2 (Spearman’s <italic>ρ</italic> = 1; Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S4). We also found zero nucleotide differences in the consensus sequences called using iVar and Geneious at all four thresholds (0%, 25%, 50%, and 90%) and across the four datasets (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S5). We found that iVar was better than cutadapt at trimming primer sequences in amplicon-based sequencing datasets (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S6). This is because iVar uses primer positions specified in a BED file to soft clip the primer regions after alignment, whereas cutadapt trims sequencing reads by comparing the primer nucleotide sequence with the nucleotides at the 5′ end of each read, before alignment. As a result, iVar was able to trim sequencing reads that might not start, or end, exactly at the beginning of the primer sequence (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S6). Since cutadapt uses the actual primer sequences, which are assumed to be anchored at the 5′ or 3′ end to do the trimming, it misses these cases. We trimmed the length of the longest primer sequence (22 bp) from the 5′ end of all the sequenced reads using the “HEADCROP” option in Trimmomatic. This approach, however, is crude and will result in a loss of 22 bp from the 5′ end of all sequenced reads (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S6). Thus, iVar contains functionality that is critical for performing primer and quality trimming, consensus calling, and variant calling from datasets generated using amplicon-based protocols.</p>

      <title>PrimalSeq and iVar can be used to measure intrahost virus genetic diversity from primary samples</title>
      <p id="Par25">There are many sequencing options available to measure intrahost virus diversity from cell culture stocks (e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]) or infected animals with high titers (e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]). These approaches, however, often do not generate sufficient data when there is high host background RNA, or low virus copies, as is the case for many viruses, including Zika, during human and primate infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Using our validated PrimalSeq and iVar framework (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>), and by using Primal Scheme to create a new multiplexed primer set to amplify West Nile virus, we thoroughly evaluated our approaches to measure intrahost diversity from 36 Zika virus and West Nile virus populations (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). These samples came from a variety of laboratory and field-derived sample types and were each amplified, sequenced, and analyzed in duplicate (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S2, Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). To account for the influence of virus concentration on our measures of genetic diversity (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>c), all Zika virus and West Nile virus samples were normalized at 1000 and 10,000 RNA copies, respectively. We omitted (i.e., “masked”) from comparative genomic analysis regions of the virus genomes with iSNV mismatches in the primer binding regions (~ 2 per sample) or with sequencing coverage depth &lt; 400× (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S2, Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>, gray bands).<fig id="Fig7"><label>Fig. 7</label><caption><p>PrimalSeq can be used to measure intrahost variants from a variety of sample types. <bold>a</bold> We sequenced technical duplicates of Zika virus populations (1000 virus RNA copies each) to identify intrahost single-nucleotide variants (iSNVs) &gt; 3% within each sample.

For the in vitro and in vivo samples, where the reference population sequence is known, the iSNV frequencies were calculated by change in frequency from pre- to post-infection.

<italic>Culex</italic> mosquitoes and dead American crows were collected from San Diego County, CA, during 2015 to sequence West Nile virus from field samples (10,000 virus RNA copies each). The iSNV frequencies from the field samples are the minor allele frequencies (maximum frequency = 0.5) because the reference virus sequence was not known. For both (<bold>a</bold> and <bold>b</bold>), analysis was limited to regions of the genome with &gt; 400× coverage depth in the protein coding sequence and we masked amplicons with primer mismatches from our analysis (gray regions) for direct comparisons of intrahost genetic diversity</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13059_2018_1618_Fig7_HTML" id="MO7"/></fig></p>
      <p id="Par26">To demonstrate the types of analyses that can be performed with PrimalSeq and iVar, we compared the mosquito- and vertebrate-derived virus samples using several measures of intrahost diversity (Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>). We measured genetic richness (the number of iSNV sites; Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>a), complexity (uncertainty associated with randomly sampling an allele; Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>b), and distance (the sum of all iSNV frequencies; Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>c) of iSNVs &gt; 3% frequency. We did not analyze masked regions, so that only high confidence regions of the genome from all samples within the experiment were compared (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). We found that Zika virus genetic complexity and distance was significantly higher from populations derived from primate (Hela) cells than <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> (Aag2) cells (Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>). In vivo, however, our findings were reversed. Zika virus genetic richness and complexity were significantly higher in <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> bodies than primate (rhesus macaque) plasma (Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>). Furthermore, we found that the distribution of iSNV frequencies of the Zika virus populations was similar across different in vivo infections (Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>d). This finding indicates that the increased Zika virus diversity in mosquitoes was driven by more 3–20% iSNVs that were also common in macaques, and not by a few additional high frequency iSNVs. We found that from both Zika and West Nile virus field samples, genetic diversity was not significantly different between virus populations isolated from their mosquito vectors (<italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> or <italic>Culex</italic>) or vertebrate hosts (humans or birds), though the mosquito samples were more variable (Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>). We also compared measuring intrahost virus genetic diversity using a 3% iSNV cutoff (Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>) to using a 5% iSNV cutoff (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S2) and found the results mostly comparable, though some of the vector-host comparisons were no longer significant.

    <title>Discussion</title>
    <p id="Par27">Understanding how RNA viruses evolve within hosts can help lead to breakthroughs in medicine and biology. Rapid developments in sequencing technologies are facilitating more research into these areas, yet usage of unvalidated tools and systematic biases can dramatically limit the utility of the results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. To address these concerns, we developed PrimalSeq [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] and validated it across different platforms and sample types. In our development of iVar we show that PrimalSeq can be used to accurately measure intrahost virus diversity from different viruses and samples with amplicon-based sequencing. Based on our experimental validations, we provide a detailed laboratory protocol (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>), and suggest the following best practices for measuring intrahost virus diversity when using amplicon-based sequencing approaches:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par28">Start with at least 1000 RNA copies of the virus for the initial cDNA synthesis step.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par29">Prepare the RNA from virus populations for sequencing in duplicate.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par30">Sequence each library to a depth of at least 400× at each genome position using the Illumina platform.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par31">Only call iSNVs greater than 3% frequency that are detected in both replicates (a lower frequency may be achievable with higher RNA quantities).</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par32">For multi-sample comparisons of genetic diversity, omit genome regions amplified with primers that contain iSNVs within the binding sites.</p></list-item></list></p>
    <p id="Par33">Several factors can alter the accuracy of measuring intrahost virus diversity. In particular, we found that input virus concentrations, sequencing coverage depths, and primer mismatches can have profound effects on iSNV estimations. Using the recommendations above, however, we could consistently and accurately detect iSNVs at 3% frequency and higher. We predict that the lower limit of iSNV detection can be improved with a higher effective sampling depth (i.e., more input virus and deeper coverage) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p>
    <p id="Par34">Given no primer mismatches to the virus sequences, we found that measures of iSNVs frequencies from PrimalSeq were nearly as accurate as an untargeted metagenomics approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Because iVar remove the primer sequences from downstream analysis and use overlapping amplicons, frequency measures of iSNVs within the primer regions themselves are not skewed. Instead, iSNVs within primer regions can alter the measured frequencies of other iSNVs within that particular amplicon. In these cases, results should be interpreted with caution, and we incorporated a step in iVar to mask out such regions for comparative analyses. It is plausible that using primers with degenerate nucleotides at mismatched iSNV positions could help alleviating this bias [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>].</p>
    <p id="Par35">False iSNV calls significantly influence measurements of intrahost virus diversity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. We found that the positive association of false positive iSNVs with sequencing read lengths better fit the profiles of Illumina sequencing errors, rather than PCR errors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. In fact, we estimate that the Illumina MiSeq error rate (~ 0.9% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]) is ~ 60× greater than the error rates during PCR in our approach (~ 0.02% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]). Therefore, PrimalSeq likely does not add significantly more error, and by extension false iSNVs, than what was already inherent to the Illumina sequencing platform. Indeed, we found that PrimalSeq was comparable to PCR-free metagenomic sequencing in estimating intrahost virus diversity.</p>
    <p id="Par36">The ease and portability of Oxford Nanopore technologies, particularly the MinION, are revolutionizing the way we sequence viruses, including its use in near real-time outbreak tracking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Our data indicate, however, that the Nanopore platform is not yet adequate for detection of minor alleles and measures of intrahost diversity. While it may provide value in tracking frequency changes of known iSNVs over time, we found that the high error rates (10–15% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]) makes it difficult to differentiate between true and false iSNV calls. We found that stringent post-filtering, such as combining iSNV frequencies and strand bias across comparing replicate samples, significantly reduce false positive iSNV calls, but there is still a high false discovery rate. Effectively using Nanopore sequencing for intrahost virus diversity measurements will require higher sequencing accuracy and base calling, exploitation of co-occurring variants (i.e., haplotyping) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>], or utilization of different molecular approaches, including the 1D<sup>2</sup> method (where template and complementary strands of each fragment are sequenced) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>], tandem repeat consensus techniques [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>] or unique molecular identifiers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>].</p>
    <p id="Par37">For viruses that utilize multiple hosts, like mosquito-borne viruses, being able to compare results from many samples types is critically important. A lack of standardization, however, means that the field does not yet have a consensus to whether the mosquito vector or the vertebrate host contributes the most to virus genetic diversity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>]. The development of PrimalSeq and iVar allows for such measurements to be performed across diverse environments, sample types, and experimental designs. Using PrimalSeq, for example, we found that in vitro Zika virus diversity was significantly greater in human cells, when compared to mosquito cells. However, we found that these results were reversed during in vivo studies. Furthermore, we did not detect significant differences in field-collected mosquito and vertebrate samples for both Zika and West Nile virus. A caveat for the field samples, however, is that we do not know the reference sequence and cannot account for consensus-changing mutations introduced through intrahost bottlenecks and genetic drift [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>]. In addition, a limitation for all of our samples is that we can only compare diversity measurements from iSNVs greater than 3% frequency, and iSNVs below this threshold may be important for the virus population structure and phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>]. Even still, our incongruent results among experimental designs help to explain why there is still debate about the relative impact of vectors and hosts on virus evolution, and further use of PrimalSeq will help to resolve these issues.</p>

    <title>Conclusions</title>
    <p id="Par38">We demonstrate that PrimalSeq can accurately measure intrahost virus genetic diversity if properly validated. We benchmarked our highly multiplexed and streamlined amplicon-based sequencing method using a series of experiments with mixed virus populations, developed an all-inclusive computational analysis tool (iVar), and showcase its utility by measuring intrahost virus diversity from cells, mosquitoes, primates, birds, and humans. Furthermore, using our free online primer designer, Primal Scheme (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://primal.zibraproject.org/">primal.zibraproject.org</ext-link>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], PrimalSeq can be modified for use with a wide range of viruses. Overall, our detailed laboratory and computational approaches presented here can reveal important insights about intrahost virus evolution directly from clinical or experimental samples in a way that is cheap, accurate, and scalable.</p>

      <title>Mixed virus populations</title>
      <p id="Par39">Zika virus RNA from isolates PRVABC59 (Puerto Rico 2015, Genbank KX087101, “virus #1”) and FSS13025 (Cambodia 2010, Genbank KU955593, “virus #2”) were quantified by qRT-PCR (as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]). The consensus sequences from PRVABC59 and KX087101 were determined using untargeted metagenomics (see below) and a strict &gt; 99% majority nucleotide threshold at each site. Sites that were mixed (i.e., containing an iSNV &gt; 1% frequency) were not used to evaluate iSNVs at known frequencies (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Using quantified virus RNA copies, the two viruses were mixed to achieve the desired total RNA copies (one half required amount because 2 μL of RNA was used for cDNA) and ratios of PRVABC59:FSS13025. Metagenomic sequencing of a 10:1 mixed virus population (i.e., 10% FSS13025) was used to verify our mixing approach (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Each mixed virus population was sequenced in triplicate using the metagenomic and amplicon approaches described below.</p>

      <title>Quantification of virus RNA copies</title>
      <p id="Par45">Zika virus RNA copies were quantified using a qRT-PCR assay targeting the NS5 protein coding region of the genome using the BioRad One-step qRT-PCR for probes kit. In a 20-μL reaction, 2 μL of virus RNA was added to 10 μL of iTaq universal probes reaction mix, 0.5 μL of iScript RT, 6 μL of nuclease-free water, 0.5 μL of the forward primer (5′-AGTGCCAGAGCTGTGTGTAC-3′; genome positions 9007–9027), 0.5 μL of the reverse primer (5′-TCTAGCCCCTAGCCACATCT-3′; genome positions 9097–9117), and 0.5 μL of the 6-FAM labeled probe (5′-GGCAGCCGCGCCATCTGGT-3′; genome positions 9078–9096). The reactions were then amplified on a thermocycler with the following conditions: 50 °C for 10 min, 95 °C for 3 min, and followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C for 10 s and 57 °C for 10 s (fluorescence read at the end of the 57 °C step). To calculate the number of virus template copies using standard curves, we include 10-fold dilutions of partial Zika virus RNA genomes spanning the primer sites (10<sup>7</sup> to 10<sup>0</sup> copies per reaction). The Zika virus RNA standards were constructed by PCR amplifying a 848 bp segment of the Zika virus NS5 protein coding region (genome positions 8644 to 9492) with the following primers: forward containing a T7 promoter region (5′-TAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGATCAGGCTCCTGTCAAAACCC-3′; underlined = T7 promoter sequence; genome positions 8644–8664) and reverse primer (5′-AGTGACAACTTGTCCGCTCC-3′; genome positions 9472–9492). The amplified cDNA was converted into RNA to be used as standards using the Invitrogen MEGAscript T7 Transcription Kit.</p>
      <p id="Par46">The accuracy of measuring virus RNA copies by targeting one small genome region, in this case positions 9007–9117, is dependent on relatively equal proportions of the virus genome present in the sample. To address this, we used untargeted metagenomic sequencing of our 1000 RNA copy stocks of virus #1, virus #2, and three replicates of the Mix10% population. The normalized coverage shows that depth is consistent across the virus genome (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S3). The normalized coverage changes are consistent among virus samples and replicates, suggesting that coverage depth is more dependent on intrinsic factors of the virus genome influence replication efficiency (i.e., GC content [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>]) rather than significant RNA degradation leading to the loss of a fraction of the virus genome. Hence, we are confident that our qRT-PCR results are relatively informative for determining the virus RNA copy numbers across the whole genome.</p>
      <p id="Par47">For all Zika virus samples, 1000 virus RNA copies were used for sequencing, unless otherwise specified (e.g., Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>c).

      <title>Illumina data processing and variant calling using iVar</title>

The software package was written in C++ and has two dependencies—HTSlib (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/samtools/htslib">github.com/samtools/htslib</ext-link>) and Awk (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~bwk/btl.mirror/">cs.princeton.edu/~bwk/btl.mirror/</ext-link>). Awk is generally available on most unix based operating systems and HTSlib has only one dependency—zlib (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://zlib.net/">zlib.net/</ext-link>). The output of `mpileup` command from the widely used SAMtools [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>] was used by the package to call iSNVs and generate a consensus sequence from an alignment. The computational pipeline was divided in four main sections: (1) alignment, (2) trimming, (3) constructing nucleotide matrices and scan for iSNVs within primer regions, and (4) statistical comparisons between replicate datasets. The paired-end reads were aligned to a provided reference genome using BWA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>]. The paired-end reads were not merged at any point in this process. The primer sequences were trimmed from the reads using a BED file, with the primer positions, followed by quality trimming. iSNVs above the frequency cutoff of 3% were then called using the `mpileup` command from SAMtools (maximum coverage depth cutoff was set to 0[“-d 0”], making the limit on depth the maximum limit of an signed 32 bit integer (i.e., 2,147,483,647). In addition to the frequency threshold, Fisher’s exact test was used to determine if the frequency of the iSNV is significantly higher than the mean error rate at that position (see contingency table, Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S6). Based on the iSNVs called, mismatches in the primer sequences were identified and the reads from the amplicon were removed. The variant calling step were repeated to remove any influence of the primer mismatch on iSNV frequencies.<fig id="Fig9"><label>Fig. 9</label><caption><p>Overview of iVar pipeline. iVar was used to construct two pipelines for calling intrahost single-nucleotide variants (iSNVs) from samples with and without a known reference sequence. The nodes in the chart are colored based on the usage of iVar, bwa, and SAMtools at each step. For samples with a known reference sequence, the primer sequences are trimmed from the sequenced reads, followed by quality trimming. A consensus sequence for the sample is called by merging the aligned BAM files from each replicate. The primer sequences are then aligned to this consensus sequence and mismatches are identified by iVar after performing variant calling on the aligned primers. The reads corresponding to the mismatched primers are removed from the aligned BAM file of each replicate to ensure that any bias introduced in the iSNV frequencies is removed. The iSNVs are then called for each replicate, individually, with a minimum frequency threshold of 3% and an intersection of the iSNVs across all the replicates are considered to be the “true” iSNVs. For samples with an unknown reference sequence, the iSNVs cannot be called directly using a reference sequence. In this case, after generating the consensus sequence, reads from each replicate are aligned back to this consensus sequence and these realigned BAM files are used for the same subsequent steps as in the case of samples with a known reference sequence</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13059_2018_1618_Fig9_HTML" id="MO9"/></fig></p>

We did the consensus calling at four different thresholds—0% (majority), 25%, 50% (strict), and 90%. We counted the mismatches between the resulting consensus sequences from iVar, Geneious and the reference sequence by performing a multiple sequence alignment using MAFFT (v7.388) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. While counting mismatches, we ignored mismatches when one sequence had a gap and the other had a “N,” since in either case. We validated primer trimming and quality trimming in iVar against anchored adapter trimming in cutadapt (v1.16) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>] and against Trimmomatic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. iVar uses a sliding window starting from the 5′ end and checks if the average quality within the window drops below the threshold. As soon as the quality drops below the threshold, it trims the sequence by soft clipping the read. This is different from the algorithm cutadapt uses to do quality trimming, but is similar to the sliding window approach used by Trimmomatic. The data and code used for the validation are at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://github.com/andersen-lab/paper_2018_primalseq-ivar">github.com/andersen-lab/paper_2018_primalseq-ivar</ext-link> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>].</p>

      <title>Oxford Nanopore sequencing and analysis</title>
      <p id="Par53">Using the same PCR amplicons used for amplicon-based Illumina sequencing, we sequenced three replicates of the mixed Zika virus population (90% virus #1, 10% virus #2) using the Oxford Nanopore GridION sequencer. Native, 1D barcode libraries (SQK-NSK007, Oxford Nanopore Technologies, UK) were prepared according to previously published methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], with three amplification replicates corresponding to barcodes 1, 2 and 3. The pooled sequencing library was sequenced on an R9.4 version flowcell (FLO-MIN106, Oxford Nanopore Technologies, UK). Reads were basecalled using Albacore 2.3.1 using the command-line read_fast5_basecaller.py -c r94_450bps_linear.cfg -i fast5 -o fastq -r -t 12. Reads were subsequently demultiplexed with Porechop 0.2.3_seqan2.1.1 using default (lenient) settings (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/rrwick/Porechop">github.com/rrwick/Porechop</ext-link>). A total of 2.4 million reads were generated which after alignment and trimming covered 95.66% of the reference genome (Genbank KX087101). For the purposes of assigning to genotypes (i.e., unique virus haplotypes), reads were assigned to individual strains using BWA-MEM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>] against a custom reference database comprising four Zika virus genomes: Genbank KX087101 (virus #1), KU955593 (virus #2), EU545988 (an Asian lineage virus isolated in 2007) and NC_012532 (MR766, an African lineage virus). Counts for each assignment were retrieved, ignoring multi-mapping reads using the shell command bwa mem -x ont2d | samtools view -h -F 256 - | samtools view -h -F 2048 - | cut -f 3 | sort | uniq -c. Next, each replicate was aligned to the PRVACB59 reference genome with BWA-MEM using setting -x ont2d. Primer binding sites and any residual adaptor sequence were masked in the resulting BAM alignment using the align_trim script from the Zibra pipeline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Allele frequencies and putative iSNVs (ignoring insertions or deletions) were extracted from BAM files using a Python script freqs.py (included in the accompanying code repository: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/nickloman/zika-isnv">github.com/nickloman/zika-isnv</ext-link> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref>]). This script utilizes the pileup functionality of samtools via the pysam Python interface module (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/pysam-developers/pysam">github.com/pysam-developers/pysam</ext-link>). Only predicted variants with more than 10 supporting forward and 10 supporting reverse reads were considered. The logistic regression model was trained and tested under a 10-fold cross validation scheme using the train function with the parameters method = “glm” and family = “binomial” from the caret (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/topepo/caret/">github.com/topepo/caret/</ext-link>) library in R. Class probabilities for the ROC curve were captured from the same function and plotted using ggplot2 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/tidyverse/ggplot2">github.com/tidyverse/ggplot2</ext-link>).</p>

      <p id="Par54">Virus iSNVs &gt; 3% were used to genetically characterize the populations derived from in vitro, in vivo, and field samples (Figs. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref> and <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). For this purpose, insertions and deletions were not analyzed. For the Zika virus in vitro and in vivo samples, where the ancestral PRVABC59 sequence was known, the iSNV frequencies were calculated by the difference between the ancestral (pre-infection) and derived (post-infection) frequencies (e.g., if variant X was detected at 5% in the ancestral and 10% in the derived population, the iSNV frequency was listed as 5%). For the Zika and West Nile virus field samples, where the ancestral virus sequence was not known, the derived iSNV frequencies were used for the population genetic analysis. Richness was calculated by the total number of iSNV sites per population (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>a). Complexity, uncertainty associated with randomly sampling an allele, was calculated at each site using Shannon entropy:<disp-formula id="Equa"><alternatives><tex-math id="M1">\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

      <p id="Par1">How viruses evolve within hosts can dictate infection outcomes; however, reconstructing this process is challenging. We evaluate our multiplexed amplicon approach, PrimalSeq, to demonstrate how virus concentration, sequencing coverage, primer mismatches, and replicates influence the accuracy of measuring intrahost virus diversity. We develop an experimental protocol and computational tool, iVar, for using PrimalSeq to measure virus diversity using Illumina and compare the results to Oxford Nanopore sequencing. We demonstrate the utility of PrimalSeq by measuring Zika and West Nile virus diversity from varied sample types and show that the accumulation of genetic diversity is influenced by experimental and biological systems.</p>

    <title>Background</title>
    <p id="Par2">RNA viruses, including HIV, influenza, West Nile, and Zika, pose significant threats to public health worldwide. Part of this burden stems from their ability to rapidly evolve within hosts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Generation of intrahost genetic diversity allows virus populations to evade host immune responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], alter the severity of disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], and adapt to changing environments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Studying virus populations, both within naturally infected hosts and during experimental evolution, can therefore lead to breakthroughs in our understanding of virus-host interactions and novel approaches for outbreak response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p>
    <p id="Par3">In many cases, however, accurately measuring intrahost RNA virus diversity using deep sequencing remains a significant challenge. Multiple factors, such as virus titer, sample preparation, sequencing errors, and computational inferences, can bias measures of genetic diversity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Moreover, for many clinical samples, low ratios of viral to host RNA often necessitate enrichment of viral nucleic acid to recover sufficient templates for deep sequencing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. This is especially true for Zika virus, where low viremias (&lt; 1000 copies/μL of RNA) are often detected during natural and experimental infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. PCR amplification of virus nucleic acid is a common approach to overcome this challenge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], although it can introduce biases by altering the composition of intrahost genetic variants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Therefore, to ensure accuracy, comprehensive validation of deep sequencing approaches should accompany diversity measures from biological samples.</p>
    <p id="Par4">We previously developed a multiplex primer design tool (“Primal Scheme”) coupled to a laboratory protocol (“PrimalSeq”) to sequence RNA viruses directly from clinical samples in a way that is cheap, accurate, and scalable under resource-limited conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Versions of PrimalSeq have been used to sequence the majority of Zika virus genomes from the epidemic in the Americas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], yellow fever virus in Brazil [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], and West Nile virus in the USA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. PrimalSeq has also been used to characterize Zika virus during infection of non-human primates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. While PrimalSeq was shown to be superior to other methods for obtaining consensus sequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], it has yet to be validated for measuring intrahost diversity.</p>
    <p id="Par5">In this study, we benchmarked PrimalSeq for sequencing diverse virus populations, highlighting its limitations and providing recommendations for accurately measuring intrahost single-nucleotide variants (iSNVs) from both Illumina and Oxford Nanopore data. We used these results to develop comprehensive laboratory protocols and a computational tool (iVar), and further tested PrimalSeq to characterize Zika virus populations generated from cell culture, mosquito, non-human primate, and human clinical samples. We demonstrate the utility of PrimalSeq for other viruses by designing an amplicon scheme for West Nile virus and measuring genetic diversity from field-collected mosquitoes and birds. Our data show that virus diversity can be significantly impacted by the experimental and biological systems, and we provide a framework to uncover the underlying mechanisms. PrimalSeq and iVar provide a scalable platform for viruses other than Zika and West Nile that can be applied to discover ecological, epidemiological, and immunological drivers of virus evolution in a variety of systems.</p>

      <p id="Par6">We previously developed Primal Scheme (Quick et al.; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://primal.zibraproject.org/">primal.zibraproject.org</ext-link>), a multiplex primer design tool for amplicon-based sequencing of RNA virus genomes directly from clinical samples [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Our Zika virus PrimalSeq protocol generates 35 overlapping amplicons of ~ 400 base pairs from two multiplexed PCR reactions, an approach similar to “RNA jackhammering,” which was developed to sequence HIV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. The process of PCR amplification to generate sufficient templates for high-throughput sequencing, however, may bias the measurements of intrahost virus diversity through differential amplification efficiencies for divergent virus haplotypes present in a population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>].</p>
      <p id="Par7">Given the potential biases that may be introduced during PCR amplification, we sought to assess the accuracy of PrimalSeq for iSNV detection. Through a series of experiments, we determined that at least 1000 RNA virus copies are needed to detect iSNVs at greater than 3% frequency, when sequenced to a coverage depth of at least 400× (i.e., the number of sequenced nucleotides per targeted genome position, Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). To set up these experiments, we created genetically diverse Zika virus populations by mixing two divergent virus strains: Zika virus #1 isolated from Puerto Rico in 2015 (Genbank KX087101) and virus #2 isolated from Cambodia in 2010 (Genbank KU955593). Using gold-standard untargeted metagenomic sequencing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>], we determined that there were 159 fixed consensus sequence differences between the viruses located throughout the 10,807 nucleotide genome of virus #1 and #2 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Measurement intrahost variant frequencies are more accurate at high frequencies and are susceptible to input concentrations and coverage depths. <bold>a</bold> We created genetically diverse virus populations by mixing two Zika virus isolates with 159 consensus nucleotide differences to test the effects of PCR amplification prior to sequencing to measure intrahost single-nucleotide variant (iSNV) frequencies. For these initial experiments, we amplified three ~ 400 bp regions of the Zika virus genome using primers without any mismatches to either of the mixed virus (shown as amplicons 5, 24, and 33). "Amplicon 5" contains 5 iSNV sites, "amplicon 24" contains 8 iSNV sites, and "amplicon 33" contains 5 iSNV sites. <bold>b</bold> We created virus populations containing 50%, 25%, 14%, 7%, 3%, 1.5%, and 0.8% virus #2 to test the impact of PCR amplification prior to sequencing on measuring ranges of iSNV frequencies. The data points represent individual iSNVs amplified and sequenced in triplicate from each population (colored by amplicon 5, 24, or 33 as shown in <bold>a</bold>. <bold>c</bold> We 10-fold serially diluted a mixed population containing 14% of virus #2 (expected, dotted line) from 100,000 to 10 copies to test the effects of input concentrations on accurate iSNV measurements. <bold>d</bold> We randomly downsampled the datasets generated from 1000 input virus RNA copies containing 3% virus #2 to set coverage depths (sequenced nucleotides [nt] per genome position) to determine the minimum coverage needed to yield accurate iSNV measurements.

      <p id="Par8">For our initial evaluation, we selected three of the 35 Zika virus primer sets that flanked at least five variable genome positions (amplicons 5, 24, and 33). We then made two sets of mixed virus populations: (1) altering the ratios of mixed viruses, while keeping the overall input concentration constant at 1000 virus RNA copies (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b) and (2) maintaining a constant ratio of 14% of virus #2 while altering the input concentrations of virus RNA used for cDNA synthesis (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>c). For each test, we measured the frequencies of the 18 iSNVs between virus #1 and #2 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a). We generated the amplicons independently three times and sequenced each using the Illumina MiSeq platform (“technical replicates”).</p>
      <p id="Par9">We found that the measured mean iSNV frequencies were accurate from populations containing 50%, 25%, 14%, 7%, and 3% of virus #2 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b). At 1.5% of virus #2, the standard deviation of our measured mean iSNV frequency (0.2–1.2%) fell below the expected frequency, indicating that we could not measure the true iSNV frequency at that dilution (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b). This demonstrates that the lower limit of accurate iSNV detection for PrimalSeq in this scenario is between 1.5 and 3%. When we altered input concentrations of a population containing 14% virus #2 from 100,000 to 10 virus RNA copies (10-fold serial dilutions), we found that the variances of measured frequencies became significantly higher from concentrations containing 100 or less copies (Levene’s test for variance, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05; Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>c). Therefore, input virus concentrations can dramatically alter iSNV detection, as others have also discovered [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. We conclude that a minimum of 1000 virus RNA copies should be used with PrimalSeq to accurately measure iSNVs greater than 3% frequency.</p>
      <p id="Par10">Sequencing coverage depth is another important factor for iSNV detection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], so we sought to define the level of sequencing coverage needed to accurately measure iSNVs. From our samples containing 1000 virus RNA copies with 97% virus #1 and 3% virus #2, we sequenced the targeted genome regions in triplicates to a coverage depth of ~ 3000×. We randomly downsampled these datasets to generate coverage depths of 1000, 600, 400, 200, 100, and 50× (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>d). We found that the variances of iSNV frequencies became significantly higher from coverage depths lower than 400× (i.e., at 200, 100, and 50×; Levene’s test for variance, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05; Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>d). Thus, we conclude that a minimum sequencing coverage depth of 400× is required to maintain iSNV measurement accuracy at the lower limit of frequency detection (3%) and input concentration (1000 virus RNA copies).</p>

      <title>Primer mismatches impact intrahost variant frequency measurements</title>
      <p id="Par11">A concern for using PCR-based sequencing protocols for measuring intrahost virus diversity is the potential for primer mismatches to alter PCR efficiency that can bias iSNV frequency measurements. Indeed, we found that primer mismatches, especially those close to the 3′ end, can alter iSNV frequencies in the generated amplicons (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). To make this assessment, we used (1) our Zika virus PrimalSeq strategy and (2) a mix containing 90% of virus #1 and 10% of virus #2 (“Mix10%”). Of the 159 consensus nucleotide differences between virus #1 and #2, 24 resulted in mismatches within the primer regions of 20 of the oligos used to generate 18 of the 35 PCR amplicons (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a, Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S1). In addition, at least one nucleotide difference occurred within each of the 18 amplicons (outside of the primer-binding region), which allowed us to assess the influence of primer mismatches on iSNV frequency measurements across the Zika virus genome.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Measures of intrahost variant frequencies are sensitive to primer mismatches. <bold>a</bold> To assess the impacts of primer mismatches on accurately measuring intrahost single-nucleotide variants (iSNVs), we sequenced a mixed Zika virus population using 35 overlapping PCR amplicons (see “Amplicon scheme” above panel). The virus population contained 10% virus #2 (Expected) and 1000 virus RNA copies were amplified and sequenced in triplicate. The amplicons and iSNVs are colored according to the number of mismatches in the primer sequences used to generate that amplicon. Data shown as means and ranges. <bold>b</bold> To account for unequal iSNV sites within each amplicon, the iSNV frequencies on each amplicon were averaged to produce a haplotype frequency for virus #2 mixed at 10% (Expected). Data shown as means and ranges. <bold>c</bold> We calculated the deviations between the measured and expected virus #2 haplotype frequencies (absolute value of the log<sub>2</sub> fold change) to assess the bias introduced during PCR of amplicons containing primer mismatches to virus #2 (*, Welch’s <italic>t</italic> test, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). Data shown as means and standard deviations. <bold>d</bold> We plotted the deviations from expected haplotype frequencies by the distance of mismatches from the 3′ end of the primer to investigate the impact of mismatch location. If more than one mismatch was present on a primer pair (orange), the data is shown using the closest mismatch to the 3′ end. Mismatches closer to the 3′ end of the primer are more likely decrease the accuracy of iSNV or haplotype measurements from that amplicon (correlation by Pearson <italic>r</italic>, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). Data shown as the mean from all three replicates</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13059_2018_1618_Fig2_HTML" id="MO2"/></fig></p>
      <p id="Par12">We amplified the Mix10% virus population (1000 RNA copies) independently three times and sequenced each replicate to a minimum coverage depth of 1000× using the Illumina MiSeq. We measured iSNV frequency at each site and calculated the mean iSNV frequency of all iSNVs within an amplicon to estimate the computed virus #2 haplotype frequency (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b). We found that iSNV frequencies measured from amplicons without primer mismatches were significantly closer to the expected value of 10% than amplicons with one or more mismatches in the primer regions (Welch’s <italic>t</italic> test, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05, Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>c). Moreover, we found that mismatches closer to the 3′ end of the primer were more likely to lead to inaccurate frequency measurements (Pearson <italic>r</italic>, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05, Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>d). Overall, our data demonstrate that the accuracy of intrahost virus diversity measures is highly impacted by primer mismatches during PCR. Thus, when iSNVs are detected from amplicons with mismatches in the primer binding sites, the resulting diversity data from those amplicons should be interpreted with caution.</p>

      <title>Removal of false positive intrahost variants with replicate sequencing</title>
      <p id="Par13">Measurements of virus intrahost genetic diversity are sensitive to PCR and sequencing errors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. These factors, combined with others such as virus concentration and sequencing coverage (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>), can lead to erroneous iSNV detection (i.e., false positives) and bias measures of genetic diversity. To improve accurate iSNV detection, we examined the distribution of false positive iSNV calls and investigated methods to remove them during analysis. We found that (1) the distribution of false positive iSNVs more closely matched the profile of sequencing errors than PCR errors and that (2) the majority of false iSNV &gt; 3% could be removed by replicate sequencing (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>).</p>
      <p id="Par14">To investigate false positive iSNV calls, we amplified our Mix10% virus population (1000 RNA copies) individually three times and sequenced each on the Illumina MiSeq. We limited our analysis to only those amplicons with perfect primer matches. Within these regions, we analyzed 54 sites with expected 10% iSNVs (true positives) and 4173 sites that were invariable in our mixed virus population. We considered any iSNVs detected &gt; 0.1% frequency at the invariable sites as false positives. We found that on average, 631 of the 4173 expected invariable sites (16%) had false positive iSNVs at a &gt; 0.1% frequency cutoff. We observed false positive iSNVs on every amplicon but found that they were unevenly distributed across the 250 nucleotide long Illumina reads (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a, b). Specifically, we found that virus genome sites covered by sequencing reads at positions &gt; 150 nucleotides had significantly more false positives (Wilcoxon test, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05; Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a insert) at significantly higher frequencies (Mann-Whitney test, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05; Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>b insert) than positions &lt; 150 nucleotides into the read. Our data therefore show that false positive iSNVs are not evenly distributed across the Illumina sequencing reads, and that the profiles are consistent with published Illumina error rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. We found that the occurrence and iSNV frequency of false positives, decreased during the last 50 nucleotides of the Illumina reads (positions 200–250, Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a, b), which is due to overlapping (not merged) reads during paired-end sequencing of 400 bp amplicons (data not shown).<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>False positive intrahost variants caused by sequencing errors can be removed by technical replicates and frequency cutoffs.

This left us with 61 true positive (10% frequency) iSNV sites and 3940 sites not expected to be variable to investigate false positives (&gt; 0.1% frequency). <bold>a</bold> The locations of false positives on the sequencing read position were mapped and shown as the distribution within 25 nt bins by percent of sites with false positive iSNV calls.

      <p id="Par15">Knowing the general distribution of false positive iSNVs, we sought to remove them post sequencing. Based on previous investigations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>], we proposed to remove false positive iSNVs by (1) amplifying and sequencing each sample as technical replicates (at least twice) and (2) only calling iSNVs detected in all replicates. Using our Mix10% virus population, we analyzed each replicate in isolation or in combination and calculated the mean iSNV frequencies (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>c). From individually sequenced replicates, we found 1–2 false positive iSNVs per sample were within the frequency distribution of our true iSNVs (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>c, panel “1 replicate”), demonstrating that a simple frequency cutoff will either leave false positive or remove true positive iSNVs. When considering replicates in combination, however, we found that the percent of sites with a false positive iSNV call (above 0.1%) dropped from ~ 16% (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>c “1 replicate”) to ~ 9% (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>c “2 replicates”). More importantly, we found that all of the false iSNVs that passed the duplicate filter had frequencies below the 3% limit of accurate iSNV measurements (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b). This allowed us to use a secondary frequency cutoff (3%) to remove the remainder of the false positives, while maintaining all of the true (10%) iSNVs. We found that the addition of a third technical replicate only resulted in a moderate reduction of sites with false iSNVs above 0.1% (9 to 6%) and did not help us to decrease the frequency cutoff filter (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>c “3 replicates”). Using pseudo replicates (i.e., using the same replicate more than once, instead of using technical replicates) to filter variants, we found that this did not lead to an improvement in eliminating false positives (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S1). This finding shows that the elimination of false positives when using technical replicates is not due to an apparent increase in sequencing coverage, but rather is due the independent nature of each replicate sequencing library. We conclude that PrimalSeq can be used for accurate iSNV detection above 3% when using at least two technical replicates.</p>

      <title>The accuracy of PrimalSeq is comparable to metagenomic sequencing</title>
      <p id="Par16">The gold standard for virus sequencing is untargeted metagenomics—sampling all RNA or DNA present in a sample [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Compared to amplicon-based sequencing, metagenomic sequencing uses random priming and does not select for specific RNA sequences and is thus less biased. In addition, for virus sequencing in resource-limited conditions, the Oxford Nanopore MinION is gaining popularity due to its portability and low instrument cost [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>], which is enabling real-time outbreak tracking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. To compare iSNV calling accuracy across platforms and methods, we evaluated iSNV measurements using either: (1) metagenomic Illumina sequencing, (2) PrimalSeq with Illumina sequencing, and (3) PrimalSeq with Oxford Nanopore sequencing. We found that PCR amplification leads to more variable true iSNV frequency measurements, but that the overall accuracy of PrimalSeq is comparable to metagenomic sequencing (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). PrimalSeq using Nanopore sequencing can be used to detect iSNVs, but, as expected, high error rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>] makes it difficult to differentiate between true and false iSNVs (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>).<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><p>PCR amplification prior to sequencing leads to similar overall measurements of genetic diversity. <bold>a</bold> We compared our PrimalSeq that enriches for specific virus sequences to the current ‘gold standard’ for measuring intrahost genetic diversity, metagenomics; and we compared sequencing the amplicons using the Illumina and Oxford Nanopore platforms.

      <p id="Par17">To compare PrimalSeq and metagenomic sequencing approaches, as well as platforms (Illumina or Nanopore), for iSNV measurement accuracy, we generated triplicate sequencing libraries from our Mix10% virus population (1000 RNA copies). The triplicate amplicon libraries were sequenced using both Illumina MiSeq and Oxford Nanopore MinION platforms, while the metagenomics libraries were sequenced using the MiSeq (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>a). We found that compared to metagenomic sequencing, mean true positive iSNV frequencies generated from PrimalSeq were not significantly different when using the Illumina platform (Welch’s <italic>t</italic> test, <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05; Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>b, c).

To determine the discriminatory power of calling true negative and false positive iSNVs, we analyzed iSNV frequencies &gt; 3% (cutoff determined in Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>c) from 4173 sites expected to be invariable (i.e., true negatives).

      <title>High intrahost variant false discovery rate using Oxford Nanopore sequencing</title>
      <p id="Par18">To further explore Oxford Nanopore sequencing for measuring intrahost virus diversity, we examined if we could (1) differentiate between mixed genotypes within a virus population and (2) computationally remove false positive iSNVs. Though the mean iSNV frequencies measured from Nanopore were not significantly different from Illumina (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>) and we could assign reads to the correct haplotype (i.e., virus #1 or #2), we found it difficult to differentiate between true and false positive iSNVs (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). For this evaluation, we used our Nanopore data generated from the Mix10% Zika virus population (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>a).</p>
      <p id="Par19">First, using a reference database containing virus #1 and #2, plus two divergent Zika viruses (French Polynesia, 2007; Uganda, 1947), we determined if we could differentiate between virus haplotypes in a mixed population. We found that 92.38% of the aligned reads mapped to virus #1 and 7.35% mapped to virus #2, the roughly expected 90%:10% proportions (0.27% of reads mapped erroneously to haplotypes not present in the mixture). Overall, the results indicate that nanopore sequencing reads are useful for identifying highly divergent haplotypes within a mixture—as might be expected for some co-infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]—despite a high error rate. This approach, however, will be less useful for detecting co-infections if the divergence between the haplotypes is small or the haplotypes are unknown.</p>
      <p id="Par20">To attempt to differentiate between true and false positive iSNVs, we limited our analysis to regions only covered by perfect primer matches and analyzed 54 true positive and 4173 true negative sites, as we did above for the Illumina data (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). We filtered the sequencing data using technical replicates and a 3% frequency cutoff, which we demonstrated above could be used to remove false iSNV calls in our Illumina data (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>c). Using these filters, we found that &gt; 17% of the 4173 invariant sites had false iSNV calls in the Nanopore data, even when including all three replicates (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>a). This is because the majority of the false positive iSNVs had measured frequencies as high, or higher, than the 10% true positives (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>c), leading to a &gt; 93% false discovery rate (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>a). To investigate if the false discovery rate could be reduced using additional data within the sequencing reads, we trained a logistic regression model incorporating iSNV frequency and strand bias [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>] as features, and the presence or absence of known iSNVs as the response variable (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>b). Based on this analysis, we found that using a frequency and strand bias filter resulted in a higher true or false iSNV discriminatory power, as shown by its greater area under the curve, than the two features independently (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>b). Using this filter for individual replicates, we were able to reduce the number of false positive iSNVs from ~ 900 to 1000 (3% cutoff) to ~ 50–70 (frequency + strand bias) and the false discovery rate from ~ 95 to ~ 55% (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>a). By including replicate sequencing (either 2 or 3), we could further reduce the false discovery rate to &lt; 40% (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>a). Despite this significant reduction, the remaining false positive iSNVs still had high frequencies in our dataset (~ 5–25%, Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>d). It should be noted that because we are comparing two divergent viruses, the false discovery rates will likely increase when sequencing virus populations with fewer true iSNVs; however, applying the frequency and strand bias filter will still provide higher true or false iSNV discriminatory power. These findings show that estimating intrahost virus genetic diversity using the Oxford Nanopore platform will require additional technological and computational innovations for anything other than simple scenarios of co-infections with diverse virus haplotypes.</p>

      <title>Accurate analysis of amplicon-based sequencing data using iVar</title>
      <p id="Par21">Using the above validation experiments, we generated a comprehensive experimental protocol (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>) and an open source computational tool, iVar (<italic>i</italic>ntrahost <italic>v</italic>ariant <italic>a</italic>nalysis of <italic>r</italic>eplicates; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/andersen-lab/ivar">github.com/andersen-lab/ivar</ext-link>) to accurately analyze data from amplicon-based sequencing (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). Our framework should be compatible with any PCR-based sequencing approach, but was specifically designed for use with PrimalSeq on the Illumina platform. For the experimental protocol, we added the following recommendations to PrimalSeq to measure intrahost virus diversity: (1) start with at least 1000 RNA copies of the virus (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>c), (2) prepare each sample as technical duplicates (Figs. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>c and <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>c), and (3) sequence to a depth of at least 400× (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>d).<fig id="Fig6"><label>Fig. 6</label><caption><p>Experimental and computational workflow for measuring intrahost virus diversity using PrimalSeq</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13059_2018_1618_Fig6_HTML" id="MO6"/></fig></p>
      <p id="Par22">Our computational package, iVar, contains functions broadly useful for viral amplicon-based sequencing that cannot be accomplished using currently existing tools. We programmed iVar in C++ with minimal dependencies, and created the following functions to accurately call intrahost variants and generate virus consensus genomes from sequencing data across multiple replicates: (1) trimming of primers and low-quality bases, (2) consensus calling of virus sequences, (3) intrahost variant calling of iSNVs, insertions, and deletions, followed by a filtering step that uses variants called across multiple replicates to exclude false positives, and (4) identification of mismatches in primer sequences and exclusion of the corresponding reads from alignment files. We also created two pipelines using iVar to call intrahost variants from samples with or without known reference sequences, and prepared with or without technical replicates (with no limit on the number of technical replicates). When using iVar in combination with PrimalSeq, from our empirically-derived data we found that the following guidelines produced robust and reproducible results: (1) only call intrahost variants detected in two or more technical replicates greater than 3% frequency (Figs. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a and <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>c) and (2) remove reads from amplicons with mismatched primers to normalize comparisons of intrahost populations (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>).</p>
      <p id="Par23">We incorporated several functions into iVar for accurate intrahost variant calling that are currently not available in other software packages (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). First, iVar removes primer sequences from aligned reads in an input BAM file, based on a BED file with primer positions. This allows iVar to accurately trim primer sequences irrespective of potential mismatches in the aligned region of the sequencing reads and primer sequences. Following the trimming of primer sequences, iVar uses a sliding window approach to remove low quality bases based on phred score thresholds that can be specified by the user. During the trimming process, iVar stores primer sequences that were trimmed off as auxiliary data for each read in each input BAM file. Second, for virus consensus sequence generation, iVar uses the output of mpileup taking into account ambiguous nucleotides and a minimum threshold for base coverage that can be specified by the user. Third, to detect iSNVs, deletions, and insertions, iVar uses the output of mpileup taking into account a minimum threshold for base quality and a minimum threshold for variant frequency. iVar then uses the intrahost variants called across multiple technical replicates to exclude variants that may have been introduced into individual replicates due to amplification, library preparation, and/or sequencing errors (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>c). Fourth, to identify primer sequences with mismatches, iVar calls variants on an alignment of primer sequences and identifies those with mismatches to the reference. Reads with auxiliary data that matches these identified primers are selectively removed from the alignment. This ensures that varying primer binding efficiency will not bias the frequency of the intrahost variants called with iVar (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Thus, iVar provides an inclusive software package that integrates a set of critical functions for accurate primer and quality trimming, consensus calling, and intrahost variant detection from data generated using amplicon-based sequencing, including PrimalSeq.</p>
      <p id="Par24">We benchmarked iVar against the pre-existing tools VarScan2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>], MAFFT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>], Geneious [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>], Trimmomatic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>], and cutadapt [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>] to validate the trimming, consensus sequence generation, and intrahost variant calling functions in iVar. We found that iVar performed as well as, or better than, each of these tools (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figures S4-S6). We used two simulated datasets and two clinical Zika virus samples sequenced using PrimalSeq to validate iSNV calling, and found an almost perfect correlation between iVar and VarScan2 (Spearman’s <italic>ρ</italic> = 1; Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S4). We also found zero nucleotide differences in the consensus sequences called using iVar and Geneious at all four thresholds (0%, 25%, 50%, and 90%) and across the four datasets (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S5). We found that iVar was better than cutadapt at trimming primer sequences in amplicon-based sequencing datasets (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S6). This is because iVar uses primer positions specified in a BED file to soft clip the primer regions after alignment, whereas cutadapt trims sequencing reads by comparing the primer nucleotide sequence with the nucleotides at the 5′ end of each read, before alignment. As a result, iVar was able to trim sequencing reads that might not start, or end, exactly at the beginning of the primer sequence (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S6). Since cutadapt uses the actual primer sequences, which are assumed to be anchored at the 5′ or 3′ end to do the trimming, it misses these cases. We trimmed the length of the longest primer sequence (22 bp) from the 5′ end of all the sequenced reads using the “HEADCROP” option in Trimmomatic. This approach, however, is crude and will result in a loss of 22 bp from the 5′ end of all sequenced reads (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S6). Thus, iVar contains functionality that is critical for performing primer and quality trimming, consensus calling, and variant calling from datasets generated using amplicon-based protocols.</p>

      <title>PrimalSeq and iVar can be used to measure intrahost virus genetic diversity from primary samples</title>
      <p id="Par25">There are many sequencing options available to measure intrahost virus diversity from cell culture stocks (e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]) or infected animals with high titers (e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]). These approaches, however, often do not generate sufficient data when there is high host background RNA, or low virus copies, as is the case for many viruses, including Zika, during human and primate infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Using our validated PrimalSeq and iVar framework (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>), and by using Primal Scheme to create a new multiplexed primer set to amplify West Nile virus, we thoroughly evaluated our approaches to measure intrahost diversity from 36 Zika virus and West Nile virus populations (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). These samples came from a variety of laboratory and field-derived sample types and were each amplified, sequenced, and analyzed in duplicate (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S2, Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). To account for the influence of virus concentration on our measures of genetic diversity (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>c), all Zika virus and West Nile virus samples were normalized at 1000 and 10,000 RNA copies, respectively. We omitted (i.e., “masked”) from comparative genomic analysis regions of the virus genomes with iSNV mismatches in the primer binding regions (~ 2 per sample) or with sequencing coverage depth &lt; 400× (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S2, Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>, gray bands).<fig id="Fig7"><label>Fig. 7</label><caption><p>PrimalSeq can be used to measure intrahost variants from a variety of sample types. <bold>a</bold> We sequenced technical duplicates of Zika virus populations (1000 virus RNA copies each) to identify intrahost single-nucleotide variants (iSNVs) &gt; 3% within each sample. In vitro and in vivo samples were generated using Zika virus strain PRVABC59 (isolated from Puerto Rico, 2015) during infection of <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> Aag2 cells (derived from embryos), human HeLa cells (derived from cervical epithelial cells), <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> mosquitoes (orally infected), and Indian origin rhesus macaques (subcutaneously infected). For the in vitro and in vivo samples, where the reference population sequence is known, the iSNV frequencies were calculated by change in frequency from pre- to post-infection.

<italic>Culex</italic> mosquitoes and dead American crows were collected from San Diego County, CA, during 2015 to sequence West Nile virus from field samples (10,000 virus RNA copies each). The iSNV frequencies from the field samples are the minor allele frequencies (maximum frequency = 0.5) because the reference virus sequence was not known. For both (<bold>a</bold> and <bold>b</bold>), analysis was limited to regions of the genome with &gt; 400× coverage depth in the protein coding sequence and we masked amplicons with primer mismatches from our analysis (gray regions) for direct comparisons of intrahost genetic diversity</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13059_2018_1618_Fig7_HTML" id="MO7"/></fig></p>
      <p id="Par26">To demonstrate the types of analyses that can be performed with PrimalSeq and iVar, we compared the mosquito- and vertebrate-derived virus samples using several measures of intrahost diversity (Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>). We measured genetic richness (the number of iSNV sites; Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>a), complexity (uncertainty associated with randomly sampling an allele; Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>b), and distance (the sum of all iSNV frequencies; Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>c) of iSNVs &gt; 3% frequency. We did not analyze masked regions, so that only high confidence regions of the genome from all samples within the experiment were compared (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). We found that Zika virus genetic complexity and distance was significantly higher from populations derived from primate (Hela) cells than <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> (Aag2) cells (Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>). In vivo, however, our findings were reversed. Zika virus genetic richness and complexity were significantly higher in <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> bodies than primate (rhesus macaque) plasma (Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>). Furthermore, we found that the distribution of iSNV frequencies of the Zika virus populations was similar across different in vivo infections (Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>d). This finding indicates that the increased Zika virus diversity in mosquitoes was driven by more 3–20% iSNVs that were also common in macaques, and not by a few additional high frequency iSNVs. We found that from both Zika and West Nile virus field samples, genetic diversity was not significantly different between virus populations isolated from their mosquito vectors (<italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> or <italic>Culex</italic>) or vertebrate hosts (humans or birds), though the mosquito samples were more variable (Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>). We also compared measuring intrahost virus genetic diversity using a 3% iSNV cutoff (Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>) to using a 5% iSNV cutoff (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S2) and found the results mostly comparable, though some of the vector-host comparisons were no longer significant. Overall, our data suggest that virus diversity is highly dependent on the experimental and biological systems, and future uses of PrimalSeq will help identify the mechanisms underlying these evolutionary differences (Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>e).<fig id="Fig8"><label>Fig. 8</label><caption><p>Intrahost virus genetic diversity is dependent on the experimental and biological system.

    <title>Discussion</title>
    <p id="Par27">Understanding how RNA viruses evolve within hosts can help lead to breakthroughs in medicine and biology. Rapid developments in sequencing technologies are facilitating more research into these areas, yet usage of unvalidated tools and systematic biases can dramatically limit the utility of the results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. To address these concerns, we developed PrimalSeq [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] and validated it across different platforms and sample types. In our development of iVar we show that PrimalSeq can be used to accurately measure intrahost virus diversity from different viruses and samples with amplicon-based sequencing. Based on our experimental validations, we provide a detailed laboratory protocol (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>), and suggest the following best practices for measuring intrahost virus diversity when using amplicon-based sequencing approaches:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par28">Start with at least 1000 RNA copies of the virus for the initial cDNA synthesis step.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par29">Prepare the RNA from virus populations for sequencing in duplicate.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par30">Sequence each library to a depth of at least 400× at each genome position using the Illumina platform.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par31">Only call iSNVs greater than 3% frequency that are detected in both replicates (a lower frequency may be achievable with higher RNA quantities).</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par32">For multi-sample comparisons of genetic diversity, omit genome regions amplified with primers that contain iSNVs within the binding sites.</p></list-item></list></p>
    <p id="Par33">Several factors can alter the accuracy of measuring intrahost virus diversity. In particular, we found that input virus concentrations, sequencing coverage depths, and primer mismatches can have profound effects on iSNV estimations. Using the recommendations above, however, we could consistently and accurately detect iSNVs at 3% frequency and higher. We predict that the lower limit of iSNV detection can be improved with a higher effective sampling depth (i.e., more input virus and deeper coverage) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p>
    <p id="Par34">Given no primer mismatches to the virus sequences, we found that measures of iSNVs frequencies from PrimalSeq were nearly as accurate as an untargeted metagenomics approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Because iVar remove the primer sequences from downstream analysis and use overlapping amplicons, frequency measures of iSNVs within the primer regions themselves are not skewed. Instead, iSNVs within primer regions can alter the measured frequencies of other iSNVs within that particular amplicon. In these cases, results should be interpreted with caution, and we incorporated a step in iVar to mask out such regions for comparative analyses. It is plausible that using primers with degenerate nucleotides at mismatched iSNV positions could help alleviating this bias [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>].</p>
    <p id="Par35">False iSNV calls significantly influence measurements of intrahost virus diversity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. We found that the positive association of false positive iSNVs with sequencing read lengths better fit the profiles of Illumina sequencing errors, rather than PCR errors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. In fact, we estimate that the Illumina MiSeq error rate (~ 0.9% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]) is ~ 60× greater than the error rates during PCR in our approach (~ 0.02% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]). Therefore, PrimalSeq likely does not add significantly more error, and by extension false iSNVs, than what was already inherent to the Illumina sequencing platform. Indeed, we found that PrimalSeq was comparable to PCR-free metagenomic sequencing in estimating intrahost virus diversity.</p>
    <p id="Par36">The ease and portability of Oxford Nanopore technologies, particularly the MinION, are revolutionizing the way we sequence viruses, including its use in near real-time outbreak tracking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Our data indicate, however, that the Nanopore platform is not yet adequate for detection of minor alleles and measures of intrahost diversity. While it may provide value in tracking frequency changes of known iSNVs over time, we found that the high error rates (10–15% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]) makes it difficult to differentiate between true and false iSNV calls. We found that stringent post-filtering, such as combining iSNV frequencies and strand bias across comparing replicate samples, significantly reduce false positive iSNV calls, but there is still a high false discovery rate. Effectively using Nanopore sequencing for intrahost virus diversity measurements will require higher sequencing accuracy and base calling, exploitation of co-occurring variants (i.e., haplotyping) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>], or utilization of different molecular approaches, including the 1D<sup>2</sup> method (where template and complementary strands of each fragment are sequenced) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>], tandem repeat consensus techniques [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>] or unique molecular identifiers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>].</p>
    <p id="Par37">For viruses that utilize multiple hosts, like mosquito-borne viruses, being able to compare results from many samples types is critically important. A lack of standardization, however, means that the field does not yet have a consensus to whether the mosquito vector or the vertebrate host contributes the most to virus genetic diversity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>]. The development of PrimalSeq and iVar allows for such measurements to be performed across diverse environments, sample types, and experimental designs. Using PrimalSeq, for example, we found that in vitro Zika virus diversity was significantly greater in human cells, when compared to mosquito cells. However, we found that these results were reversed during in vivo studies. Furthermore, we did not detect significant differences in field-collected mosquito and vertebrate samples for both Zika and West Nile virus. A caveat for the field samples, however, is that we do not know the reference sequence and cannot account for consensus-changing mutations introduced through intrahost bottlenecks and genetic drift [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>]. In addition, a limitation for all of our samples is that we can only compare diversity measurements from iSNVs greater than 3% frequency, and iSNVs below this threshold may be important for the virus population structure and phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>]. Even still, our incongruent results among experimental designs help to explain why there is still debate about the relative impact of vectors and hosts on virus evolution, and further use of PrimalSeq will help to resolve these issues.</p>

We benchmarked our highly multiplexed and streamlined amplicon-based sequencing method using a series of experiments with mixed virus populations, developed an all-inclusive computational analysis tool (iVar), and showcase its utility by measuring intrahost virus diversity from cells, mosquitoes, primates, birds, and humans.

      <title>Quantification of virus RNA copies</title>
      <p id="Par45">Zika virus RNA copies were quantified using a qRT-PCR assay targeting the NS5 protein coding region of the genome using the BioRad One-step qRT-PCR for probes kit. In a 20-μL reaction, 2 μL of virus RNA was added to 10 μL of iTaq universal probes reaction mix, 0.5 μL of iScript RT, 6 μL of nuclease-free water, 0.5 μL of the forward primer (5′-AGTGCCAGAGCTGTGTGTAC-3′; genome positions 9007–9027), 0.5 μL of the reverse primer (5′-TCTAGCCCCTAGCCACATCT-3′; genome positions 9097–9117), and 0.5 μL of the 6-FAM labeled probe (5′-GGCAGCCGCGCCATCTGGT-3′; genome positions 9078–9096). The reactions were then amplified on a thermocycler with the following conditions: 50 °C for 10 min, 95 °C for 3 min, and followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C for 10 s and 57 °C for 10 s (fluorescence read at the end of the 57 °C step). To calculate the number of virus template copies using standard curves, we include 10-fold dilutions of partial Zika virus RNA genomes spanning the primer sites (10<sup>7</sup> to 10<sup>0</sup> copies per reaction). The Zika virus RNA standards were constructed by PCR amplifying a 848 bp segment of the Zika virus NS5 protein coding region (genome positions 8644 to 9492) with the following primers: forward containing a T7 promoter region (5′-TAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGATCAGGCTCCTGTCAAAACCC-3′; underlined = T7 promoter sequence; genome positions 8644–8664) and reverse primer (5′-AGTGACAACTTGTCCGCTCC-3′; genome positions 9472–9492). The amplified cDNA was converted into RNA to be used as standards using the Invitrogen MEGAscript T7 Transcription Kit.</p>
      <p id="Par46">The accuracy of measuring virus RNA copies by targeting one small genome region, in this case positions 9007–9117, is dependent on relatively equal proportions of the virus genome present in the sample. To address this, we used untargeted metagenomic sequencing of our 1000 RNA copy stocks of virus #1, virus #2, and three replicates of the Mix10% population. The normalized coverage shows that depth is consistent across the virus genome (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S3). The normalized coverage changes are consistent among virus samples and replicates, suggesting that coverage depth is more dependent on intrinsic factors of the virus genome influence replication efficiency (i.e., GC content [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>]) rather than significant RNA degradation leading to the loss of a fraction of the virus genome. Hence, we are confident that our qRT-PCR results are relatively informative for determining the virus RNA copy numbers across the whole genome.</p>
      <p id="Par47">For all Zika virus samples, 1000 virus RNA copies were used for sequencing, unless otherwise specified (e.g., Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>c). For all West Nile virus sample, 10,000 virus RNA copies were used. Normalizing input copy numbers allowed us to more accurately compare sequencing results.</p>

In brief, cDNA was generated as described for the amplicon-based methods. Second-strand cDNA was generated using <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> DNA ligase and polymerase (New England Biolabs). The cDNA was purified by Agencourt AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter) prior to library preparation using Nextera XT (Illumina) following the vendor’s protocols, but with less reagents.

After incubation, the reaction was stopped using 2.5 μL of Neutralize Tagment Buffer (one half recommended). The libraries were indexed and amplified using one half of the Nextera PCR reagents and primers in a 25-μL reaction. Agencourt AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter) were used for the final purification step (purified twice at a ratio of 0.7:1 beads to sample).

      <title>Illumina data processing and variant calling using iVar</title>
      <p id="Par51">We developed an open source software package to process virus sequencing data and call iSNVs from technical replicates, iVar (intrahost variant analysis from replicates), and detailed documentation can be found at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/andersen-lab/ivar">github.com/andersen-lab/ivar</ext-link> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>]. The tool is licensed under GNU General Public License v3.0 and the source code is available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/andersen-lab/ivar">github.com/andersen-lab/ivar</ext-link> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>]. The version of the code used in this paper is available at 10.5281/zenodo.2471612. A list of iVar commands and their brief descriptions are provided in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S5, and additional details about the options are available in the documentation and can also be accessed in the help menu distributed with the tool [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>]. iVar was used to write two pipelines for calling iSNVs from samples with or without the known reference sequence (i.e., experimental and field-collected samples, respectively; Fig. <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9</xref>). The software package was written in C++ and has two dependencies—HTSlib (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/samtools/htslib">github.com/samtools/htslib</ext-link>) and Awk (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~bwk/btl.mirror/">cs.princeton.edu/~bwk/btl.mirror/</ext-link>). Awk is generally available on most unix based operating systems and HTSlib has only one dependency—zlib (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://zlib.net/">zlib.net/</ext-link>). The output of `mpileup` command from the widely used SAMtools [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>] was used by the package to call iSNVs and generate a consensus sequence from an alignment. The computational pipeline was divided in four main sections: (1) alignment, (2) trimming, (3) constructing nucleotide matrices and scan for iSNVs within primer regions, and (4) statistical comparisons between replicate datasets. The paired-end reads were aligned to a provided reference genome using BWA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>]. The paired-end reads were not merged at any point in this process. The primer sequences were trimmed from the reads using a BED file, with the primer positions, followed by quality trimming. iSNVs above the frequency cutoff of 3% were then called using the `mpileup` command from SAMtools (maximum coverage depth cutoff was set to 0[“-d 0”], making the limit on depth the maximum limit of an signed 32 bit integer (i.e., 2,147,483,647). In addition to the frequency threshold, Fisher’s exact test was used to determine if the frequency of the iSNV is significantly higher than the mean error rate at that position (see contingency table, Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S6). Based on the iSNVs called, mismatches in the primer sequences were identified and the reads from the amplicon were removed. The variant calling step were repeated to remove any influence of the primer mismatch on iSNV frequencies.<fig id="Fig9"><label>Fig. 9</label><caption><p>Overview of iVar pipeline. iVar was used to construct two pipelines for calling intrahost single-nucleotide variants (iSNVs) from samples with and without a known reference sequence. The nodes in the chart are colored based on the usage of iVar, bwa, and SAMtools at each step. For samples with a known reference sequence, the primer sequences are trimmed from the sequenced reads, followed by quality trimming. A consensus sequence for the sample is called by merging the aligned BAM files from each replicate. The primer sequences are then aligned to this consensus sequence and mismatches are identified by iVar after performing variant calling on the aligned primers. The reads corresponding to the mismatched primers are removed from the aligned BAM file of each replicate to ensure that any bias introduced in the iSNV frequencies is removed. The iSNVs are then called for each replicate, individually, with a minimum frequency threshold of 3% and an intersection of the iSNVs across all the replicates are considered to be the “true” iSNVs. For samples with an unknown reference sequence, the iSNVs cannot be called directly using a reference sequence. In this case, after generating the consensus sequence, reads from each replicate are aligned back to this consensus sequence and these realigned BAM files are used for the same subsequent steps as in the case of samples with a known reference sequence</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13059_2018_1618_Fig9_HTML" id="MO9"/></fig></p>

      <title>Validation of iVar</title>
      <p id="Par52">iVar was validated against existing tools. (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S7, Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S4-S6). We validated iSNV calling in iVar against the `mpileup2snp` and `mpileup2indel` commands in VarScan2 (v2.3.9) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>] using four datasets—two simulated datasets and two clinical Zika virus samples, sequenced using PrimalSeq. We ran both tools with no thresholds and with a quality threshold of 20 and a minimum frequency threshold of 3%. We validated the consensus calling in iVar against the consensus calling available in Geneious (v11.1.4) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>] using four datasets—two simulated datasets and two clinical Zika virus samples, sequenced using PrimalSeq. We did the consensus calling at four different thresholds—0% (majority), 25%, 50% (strict), and 90%. We counted the mismatches between the resulting consensus sequences from iVar, Geneious and the reference sequence by performing a multiple sequence alignment using MAFFT (v7.388) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. While counting mismatches, we ignored mismatches when one sequence had a gap and the other had a “N,” since in either case. We validated primer trimming and quality trimming in iVar against anchored adapter trimming in cutadapt (v1.16) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>] and against Trimmomatic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. iVar uses a sliding window starting from the 5′ end and checks if the average quality within the window drops below the threshold. As soon as the quality drops below the threshold, it trims the sequence by soft clipping the read. This is different from the algorithm cutadapt uses to do quality trimming, but is similar to the sliding window approach used by Trimmomatic.

      <title>Oxford Nanopore sequencing and analysis</title>
      <p id="Par53">Using the same PCR amplicons used for amplicon-based Illumina sequencing, we sequenced three replicates of the mixed Zika virus population (90% virus #1, 10% virus #2) using the Oxford Nanopore GridION sequencer. Native, 1D barcode libraries (SQK-NSK007, Oxford Nanopore Technologies, UK) were prepared according to previously published methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], with three amplification replicates corresponding to barcodes 1, 2 and 3. The pooled sequencing library was sequenced on an R9.4 version flowcell (FLO-MIN106, Oxford Nanopore Technologies, UK). Reads were basecalled using Albacore 2.3.1 using the command-line read_fast5_basecaller.py -c r94_450bps_linear.cfg -i fast5 -o fastq -r -t 12. Reads were subsequently demultiplexed with Porechop 0.2.3_seqan2.1.1 using default (lenient) settings (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/rrwick/Porechop">github.com/rrwick/Porechop</ext-link>). A total of 2.4 million reads were generated which after alignment and trimming covered 95.66% of the reference genome (Genbank KX087101). For the purposes of assigning to genotypes (i.e., unique virus haplotypes), reads were assigned to individual strains using BWA-MEM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>] against a custom reference database comprising four Zika virus genomes: Genbank KX087101 (virus #1), KU955593 (virus #2), EU545988 (an Asian lineage virus isolated in 2007) and NC_012532 (MR766, an African lineage virus). Counts for each assignment were retrieved, ignoring multi-mapping reads using the shell command bwa mem -x ont2d | samtools view -h -F 256 - | samtools view -h -F 2048 - | cut -f 3 | sort | uniq -c. Next, each replicate was aligned to the PRVACB59 reference genome with BWA-MEM using setting -x ont2d. Primer binding sites and any residual adaptor sequence were masked in the resulting BAM alignment using the align_trim script from the Zibra pipeline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Allele frequencies and putative iSNVs (ignoring insertions or deletions) were extracted from BAM files using a Python script freqs.py (included in the accompanying code repository: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/nickloman/zika-isnv">github.com/nickloman/zika-isnv</ext-link> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref>]). This script utilizes the pileup functionality of samtools via the pysam Python interface module (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/pysam-developers/pysam">github.com/pysam-developers/pysam</ext-link>). Only predicted variants with more than 10 supporting forward and 10 supporting reverse reads were considered.

For the Zika and West Nile virus field samples, where the ancestral virus sequence was not known, the derived iSNV frequencies were used for the population genetic analysis.

      <title>Ethics approval and consent to participate</title>
      <p>Research on human subjects was conducted in compliance with existing regulations relating to the protection of human subjects and was evaluated and approved (#IRB-15-6664) by the Institutional Review Board/Ethics Review Committee at The Scripps Research Institute. Clinical samples were obtained from the Florida Department of Health (DOH) and Antibody Systems Inc. Samples collected in Florida were collected under a waiver of consent granted by the Florida DOH Human Research Protection Program. The work received a non-human subjects research designation (category 4 exemption) by the Florida DOH since this research was performed with leftover clinical diagnostic samples involving no more than minimal risk. Hence, written informed consent was not obtained. All samples were de-identified prior to receipt by the study investigators. The experimental methods used comply with the Helsinki Declaration.</p>
      <p>Research involving Indian origin rhesus macaques was conducted at the California National Primate Research Center, and experimental infections of mice upon which <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> mosquitoes fed were performed at the University of California, Davis, School of Veterinary Medicine. Both institutes are fully accredited by the Association for the Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International. Animals were cared for in accordance with the National Research Council Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and the Animal Welfare Act. Animal experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of UC Davis (protocols #19211 and #19695 for rhesus macaques, protocol #19404 for mice). All macaques samples used in this study were from approved studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>]; and none were generated specifically for this work.</p>
