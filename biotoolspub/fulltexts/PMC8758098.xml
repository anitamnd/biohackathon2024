    <abstract>
      <p>The spread of pathogens fundamentally depends on the underlying contacts between individuals. Modeling the dynamics of infectious disease spread through contact networks, however, can be challenging due to limited knowledge of how an infectious disease spreads and its transmission rate. We developed a novel statistical tool, INoDS (Identifying contact Networks of infectious Disease Spread) that estimates the transmission rate of an infectious disease outbreak, establishes epidemiological relevance of a contact network in explaining the observed pattern of infectious disease spread and enables model comparison between different contact network hypotheses. We show that our tool is robust to incomplete data and can be easily applied to datasets where infection timings of individuals are unknown. We tested the reliability of INoDS using simulation experiments of disease spread on a synthetic contact network and find that it is robust to incomplete data and is reliable under different settings of network dynamics and disease contagiousness compared with previous approaches. We demonstrate the applicability of our method in two host-pathogen systems: <italic toggle="yes">Crithidia bombi</italic> in bumblebee colonies and Salmonella in wild Australian sleepy lizard populations. INoDS thus provides a novel and reliable statistical tool for identifying transmission pathways of infectious disease spread. In addition, application of INoDS extends to understanding the spread of novel or emerging infectious disease, an alternative approach to laboratory transmission experiments, and overcoming common data-collection constraints.</p>

      <title>Author summary</title>
      <p>Network models are widely used to understand and predict infectious disease spread in human and animal populations. However, the choice of network model often relies on subjective expert knowledge or disease transmission experiments that are time-consuming and difficult to perform. We developed a novel tool, called INoDS (Identifying contact Networks of infectious Disease Spread), that uses robust statistical approach to establish relevance of a network model in explaining transmission pathways of an infectious disease outbreak. We used computer simulations and real-world dataset to test the accuracy of our tool and robustness to missing data. We found that INoDS is robust to common data-collection constraints, broadly applicable and accurate compared to current approaches. The tool that we have developed can therefore provide immediate epidemiological insights in the event of an epidemic outbreak, and can be used to improve targeted disease control.</p>

    <title>Introduction</title>
    <p>Host contacts, whether direct or indirect, play a fundamental role in the spread of infectious diseases [<xref rid="pcbi.1009604.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>–<xref rid="pcbi.1009604.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Traditional epidemiological models make assumptions of homogeneous social structure and mixing among hosts which can yield unreliable predictions of infectious disease spread [<xref rid="pcbi.1009604.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1009604.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>–<xref rid="pcbi.1009604.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Network approaches provide an alternative to modeling infection transmission by explicitly incorporating host interactions that mediate pathogen transmission. Formally, in a contact network model, individuals are represented as nodes, and an edge between two nodes represents an interaction that has the potential to transmit infection. A dynamic contact network model tracks interactions evolving over time due to social, demographic or environmental processes as well as perturbations [<xref rid="pcbi.1009604.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Constructing a complete contact network model requires (i) knowledge about the transmission route(s) of a pathogen, (ii) a sampling of all individuals in a population, and (iii) a sampling of all interactions among the sampled individuals that may lead to infection transfer. In addition, accuracy of disease predictions depends on the precise epidemiological knowledge about the pathogen, including the rate of pathogen transfer given a contact between two individuals, and the rate of recovery of infected individuals.</p>
    <p>The use of modern technology in recent years, including RFID, GPS, radio tags, proximity loggers and automated video tracking has enabled the collection of detailed movement and contact data, making network modeling feasible. Despite the technology, logistical and financial constraints still prevent data collection on all individuals and their social contacts [<xref rid="pcbi.1009604.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>–<xref rid="pcbi.1009604.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. More importantly, limited knowledge about a host-pathogen system makes it challenging to identify the mode of infection transmission, define the relevant contacts between individuals that may lead to infection transfer, and measure the per-contact rate of infection transmission [<xref rid="pcbi.1009604.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>–<xref rid="pcbi.1009604.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Laboratory techniques of unraveling transmission mechanisms usually take years to resolve [<xref rid="pcbi.1009604.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>–<xref rid="pcbi.1009604.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Defining accurate contact networks underlying infection transmission in human infectious disease has been far from trivial [<xref rid="pcbi.1009604.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1009604.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1009604.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. For animal infectious disease, limited information on host behavior and the epidemiological characteristics of the spreading pathogen makes it particularly difficult to define a precise contact network, which has severely limited the scope of network modeling in animal and wildlife epidemiology [<xref rid="pcbi.1009604.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1009604.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p>
    <p>Lack of knowledge about disease transmission mechanisms has prompted the use of several indirect approaches to identify the link between social structure and disease spread. A popular approach has been to explore the association between social network position (usually quantified as network degree) of an individual and its risk of acquiring infection [<xref rid="pcbi.1009604.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>–<xref rid="pcbi.1009604.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Another approach is to use proxy behaviors, such as movement, spatial proximity or home-range overlap, to measure direct and indirect contact networks occurring between individuals [<xref rid="pcbi.1009604.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>–<xref rid="pcbi.1009604.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. A recent approach, called the <italic toggle="yes">k</italic>-test procedure, explores a direct association between infectious disease spread and a contact network by comparing the number of infectious contacts of infected cases to that of uninfected cases [<xref rid="pcbi.1009604.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. However, several challenges remain in identifying the underlying contact networks of infection spread that are not addressed by these approaches. First, it is often unclear how contact intensity (e.g. duration, frequency, distance) relates to the risk of infection transfer unless validated by transmission experiments [<xref rid="pcbi.1009604.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Furthermore, the role of weak ties (i.e., low-intensity contacts) in pathogen transfer is ambiguous [<xref rid="pcbi.1009604.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1009604.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. The interaction network of any social group will appear as a fully connected network if monitored for a long period of time. As fully-connected contact networks rarely reflect the dynamics of infectious disease spread through a host population, one may ask whether weak ties can be ignored, or what constitutes an appropriate intensity threshold below which interactions are epidemiologically irrelevant? Second, many previous approaches ignore the dynamic nature of host contacts. The formation and dissolution of contacts over time is crucial in determining the order in which contacts occur, which in turn regulates the spread of infectious diseases through host networks [<xref rid="pcbi.1009604.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1009604.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1009604.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Finally, none of the existing approaches allow direct comparison of competing hypotheses about disease transmission mechanisms which may generate distinct contact patterns and consequently different contact network models.</p>
    <p>All of these challenges demand an approach that can allow direct comparison between competing hypothesis on transmission pathways while taking into account the dynamics of host interactions and constraints of data sampling. We introduce a statistical tool called INoDS (<italic toggle="yes">I</italic>dentifying contact <italic toggle="yes">N</italic>etworks <italic toggle="yes">o</italic>f infectious <italic toggle="yes">D</italic>isease <italic toggle="yes">S</italic>pread) that establishes the epidemiological relevance of observed contact networks in explaining the patterns of infectious disease spread. INoDS also allows testing competing hypotheses on the mode of disease transmission by performing model comparison between different contact networks. The tool can estimate the per-contact transmission rate and recovery rate for various disease progressions (e.g. SI, SIS and SIR) and can be extended to incorporate complexities in transmission (e.g. individual-level heterogeneity in susceptibility; latent period following infection). INoDS provides inference on static and dynamic contact networks, and is robust to common forms of missing data. Using two empirical datasets, we highlight the two-fold application of INoDS—(<italic toggle="yes">i</italic>) to identify whether observed patterns of infectious disease spread are likely given an empirical contact network, and (<italic toggle="yes">ii</italic>) to identify transmission routes, the role of the contact intensity, and the per contact transmission rate of a host-pathogen system. The epidemiological insights into infectious disease provided by INoDS can be invaluable in implementing immediate disease control measures in the event of an emerging epidemic outbreak.</p>

    <title>Results</title>
    <p>The primary purpose of INoDS is to evaluate whether an observed contact network is likely to generate an infection time-series observed in a particular host population. INoDS also provides epidemiological insights into the spreading pathogen by estimating the per-contact rate of transmission (<italic toggle="yes">β</italic>). The pattern of infectious disease spread in a host population depends on the mode of transmission, and the epidemiological relevance of contact network is sensitive to the amount of collected data on nodes and edges. The tool therefore treats each empirically collected contact network as a unique network hypothesis, and facilitates hypothesis testing between different contact networks.</p>
    <p>The INoDS algorithm follows a three step procedure (<xref rid="pcbi.1009604.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>). First, the tool estimates a per-contact transmission rate (<italic toggle="yes">β</italic>) of the pathogen and an background transmission parameter (<italic toggle="yes">ϵ</italic>). The <italic toggle="yes">β</italic> parameter quantifies the per-contact rate of pathogen transmission, and the <italic toggle="yes">ϵ</italic> parameter quantifies components of infection transmission that are unexplained by the contact network (<xref rid="pcbi.1009604.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig</xref>). In the second step, Bayesian hypothesis testing is performed to establish epidemiological relevance of the observed contact network. Null hypothesis is expressed as a uniform distribution over randomized networks generated by permuting 10%—100% edge connections of each time-slice using double-edge swap procedure [<xref rid="pcbi.1009604.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] and assigning each edge the average edge weight of the original snapshot. In the final step, model selection between multiple contact network hypotheses is performed using Bayes Factor.</p>

        <p><bold>Observed data</bold>(left panel): INoDS utilizes an observed infection time-series data to estimate statistical evidence towards a static or dynamic contact network hypothesis (or hypotheses) using a three-step procedure. Shown here is an example of two competing network hypotheses based on behaviors A and B that potentially cause infection transfer. <bold>Inferential steps</bold> (right panel): In the first step, the tool estimates per-contact transmission rate parameter <italic toggle="yes">β</italic>, and background transmission rate parameter <italic toggle="yes">ϵ</italic> which captures the components of infection propagation unexplained by the edge connections of the network hypothesis. Here, the total infected connections of the focal node <italic toggle="yes">i</italic> (<italic toggle="yes">k</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">i</italic></sub>) is 2. Second, to estimate the epidemiological relevance of the network hypothesis, Bayesian hypothesis testing is performed. The prior distribution shows that the null hypothesis (<italic toggle="yes">M</italic> = 1) assumes a uniform distribution over randomized networks generated by permuting 10%—100% of edge connections in the contact network (<italic toggle="yes">H</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">A</italic></sub>), whereas the alternate hypothesis (<italic toggle="yes">M</italic> = 2) is a spike-shaped distribution such that only the contact network (<italic toggle="yes">H</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">A</italic></sub>, 0% permutation) has non-zero probability. The distribution on model index shifts to M = 2 if the alternate hypothesis has higher posterior probability than the null. Third, model selection of competing network hypotheses is performed using Bayes Factor (BF). A Bayes factor above 2.44 is considered to be decisive support for one hypothesis over the other.</p>

    <p>In the sections that follow, we validate each of the three steps of INoDS, assess its robustness to missing data and compare its performance with previous approaches by performing simulation experiments of disease spread on a synthetic contact network. The advantage of using a simulated dataset is that it allows accurate evaluation of INoDS performance. We further demonstrate the applicability of INoDS in two empirical datasets: (<italic toggle="yes">i</italic>) spread of an intestinal pathogen in bumble bee colonies, and (<italic toggle="yes">ii</italic>) salmonella spread in Australian sleepy lizards.</p>
    <sec id="sec003">
      <title>Validating INoDS performance</title>
      <p>We validated the performance of INoDS using a simulated dataset. This dataset was generated by performing numerical disease simulations on a synthetic dynamic network (henceforth called the true synthetic network) where per-contact transmission rate, <italic toggle="yes">β</italic>, ranged from 0.01 to 0.1.</p>
      <p><bold>Validation of step 1</bold>: <xref rid="pcbi.1009604.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2a</xref> shows INoDS estimates of <italic toggle="yes">β</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">ϵ</italic> each for 10 independent disease simulations of the synthetic pathogen with disease contagiousness ranging from 0.01 to 0.1. We found that INoDS accurately estimated the per-contact transmission rate <italic toggle="yes">β</italic>, and background transmission rate <italic toggle="yes">ϵ</italic> for the simulated dataset. The accuracy was independent of the pathogen’s contagiousness. For example, we estimated an average <italic toggle="yes">β</italic> value of 0.039 (SD = 0.003) using INoDS for disease simulations involving a simulated pathogen with <italic toggle="yes">β</italic> value of 0.04. The background transmission parameter, <italic toggle="yes">ϵ</italic>, was accurately estimated as zero for all simulations since all infection transmission events in the simulated dataset were perfectly explained by the edge connections of the contact network (<xref rid="pcbi.1009604.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2a</xref>).</p>

      </fig>
      <p><bold>Validation of step 2</bold>: The second step, which involves establishing the epidemiological relevance of the contact network, was evaluated by performing Bayesian hypothesis testing. Prior was defined as an ensemble of randomized networks with 10%–100% permuted edge connections. We found that log Bayes factor of observed network was more than 2.44 for all ranges of <italic toggle="yes">β</italic>, indicating that INoDS accurately detected epidemiological relevance of the contact network irrespective of contagiousness of the spreading pathogen (<xref rid="pcbi.1009604.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2b</xref>).</p>
      <p><bold>Validation of step 3</bold>: Where multiple hypotheses of contact networks exists, model selection is performed by computing the ratio of marginal likelihoods (Bayesian evidence). We validated this step by comparing the Bayesian evidence of the true synthetic network with networks generated by shuffling 25%, 50%, 75% and 100% of edge connections present in the true synthetic network. We found that log Bayes factor of the true synthetic contact network was more than 2.44 for most replicates compared with randomized networks when <italic toggle="yes">β</italic>* = 0.01. Log Bayes factor exceeded 10 for synthetic pathogens with transmission rates <italic toggle="yes">β</italic>* &gt; 0.01, suggesting a decisive evidence for the true synthetic network (<xref rid="pcbi.1009604.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2c</xref>).</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec004">
      <title>Robustness to missing network data</title>
      <p>Next, we tested the robustness of INoDS against two potential sources of error in network data collection: incomplete sampling of individuals in a population (missing nodes) and incomplete sampling of interactions between individuals (missing edges). To create networks with missing data, we randomly deleted 25–75% of nodes and edges from the true synthetic network that were not a part of the path of simulated infection spread. We focus on this type of missing data as infected individuals and their contact are more likely to be observed (particularly for infections with observable symptoms). Methodologically, this approach also allows us to tease apart INoDS’s performance when both the complete and incomplete networks have equal ability to explain the propagation of disease. If robust to missing data, we expect INoDS to recover the same parameter estimates and model evidence as the true and complete synthetic network.</p>
      <p>We found that even when 75% of network data is missing, the estimated transmission rate <italic toggle="yes">β</italic> is identical to <italic toggle="yes">β</italic> values estimated for the complete synthetic network (<xref rid="pcbi.1009604.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3a</xref>). For all incompletely sampled networks, log Bayes factor was greater than 2.44 compared to the null hypothesis. INoDS thus correctly identified all incompletely sampled networks to be epidemiological relevant (<xref rid="pcbi.1009604.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3b</xref>). As expected, log Bayes factor was less than 2.44 for all degrees of missing data indicating that the true synthetic network does not have higher evidence compared with incompletely sampled networks. Together, we found that the performance of INoDS was unaffected by missing network data if the missing nodes/edges are not a part of the outbreak path.</p>

          <p>Robustness of INoDS to missing nodes and missing edges in network hypothesis. Networks with missing nodes/edges were created by randomly removing 25–75% of nodes/edges not involved in infection spread path at each time-step from the dynamic synthetic network. (a) Step 1: Δ<italic toggle="yes">β</italic> is the relative deviation of estimated transmission parameter <italic toggle="yes">β</italic> from the true transmission rate <italic toggle="yes">β</italic>*. (b) Step 2: Epidemiological relevance of observed network with missing data. Each box summarizes log Bayes factor of observed network with missing data compared to null hypothesis (viz a prior of networks with 10% to 100% permuted edges). (c) Evidence for the true synthetic network over datasets with missing data. Log Bayes factor of more than 2.44 (dashed line) is considered to be a strong support in favor of the observed contact network. The middle black line in each box plot is the median, the boxed area extends from the 25th to 75th quartile, and whiskers extended from the hinge to the largest/smallest value no further than 1.5 times the inter-quartile range.</p>

      </fig>
      <p>In the supplement, we tested the performance of INoDS when data is missing at random for nodes, edges or cases (<xref rid="pcbi.1009604.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Fig</xref>). We found that the deviation of estimated <italic toggle="yes">β</italic> increases with the degree of missing data, and networks with missing data had lower evidence compared with the true synthetic network. This is because removing nodes/edges involved in the transmission process lowers the network’s ability to explain the propagation of disease outbreak. Additionally, removing cases (i.e., infected status from nodes) from the infection time-series results in lower quality infection data compared to data where all infection events are documented.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec005">
      <title>Comparison with previous approaches</title>
      <p>Next, we compared INoDS with two previous approaches that have been used to establish an association between infection spread and contact network in a host population—the <italic toggle="yes">k</italic>-test and network position test. The <italic toggle="yes">k</italic>-test procedure involves estimating the mean infected degree (i.e., number of direct infected contacts) of each infected individual in the network, called the <italic toggle="yes">k</italic>-statistic. The <italic toggle="yes">p</italic>-value in the <italic toggle="yes">k</italic>-test is calculated by comparing the observed <italic toggle="yes">k</italic>-statistic to a distribution of null <italic toggle="yes">k</italic>-statistics which is generated by randomizing the node-labels of infection cases in the network [<xref rid="pcbi.1009604.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Network position test compares the degree of infected individuals to that of uninfected individuals [<xref rid="pcbi.1009604.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1009604.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1009604.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The observed network is considered to be epidemiologically relevant when the difference in average degree between infected and uninfected individuals exceeds the degree difference in an ensemble of randomized networks at 5% significance level. Both these previous approaches only provide evidence for static networks by comparison with a null expectation. We therefore performed comparisons with step 2 of INoDS where epidemiological relevance of a network hypothesis is evaluated. To do so, we performed simulations of infection with <italic toggle="yes">β</italic> ranging from 0.01 to 0.1, corresponding to disease prevalence of 8.1% to 99.8%, respectively.</p>
      <p>We found that INoDS accurately established epidemiological relevance across a wide range of <italic toggle="yes">β</italic> when no network or disease data was missing. At <italic toggle="yes">β</italic> = 0.01, however, the power of the model is lower compared to the <italic toggle="yes">k</italic>-test (<xref rid="pcbi.1009604.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4</xref>). For values of <italic toggle="yes">beta</italic> beyond 0.01, the performance of INoDS in establishing epidemiological relevance surpasses two previous approaches—the <italic toggle="yes">k</italic>-test procedure and the network position test. The power of the <italic toggle="yes">k</italic>-test in detecting epidemiological relevance of an observed contact network decreases with an increasing amount of missing data and transmission rate of pathogen. Of the three approaches, the network position test has the lowest power in detecting epidemiological relevance.</p>

      <title>Applications to empirical data-sets</title>
      <p>We next demonstrate the application of INoDS to perform hypothesis testing on contact networks, identify transmission mechanisms and infer transmission rate using two empirical datasets. The first dataset is derived from the study by Otterstatter &amp; Thomson [<xref rid="pcbi.1009604.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] that examines the spread of an intestinal pathogen (<italic toggle="yes">Crithidia bombi</italic>) within colonies of the social bumble bee, <italic toggle="yes">Bombus impatiens</italic>. The second dataset documents the spread of <italic toggle="yes">Salmonella enterica</italic> within two wild populations of Australian sleepy lizards <italic toggle="yes">Tiliqua rugosa</italic> [<xref rid="pcbi.1009604.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. We chose these two empirical datasets because they represented two distinct (i) host taxonomic class, (ii) models of disease spread (SI vs SIS), and (iii) disease data collection methodology (infection timing known for bumble bee dataset vs unknown for sleepy lizard dataset, and (iv) network connectivity (fully connected in bumble bees vs sparsely connected in sleepy lizards).</p>
      <sec id="sec007">
        <title>Determining transmission mechanism and the role of contact intensity: Case study of <italic toggle="yes">Crithidia bombi</italic> in bumble bees</title>
        <p>[<xref rid="pcbi.1009604.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] showed that the transmission of gut protozons, <italic toggle="yes">Crithidia bombi</italic>, in bumble bee colonies is associated with the frequency of contacts with infected nest-mates rather than the duration of contacts. The dynamic contact networks in the experiments were fully connected, i.e., all individuals were connected to each other in the network at all time steps. We extended the previous analysis by answering two specific questions: (1) Does the type of contact (frequency vs duration) matter in transmission?, and (2) Do contact intensity (i.e, the edge weights) between individuals contribute to infection transfer? We performed analyses on two types of contact network hypotheses—those are described by frequency of contacts and those that are described by duration of contacts—and compared the results with the findings reported in [<xref rid="pcbi.1009604.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>].</p>
        <p>To answer the two questions, we constructed dynamic contact networks where edges represent close proximity between individuals. Since fully connected networks rarely describe the dynamics of infection spread, we sequentially removed edges with weights less than 5–50% of the highest edge weight to generate contact network hypotheses at different edge weight thresholds. Corresponding to the two types (frequency and duration) of weighted networks, unweighted contact networks were also constructed by replacing weighted edges in the thresholded weighted networks with binary edges (i.e., edges with an edge weight of one).</p>
        <p><xref rid="pcbi.1009604.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref> shows the estimates of pathogen transmission rate <italic toggle="yes">β</italic> for the four types of contact network hypotheses at different edge weight thresholds. We found only a few contact network hypotheses were epidemiologically relevant (bars with asterisks). Weighted frequency networks had highest evidence for colonies QC6 and UN1 and at 35% and 5% edge-weight threshold respectively (bars with red asterisks). Our results therefore show that contact frequency, rather than duration, better explained the spread of the <italic toggle="yes">Crithidia bombi</italic> through bumble bee colonies. We also found that contact intensity, quantified through edge weights, is important in explaining pathogen spread.</p>

        <title>Identifying transmission mechanisms with imperfect disease data: Case study of <italic toggle="yes">Salmonella enterica</italic> Australian sleepy lizards</title>
        <p>Spatial proximity is known to be an important factor in the transmission of <italic toggle="yes">Salmonella enterica</italic> within Australian sleepy lizard populations [<xref rid="pcbi.1009604.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. However, it is not known whether the transmission risk increases with frequency of proximate encounters between infectious and susceptible lizards. We therefore tested two contact network hypotheses to explain the spread of salmonella at two sites of wild sleepy lizards populations. The first contact network hypothesis placed binary edges between lizards if they were ever within 14m distance from each other during a day (24 hours). We constructed the second contact network by assigning edge weights proportional to the number of times two lizards were recorded within 14m distance of each other during a day.</p>
        <p>Because disease sampling was performed at regular fortnightly intervals, the true infection time (day) of individuals at both study sites was unknown. We therefore used a data augmentation method in INoDS (see <xref rid="sec010" ref-type="sec">Materials &amp; methods</xref>) to sample unobserved infection timings along with the per contact transmission rate, <italic toggle="yes">β</italic>, and error, <italic toggle="yes">ϵ</italic>. We found that weighted network was epidemiologically relevant at site 2 but not at site 1 (<xref rid="pcbi.1009604.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6</xref>). Proximity networks with weighted edges had higher marginal (Bayesian) evidence compared with binary networks at both sites. This suggests that the occurrence of repeated contacts between two spatially proximate individuals, rather than just the presence of contact between individuals is more explanatory of Salmonella transmission in sleepy lizards.</p>

    <title>Discussion</title>
    <p>In this study we present INoDS as a tool that performs network model selection and establishes the statistical significance of a contact network model to describe the spread of infectious diseases. Our method also provides epidemiological insights about the host-pathogen system by enabling hypothesis testing on different transmission mechanisms, and estimating pathogen transmission rates. Unlike previous approaches that rely on social network position [<xref rid="pcbi.1009604.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>–<xref rid="pcbi.1009604.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], proxy behaviors [<xref rid="pcbi.1009604.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>–<xref rid="pcbi.1009604.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] or connectivity [<xref rid="pcbi.1009604.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], we show that our method is robust to missing network data, imperfect disease surveillance, can provide inference for dynamic networks and a range of disease progression models. Additionally, our tool overcomes a common challenge of imperfect knowledge of infection acquisition by assuming infection times to be unobserved and using data on infection <italic toggle="yes">diagnosis</italic> instead to provide inference on contact networks.</p>
    <p>In principle, the background transmission rate parameter, <italic toggle="yes">ϵ</italic>, in INoDS is similar to the asocial learning rate used in the network based diffusion analysis approach in the behavior learning literature [<xref rid="pcbi.1009604.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1009604.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. The background transmission parameter in our model serves to approximately assess transmission which is unexplained by the edge connections of the network hypothesis. Under the scenario of a network hypothesis with no edges, the best fit <italic toggle="yes">ϵ</italic> would indicate that all disease data is generated by unobserved transmission. Any transmission events that can be better explained by a network edge reduce the model’s expectation from this maximum <italic toggle="yes">ϵ</italic> estimate. Relative deviation of <italic toggle="yes">ϵ</italic> from the maximum possible value is therefore highest for a network hypothesis with no missing data. The relative deviation of <italic toggle="yes">ϵ</italic> declines with increasing missing data, although it is more sensitive to missing network information compared with missing information in infection time-series data (<xref rid="pcbi.1009604.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4 Fig</xref>).</p>
    <p>Our work thus addresses a growing subfield in network epidemiology that leverages statistical tools to infer contact networks using all available host and disease data [<xref rid="pcbi.1009604.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1009604.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1009604.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>–<xref rid="pcbi.1009604.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Our approach can be used to tackle several fundamental challenges in the field of infectious disease modeling [<xref rid="pcbi.1009604.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1009604.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. First, INoDS can be used to perform model selection on contact network models that quantify different transmission modes; this approach facilitates the identification of infection-transmitting contacts and does not rely on laboratory experimentation (or subjective expert knowledge). Second, INoDS can be used to establish the statistical significance of proxy measures of contact (such as spatial proximity, home-range overlap or asynchronous refuge use) in cases where data on direct interactions between hosts are limited. Third, INoDS can establish the epidemiological role of edge weights in a contact network by performing model selection of contact networks with similar edge connections but different edge weighting criteria.</p>
    <p>In the first empirical example involving the spread of the <italic toggle="yes">Crithidia</italic> gut protozoan in bumble bee colonies, we demonstrate that contact networks weighted with respect to frequency, rather than duration, explain the observed patterns of transmission. Our results therefore support the original finding of the study [<xref rid="pcbi.1009604.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], where individual risk of infection was found to be correlated with contact rate with infected nest-mates. We further found that weak ties below a certain edge weight threshold do not play an important role in infection transfer for this empirical system. In the second empirical dataset, we found that frequency of contacts between closely located lizards allows better, i.e. more consistent, predictions on Salmonella transmission. Our results supports results from a previous study which suggests that the bacterial transmission in Australian sleepy lizards occur between closely located animals [<xref rid="pcbi.1009604.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>].</p>
    <p>As with all models, the results from INoDS should be considered within the context of model assumptions. First, we assumed that the infection process has no latent period. In the future, disease latency can be incorporated into the model by using a data augmentation technique, similar to what we use for inferring infection times. Second, we assumed that the infectiousness of infected hosts and susceptibility of naive hosts is equal for all individuals in the population. Heterogeneity in infectiousness of infected hosts and the susceptibility of naive hosts can be incorporated as random effects in the model. Third, in the current version of our model, we do not consider re-infection of hosts. Re-infectivity of hosts can be easily incorporated by allowing multiple time-points of infection acquisition in <xref rid="pcbi.1009604.e002" ref-type="disp-formula">Eq (2)</xref>.</p>
    <p>Our results show that the data-collection efforts should aim to sample as many individuals in the population as possible, since missing nodes have the greatest impact (rather than missing edges) on the statistical significance of network models. Since data-collection for network analysis can be labor-intensive and time-consuming, our approach can be used to make essential decisions on how limited data collection resources should be deployed. For example, under a limited capability of recording real-time interactions between hosts, INoDS can identify the minimum time-resolution required during data collection for a network model with sufficient statistical ability to establish epidemiological relevance. Our approach can also be used to improve targeted disease management and control by identifying high-risk behaviors and super-spreaders of a novel pathogen without relying on intensive transmission experiments that take years to resolve.</p>

    <title>Materials &amp; methods</title>
    <p>Here we describe INoDs (Identifying contact Networks of infectious Disease Spread), a computational tool that (<italic toggle="yes">i</italic>) estimates per contact transmission rate (<italic toggle="yes">β</italic>) of infectious disease for empirical contact networks, (<italic toggle="yes">ii</italic>) establishes the epidemiological relevance of a contact network by performing Bayesian hypothesis testing, and (<italic toggle="yes">iii</italic>) enables discrimination of competing contact network hypotheses, including those based on pathogen transmission mode, edge weight criteria and data collection techniques. Two types of data are required as input for INoDS—infection time-series data, which include infection diagnoses (coded as 0 = not infected and 1 = infected), and time-step of diagnosis for all available individuals in the population; and an edge-list of a dynamic (or static) contact network. An edge-list format is a list of node pairs (each node pair represents an edge of the network), along with the weight assigned to the interaction, and time-step of interaction, with one node pair per line. The tool can be used for unweighted contact networks—an edge weight of one is assigned to all edges in this case. Time-steps of interactions are not required when analysis is performed on static contact networks. The software, implemented in Python, is platform independent, and is freely available at <ext-link xlink:href="https://github.com/bansallab/INoDS-model" ext-link-type="uri">https://github.com/bansallab/INoDS-model</ext-link>.

      <p>For a susceptible individual, the potential of acquiring infection at each time-step depends on the per contact transmission rate, the total strength of interactions with its infected neighbors at the previous time-step, and a parameter <italic toggle="yes">ϵ</italic> that captures the force of infection that is not explained by the individual’s social connections.

        <title>Parameter estimation and data augmentation of infection timings</title>
        <p>We used <monospace>DynamicNestedSampler</monospace> of <italic toggle="yes">dynesty</italic> package implemented in Python to estimate Bayesian posteriors and evidences [<xref rid="pcbi.1009604.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Nested sampling is a numerical method of simultaneously estimating both the posterior and evidence by maintaining a set of samples from the prior, and iteratively updating them subject to the constraint that new samples have higher likelihoods. Dynamic nested sampling allows the samples to be allocated adaptively, maximizing both accuracy and efficiency [<xref rid="pcbi.1009604.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. We assumed a uniform prior distribution for <italic toggle="yes">β</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">ϵ</italic> parameters with range [0, 10].</p>
        <p>Calculation of the likelihood in <xref rid="pcbi.1009604.e002" ref-type="disp-formula">Eq 2</xref> requires knowledge of exact timing of infection, <italic toggle="yes">t</italic><sub>1</sub>, …<italic toggle="yes">t</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">n</italic></sub>, for <italic toggle="yes">n</italic> infected individuals in the population. However in many cases, the only data available are the timings of when individuals in a populations were <italic toggle="yes">diagnosed</italic> to be infected, <italic toggle="yes">d</italic><sub>1</sub>, …<italic toggle="yes">d</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">n</italic></sub>. We therefore employ a Bayesian data augmentation approach to estimate the actual infection timings in the disease dataset [<xref rid="pcbi.1009604.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Since in this case the infection time <italic toggle="yes">t</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">i</italic></sub> for an individual <italic toggle="yes">i</italic> is unobserved, we only know that <italic toggle="yes">t</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">i</italic></sub> lies between the interval (<italic toggle="yes">L</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">i</italic></sub>, <italic toggle="yes">d</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">i</italic></sub>], where <italic toggle="yes">L</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">i</italic></sub> is the last negative diagnosis of individual <italic toggle="yes">i</italic> before infection acquisition. Within this interval, the individual could have potentially acquired infection at any time-step where it was in contact with other individuals in the network. Assuming incubation period to be one time-step, the potential set of infection timing can be represented as <italic toggle="yes">t</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">i</italic></sub> ∈ {<italic toggle="yes">g</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">i</italic></sub>(<italic toggle="yes">t</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">i</italic></sub> − 1) &gt; 0, <italic toggle="yes">L</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">i</italic></sub> &lt; <italic toggle="yes">t</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">i</italic></sub> ≤ <italic toggle="yes">d</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">i</italic></sub>}, where <italic toggle="yes">g</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">i</italic></sub>(<italic toggle="yes">t</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">i</italic></sub> − 1) is the degree (number of contacts) of individual <italic toggle="yes">i</italic> at time <italic toggle="yes">t</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">i</italic></sub> − 1. For infections that follow a SIS or SIR disease model, it is also essential to impute the recovery time of infected individuals for accurate estimation of infected degree. To do so, we adopt a similar data augmentation approach as described to sample from the set of possible recovery time-points.</p>
        <p>The data augmentation proceeds in two steps. In the first step, the missing infection times are imputed conditional on the possible set of infection times. In the next step the posterior distributions of the unknown parameters are sampled based on the imputed data. We performed data imputation using inverse transform sampling method, which is a technique of drawing random samples from any probability distribution given its cumulative distribution function [<xref rid="pcbi.1009604.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>].</p>

        <p>We performed Bayesian hypothesis testing to establish the epidemiological relevance of a contact network in explaining the observed pattern of infectious disease spread. Null hypothesis is expressed as a uniform prior distribution over networks with permuted edge connections of varying degree (10% to 100%). Prior distribution of alternative hypothesis puts all credibility in an infinitely dense spike at 0% permutation level (viz, the observed contact network). Bayes factor of alternate hypothesis vs null was defined as:

      <title>Validating INoDS performance</title>
      <p>We validated the performance of INoDS by evaluating its accuracy in estimating the unknown transmission parameter <italic toggle="yes">β</italic>, robustness to missing data, and comparing the performance of tool with previous approaches. To do so we first constructed a dynamic synthetic network using the following procedure. At time-step <italic toggle="yes">t</italic> = 0, a static network of 100 nodes, mean degree 4, and Poisson degree distribution was generated using the configuration model [<xref rid="pcbi.1009604.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. At each subsequent time-step, 10% of edge-connections present in the previous time-step were permuted, for a total of 100 time-steps. That is, the dynamic synthetic network (called true synthetic network in the results) consists of contacts (<italic toggle="yes">i</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">j</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">t</italic>) between node <italic toggle="yes">i</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">j</italic> at time <italic toggle="yes">t</italic>, lasting from a duration of 1 to 100 time steps; each contact is capable of disease transmission [<xref rid="pcbi.1009604.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Next, through the synthetic dynamic network, we performed 10 independent SI disease simulations with per contact rate of infection transmission (<italic toggle="yes">β</italic>*) 0.01 to 0.1. Model accuracy was evaluating by comparing INoDS estimation of the transmission parameter, <italic toggle="yes">β</italic>, with the true transmission rate <italic toggle="yes">β</italic>* that was used to perform disease simulations. Since the synthetic network completely described the disease simulations, model accuracy was also tested by evaluating the deviation of the estimated error parameter <italic toggle="yes">ϵ</italic>, from the expected value of zero.</p>
      <p>We next tested robustness of the tool against two types of missing network data: (a) incomplete sampling of individuals in a population (missing nodes), and (b) incomplete sampling of interactions between individuals (missing edges). To do so, we simulated two independent SI disease simulations each for ten <italic toggle="yes">β</italic>* values ranging from 0.01 to 0.1 with increment of 0.01 through the synthetic dynamic network. The two scenarios of missing data were created by randomly removing 25–75% of nodes and edges from the true synthetic network that were not a part of the path of simulated infection spread. This approach allowed us to investigate INoDS performance for various levels of incompletely sampled networks with the infection path preserved. If INoDS is robust to missing network data, we expect to recover similar parameter estimate, epidemiological relevance and model evidence for all networks.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec017">
      <title>Comparisons with previous approaches</title>
      <p>We compared INoDS performance with two previous approaches that are popularly used to establish epidemiological significance of contact networks—<italic toggle="yes">k</italic>-test [<xref rid="pcbi.1009604.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] and network position test. <italic toggle="yes">k</italic> − <italic toggle="yes">test</italic> estimates the average number of infected connections for each infected individual in the network. To establish the epidemiological significance of a contact network this metric, called the <italic toggle="yes">k</italic>-statistic, is compared to a distribution of null <italic toggle="yes">k</italic>-statistics obtained by randomly swapping the node labels. A p-value is calculated as the number of permutations that produce <italic toggle="yes">k</italic>-statistics more extreme than the observed <italic toggle="yes">k</italic>-statistic. Network position test compares the average degree (i.e., the average number of connections) of infected cases with the degree of uninfected individuals. The difference in average degree in the observed network is compared to the degree difference in networks where random edge connections. A p-value is calculated as the number of random networks where the degree between infected and uninfected individuals is higher than the observed network.</p>
      <p>Both of these previous approaches only provide epidemiological evidence of the observed contact network and do not estimate transmission parameters or enable model comparisons. We therefore performed comparisons with step 2 of INoDS where epidemiological relevance of the observed network is evaluated. We also note that the previous approaches are limited to static and unweighted networks, we therefore performed model comparisons on a “true” synthetic static network with 100 nodes, Poisson degree distribution and a mean network degree of 3. Simulations of disease spread were performed with a broad range of per contact transmission rate (<italic toggle="yes">β</italic>). Null expectation in INoDS and network position test was generated by permuting the edge connections of the observed networks, creating an ensemble of null networks. In <italic toggle="yes">k</italic>-test, the location of infection cases within the observed network are permuted, creating a permuted distribution of <italic toggle="yes">k</italic>-statistic [<xref rid="pcbi.1009604.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].</p>

      <title>Applications to empirical datasets</title>
      <p>We demonstrate the applications of our approach using two datasets from the empirical literature. The first dataset comprises of dynamic networks of bee colonies (N = 5–7 individuals), where edges represent direct physical contacts that were recorded using a color-based video tracking software. A bumble bee colony consists of a single queen bee and infertile workers. Here, we focus on the infection experiments in two colonies (colony QC6 and UN1). Infection progression through the colonies was tracked by daily screening of individual feces, and the infection timing was determined using the knowledge of the rate of replication of <italic toggle="yes">C. bombi</italic> within its host intestine.</p>
      <p>The second dataset monitors the spread of the commensal bacterium <italic toggle="yes">Salmonella enterica</italic> in two separate wild populations of the Australian sleepy lizard <italic toggle="yes">Tiliqua rugosa</italic>. The two sites consisted of 43 and 44 individuals respectively, and these represented the vast majority of all resident individuals at the two sites (i.e., no other individuals were encountered during the study period). Individuals were fitted with GPS loggers and their locations were recorded every 10 minutes for 70 days. Salmonella infections were monitored using cloacal swabs on each animal once every 14 days. Consequently, the disease data in this system do not identify the onset of each individual’s infection. We used a SIS (susceptible-infected-susceptible) disease model to reflect the fact that sleepy lizards can be reinfected with salmonella infections. Proximity networks were constructed by assuming a contact between individuals whenever the location of two lizards was recorded to be within 14m distance of each other [<xref rid="pcbi.1009604.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The dynamic networks at both sites consisted of 70 static snapshots, with each snapshot summarizing a day of interactions between the lizards. We constructed two contact network hypotheses to explain the spread of salmonella. The first contact network hypothesis placed binary edges between lizards if they were ever within 14m distance from each other during a day. The second contact network assigned edge weights proportional to the number of times two lizards were recorded within 14m distance of each other during a day. Specifically, edge weights between two lizards were equal to their frequency of contacts during a day normalized by the maximum edge weight observed in the dynamic network.</p>

    <p>Reviewer #1: This manuscript presents a method of inferring model parameters for disease spreading on empirical contact networks. It is also capable of testing the robustness of the network representations given data about who is infected at what time. I think it looks like a contribution of practical importance, even though getting the data needed for input is a difficult task. Below are some specific concerns:</p>
    <p>[Line 9–12] "Constructing a complete contact network model requires (i) knowledge about the transmission route(s) of a pathogen, (ii) a sampling of all individuals in a population, and (iii) a sampling of all interactions among the sampled individuals that may lead to infection transfer." First, if you have done (iii), haven't you also done (ii)? Second, why do you need to know (i)? Yes, you would need to know it to infer the parameters of the compartmental model, but not to construct a contact network?</p>
    <p>[Line 61–65] You say you can use a "dynamic contact network." Above, you defined a contact network as "individuals are represented as nodes, and an edge between two nodes represents an interaction that has the potential to transmit infection". Exactly how does dynamism enter this definition?</p>
    <p>[Line 62–63] If you have a temporal network version about the SIS or SIR model, it is a two-parameter model. You cannot reduce parameters and omit the recovery rate as in static network epidemiology. Thus, your tool also needs to estimate the recovery rate (or disease duration, depending on your model of infection duration).</p>
    <p>[Line 63] In the light of the previous question, you can omit the SI model since it is contained in the SIS and SIR models.</p>
    <p>[Fig. 1] The smallest text is not readable.</p>
    <p>[Around line 87] How do you randomize the network? If you randomize a dynamical network, there are many options that all destroy different structures of the original data. See Gauvin et al., Randomized reference models for temporal networks</p>

    <p>[Around line 87] What is the logic of randomizing different percentages of the links? When you randomize the network, you destroy the particular structure that affects the disease spreading. It is not telling you whether your network is robust to errors because random changes make the network more random, i.e., less like the structured, real networks. If you consider networks obtained by random changes as a model, this is systematically biased toward randomness and should certainly be a bad model.</p>
    <p>[Line 104] " 0.039 ( 0.003 SD)" What is this notation? Do you mean 0.003 times the standard deviation? or that 0.003 is the standard deviation?</p>

    <p>Continuing the previous point. There are papers in the temporal-network epidemiology literature that relate to this work. One such is: Holme &amp; Rocha, Impact of misinformation in temporal network epidemiology, Network Science 7, 52-69 (2019).</p>

    <p>[Fig. 3 caption] If you remove edges not involved in a spreading path, aren't you introducing a bias? Those edges should, by definition, be less important for the epidemics.</p>
    <p>Reviewer #2: Sah, et al. present an exciting technique that is leaps and bounds beyond of the "comparable" approaches they test it against in the study of contact network relevance to disease spread. This work has great potential to address some of the most pressing concerns in disease ecology, namely a rigorous way to assess and compare contact networks as explanatory tools in the spread of infectious disease. Despite my excitement and generally positive impression, I have one main concern and two secondary ones that I outline below.</p>
    <p># Validation with respect to missing data:</p>
    <p>The authors perform three main tests to validate their approach in the face of missing data: they remove nodes, edges, or cases and then run the model to see if it still performs well in each of its three tasks: estimating parameters, determining that the network is relevant to disease spread, and performing model selection between the "true network" and the pruned ones.</p>
    <p>My main issue is that under the current methods, the authors only consider nodes and edges that are not involved in the simulated disease transmission for removal. Besides being unrealistic from a data-scarcity perspective (we rarely know whether the individuals we have missed were involved in the transmission chain or not), this additionally (I would argue undesirably) alters the model-perceived disease prevalence.</p>
    <p>Because (by definition) none of the removed edges were involved in the transmission process, many (most?) of them were connecting two susceptible nodes and thus wouldn't have come into the likelihood calculation anyway. The removal of edges should functionally increase the perception of beta, since edges that remain are more likely to result in further infections, but this is not what we see in Figure 3 -- I wonder if the authors have an intuition for why their model continues to perform so well</p>
    <p>The removal of nodes is not really a distinct treatment from the removal of edges, as when nodes are removed, the edges connected to them are removed as well. We would thus expect nodes to have (at least) as big of an effect as just removing edges. Importantly, this removal also increases the prevalence of disease within the network (because we are only removing healthy nodes). This combined with the above is likely why we see an increase in epsilon, though the lack of a response in beta is surprising, as before.</p>
    <p>Finally, removing cases is the only change that alters the actual infection data, but in this case, nodes are not removed but rather their infectious status is never recognized (assuming they follow the procedure from VanderWaal, et al. (2016)). This seems like it would have the biggest effect on beta, but those results are not presented in this work. It does yield the smallest absolute epsilon, but might have something to do with effectively reducing prevalence in the population. Thus, less extrinsic forcing is needed to explain the data, even in the absence of beta (more on this below).</p>
    <p>I would like to see two additional pruning procedures: removing nodes truly at random (infected or not), and the same for edges. This would keep the prevalence approximately equal and would be a more realistic scenario. I expect these will have a larger effect on beta, since we are losing information about the actual spread of disease.</p>
    <p>It might be interesting to connect the neighbors of removed nodes via the addition of edges, since there is still a path for infection even if we don't observe it, but this might be beyond the scope of this work.</p>
    <p>In Figure S2, the authors consider the absolute deviation of epsilon from 0, but I am not convinced this is the most informative way to present the model's reliance on unobserved transmission. Given a timeseries and a network without edges, there is some best-fit (i.e. maximizing the likelihood function in equation 2) epsilon for regenerating the data. Any transmission events that can be better explained by a network edge (and therefore beta parameter) reduce the model's expectation for epsilon. I am curious how a figure like S2 would look if the y-axis were the relative error (to this maximum) rather than absolute error (from 0).</p>
    <p>Finally, my understanding is that the time of infection is assigned (uniformly) randomly between the two timepoints of an individual being susceptible and infectious. It seems a reasonable assumption that this distribution is non-uniform insofar as the likelihood of infection will depend on the node's degree as it changes throughout this window.</p>
    <p># Comparison to previous methods:</p>
    <p>One of the variables noted to be important to success of the approach of VanderWaal, et al. (2016) is pathogen prevalence. Did the authors detect a similar dependence in their method?</p>
    <p>Along these lines, I am having trouble reconciling Figure 4 with Figure 3 from VanderWaal, et al. (2016) -- how do the authors find nearly 0 power under (presumably) similar parameterizations that VanderWaal, et al. find nearly 1 (i.e. beta = 0.04 and 0.133)?</p>
    <p>l 378 -- the authors use the Kass &amp; Rafferty (1995) interpretations of BF (i.e. &gt; 0.5 is "signficant"), but this seemed to be the most generous of interpretations that I've encountered. In most cases, this doesn't matter, as the authors report the BF directly, however in Figure 3, I wonder how much the left column would differ if 2, 3, or 10 (sensu Lee and Wagenmakers (2014)) were used instead.</p>
    <p># Code/reproducibility:</p>
    <p>The link provided in the text (<ext-link xlink:href="https://bansallab.github.io/INoDS-model/" ext-link-type="uri">https://bansallab.github.io/INoDS-model/</ext-link>) leads to a page that does not contain a link to download the software, requiring the reader to have sufficient knowledge of github to navigate to <ext-link xlink:href="https://github.com/bansallab/INoDS-model/" ext-link-type="uri">https://github.com/bansallab/INoDS-model/</ext-link> before gaining access.</p>
    <p>It would additionally greatly improve accessibility if some sample data were provided in the repository such that a user can get it running right out-of-the-box, so to speak. As it is, even the referenced datasets are not readily available. I was unable to find either dataset within the Harvard Dataverse (as referenced in the text), and could find no record of the bee dataset elsewhere either. I did find the lizard dataset in DataDryad (<ext-link xlink:href="https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.jk87h" ext-link-type="uri">https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.jk87h</ext-link>), but the data format in this repository is not easily converted into one acceptable for INoDS.</p>
    <p>I don't think the randomization code used in this work was provided -- does your particular configuration model algorithm allow non-simple graphs? If so, I would recommend re-running with one that does not in order to make the random ensemble representative of empirically obtainable data.</p>
    <p># Other Minor Points</p>
    <p>My read of Eq. 2 is that it this formulation is particular to a disease model without re-infection -- if so, this should be stated explicitly</p>
    <p>l 136-138 -- I'm not sure I understand why this was "expected"</p>
    <p>l 157 -- this reference should be to figure 4, I believe</p>
    <p>l 362 -- should this section heading have an "epsilon" in it?</p>
    <p>l 411 -- do I understand these methods correctly that there was only one simulation per missing data scenario-beta combination? If so, I assume the paired outliers in Figure 3c are thus corresponding to particular beta values. I highly recommend performing greater replication in this analysis.</p>
    <p>## Figure 2</p>
    <p>Contrary to the caption, the boxplot whiskers do not encompass the range (as evidenced by the presence of points outside of these ranges). More likely:</p>
    <p>"The upper whisker extends from the hinge to the largest value no further than 1.5 * IQR from the hinge (where IQR is the inter-quartile range, or distance between the first and third quartiles). The lower whisker extends from the hinge to the smallest value at most 1.5 * IQR of the hinge. Data beyond the end of the whiskers are called "outlying" points and are plotted individually." -ggplot2 geom_histogram help page</p>
    <p>This description is also present in other captions.</p>
    <p>a) Plotting the beta/epsilon values directly here makes it somewhat difficult to gauge any deviation of the mean estimate from the ground truth, or any trends in deviation along beta*. Perhaps switch the vertical axis to show the absolute error or add a 1:1 line for reference. I slightly prefer the former approach, since that would allow a better understanding of any change in epsilon with increasing beta as well, which is hard to note in the current figure due to the difference in scales.</p>
    <p>b) Do these boxplots aggregate log BF across networks that vary in their degree of permutation (i.e. combining what is subdivided in panel c)?</p>
    <p>## Figure 3</p>
    <p>I wasn't sure why omitted cases is not presented here, despite being in Figure 4 and in the SI</p>
    <p>a) Are the differences from expectation actually 0 or is this a vertical-axis scaling issue? and is this absolute error? if so, I would recommend relative error here, since beta spans an order of magnitude.</p>
    <p>## Figure 4</p>
    <p>caption -- "Statistical power of INoDS was ," [delete was]</p>
    <p>## Figure 6</p>
    <p>Is there a missing network in this figure? I expected 5 networks given biweekly sampling for 70 days.</p>
    <p>I'm a little confused by the table here -- shouldn't frequency weighted at site 2 have an asterisk after it? and why does it have "frequency" in parentheses? Finally, am I reading this correctly insofar as the lower CI bound for the beta and epsilon of the site 1 binary network are equal to the estimates themselves (0.017 and 0.046, respectively)?</p>
    <p>Reviewer #3: This is an interesting and well written paper describing the development of a tool, INoDS (Identifying contact Networks of infectious Disease Spread), that can be used to perform network model selection and establishes the statistical significance of a contact network model.</p>
    <p>General comments:</p>
    <p>This work is very timely. The introduction, methods, and results are well described and easy to follow. However, there are few key components in the methods and results that need more explanation. Something that the authors need to explain in more detail is why the bumble bee and lizard case studies were chosen and why there was a need to examine both and not just one, for example. Additionally, while the introduction, methods, and results were well developed, the discussion is currently a bit weak, as it essentially re-iterates much of the information given in the abstract, introduction, and results. The authors do not discuss their work in the context of other studies (or do so at a very shallow level), there is no discussion of limitations nor of future directions and next steps. I would suggest cutting much of the information that repeats the introduction (e.g., why this tool is needed) and results, and provide a deeper discussion of how this tool should be used, which systems might need it most, and what the limitations are. Finally, the authors need to check some of their references and figure citations in the main text before publication as there are errors (e.g., some figures are incorrectly referenced in the main text (e.g., figure 3 instead of 4) and figure 6 was not referred to at all in the main text).</p>
    <p>Specific comments:</p>
    <p>Line 63-64: provide examples in parentheses of the type of complex models</p>
    <p>Line 94-95: More detail on why those two empirical datasets were chosen, and why the need to look at both. This can be stated either here or in the methods.</p>
    <p>Line 157: I believe the authors are referring to figure 4 here not figure 3.</p>
    <p>Line 292-293: In what way? Perhaps give examples.</p>
    <p>Line 458-459: This needs to be stated earlier in the manuscript as it helps understand why this dataset was used as an example.</p>
    <p>Figures:</p>
    <p>Figure 1 – In the first inferential step, need to define k. Since the methods are at the end of the manuscript, it would be good to define it here as well. In the third inferential step, might be good to explain that a Bayes factor above 3 provides support for one hypothesis over the other (for those less familiar with Bayesian statistics).</p>
    <p>Figure 3 – panels a-c are not listed in the figure but are when the figure is referenced in the text.</p>
    <p>Figure 6 – not referred to in main text</p>
    <p>Figure 6 – suggest adding days in parentheses for the time on the x-axis.</p>

    <p>Two minor lingering comments:</p>
    <p>1) The axes in figure 2a could be better fit to the data (right now the data only fill the lower ~1/3 of the plot.</p>
    <p>2) As noted in my original review, the replication count for figure 3 feels quite small (only 2 replicates per parameter combination) -- while I would have liked to see more, this is not a sticking point for my endorsement</p>

Read more information on sharing protocols at <ext-link xlink:href="https://plos.org/protocols?utm_medium=editorial-email&amp;utm_source=authorletters&amp;utm_campaign=protocols" ext-link-type="uri">https://plos.org/protocols?utm_medium=editorial-email&amp;utm_source=authorletters&amp;utm_campaign=protocols</ext-link></p>
    <p>References:</p>
    <p>Review your reference list to ensure that it is complete and correct. If you have cited papers that have been retracted, please include the rationale for doing so in the manuscript text, or remove these references and replace them with relevant current references. Any changes to the reference list should be mentioned in the rebuttal letter that accompanies your revised manuscript.</p>

    <p>Dear Dr Bansal,</p>
    <p>We are pleased to inform you that your manuscript 'Revealing mechanisms of infectious disease outbreak through empirical contact networks' has been provisionally accepted for publication in PLOS Computational Biology.</p>
    <p>Before your manuscript can be formally accepted you will need to complete some formatting changes, which you will receive in a follow up email. A member of our team will be in touch with a set of requests.</p>
    <p>Please note that your manuscript will not be scheduled for publication until you have made the required changes, so a swift response is appreciated.</p>
    <p>IMPORTANT: The editorial review process is now complete. PLOS will only permit corrections to spelling, formatting or significant scientific errors from this point onwards. Requests for major changes, or any which affect the scientific understanding of your work, will cause delays to the publication date of your manuscript.</p>
    <p>Should you, your institution's press office or the journal office choose to press release your paper, you will automatically be opted out of early publication. We ask that you notify us now if you or your institution is planning to press release the article. All press must be co-ordinated with PLOS.</p>
    <p>Thank you again for supporting Open Access publishing; we are looking forward to publishing your work in PLOS Computational Biology. </p>
    <p>Best regards,</p>
