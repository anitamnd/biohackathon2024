    <abstract>
      <p>Protein secondary structure prediction (SSP) has a variety of applications; however, there has been relatively limited improvement in accuracy for years. With a vision of moving forward all related fields, we aimed to make a fundamental advance in SSP. There have been many admirable efforts made to improve the machine learning algorithm for SSP. This work thus took a step back by manipulating the input features. A secondary structure element-based position-specific scoring matrix (SSE-PSSM) is proposed, based on which a new set of machine learning features can be established. The feasibility of this new PSSM was evaluated by rigid independent tests with training and testing datasets sharing &lt;25% sequence identities. In all experiments, the proposed PSSM outperformed the traditional amino acid PSSM. This new PSSM can be easily combined with the amino acid PSSM, and the improvement in accuracy was remarkable. Preliminary tests made by combining the SSE-PSSM and well-known SSP methods showed 2.0% and 5.2% average improvements in three- and eight-state SSP accuracies, respectively. If this PSSM can be integrated into state-of-the-art SSP methods, the overall accuracy of SSP may break the current restriction and eventually bring benefit to all research and applications where secondary structure prediction plays a vital role during development. To facilitate the application and integration of the SSE-PSSM with modern SSP methods, we have established a web server and standalone programs for generating SSE-PSSM available at <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="http://10.life.nctu.edu.tw/SSE-PSSM" ext-link-type="uri">http://10.life.nctu.edu.tw/SSE-PSSM</ext-link>.</p>

    <title>Introduction</title>
    <p>The secondary structure prediction of a protein means determining the secondary structural conformation for each residue of the protein merely based on the amino acid sequence. Although SSP has been applied to many fields, its accuracy seems to stay on a plateau of 81–86% for years. We believe that if the accuracy of SSP can be substantially improved, research and applications dependent on it will all be advanced. This work aims to make a fundamental improvement in SSP, hoping that, if the proposed algorithm can be adopted by state-of-the-art SSP methods, the general accuracy of SSP will reach a new level. Thanks to many recent works [<xref rid="pone.0255076.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0255076.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], much progress has been brought to the methodology and machine learning algorithms for SSP. Thus, this study focuses on developing a new set of features that can be utilized in all mature machine-learning-based SSP methods. The outcome of our efforts is a new position-specific scoring matrix (PSSM) composed of secondary structural elements instead of amino acid codes.</p>
    <p>SSP methods have been developed for more than sixty-five years since Pauling and Corey first proposed the helix and sheet conformations of polypeptides in 1951 [<xref rid="pone.0255076.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0255076.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Despite being an “ancient” topic, there have been still more than five methods published every year since 2010 [<xref rid="pone.0255076.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] because SSP has many applications in protein sciences, such as fold recognition [<xref rid="pone.0255076.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0255076.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], tertiary/quaternary structure prediction and modelling [<xref rid="pone.0255076.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0255076.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], functional and evolutionary analyses [<xref rid="pone.0255076.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0255076.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], prediction of folding pathway/elements [<xref rid="pone.0255076.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0255076.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], and prediction of disordered regions [<xref rid="pone.0255076.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0255076.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], functional sites [<xref rid="pone.0255076.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0255076.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], binding sites [<xref rid="pone.0255076.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0255076.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], enzyme target sites [<xref rid="pone.0255076.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0255076.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], and suitable bioengineering sites [<xref rid="pone.0255076.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0255076.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Moreover, predicted secondary structures could be used in <italic toggle="yes">de novo</italic> protein design [<xref rid="pone.0255076.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0255076.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] and protein drug design [<xref rid="pone.0255076.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0255076.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>].</p>
    <p>For carrying out SSP, protein secondary structural conformations were first classified into secondary structure elements (SSEs). There are two widely used sets of SSE: 1) The three-state (Q3) SSEs that describe a protein conformation as helixes (H), strands (E), and coils (C). 2) The eight-state (Q8) SSEs defined by DSSP [<xref rid="pone.0255076.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] that include 3<sub>10</sub>-helix (G), α-helix (H), π-helix (I), extended β-strand (E), β-bridge (B), turn (T), bend (S), and coil (C). Therefore, the development and evaluation of SSP methods also fall into two major categories, <italic toggle="yes">i</italic>.<italic toggle="yes">e</italic>., methods making three-state SSE predictions with Q3 accuracy and methods making eight-state predictions with Q8 accuracy. In general, Q8 methods are also capable of making three-state predictions.</p>
    <p>During the past four decades, SSP accuracy has been continuously raised until the last few years. In 1978, Garnier, Osguthorpe, and Robson developed the GOR method based on information theory and achieved ~60% accuracy for helices, β-pleated sheets, reverse turns, and coils [<xref rid="pone.0255076.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. In 1988, Qian and Sejnowski accomplished 64.3% Q3 by neural networks [<xref rid="pone.0255076.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. In 1993, Rost and Sander used multiple sequence alignment (MSA) profiles of homologous sequences as features for a neural network method PHD and increased the Q3 to 69.7% [<xref rid="pone.0255076.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. In 1999, Jones utilized the sequence profile computed by PSI-BLAST, known as the PSSM [<xref rid="pone.0255076.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>], as features and developed a neural-network-based method PSIPRED, which promoted the Q3 accuracy to 76.5% [<xref rid="pone.0255076.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].</p>
    <p>After PSIPRED, most SSP methods employed PSSM as the major feature set, and the competition of accuracy had then mainly focused on the algorithm and improvement in machine learning, such as neural networks [<xref rid="pone.0255076.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0255076.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>], support vector machine [<xref rid="pone.0255076.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0255076.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>], and hidden Markov models [<xref rid="pone.0255076.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0255076.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. The Q3 accuracy of methods developed in the early 2000s generally fell between 76% and 78% [<xref rid="pone.0255076.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. Meanwhile, the Q8 accuracy of SSpro8 broke the record and reached 62.6% [<xref rid="pone.0255076.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. In 2007, the Q3 came up to 79.5% when Dor and Zhou developed the SPINE based on neural networks and a large training dataset [<xref rid="pone.0255076.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. Soon after that, Jpred 3 [<xref rid="pone.0255076.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>], another neural-network-based method, broke 80% Q3 in 2008. Since then, neural network derivatives have formed the core of most SSP methods. Because of the rapid growth of computing power and the amount of available training data (proteins with determined structures), the architectures of neural networks became increasingly sophisticated, inclusive of the BRNN [<xref rid="pone.0255076.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>], CNF [<xref rid="pone.0255076.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], BRNN-LSTM [<xref rid="pone.0255076.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>], deep learning [<xref rid="pone.0255076.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0255076.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] and CRNN [<xref rid="pone.0255076.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. However, the accuracy seems to meet a plateau; little improvement has been made during the past ten years. The Q3 of current SSP methods evaluated with strict independent tests falls between 81% and 86%, while there has not yet been Q8 higher than 75%.</p>
    <p>Since the PSSM was introduced into this field, few changes have been made to the fundamental feature set. Theoretically, the quality of features (and training data) should be the ultimate limitation for the accuracy of a predictor, suggesting that if the feature set used by current methods could be improved, the overall accuracy of SSP would be enhanced. We thus proposed an SSE-based PSSM that might be easily integrated into various SSP methods to achieve such enhancements. The way we computed this new PSSM was just a few steps away from the traditional PSSM, the same as which the values of the proposed PSSM could be readily used as features for machine learning. In order to make a reliable evaluation of the SSE-PSSM, a careful experimental dataset preparation procedure was conducted such that any two datasets for either training, testing, or independent tests shared &lt;25% sequence identities. Independent tests revealed that, by using the same machine learning strategy, the accuracy accomplished by the SSE-PSSM feature set was much higher than that by the conventional amino acid PSSM feature set. Preliminary tests, in which the SSE-PSSM feature set was indirectly incorporated into state-of-the-art SSP methods, showed that these methods’ accuracy could be significantly improved. For instance, when it was preliminarily integrated with DeepCNF [<xref rid="pone.0255076.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], Q3 raised from 82.9% to 84.1%, and Q8 from 68.4% to 71.8%, as assessed with the CASP12 independent set [<xref rid="pone.0255076.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0255076.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. We aimed to bring a general improvement to SSP by updating the machine learning feature set, and the proposed SSE-PSSM has been demonstrated promising for this purpose.</p>

      <title>Example of the SSE-PSSM</title>
      <p>The main contribution of this work is an SSE-based PSSM that may serve SSP algorithms as a new feature set. <xref rid="pone.0255076.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref> demonstrates the difference between a traditional amino acid-based PSSM and the proposed SSE-PSSM. The first advantage of the SSE-PSSM is its simplicity of implementation. With a protein sequence similarity search program like the PSI-BLAST [<xref rid="pone.0255076.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>] or HHBlits [<xref rid="pone.0255076.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>] and a protein structure dataset, a set of aligned amino acid sequences can be transformed into aligned SSE sequences and construct the SSE-PSSM. Another advantage lies in the density of information. The intermediate of a PSSM is the position propensity matrix (PPM). If the query protein is so novel that few homologs exist in the target dataset, the PPM generated from the aligned amino acid sequences may contain too many zeros to maintain the quality of the generated PSSM. Because the number of SSE codes (3 or 8) was much smaller than that of amino acids (20), with the same amount of homologs, the SSE-PPM will have much fewer zeros and hence a higher quality of the PSSM. Besides, the small number of SSE codes is feasible to improve the efficiency of machine learning algorithms, the time cost of which usually increases as the number of input features increases [<xref rid="pone.0255076.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>].</p>

      <p>Typically, a sequence alignment block is transformed into a position propensity matrix and then the PSSM. In generating the proposed SSE-based PSSM, the main difference is an additional SSE transformation step (see <xref rid="sec015" ref-type="sec">Materials and methods</xref>). By introducing secondary structure information from the query protein’s homologs into the system, the SSE-PSSM feature set helps improve SSP accuracy. The SSE transformation decreases the number of codes and significantly reduces the proportion of null entries in the propensity matrix, which eventually enhances the quality of the final scoring matrix and may further improve the prediction accuracy. This illustration was made using part of the alignment of a real case, a Nudix hydrolase (PDB 1mqw). For simplicity, three-state SSE codes were applied here. In this study, the actual predictive models of the SSE-PSSM feature set were constructed using eight-state codes.</p>

      <title>Accuracy of secondary structure prediction by SSE-PSSM</title>
      <p>The SSE-PSSM is a <bold>feature set</bold> rather than a predictor. In order to evaluate it, an integrated machine learning system we developed [<xref rid="pone.0255076.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0255076.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] was utilized. Since the focus of this study is the new feature set instead of machine learning, we simply adopted the default settings of this system without optimization. As a basis for comparison, the traditional amino acid PSSM (AA-PSSM) feature set was also generated. The predictive models of SSE- and AA-PSSMs were trained with QuerySet-T, and independent tests were performed with QuerySet-I. For avoiding the bias of prediction and information leakage, these datasets were iteratively homology reduced such that any two proteins from them shared &lt;25% identity (see <bold>“Experimental datasets”</bold>).</p>
      <p>As shown in <xref rid="pone.0255076.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, no matter in the three- or eight-state prediction, the overall accuracy (Q3 and Q8), boundary accuracy, and internal accuracy of SSE-PSSM were all higher than those of AA-PSSM; and the misclassification rates of SSE-PSSM were considerably lower. The SOV (segment overlap measure), a more critical assessment measure than the Q accuracy, can effectively capture the overall quality of SSP for a protein and reduce noises from individual residues [<xref rid="pone.0255076.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0255076.ref072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. Previous studies calculated the SOV on the three-state basis (SOV3). Here a more critical eight-state SOV, the SOV8, was also calculated. Judging from the SOV data, the same conclusion was reached that SSE-PSSM outperformed the traditional AA-PSSM as an SSP feature set.</p>

      <p>Several state-of-the-art SSP methods were tested. Although the SSE-PSSM model achieved higher scores in most measures, it is noteworthy that the SSE-PSSM and those methods were not applied on an equal basis. In this experiment, except for the SSE-PSSM model, all methods were developed based on the traditional PSSM. This experiment aimed to demonstrate the feasibility of the SSE-PSSM as an <bold>SSP feature set</bold> but not to compare the accuracy among SSP methods. The machine learning system we utilized to establish the SSE- and AA-PSSM models was only a simple setup. If the advanced machine learning algorithms of those SSP methods could be applied, the accuracy of the AA-PSSM model should be at a level similar to them. Taking the accuracy of the AA-PSSM as a baseline, the SSE-PSSM achieved &gt;12% and &gt;18% improvements in Q3 and Q8, respectively. If the SSE-PSSM could be adopted by those state-of-the-art methods, their accuracy would be significantly improved as well, pushing much forward the leading edge of SSP. The Q8 of several recent works may break the current upper level of 75% [<xref rid="pone.0255076.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0255076.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p>
      <p>The accuracies reported here were lower than those in previous reports because the way we prepared datasets was so stringent that it limited the size of the PSSM target dataset TargetSet-nr25, which consisted of only 11.4 thousand sequences. The size of target dataset has been shown to exhibit a positive correlation with SSP accuracy [<xref rid="pone.0255076.ref073" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. When a conventional UniRef90-2015 of 38.2 million sequences was applied, the accuracies were all at the same levels as previously reported (<italic toggle="yes">i</italic>.<italic toggle="yes">e</italic>., ~81% Q3; see “<bold>Applied secondary structure prediction methods</bold>”). To ensure the reliability of the results based on the small TargetSet-nr25, we repeated all experiments three times by random sampling to obtain the averaged performance (see “<bold>Experimental datasets</bold>”).</p>

      <title>Performance for various structure classes</title>
      <p>To our knowledge, the accuracy of SSP methods on different protein structural classes has not been discussed. Here we grouped the query proteins of our independent test set (QuerySet-I) according to their SCOP (Structural Classification of Proteins) classes [<xref rid="pone.0255076.ref074" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>] to analyze the performance of the predictive model of SSE-PSSM and several SSP methods. <xref rid="pone.0255076.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> demonstrated that most SSP methods were most sensitive to either alpha-beta mixed or all-alpha proteins if the accuracy was determined based on residues (Q3/Q8). Interestingly, all predictors showed the best performance for alpha-beta mixed proteins when measuring the accuracy according to secondary structure segments (SOV3/SOV8; see <xref rid="sec009" ref-type="sec">Discussion</xref>). In implementing the SSE-PSSM as an SSP feature set, attention might be paid to all-alpha proteins, for it performed relatively weak in this class. The DeepCNF, an excellent algorithm based on deep convolutional neural fields [<xref rid="pone.0255076.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], outperformed the SSE-PSSM model even with a traditional PSSM as its main feature set. Nevertheless, an advantage the SSE-PSSM may bring to current SSP methods is the balanced performance, for it achieved the smallest standard deviations of Q3, Q8, and SOV8 among these structural classes.</p>

      <p>An underline indicates that the SSP method performed best in this class compared to its accuracy in these four classes.</p>
      <p>These results also revealed an issue: all methods performed the poorest when predicting all-beta proteins. Although it had been reported that most SSP methods performed worse in strands than in helices [<xref rid="pone.0255076.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0255076.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], this is perhaps the first time SSP methods were challenged with proteins overall folded into strands <italic toggle="yes">versus</italic> helices, and the poor performance in all-beta proteins should be informative for future SSP developments. One way out of this problem might be a two-staged approach in which the structural class of the query sequence is predicted at first, and then the per-residue secondary structure is predicted by using predictive models specifically established for the predicted structural class.</p>

      <title>Performance for different protein sizes</title>
      <p>It is not clear whether current SSP methods perform equally for proteins of different sizes. The independent test dataset (QuerySet-I) was divided into three size subsets. As revealed by <xref rid="pone.0255076.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>, except for the SSE-PSSM predictive model, the performance of all predictors dropped as the size increased. The SSE-PSSM performed best for medium-sized proteins, whereas all other methods performed best for small ones (see the underlined). Judging from the standard deviation of accuracy, the SSE-PSSM had a relatively stable performance regarding the size of proteins. This balance was not just the effect of how we trained the predictive model of SSE-PSSM, because the model of AA-PSSM (trained with the same data and machine learning procedure) performed best for small and worst for large proteins as the amino acid PSSM methods did. Thus, adopting the SSE-PSSM feature set may help current SSP methods balance the performance for proteins of different sizes.</p>

      <title>Improvement in accuracy by combining SSE-PSSM with traditional PSSM and state-of-the-art SSP methods</title>
      <p>This study constructed two types of feature sets, the proposed SSE-PSSM and the widely used AA-PSSM. For an SSP method using AA-PSSM already, we wondered whether its accuracy would be enhanced if the SSE-PSSM were incorporated into the feature set. As a pretest, using the same machine learning system [<xref rid="pone.0255076.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0255076.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], we constructed a predictive model by combining the AA- and SSE-PSSMs. This model was trained with QuerySet-T. In addition to our independent test dataset (QuerySet-I), three independent datasets established in previous studies, the TS115, CASP12, and CASP13 [<xref rid="pone.0255076.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0255076.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>], and their companion target dataset UniRef90-2015 were also recruited to make rigorous assessments. As shown in <xref rid="pone.0255076.s007" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Table</xref>, after the feature set integration, the accuracy on all datasets was remarkably improved over solely using the AA-PSSM.</p>
      <p>The success in improving the accuracy of the traditional AA-PSSM feature set by combining it with the SSE-PSSM encouraged us to take a step further to incorporate the SSE-PSSM into state-of-the-art SSP methods. However, the unavailability of the source codes of the programs made it impossible to change the feature set of those methods. Thus, we used a trick to construct new predictive models by using the output of the programs as input features. For verifying the feasibility of this “second-level” machine learning strategy, both the results of training and independent test of constructed models were compared with the raw results of these methods. As demonstrated in <xref rid="sec015" ref-type="sec">Materials and methods</xref>, this second-level learning did not much influence their accuracy. With this strategy, additional features like the SSE-PSSM could be “indirectly” integrated into a well-developed predictor. As diagramed in <xref rid="pone.0255076.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>, independent tests concluded that the predictive models of these state-of-the-art SSP methods integrated with the SSE-PSSM feature set all outperformed the models without integration. After the integration, in general, eight-state predictions were improved more significantly than three-state ones. On average, the Q3/SOV3 and Q8/SOV8 were improved by 3–4% and ~7%, respectively (see also <xref rid="pone.0255076.s008" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Table</xref> for detailed data). Taking only the results of third-party independent datasets (TS115 and the CASPs) into consideration, the improvements in Q3/SOV3 and Q8/SOV8 still reached 2.0%/2.9% and 5.2%/5.1%, respectively. As a control test, the traditional AA-PSSM had also been integrated in the same way into those methods. Because the original predictive models of those methods were all constructed with the traditional PSSM, this feature set integration was expected to bring little benefit. Supported by the results listed in <xref rid="pone.0255076.s009" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Table</xref>, most SSP accuracy values of these methods increased less than 1% while some even decreased.</p>

      <p>Comparing the significant differences between integrating SSE-PSSM and the traditional AA-PSSM, SSE-PSSM was demonstrated feasible to improve the accuracy of current SSP methods. For precisely determining the extent to which SSE-PSSM can enhance accuracy, this indirect feature integration experiment was just a preliminary test.

      <title>Improvement in accuracy by combining SSE-PSSM with state-of-the-art SSP methods that depend on HHBlits PSSM</title>
      <p>After this study was initiated, more and more SSP algorithms utilized the HHBlits [<xref rid="pone.0255076.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>] to perform MSA analysis between the query protein and target dataset proteins, encode the resultant conservation profile as a PSSM, and make SSP either directly by the HHBlits-PSSM (<italic toggle="yes">e</italic>.<italic toggle="yes">g</italic>., NetSurfP-2 [<xref rid="pone.0255076.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]) or by both the PSSMs generated by HHBlits and PSI-BLAST (<italic toggle="yes">e</italic>.<italic toggle="yes">g</italic>., MUFOLD-SS [<xref rid="pone.0255076.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], Porter5 [<xref rid="pone.0255076.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], and Spider3 [<xref rid="pone.0255076.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]). To examine whether SSE-PSSM is compatible with the HHBlits-based SSP methodology, we first implemented it based on HHBlits MSA and assessed it by 1) using it along as the predictive feature set, 2) combining it with the AA-PSSMs produced with HHBlits and PSI-BLAST (AA-PSSMhh for short) as a large feature set, and 3) preliminary integrating it with several HHBlits-based SSP algorithms in the same way stated above. As summarized in <xref rid="pone.0255076.s010" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4 Table</xref>, the average Q3/Q8 on TS115 and the CASP datasets of the HHBlits-based SSE-PSSM (SSE-PSSMhh) and AA-PSSMhh was 77.9%/63.3% and 73.8%/52.8%, respectively. After combining with the SSE-PSSMhh, the Q3/Q8 and SOV3/SOV8 of AA-PSSMhh was respectively improved by 7.8%/12.5% and 9.0%/12.5% on average. As demonstrated in <xref rid="pone.0255076.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>, the four HHBlits-based SSP algorithms mentioned above were preliminarily integrated with the SSE-PSSMhh feature set (refer to <xref rid="pone.0255076.s010" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4 Table</xref> for raw data). Before the feature integration, the average Q3 and Q8 of those algorithms on TS115 and the CASPs were 84.1% and 67.2%, respectively. After integration, the average Q3 and Q8 increased to 85.7% (+1.6%) and 70.0% (+4.3%), respectively. In general, the performance of these HHBlits-based algorithms in SOVs was weaker than in Q measures. The improving effect of SSE-PSSMhh for the assessed four SSP algorithms on the SOV3/8 accuracies was +2.2%/+3.1% on average.</p>

      <title>Category of a predictor established with the SSE-PSSM</title>
      <p>According to whether a template structure is utilized to infer the per-residue conformation of a query protein, SSP algorithms can be classified into two categories: template-based and template-free [<xref rid="pone.0255076.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Since the critical step of the proposed version of SSE-PSSM algorithm is to determine the SSE sequences of the query protein’s homologs based on a reference structure dataset, an SSP method developed using this SSE-PSSM is essentially a template-based method. Nevertheless, there are some differences between the SSE-PSSM feature set and classic template-based methods. Firstly, an extensively aligned homolog of the query protein is not required. If the query protein is unique or if the target dataset consisted of highly non-redundant sequences, the homologs retrieved by the sequence search engine can be very divergent, and the aligned regions between the query protein and homologs are highly fragmented. Even in such cases, the SSE-PSSM can still be assembled. Secondly, the SSE-PSSM scores of a residue position are determined by the substitution rates of conformations, not by the conformations of residues aligned with it.</p>
      <p>In this work, the query and target datasets for training and independent tests were all highly non-redundant. The non-redundancy not only existed between datasets but also within every dataset. For instance, QuerySet-I and TargetSet-nr25 are 25% identity non-redundant in between; meanwhile, in QuerySet-I, any two sequences shared &lt;25% identity, so did sequences in TargetSet-nr25. Therefore, it should be tough for any query in our experiments to find closely related homologs to be its template. It is more likely that the SSE-PSSM of a query was constructed entirely based on marginally aligned far-related homologs. The high accuracy accomplished by the predictive model of SSE-PSSM indicated that SSE-PSSM did not rely on high-quality templates.</p>
      <p>For comparison, we performed accuracy assessments and feature integration tests on the template-based version SSpro8 (SSpro8T) using the same independent datasets as well as the testing dataset of SSpro8T [<xref rid="pone.0255076.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] (abbreviated as TSsspro8 in this paper). SSpro8T exhibited different properties from the eleven template-free algorithms we utilized. First, its accuracy dropped rapidly as the independent dataset became more updated, supposedly because of the increasing difficulty in finding good templates for new novel proteins that are very different from old PDB (Protein Data Bank) [<xref rid="pone.0255076.ref075" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>] releases. For instance, as listed in <xref rid="pone.0255076.s011" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5 Table</xref>, the macro-average Q3 of the seven PSI-BLAST-based algorithms on TSsspro8 and CASP12 was 79.8% and 79.5%, and that of the four HHBlits-based algorithms was 85.5% and 84.7%, respectively. Both types of template-free algorithms exhibited a &lt;1% drop in accuracy. However, the macro-average Q3 of SSPro8T on TSsspro8 and CASP12 was 94.4% and 78.9%, a 15.5% drop. As for the predictive model of SSE-PSSM, its Q3 on these datasets was 86.2% and 79.0% (<xref rid="pone.0255076.s007" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Table</xref>), equivalent to a 7.2% drop. This fact supported that an SSP method working based on the SSE-PSSM is essentially template-based. Second, when SSpro8T was integrated with SSE-PSSM, the accuracy improvement in Q3/SOV3 was negligible (&lt;0.1%, see <xref rid="pone.0255076.s008" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Table</xref>), no matter assessed with any dataset. The Q8/SOV8 on most datasets were even reduced. It has been demonstrated that all the eleven template-free algorithms would significantly gain accuracy once integrated with SSE-PSSM. To determine whether this difference between SSpro8T and template-free methods resulted from the opposite properties of template-based and template-free algorithms or it was because of the weakness of SSE-PSSM, we applied the same feature-integration procedure to combine SSpro8T with DeepCNF, the most accurate PSI-BLAST-based template-free method we utilized, and PSIPRED, the rapidest one. The results summarized in <xref rid="pone.0255076.s008" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Table</xref>, where the Q3/SOV3 of SSpro8T integrated with either DeepCNF or PSIPRED were barely improved and the Q8/SOV8 decreased, revealed that the SSE-PSSM is analogous to template-free SSP methods in some aspects. We speculated that, when the integrated feature set of SSpro8T and SSE-PSSM (or a template-free method) was trained with the QuerySet-T, which consisted of PDB structures deposited before 2015, the SSpro8T would dominate the accuracy because it was trained by structures deposited before or in 2013, rather close to the deposit year of QuerySet-T proteins. Once the predictive model was established, features other than SSpro8T would be ineffective or even become noise in actual predictions.</p>
      <p>To sum up, an SSP method developed based on the template-based SSE-PSSM can significantly outperform template-free methods when good template(s) are available; otherwise, it will still work by assembling fragmented far-related templates and produce analogous results of template-free methods.</p>

    <sec id="sec011">
      <title>From where SSE-PSSM brings improvements</title>
      <p>An apparent reason why the SSE-PSSM could help current SSP methods achieve improved accuracies is the usage of secondary structure information of the homologs of the query protein. According to the alignment of homologs, as a traditional amino acid PSSM provides per residue the conservation pattern of amino acids [<xref rid="pone.0255076.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>], an SSE-PSSM provides the conservation pattern of secondary structure elements, which is supposed much more referable in SSP than the former. Another reason for the improvement might be the high information density of the matrix, as demonstrated by the fact that the PPM of an SSE-PSSM may contain fewer null data than an AA-PSSM (<xref rid="pone.0255076.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>). To examine the influence of the information density, we computed the average proportion of codes with zero occurrence frequency in the PPM of the AA-PSSM and SSE-PSSM. As shown in <xref rid="pone.0255076.s012" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6 Table</xref>, the proportion of null-occurrence codes of the SSE-PSSM was remarkably lower than that of the AA-PSSM. If the proportion of null-occurrence did influence the performance of a PSSM in SSP, when the size of the SSE alphabet increased, the accuracy should decrease. As expected, when the SSE alphabet was changed from the DSSP alphabet (8 codes) to the kappa-alpha (22 codes) [<xref rid="pone.0255076.ref076" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>] or the SARST alphabet (23 codes) [<xref rid="pone.0255076.ref077" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>], as the proportion of null-occurrence codes increased, the SSP accuracy dropped.</p>

      <title>On the accuracy of secondary structure prediction for proteins of different structural classes and sizes</title>
      <p>Among helix, strand, and coil conformations, SSP methods’ accuracy is usually highest in helices and lowest in strands [<xref rid="pone.0255076.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0255076.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Similar results were observed in <xref rid="pone.0255076.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. The accuracy of all applied state-of-the-art SSP methods yielded the highest or second-highest Q3/8 in all-alpha (mainly helices) and the lowest Q3/8 in all-beta (mainly strands) proteins. Interestingly, when measuring the accuracy using SOV3/8 instead of Q3/8, the most inferior accuracy remained in the all-beta class; however, the highest changed to the alpha-beta mixed class. We speculate that the reason is the property of the SOV algorithm, which is more sensitive to whether the pattern of SSE segments is correctly predicted than whether each SSE code is precisely positioned [<xref rid="pone.0255076.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. Because of it, if the boundaries of SSE segments were predicted imperfectly, the decrease of SOV in all-alpha proteins may be greater than that in alpha-beta mixed. The traditional Q3/8, on the contrary, is sensitive to the boundary of SSE segments because it counts every residue position equally. As a result, imprecise boundary predictions will decrease the Q3/8 more in alpha-beta mixed than in all-alpha proteins, as exemplified below,</p>
      <p specific-use="line">All-alpha,         Q3 = 0.600, SOV3 = 0.441</p>

      <p>where the syntaxes of these pseudo secondary structures are the same (<monospace>-<bold>C</bold>XXXX-</monospace>), and the only difference between an actual and a predicted SSE sequence is a frameshift. With the same secondary structural segment patterns, the fluctuations of Q3 are higher than those of SOV3. When Q3 of the alpha-beta mixed case is so much lower than Q3 of the all-alpha case (0.440 &lt; 0.600), SOV3 of the alpha-beta mixed case is even higher than SOV3 of the all-alpha case (0.526 &gt; 0.441). In addition to the different algorithmic properties regarding imprecise boundaries, these examples reveal that Q and SOV have very different tendencies for proteins of different structural types. We would like to suggest a cautious use of both measures in situations where the accuracy of an SSP method is assessed with multiple datasets, especially when the contents of protein structure classes of those datasets vary.</p>
      <p>The formation of a β-strand-pleated sheet may involve residues distant in a protein sequence, while residues of a helix are usually located nearby. Therefore, most previous studies explained that the higher prediction accuracy in helices than strands is because of the difficulty of catching the long-range residue interactions of strands [<xref rid="pone.0255076.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0255076.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. Here we speculate that imbalanced training cases may be another reason. The natural prevalence of strands is lower than that of helices (around 3:5). In the development of an SSP predictor, if the balance of the structural classes of cases were not considered, it is very likely that the training datasets contain fewer strands than helices and hence make the predictor less sensitive to strands. The first supporting data are the relatively balanced performances of the SSE-PSSM model in different structure classes (<xref rid="pone.0255076.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>), which might be accomplished partly because of the SCOP class-balanced training dataset (QuerySet-T; <xref rid="sec015" ref-type="sec">Materials and methods</xref>). Indirect support comes from the balanced performance of the SSE-PSSM model for proteins of different sizes (<xref rid="pone.0255076.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>), which might be the effect of the fact that QuerySet-T was also a size-balanced dataset. Hence, we suggest future SSP studies use the approach we prepared the training dataset to balance the SSP performance for various types of proteins.</p>

    <sec id="sec013">
      <title>Limitation of the proposed approaches</title>
      <p>An understandable disadvantage of the current SSE-PSSM algorithm is that the SSE sequences of target proteins are required. When the structure of a hit retrieved by sequence similarity search from the target dataset is not available, our solution was to run a second-round similarity search against a reference dataset of non-redundant structures to construct an approximate SSE sequence for the hit (Subsection: <bold>Algorithm of the SSE-PSSM</bold>). Although this approximation indeed helped improve the accuracy of all applied SSP methods as the SSE-PSSM was incorporated, the improvements were smaller than situations where the target protein structures were available (compare the TargetSet-nr25 and UniRef90 results of <xref rid="pone.0255076.s007" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0255076.s008" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2</xref> Tables). Therefore, the best way to implement the SSE-PSSM is to utilize a target dataset of known structures, such as a non-redundant PDB or SCOP set. This strategy will bring another benefit: efficiency. Because PDB and SCOP databases are much smaller than the UniRef, carrying out SSP on them will significantly reduce the time cost. For instance, nrPDB90-2015 is approximately one-thousandth of UniRef90-2015 in size. As <xref rid="pone.0255076.s013" ref-type="supplementary-material">S7 Table</xref> shows, when nrPDB90-2015 was applied as the target set to run PSI-BLAST-based SSP methods, the speed was enhanced by 410 folds on average. Although using a small target set may decrease the accuracy (see also [<xref rid="pone.0255076.ref073" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>] for the influence of target set size on SSP accuracy), if the proposed SSE-PSSM could be implemented in those powerful methods, this decrease might be compensated or even overcome.</p>
      <p>We designed a second-level machine learning approach to preliminarily test the accuracy of several SSP methods as if the SSE-PSSM were integrated into their feature sets. Before the test, we have demonstrated that this second-level machine learning wrap had little influence on the normal performance of the applied SSP methods (<xref rid="sec015" ref-type="sec">Materials and methods</xref>). Thus, accuracy improvements observed in the preliminary feature integration tests (Figs <xref rid="pone.0255076.g002" ref-type="fig">2</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0255076.g003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>) were accomplished because of the integrated SSE-PSSM. Notwithstanding, this approach was just a simulation, and it had a weakness. When the output of a program was not the probabilities of SSEs but a single SSE classification, like in the Scorpion [<xref rid="pone.0255076.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], there will be only one informative feature obtained for each residue, and hence the applicability of this wrapped integration may be reduced. Nevertheless, as a preliminary test, our results manifested the potential of the SSE-PSSM for serving current SSP methods as a new predictive feature set.</p>

    <sec id="sec014">
      <title>Future perspectives</title>
      <p>Even though more and more powerful machine learning technologies have been applied in predicting protein secondary structures and both the records of Q3 and Q8 are broken in every short period, the improvements accomplished recently were minor. A prevailing opinion about the decelerated improvement in SSP is that the Q3 of recent works has been approaching the 88–90% theoretical limit [<xref rid="pone.0255076.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0255076.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. However, this limit was just an estimate, and Rost <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>. had also reported a large standard deviation associated with it (88.8±9.1%; <xref rid="pone.0255076.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref> of [<xref rid="pone.0255076.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]). If we were not so closely approaching the ultimate limit of SSP (refer to [<xref rid="pone.0255076.ref078" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>] for stringent evaluation of the current SSP methodology where SSE-PSSM applied), there must be certain factors restricting the progress. Since the amino acid PSSM was introduced into this field in around 2000, there have been few fundamental changes in the predictive feature set. In order to push the accuracy of current SSP algorithms out of the plateau, perhaps it is time to refine the foundation of the entire SSP methodology. The proposed SSE-PSSM may serve as a good alternative or addition to the current AA-PSSM feature set and help make a breakthrough.</p>
      <p>The idea of SSP by synthesizing the secondary structure information of the query protein’s homologs had been tested. The PROSP algorithm of the HYPROSP approach (a hybrid pipeline of PROSP and PSIPRED) [<xref rid="pone.0255076.ref079" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>] used PSI-BLAST to retrieve structural homologs of the query and analyzed their alignments by statistics to construct a knowledge base, which contained oligopeptide fragments with associated structural information, for making predictions. The Q3 of PROSP was 60–80%, depending on the match rate of the knowledge base with the query [<xref rid="pone.0255076.ref079" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]. The knowledge base is analogous to SSE-PSSM, in which every residue of the query is assigned with a set of SSE scores. Besides the difference that PROSP encoded secondary structures in three-state while the SSE-PSSM did in eight-state, PROSP made predictions by assigning the SSE of the highest score to each residue, whereas SSE-PSSM was proposed to act as a standard PSSM to be processed by machine learning. MUPRED, which encoded the alignments between the query protein and its structural homologs with a fuzzy <italic toggle="yes">k</italic>-nearest neighbor algorithm into fuzzy three-state SSE class memberships for every residue, integrated the class memberships with PSI-BLAST PSSM into a feature set to make SSP by a neural network and achieved 79–80% Q3 [<xref rid="pone.0255076.ref080" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>]. SSE-PSSM took advantage of the eight-state SSE classification and could encode the secondary structure of homologs in more detail than did the fuzzy class memberships. Regardless of some algorithmic differences, the concepts of SSE knowledge base and class memberships were similar to SSE-PSSM. If those scoring schemes could be assessed with current machine learning techniques, their accuracy would be remarkably enhanced. To facilitate the evolution of SSE-based SSP concepts and the renewal of modern SSP feature sets, we have implemented the proposed algorithm into an SSE-PSSM generating web server and standalone programs available at <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="http://10.life.nctu.edu.tw/SSE-PSSM" ext-link-type="uri">http://10.life.nctu.edu.tw/SSE-PSSM</ext-link>.</p>
      <p>SSP is an essential basis for many research and applications. If future SSP methods can adopt SSE-PSSM, a fundamental advancement in SSP is expectable and supposed beneficial for a variety of fields. For example, a homology modelling system for protein complexes we developed integrates predicted secondary structures into the template search algorithm [<xref rid="pone.0255076.ref081" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>]. Introducing an accurate SSP engine into this system may help improve the quality of identified templates and enable it to predict the contact interface of subunits. In bioengineering, predicting viable circular permutation sites is restricted to proteins with known structures at present because many predictive features were derived from secondary and tertiary protein structures [<xref rid="pone.0255076.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0255076.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]; with accurate SSP, predicting viable permutation sites for proteins with only sequences will be achievable and thus expanding the application of circular permutation.</p>

      <title>Experimental datasets</title>
      <p>When performing sequence similarity searches to generate PSSMs, one needs a set of query sequences and a set of target sequences. Evaluating the performance of a machine-learning-based predictor requires a set of training data and a set of testing data. If the composition of the testing dataset is very different from that of the training dataset, the extent of information leakage is supposed low, and overestimation of the predictor may be prevented. For protein sequences, the difference between datasets is typically judged by their non-redundancy of sequence identities. Following previous studies, we termed a testing dataset very different from the training dataset, <italic toggle="yes">i</italic>.<italic toggle="yes">e</italic>., sharing &lt;25% sequence identities, as an independent dataset. The primary purpose of data preparation in this study was to sustain stringent evaluation of the proposed algorithm by independent tests, and it was achieved by 1) creating a highly non-redundant pair of query datasets (QuerySet-T and QuerySet-I) for training and independent tests, and 2) utilizing well-developed independent test datasets from previous studies.</p>

        <title>Datasets for training and independent tests</title>
        <p>The experimental structural data were obtained from the 30% identity non-redundant (nr) dataset released by PDB [<xref rid="pone.0255076.ref075" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>] in Dec. 2015 and then homology-reduced to 25% sequence identity. Proteins with chain breaks or shorter than 20 residues were discarded. Since the official PDB nr sets were prepared by heuristic clustering [<xref rid="pone.0255076.ref082" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>], for ensuring the &lt;25% identity, homology reduction methods CD-HIT [<xref rid="pone.0255076.ref083" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>], USEARCH [<xref rid="pone.0255076.ref084" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>], and MMseqs2 [<xref rid="pone.0255076.ref085" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>] were iteratively applied to it until no sequence could be removed at the 25% identity cutoff. In the produced dataset, abbreviated nrPDB25-2015 (11,449 proteins; <xref rid="pone.0255076.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 File</xref>), any two sequences were very different; when a sequence was selected from it to be the query protein and the rest were used as the target dataset, all the hits retrieved by sequence search would be very different from the query. To evaluate the performance of the SSE-PSSM feature set on proteins of different structural classes and sizes, we randomly selected 90 small (&lt;150 residues), 90 medium (150–299 residues), and 90 large proteins (≥300 residues) from each of the four structural classes: all-alpha (a), all-beta (b), alpha-beta mixed (a/b) and alpha-beta segregated (a+b) according to SCOP [<xref rid="pone.0255076.ref074" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. There were 12 categories (4 classes × 3 sizes) comprising 1,080 (90 × 12) proteins. Form each category, 60 proteins were randomly selected to constitute the query dataset for training (QuerySet-T), and the other 30 were collected into the query dataset for independent tests (QuerySet-I). Finally, the QuerySet-T and QuerySet-I contained 720 and 360 proteins, respectively. After removing the sequences appearing in these query sets, the rest of nrPDB25-2015 served as the target dataset, which shared &lt;25% identities with the query sets and was abbreviated TargetSet-nr25. Because of the stringent homology reduction, the number of sequences available for assessing the SSE-PSSM was small. In order to ensure the results are stable, random sampling was applied three times to generate the QuerySet-T, QuerySet-I, and TargetSet-nr25 datasets, meaning all experiments in this study were repeated three times, and the reported data were average.</p>

        <title>Datasets from previous studies</title>
        <p>To make rigorous assessments of the proposed method, we sought for suitable independent test datasets. In a review by Dr. Yaoqi Zhou, state-of-the-art SSP techniques developed <bold>before</bold> 2016 were evaluated with two independent datasets comprising structures released <bold>after</bold> Jan. 1<sup>st</sup> 2016 with very low sequence identities to those released before 2016 [<xref rid="pone.0255076.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. These two datasets, the CASP12 obtained from the 12<sup>th</sup> biannual meeting of Critical Assessment of Structure Prediction techniques [<xref rid="pone.0255076.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>] (15 proteins of 91–540 residues), and the TS115 prepared by them (115 proteins of 43–1,085 residues), were utilized because the predictive model of SSE-PSSM and most SSP algorithms tested in this study were trained with proteins released before 2016. Since some tested SSP algorithms were released after 2016, the CASP13 obtained from the 13<sup>th</sup> biannual meeting of CASP consisting of structures released between 2017 and 2019 was also utilized (43 proteins of 32–718 residues). When performing independent tests with these query sets, the target datasets for generating PSSMs were the UniRef90 of 2015 (UniRef90-2015; 38.2 million proteins) [<xref rid="pone.0255076.ref086" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>] and a 90% identity nr set of PDB of the same year (nrPDB90-2015; 34,835 proteins; see <xref rid="pone.0255076.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 File</xref>). Most SSP methods applied in this study were template-free algorithms. We also tested the template-based version of SSpro8 (SSpro8T) to compare different categories of methods. The SSpro8T was evaluated by a large testing dataset of ~11,000 proteins, which was not released [<xref rid="pone.0255076.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Following the preparation procedure stated in [<xref rid="pone.0255076.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], we established an equivalent testing dataset containing 10,226 proteins abbreviated as TSsspro8 (listed in <xref rid="pone.0255076.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 File</xref> with the CASP13).</p>

        <title>Methods using PSI-BLAST as the PSSM generator</title>
        <p>Several PSI-BLAST-powered SSP methods were applied to help evaluate the SSE-PSSM and determine whether integrating this new feature set into those advanced methods would improve SSP accuracy. The standalone programs of all those methods were trained and released before 2016, including three-state algorithms: PSIPRED (v3.3) [<xref rid="pone.0255076.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], SpineX (v2.0) [<xref rid="pone.0255076.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], Scorpion (v1.0) [<xref rid="pone.0255076.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], and Spider2 (v2.0) [<xref rid="pone.0255076.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], and eight-state algorithms: RaptorX (v1.0) [<xref rid="pone.0255076.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], SSpro8 (v5.2) [<xref rid="pone.0255076.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], and DeepCNF (v1.02) [<xref rid="pone.0255076.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The original packages of these programs used different versions and parameters of PSI-BLAST, such as the E-value cutoff and the number of iterations of sequence similarity searches. To make the experiments performed on an equal basis, we modified their pipeline scripts such that the psiblast program of NCBI blast 2.3.0 [<xref rid="pone.0255076.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>] with a given set of parameters became the only PSSM engine (see <xref rid="pone.0255076.s014" ref-type="supplementary-material">S8 Table</xref> for the original and modified settings). The way we set up PSI-BLAST parameters was based on 1) the common settings used by most applied methods, 2) the settings suggested by the secondary structural code generating algorithms utilized in this work [<xref rid="pone.0255076.ref077" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0255076.ref087" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>], and 3) the default of psiblast.</p>
        <p>To make sure that we correctly ran these programs and our modifications did not disturb their normal performance, as a pretest, we conducted SSP using these methods with the TS115 and CASP12 query sets and the UniRef90-2015 target dataset and compared the results with previous reports on the same methods using equivalent datasets [<xref rid="pone.0255076.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0255076.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In most, if not all, previous SSP studies, the accuracy data were presented as average values over queries. The averages of accuracy computed in this way using our pipeline were all close to and even slightly higher than those obtained from the literature (<xref rid="pone.0255076.t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>).

        <title>Methods using HHBlits as the PSSM generator</title>
        <p>HHBlits is an efficient iterative protein sequence similarity search algorithm that aligns sequences according to their hidden Markov models [<xref rid="pone.0255076.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. Since the MSA conservation profile of HHBlits can be readily transformed into a PSSM, it is increasingly utilized by recent SSP methods as a PSSM generator. The HHBlits-based SSP algorithms applied in this study fall into two types. The NetSurfP-2 [<xref rid="pone.0255076.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] used only HHBlits to generate its SSP feature set, while the others used both the PSSMs generated by HHBlits and PSI-BLAST as predictive features, including MUFOLD-SS [<xref rid="pone.0255076.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], Porter5 [<xref rid="pone.0255076.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], and Spider3 [<xref rid="pone.0255076.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. As listed in <xref rid="pone.0255076.s014" ref-type="supplementary-material">S8 Table</xref>, we also unified the version and settings of PSI-BLAST used in the pipelines of these programs. Additionally, the version of HHBlits was fixed to be 3.3.0. These HHBlits-based SSP algorithms were significantly more accurate than the PSI-BLAST-based ones. Assessed with the TS115 and CASP12/13 independent datasets, both Q3 and Q8 of the former were &gt;3% higher than the latter (see <xref rid="pone.0255076.s011" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5 Table</xref>).</p>

      <title>Algorithm of the SSE-PSSM</title>
      <p>The major innovation of this work is the secondary structure element-based PSSM, the algorithm of which is illustrated in <xref rid="pone.0255076.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4</xref>. Most of the steps follow the traditional procedure for constructing an amino acid-based PSSM. The key modification is an SSE transformation.

If PSI-BLAST is used, make sure it provides the alignment between the query and each hit by setting the same value for “num_descriptions” and “num_alignments” parameters (<xref rid="pone.0255076.s014" ref-type="supplementary-material">S8 Table</xref>). If HHBlits is used, the multiple sequence alignment between the query and all hits can be obtained from its .hhr output file.

        <p>Following most previous studies [<xref rid="pone.0255076.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0255076.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], the AA-PSSM was generated by the PSI-BLAST [<xref rid="pone.0255076.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>].

        <title>Amino acid type</title>
        <p>Many recent studies also used each residue’s amino acid type as a feature [<xref rid="pone.0255076.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0255076.ref089" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0255076.ref090" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>]. For instance, Dr. Wang and colleagues used 21 binary features to indicate the amino acid type (20 types plus the undetermined) at a residue position as they developed the DeepCNF [<xref rid="pone.0255076.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Here we proposed a strategy to encode amino acid types as a feature: 1) classify amino acids into five classes based on their side-chain physiochemical properties [<xref rid="pone.0255076.ref091" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>], 2) sort the class by hydrophobicity high to low, 3) sort the amino acids in each class by their natural abundance low to high, and 4) assign an integer, low to high, to the sorted amino acids in all classes (see <xref rid="pone.0255076.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5 File</xref> for the encoded amino acids). The benefits of this strategy include the speed of machine learning and implicated biological meaning. First, the proposed strategy encodes 20 amino acids into just one feature, helpful for keeping the feature set small. Second, we have tested several other methods to encode the amino acids, inclusive of the DeepCNF algorithm, the molecular weight, the hydrophobicity scale, the side chain hydropathy, the solvent accessible surface area, the isoelectric point, the radius of gyration of the side chain, and the occurrence frequency in the PDB. Most of them produced similar SSP accuracies, and the proposed amino-acid feature slightly outperformed them. We presumed that the proposed classification step resulted in the fact that physiochemically similar amino acids were assigned with similar integers, making it easier for machine learning algorithms to identify the relationship or closeness between amino acids.</p>

The integration of any two or all of them was simply a merge of the feature sets. Since the amino acid type is usually applied in recent works [<xref rid="pone.0255076.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0255076.ref089" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0255076.ref090" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>], the final version of the SSE-PSSM assessed in this study was integrated with it, so was the amino acid PSSM.</p>

      <title>Application of machine-learning methods</title>
      <p>We did not develop any new machine learning method but utilized a system we had to evaluate the SSE-PSSM as a set of SSP features. If the advanced machine learning methods of recent studies, such as the deep convolutional neural fields (CNF) [<xref rid="pone.0255076.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], bidirectional recursive neural networks (BRNN) [<xref rid="pone.0255076.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0255076.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0255076.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0255076.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>], and convolutional recurrent neural network (CRNN) [<xref rid="pone.0255076.ref090" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0255076.ref092" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>] can be applied with the SSE-PSSM, the outcome will be much better than the reported.</p>
      <p>Previously as we studied a protein structural rearrangement phenomenon known as the circular permutation [<xref rid="pone.0255076.ref087" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>], an artificial intelligence system was developed to integrate several machine learning, random sampling, and parameter optimization algorithms [<xref rid="pone.0255076.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0255076.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. In the present work, this system was applied, and the recruited algorithms included bootstrap sampling, decision tree, and artificial neural network. After obtaining the answers and feature values from the training query set (QuerySet-T) and TargetSet-nr25, 100 bootstrap samples each with a bootstrapped feature set were made to train minor models of decision tree and artificial neural network (50 samples for each algorithm). The final prediction model was then formed by collecting the minor models, which made predictions by vote (note that the collection of bootstrapped decision trees is known as a random forest). With this final model, the probabilities of candidate answers for a given residue could be estimated as the percentages of votes the answers received.</p>
      <p>With the same input data and machine learning layout, either a three-state or an eight-state predictive model could be produced. An eight-state model could be applied to perform three-state predictions simply by reducing the output SSE codes to three states. However, our pretests showed that the accuracy of such manipulation was not comparable to that of a predictive model specifically constructed for three-state predictions. In this study, the three- and eight-state prediction experiments were done using different predictive models.</p>

Since SOV is more critical than the Q accuracy and extending the window by one residue will increase the number of features by one fold, which will greatly increase the time cost of machine learning, we decided to use the window size of 5 residues.</p>

        <title>SSE alphabets and their combinations</title>
        <p>In addition to the commonly used three-state and the DSSP-defined eight-state SSE codes, the kappa-alpha and SARST alphabets [<xref rid="pone.0255076.ref076" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0255076.ref077" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>] were examined for feasibility in constructing the SSE-PSSM feature set. Three-state prediction experiments on feature sets derived from the SSE-PSSMs of these alphabets and several combinations were performed using QuerySet-T and TargetSet-nr25 with a 5-residue window. Results listed in <xref rid="pone.0255076.s015" ref-type="supplementary-material">S9 Table</xref> indicated that combining the PSSMs of DSSP, kappa-alpha, and SARST codes might achieve the best accuracy, but the enhancement over the SSE-PSSM of DSSP codes was not much (0.4% in Q3). Considering the simplicity for future implementations of the SSE-PSSM, we decided to use only the PSSM of eight-state DSSP codes in this study.</p>

      <title>Combination of the SSE-PSSM with well-developed secondary structure prediction programs</title>
      <p>The source codes of model training of the applied SSP programs were not available. In order to integrate the SSE-PSSM into their systems, an indirect strategy was applied. First, after inputting a query protein to a given SSP program, for each residue, obtain the predicted probabilities of SSE codes. According to the category of the method, there may be 3 or 8 probabilities. Second, if the output of the program is just one predicted SSE code, set the probability to be 1 for the code and assign 0 probability to the others. Third, the obtained probability values are used as features combined with the SSE-PSSM for training predictive models and performing predictions by our machine learning system. In this way, the SSE-PSSM could be “indirectly” incorporated into a compiled SSP program. This strategy had been used previously. For example, the template-based SSP method PROTEUS [<xref rid="pone.0255076.ref094" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>] integrated the output of PSIPRED [<xref rid="pone.0255076.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], JNET [<xref rid="pone.0255076.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>], and its TRANSSEC into a machine learning feature set to make predictions by a neural network. If there were homologous structural fragments (<italic toggle="yes">i</italic>.<italic toggle="yes">e</italic>., templates) identified for the query sequence, PROTEUS would overlap the structural fragments over the predicted secondary structure to be its final output. With its template mode disabled, the Q3 of PROTEUS was 79.4%, which reasonably preserved and integrated the accuracy of applied programs: PSIPRED 78.1%, JNET 73.2%, and TRANSSEC 70.3% [<xref rid="pone.0255076.ref094" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>]. To verify whether our indirect feature-integration strategy also worked reasonably, we compared the accuracy of the SSP methods executed solely and their accuracy after the second-level machine learning wrap. <xref rid="pone.0255076.s016" ref-type="supplementary-material">S10 Table</xref> shows that the differences of accuracy between the native programs and the machine learning wrapped pipelines were generally small.</p>

(Please upload your review as an attachment if it exceeds 20,000 characters)</p>
    <p>Reviewer #1: The work by Chen et al proposed a method to generate secondary structure PSSM based on homologous sequences in a predefined library and then use this PSSM for secondary structure prediction. The work is interesting. Here are some questions.</p>
    <p>1) The literature review did not cover many methods that incorporate homology in secondary structure prediction. Please compare and contrast the difference. Examples are HYPROSP, PROTEUS, and MUPRED.</p>
    <p>2) It is not clear what parameters were used in PSI-BLAST to locate the homologous sequences of a query sequence from the target dataset. Was a e-value cutoff used? What happens if no homologs were found in the target dataset?</p>
    <p>3) Please report the separate results of free-modeling targets in CASP12 and CASP13.</p>
    <p>4) For completeness, please compare to more recent works of SPOT-1D (Bioinformatics. 2019 Jul 15;35(14):2403-2410) and NetSurfP-2.0 (Proteins. 2019 Jun;87(6):520-527).</p>
    <p>5) This method essentially is a template-based method (remote-homology). Please explicitly say so.</p>
    <p>Reviewer #2: The authors have presented a secondary structure prediction algorithm using a machine learning model trained on PDB structures with DSSP SSE assignments.</p>
    <p>The mapping of secondary structure information on pairwise sequence alignment to generate a position specific scoring matrix is very simple to understand and is presented in an intelligible fashion.</p>
    <p>Although, the use of local pairwise alignment for structure template based algorithms is very risky and can prove to be fatal yet almost every other template based sequence to structure predictor does exactly that.</p>
    <p>Therefore, I shall not comment over such fundamental ideological discrepancies amongst sequence and structural specialists.</p>
    <p>Overall, the article is well explained and does appear to be lengthy to read and comprehend. This is a major drawback in the manuscript organization.</p>
    <p>I would like to suggest the authors to cut-short the length of the article for convenient reading. Longer articles tend to have lesser citations.</p>
    <p>Before this article can be accepted to be published, I have some major concerns in the designed study and reported statistics. Concerns are listed as follows:</p>
    <p>Major_1: In Table 6 the authors have tried to show a benchmark (control) analysis by running the known SoA SSP methods over standardized data-set after tinkering their protocol with PSI-BLAST v2.3.0.</p>
    <p>1) Authors had used a version of 2015 and not a recent one. While I would like to know the rationale behind the choice, my important concern is that:</p>
    <p>The references listed as no. 6 and 7 were published in 2014 and 2016 resp. and used the same or perhaps an older version of PSI-BLAST.</p>
    <p>The NCBI-BLAST package updates from v2.2.28 to v2.3.0 does not list any major change to PSI-BLAST pipeline.</p>
    <p>Did the improvements made to HSP calculation and/or handling of compositional biases in BLAST, impacted the difference between the performances of SSpro8, DeepCNF as listed in the references and as reported in this study?</p>
    <p>2) The authors have deliberately tried to cite SSPro8's performance from listed ref. 7(DeepCNF's Sci. Reports, 2016) and DeepCNF's accuracy from listed ref. 10 (2018 review) rather than using the values from their own studies [listed ref. 6 and 7].</p>
    <p>If the authors used the accuracy values from SSPro8's and DeepCNF references then their accuracy should be 87.92% and 85.40% instead of 79.5% and 82.3% resp.</p>
    <p>The reported values for SSPro8 are also misleading as the article reports the SSPro8 values for older template free method while SSPro8 published in 2014 showcases drastic improvements in prediction when employing secondary structure data.</p>
    <p>Since this article is specifically about a structure based PSSM, therefore, I expect a clarification on the choices that the authors made to report these values.</p>
    <p>3) The listed ref 6 for SSpro8 claims the secondary structure prediction problem to be essentially solved by showcasing a 92% accuracy using their structure template based approach.</p>
    <p>While their claim can be disputed, it would be worthwhile to check the performance of SSE-PSSM on the exact same data-set as used in ref. 6.</p>
    <p>Major_2: Authors have not disclosed the quality of PDB structures used. Since, the PSSM is based on DSSP secondary structure assignment, it is imperative for the readers to know:</p>
    <p>1. What was the resolution cut-off?</p>
    <p>2. Were there any missing regions in the final PDB data-set used, if so, how was it handled?</p>
    <p>Major_3: It is quite intriguing to understand that what motivated the authors to use three and not one sequence homology based clustering approaches to reduce the data-set size.</p>
    <p>Currently, CD-HIT, USEARCH, and MMseq2 were used to generate nrPDB25-2015 data-set.</p>
    <p>Minor_1:</p>
    <p>Reduce the manuscript size by making good use of the supplementary space.</p>
    <p>1. Transform data Tables to data-point plots with important data labels visible. The crude tables can be provided in the supplementary files for the curious minded.</p>
    <p>2. Lots of redundant sentences can be found in the main text. Please remove these.</p>
    <p>Ex:</p>
    <p>Ln.560-563 and 564- "The experimental protein structural data were obtained from the 30% identity non-redundant dataset released by the Protein Data Bank [72] in 2015 and were then homology-reduced to 25% sequence identity." "All proteins in this source dataset were deposited in the PDB no later than Dec. 2015."</p>
    <p>Ln 380-384 is completely irrelevant and not required.</p>
    <p>Suggestion:</p>
    <p>After reviewing the article, I strongly encourage the authors to rather develop this methodology as a web-service and compile it for a specialized journal where it shall have its due attention and criticism.</p>

    <p>PONE-D-20-15212</p>
    <p>A secondary structure-based position-specific scoring matrix applied to the improvement in protein secondary structure prediction</p>
    <p>Dear Professors and Editor,</p>
    <p>We would like to thank the anonymous reviewers for their careful reading and detailed comments, which have greatly enhanced this article. We are pleased that you find sufficient merit in the work and ask for an appropriately revised manuscript. The new version of our manuscript has been modified according to referees' comments, which are also answered as follows.</p>
    <p>==================================================</p>
    <p>Editor's comment</p>
    <p>Please also underline the specificity of your approach in regards to recent PLoS ONE publication (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0235153#sec013" ext-link-type="uri">https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0235153#sec013</ext-link>).</p>
    <p>## Response:</p>
    <p>We thank the editor for handling this manuscript. The topic of the above publication was about the speed improvement in protein secondary structure prediction (SSP). The improving strategy we proposed in that paper was based on size and homology reductions of the PSI-BLAST target dataset. There was no predicting method or machine learning feature set proposed, but these are the topic of the present work. The speed improvement paper has been cited in the revised manuscript where we find it appropriate (Ref [73]), and what motivated us to do that research is stated later in this letter.</p>
    <p>==================================================</p>
    <p>Comments to the Author</p>
    <p>1. Is the manuscript technically sound, and do the data support the conclusions?</p>
    <p>Reviewer #1: Partly</p>
    <p>Reviewer #2: Yes</p>
    <p>## Response:</p>
    <p>Sincerely, we would like to thank the reviewers for their constructive comments. We did our best to fulfill the requirements for publication. Please see below for our response to their concerns.</p>
    <p>------------------------------</p>
    <p>2. Has the statistical analysis been performed appropriately and rigorously?</p>
    <p>Reviewer #1: N/A</p>
    <p>Reviewer #2: Yes</p>
    <p>## Response:</p>
    <p>Indeed, complicated statistical analyses are not required to conduct this research. In calculating the average of accuracy scores, we applied the concept of micro-average in addition to the conventional macro-average used in most previous studies. This is because multiple query datasets were utilized in this work, and the micro-average is robust when the sizes of query proteins within or between datasets significantly vary. In Materials and Methods (Lines 659–663 on Page 35), we added an example of two proteins with very different sizes to demonstrate the difference between macro- and micro-averages, hoping to help the reader know how we reported the data.</p>
    <p>------------------------------</p>
    <p>3. Have the authors made all data underlying the findings in their manuscript fully available?</p>
    <p>Reviewer #1: Yes</p>
    <p>Reviewer #2: Yes</p>
    <p>## Response:</p>
    <p>Many thanks to the reviewers for their time and patience in reviewing our numerous Supplementary Information files.</p>

    <p>4. Is the manuscript presented in an intelligible fashion and written in standard English?</p>

    <p>Reviewer #2: Yes</p>
    <p>## Response:</p>
    <p>We thank the reviewers for their recognition of our writing quality. We have shortened the article following their suggestions.</p>
    <p>==================================================</p>
    <p>5. Review Comments to the Author</p>
    <p>Reviewer #1:</p>
    <p>The work by Chen et al proposed a method to generate secondary structure PSSM based on homologous sequences in a predefined library and then use this PSSM for secondary structure prediction. The work is interesting. Here are some questions.</p>
    <p>1) The literature review did not cover many methods that incorporate homology in secondary structure prediction. Please compare and contrast the difference. Examples are HYPROSP, PROTEUS, and MUPRED.</p>
    <p>## Response:</p>
    <p>We thank the reviewer for the positive feedback and informative comment. Before receiving this comment, we did not know those methods. After reviewing them, we felt so encouraged about the future application of SSE-PSSM because those methods had utilized similar concepts to the SSE-PSSM and achieved good accuracy in SSP. They are ideal supporting information about the feasibility of our algorithm. The PROTEUS established a neural network to combine the predicting power of three SSP methods, a strategy analogous to our feature-integration procedure described in Materials and Methods. Hence, we summarized the algorithm and results of PROTEUS in Materials and Methods on Page 45. The core concepts of HYPROSP and MUPRED are similar to the SSE-PSSM, although the SSE-PSSM encodes secondary structure information more delicately and is easier to implement. Information about these innovative SSP methods has been added to Discussion on Pages 28–29. We are very grateful to the reviewer for letting us know about these methods. Encouraged by them and because of the suggestion of Reviewer 2, we implemented a web server of SSE-PSSM to facilitate its future applications.</p>
    <p>------------------------------</p>
    <p>2) It is not clear what parameters were used in PSI-BLAST to locate the homologous sequences of a query sequence from the target dataset. Was a e-value cutoff used? What happens if no homologs were found in the target dataset?</p>
    <p>## Response:</p>
    <p>The reviewer is acknowledged for reminding us that we had not clearly described these necessary details for implementing the proposed SSP feature set. In the previous manuscript, we made a Supplemental Information file (the old S4 Table) to provide the PSI-BLAST parameter settings. However, the way we mentioned this file was obscure. In the revised manuscript, we organized the descriptions about the parameters of PSI-BLAST into a paragraph entitled "Methods using PSI-BLAST as the PSSM generator" (Page 33) and specifically named the E-value cutoff and the number of PSSM iterations to make the reader know what we mean by parameters. The E-value cutoff we applied for all PSI-BLAST-based SSP algorithms was 100, as listed in the revised S8 Table along with other parameter settings.</p>
    <p>The second question is critical to the implementation. Actually, a reason we set the E-value cutoff as 100 (default of PSI-BLAST: 10) was to prevent the "no homolog" scenario. Another problematic scenario for generating a PSSM is that, for some residue position, there is no aligned residue from the homologs. In addition to the E-value cutoff, we established a second firewall for these challenging scenarios using the pseudocount method utilized by the PSI-BLAST [53]. Before this method could be applied, a substitution matrix of SSE codes based on homology analysis should be established. To make future implementation of SSE-PSSM easy, we have added S4 File to provide this matrix and how it was generated (cited in Line 741, Page 40).</p>
    <p>------------------------------</p>
    <p>3) Please report the separate results of free-modeling targets in CASP12 and CASP13.</p>
    <p>4) For completeness, please compare to more recent works of SPOT-1D (Bioinformatics. 2019 Jul 15;35(14):2403-2410) and NetSurfP-2.0 (Proteins. 2019 Jun;87(6):520-527).</p>
    <p>## Response:</p>
    <p>We appreciate that the reviewer suggested testing the proposed feature set with more updated independent test datasets and SSP algorithms, which have made this study much stronger.</p>
    <p>The SSP algorithms assessed in the original manuscript were all published before 2016 because this study began in 2016. Due to the limited computation resources of our laboratory and the heavy loading of some applied algorithms, every experiment was so time-consuming that finishing the first manuscript took us three years. When this study was initiated, most SSP methods used PSI-BLAST to generate PSSM. Recently, more and more algorithms have begun using both the PSSMs generated by PSI-BLAST and HHBlits (e.g., SPOT-1D, MUFOLD-SS, Porter5, and Spider3), or only the HHBlits PSSM, such as NetSurfP-2. </p>
    <p>Between the recommended methods, we have applied the NetSurfP-2. SPOT-1D was successfully installed. However, predicting one protein of ~200 residues with it using our rapidest server machine (16-thread Intel i9 5.1GHz CPU, Nvidia GTX 1280-core 1.7GHz GPU, and 768G RAM) took 9.6 days. Due to the limited time and GPU resources, we turn to use other recent outstanding algorithms, including MUFOLD-SS, Porter5, and Spider3, to make assessments. In particular, Spider3 was published a little earlier than SPOT-1D by the same team. SPOT-1D makes predictions by integrating the results of Spider3 and both the PSSMs of PSI-BLAST and HHBlits.</p>
    <p>In the original manuscript, we tested the feasibility of SSE-PSSM using third-party datasets TS115 and CASP12. In the revision, CASP13 and TSsspro8 (please see below) were also utilized. TSsspro8 is composed of PDB structures deposited between May 2012 and Aug. 2013, TS115 and CASP12 datasets comprised structures deposited after Jan. 2016 that were highly non-redundant from structures before 2016, and CASP13 contained novel structures deposited mainly between 2017 and 2018. Because the seven PSI-BLAST-based SSP algorithms (released before 2016) and the four newly-applied HHBlits-based algorithms (released after 2017) should have all been trained with structures deposited before 2013, they all performed well on TSsspro8, no matter in the accuracy pretest (S5 Table) or our feature integration experiments (S2 and S4 Tables). As for TS115, CASP12, and CASP13, the accuracy of the algorithms decreased as the dataset became increasingly updated (i.e., containing more far-related proteins from the training datasets of the algorithms). Perhaps because the HHBlits-based algorithms had been sufficiently trained with proteins deposited before 2016, their accuracy on TS115 and CASP12 was remarkably higher than on CASP13. For instance, the micro-average Q3 of NetSurfP-2, MUFOLD-SS, Porter5, and Spider3 on TS115 and CASP12 was 0.840 and 0.860, respectively, and their micro-average Q3 on CASP13 was only 0.825 (S5 Table).</p>
    <p>Regardless of the performance of individual algorithms on any dataset, we had previously shown that integrating the SSE-PSSM can improve the accuracy of all the seven PSI-BLAST-based algorithms (the old Table 5; update to be S2 Table). Thanks to the reviewer's suggestion, this conclusion is further verified using a more recent independent dataset (CASP13) and HHBlits-based algorithms (Figs 2 and 3). In the revised manuscript, we have marked the contents about the new datasets with orange and new algorithms with light green text background colors, respectively.</p>
    <p>------------------------------</p>
    <p>5) This method essentially is a template-based method (remote-homology). Please explicitly say so.</p>
    <p>## Response:</p>
    <p>We appreciate this advice and have accordingly done it. In the first paragraph of the revised Discussion (Page 19), we stated, "Since the critical step of the SSE-PSSM algorithm is to determine the SSE sequences of the query protein's homologs based on a reference structure dataset, an SSP method developed using the SSE-PSSM is essentially a template-based method."</p>
    <p>==================================================</p>
    <p>Reviewer #2:</p>
    <p>The authors have presented a secondary structure prediction algorithm using a machine learning model trained on PDB structures with DSSP SSE assignments.</p>
    <p>The mapping of secondary structure information on pairwise sequence alignment to generate a position specific scoring matrix is very simple to understand and is presented in an intelligible fashion.</p>
    <p>Although, the use of local pairwise alignment for structure template based algorithms is very risky and can prove to be fatal yet almost every other template based sequence to structure predictor does exactly that. Therefore, I shall not comment over such fundamental ideological discrepancies amongst sequence and structural specialists.</p>
    <p>## Response:</p>
    <p>We would like to thank the reviewer for this pertinent comment. We had also realized that using pairwise alignment to determine the template for SSP might be inadequate, especially when the query is novel. This is why the proposed SSP feature set was a position specific scoring matrix (PSSM), the establishment of which relied on the alignments between the query sequence and many homologs. Nevertheless, the way we implemented the SSE-PSSM was still based on pairwise alignments. As we verified the compatibility of the SSE-PSSM with recent SSP algorithms such as MUFOLD-SS and NetSurfP-2, which all relied on the PSSM generated by HHBlits, we got the chance to implement the SSE-PSSM based on multiple alignments because the HHBlits readily provides the multiple sequence alignment (MSA) between the query protein and identified homologs. Comparing the SSE-PSSMs generated by PSI-BLAST pairwise alignments and HHBlits MSA, the latter achieved higher Q3/8 accuracies (compare the SSE-PSSM in S1 Table and the SSE-PSSMhh in S4 Table), especially when it was integrated with the amino acid PSSM. Thanks to the comment of Reviewer 2 and the question raised by Reviewer 1, we realized the power of MSA for enhancing the proposed SSP feature set. In the revised manuscript, descriptions of the MSA-based SSE-PSSM are also marked with a light green text background.</p>
    <p>------------------------------</p>
    <p>Overall, the article is well explained and does appear to be lengthy to read and comprehend. This is a major drawback in the manuscript organization. I would like to suggest the authors to cut-short the length of the article for convenient reading. Longer articles tend to have lesser citations.</p>
    <p>## Response:</p>
    <p>We would like to thank the reviewer for the positive comments and helpful suggestion. Please see the last part of this letter for modifications made to cut short the manuscript.</p>
    <p>------------------------------</p>
    <p>Before this article can be accepted to be published, I have some major concerns in the designed study and reported statistics. Concerns are listed as follows:</p>
    <p>## Response:</p>
    <p>Sincerely, we thank the reviewer for carefully reviewing our work. The questions and information related to the listed concerns provided valuable materials for us to test the proposed SSP feature set. The questions are answered point-to-point as follows.</p>
    <p>------------------------------</p>
    <p>Major_1: In Table 6 the authors have tried to show a benchmark (control) analysis by running the known SoA SSP methods over standardized data-set after tinkering their protocol with PSI-BLAST v2.3.0.</p>
    <p>1) Authors had used a version of 2015 and not a recent one. While I would like to know the rationale behind the choice, my important concern is that:</p>
    <p>The references listed as no. 6 and 7 were published in 2014 and 2016 resp. and used the same or perhaps an older version of PSI-BLAST.</p>
    <p>## Ans:</p>
    <p>We have long been using PSI-BLAST in research and teaching. As this project began in 2016, the PSI-BLAST we had was v2.3.0 (release date: Nov. 30, 2015). The SSP methods applied in this work might be developed with different versions of PSI-BLAST, but most authors did not tell the version they used (inclusive of the two references mentioned by the reviewer). Therefore, we used the one we already had at hand. Besides, to make fair assessments and prevent unexpected influences, we thought that the version and parameter settings of PSI-BLAST should be regarded as "control variables" of the experiments and remain constant. This is why we fixed the PSI-BLAST version/parameters of all SSP programs (S8 Table) and made the performance pretest (updated as Table 4).</p>
    <p>------------------------------</p>
    <p>The NCBI-BLAST package updates from v2.2.28 to v2.3.0 does not list any major change to PSI-BLAST pipeline. Did the improvements made to HSP calculation and/or handling of compositional biases in BLAST, impacted the difference between the performances of SSpro8, DeepCNF as listed in the references and as reported in this study?</p>
    <p>## Ans:</p>
    <p>It would be challenging to examine which part of the PSI-BLAST algorithm influenced the performance of the SSP methods. Since it was only utilized as a PSSM generator in the pipeline of conventional SSP programs, most authors did not provide the parameter settings they applied. However, we speculated that the difference in performance shown in Table 4 (the old Table 6) basically resulted from parameter settings. In one of our recent SSP studies, we found that the E-value cutoff dramatically affects the accuracy of SSpro8. The default cutoff of SSpro8 was 0.001. Changing the cutoff to 10 can significantly improve the accuracy (please see the Fig 1 of [73]). The E-value cutoff of PSI-BLAST applied in this study was 100. Second, we had also computed the accuracy of DeepCNF on TS115 and CASP12 using its default PSI-BLAST settings; the Q3 was 0.822 and 0.820, respectively, merely 0.001 lower than the Q3 reported in [14]. Another factor that might cause the observed difference in Table 4 is the target dataset, as we had also found that the size and composition of the target dataset can influence accuracy [73]. Following the regular evaluation procedure of PSI-BLAST-based SSP methods and the clues provided by [14], we used the UniRef90 released in 2015 as the target dataset. However, the actual dataset applied to assess the SSP methods was not stated in [14]. The UniRef90-2015 we used was released in December, but there were 11 other releases in 2015. If the same target dataset could be used, we should be able to obtain the same accuracy reported in [14].</p>
    <p>Because of the reviewer's question, we felt interested in to what extent the version of PSI-BLAST would influence the accuracy of SSP methods. We have tested several versions and found that the accuracies registered by ≥v2.2.28 were nearly the same.</p>
    <p>----------</p>
    <p>TS115/CASP12, v.2.2.21, v.2.2.28, v2.3.0, v2.6.0, v2.11.0</p>
    <p>----------</p>
    <p>DeepCNF, Q3, 0.825/0.815, 0.825/0.817, 0.826/0.819, 0.825/0.817, 0.825/0.817</p>
    <p>SSpro8, Q3, 0.701/0.680, 0.797/0.773, 0.798/0.771, 0.797/0.773, 0.797/0.773</p>
    <p>DeepCNF, Q8, 0.717/0.715, 0.716/0.714, 0.716/0.714, 0.716/0.714, 0.716/0.714</p>
    <p>SSpro8, Q8, 0.571/0.560, 0.686/0.664, 0.686/0.664, 0.686/0.664, 0.686/0.664</p>
    <p>----------</p>
    <p>When an older version was applied, the accuracy of SSpro8 significantly decreased. The above is a list of the macro-average Q accuracies of DeepCNF and SSpro8 on TS115/CASP12. The full results of our test on PSI-BLAST versions can be found in S5 Table. Although it may be difficult to explain the underlying mechanism for these results, our test showed that, unless the version of PSI-BLAST is very old, the performance of the applied SSP programs is stable.</p>
    <p>------------------------------</p>
    <p>2) The authors have deliberately tried to cite SSPro8's performance from listed ref. 7(DeepCNF's Sci. Reports, 2016) and DeepCNF's accuracy from listed ref. 10 (2018 review) rather than using the values from their own studies [listed ref. 6 and 7]. If the authors used the accuracy values from SSPro8's and DeepCNF references then their accuracy should be 87.92% and 85.40% instead of 79.5% and 82.3% resp.</p>
    <p>## Ans:</p>
    <p>The PSI-BLAST parameter settings and the choice of target dataset can remarkably influence the performance of an SSP algorithm [73]. Even when the parameters and target dataset remain unchanged for an algorithm, different accuracy will still be produced for different query sets. For instance, the accuracies of DeepCNF on TS115 and CASP12 are different under the same experimental conditions. Thus, comparing SSP methods using accuracy data obtained from individual papers based on different experimental conditions would be very difficult.</p>
    <p>In order to make the accuracy of various SSP algorithms comparable, we tried our best to use just one source of performance data. We cited the accuracy of DeepCNF and four other algorithms from [14] (2018 review) because all those algorithms were assessed with the same target and query datasets (UniRef90-2015 vs. TS115 and CASP12). For comparability as well, we used those target and query datasets to perform all experiments in our study. The exception in Table 4 were the accuracies of SSpro8 and RaptorX, which were obtained from [7] (DeepCNF) but not [14]. The only reason was that they were not computed in [14]. As for the reason why we cited these missing accuracies from [7] instead of the paper of SSpro8 (or RaptorX), we had stated in the main text, "using … TS115 and CASP12 … and compared the results with previous reports on the same methods using equivalent datasets [7,14]." Regarding SSpro8 and RaptorX, the equivalent datasets were the CullPDB and CASP11 query sets utilized in [7] (noted in the legend of Table 4). The CASP11 was considered equivalent to CAPS12 because they are CASP datasets with close release dates. CASP10 was also tested in [7], but we did not use it because its release date was too far from CAPS12. The CullPDB was a 25% non-redundant dataset of PDB, and it was considered equivalent to TS115 because the latter was a 30% non-redundant dataset of PDB.</p>
    <p>Thanks to the question raised by the reviewer, we now find it inappropriate to cite the Q8 of SSpro8 from [7]. Although the Q8 values of SSpro8 were computed in [14], we did not use them previously because they appeared to have only two decimal places (0.xx), and the Q8 listed in [7] had three (0.xxx). Now we realize that citing the data from [14] is more reasonable and have accordingly corrected them in the new Table 4. As for RaptorX, we keep using data from [14] because Q3 was not computed in the paper of RaptorX [5]; besides, the Q8 reported in [5] was assessed with datasets less equivalent to TS115/CASP12 than CullPDB/CASP12.</p>
    <p>------------------------------</p>
    <p>The reported values for SSPro8 are also misleading as the article reports the SSPro8 values for older template free method while SSPro8 published in 2014 showcases drastic improvements in prediction when employing secondary structure data.</p>
    <p>Since this article is specifically about a structure based PSSM, therefore, I expect a clarification on the choices that the authors made to report these values.</p>
    <p>## Ans:</p>
    <p>The SSE-PSSM algorithm relies on protein secondary structure data and thus could be categorized as a template-based method. However, the SSE-PSSM was not constructed based on any specific template(s). As we designed SSE-PSSM, we speculated that it might have some fundamental differences from classic template-based SSP algorithms. Therefore, the comparison between the SSE-PSSM predictive model and the template-based version SSpro8 (abbreviated as SSpro8T) was not carried out. We would like to thank the reviewer for the constructive comment. After comparing the performance of SSE-PSSM with SSpro8T and performing feature-integration tests between them, we clearly saw their differences. For example, as shown in S2 and S5 Tables, the accuracy of SSpro8T significantly decreased as the independent dataset became more and more updated (meaning increasingly far-related from its training data). The accuracy of the SSE-PSSM predictive models, just like DeepCNF and other template-free methods, decreased much less than SSpro8T did. The feature-integrated tests revealed that SSE-PSSM is capable of improving the accuracy of all assessed template-free methods, but integrating it with SSpro8T exhibited negligible improvements or even adverse effects (S2 Table). Feature-integration tests between PSIPRED/DeepCNF and SSpro8T also showed adverse effects. Please see the first subsection of Discussion for details.</p>
    <p>------------------------------</p>
    <p>3) The listed ref 6 for SSpro8 claims the secondary structure prediction problem to be essentially solved by showcasing a 92% accuracy using their structure template based approach. While their claim can be disputed, it would be worthwhile to check the performance of SSE-PSSM on the exact same data-set as used in ref. 6.</p>
    <p>## Response:</p>
    <p>We appreciate the reviewer's suggestion about using the dataset of [6] (SSpro8) to evaluate SSE-PSSM. Since the authors had not released their dataset, we established one following the procedure they made the testing dataset (namely, the pdb_post [6]). The authors said that their testing dataset contained proteins deposited in PDB between May 2012 and Aug. 2013, but the release date of their PDB source data was not stated. Hence, we used the closest PDB release that we had: Jan. 2, 2014. The testing dataset of [6] comprised 11,213 polypeptides solved by X-ray crystallography with ≤2.5 angstroms resolution and possessing ≥30 residues without chain breaks. Based on the same criteria, the testing dataset we prepared contained 10,226 polypeptides and was named TSsspro8 (S3 File). The Q3 and Q8 of SSpro8 on this dataset were 94% and 92%, respectively (S5 Table: Panel C-2).</p>
    <p>The TSsspro8 has been used to assess SSP methods in almost every experiment. Because this dataset is old, its data were provided in Supplementary Information files. Here we would like to express our profound apologies to the Editor and Reviewers for their long waiting. Because TSsspro8 is large and several applied SSP algorithms are computationally expensive (for instance, DeepCNF and Poter5 both took ~40 min to predict one protein), every experiment of this revision took several weeks. We just summarized the main results about TSsspro8 (and the template-based SSproo8) in previous paragraphs. In the revised manuscript, statements and Supplementary Information files related to TSsspro8 are marked orange.</p>
    <p>------------------------------</p>
    <p>Major_2: Authors have not disclosed the quality of PDB structures used. Since, the PSSM is based on DSSP secondary structure assignment, it is imperative for the readers to know:</p>
    <p>1. What was the resolution cut-off?</p>
    <p>2. Were there any missing regions in the final PDB data-set used, if so, how was it handled?</p>
    <p>## Response:</p>
    <p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out the information that we should provide. PDB polypeptides with chain breaks or missing regions of any length were eliminated as the nrPDB datasets (S1 and S2 Files) were prepared. Besides, polypeptides shorter than 20 residues were discarded. Because we wanted to test SSP algorithms with real-life cases, we had not restricted the structure-determining method or the resolution of structures. Since all the developmental datasets (training/testing query and target datasets) were sampled from the nrPDB25-2015 (S1 File), we analyzed the resolution propensities of nrPDB25-2015 proteins, as listed below.</p>
    <p>----------</p>
    <p>Resolution | No. of | Percentage</p>
    <p>....(Å)..... | polypeptides.. | in nrPDB25-2015 (%)</p>
    <p>----------</p>
    <p>N/A (NMR), 707, 6.2</p>
    <p>&lt; 1.0, 25, 0.2</p>
    <p>1.0 – 2.0, 4062, 35.5</p>
    <p>2.0 – 3.0, 5591, 48.9</p>
    <p>3.0 – 4.0, 978, 8.5</p>
    <p>4.0 – 5.0, 49, 0.4</p>
    <p>≥ 5.0, 31, 0.3</p>
    <p>----------</p>
    <p>------------------------------</p>
    <p>Major_3: It is quite intriguing to understand that what motivated the authors to use three and not one sequence homology based clustering approaches to reduce the data-set size. Currently, CD-HIT, USEARCH, and MMseq2 were used to generate nrPDB25-2015 data-set.</p>
    <p>## Response:</p>
    <p>We feel thankful for the reviewer's asking. The ultimate reason was to ensure the non-redundancy of the nrPDB25-2015, the source of all developmental datasets we used. PLOS ONE is not the first journal we submit this work. In the first version, we used the nrPDB30 prepared by the PDB, and the editor recommended us to make extra homology reduction because the official nrPDBs were prepared by heuristic clustering. After we redid all experiments with USEARCH nr25 reduction and submitted the work to another journal, a reviewer recommended CD-HIT while the other recommended using MMseqs2. Even though redoing all experiments in each revision took us several months, we were actually lucky to receive those suggestions. Perhaps because of the increased diversity of the training data, each time we performed more stringent homology reduction, the accuracy of SSE-PSSM predictive models increased. These experiences had inspired us to seek a general strategy for improving the speed of SSP and led us to discover how the composition of target dataset influences the accuracy of SSP methods. The speed-improving and accuracy-influencing dataset manipulation strategies have recently been published in PLOS ONE [73].</p>

    <p>Minor_1:</p>
    <p>Reduce the manuscript size by making good use of the supplementary space.</p>
    <p>1. Transform data Tables to data-point plots with important data labels visible. The crude tables can be provided in the supplementary files for the curious minded.</p>
    <p>## Response:</p>
    <p>We thank the reviewer for the helpful suggestions. We have moved the original Tables 4, 5, and 7 as well as Fig 3 into the supplementary space. The original Table 5 was also transformed to a bar chart (the new Fig 2) to make conspicuous the important data. The new data of HHBlits-based SSP methods were also diagrammed in the new Fig 3, and the crude table was provided in the supplementary space.</p>
    <p>------------------------------</p>
    <p>2. Lots of redundant sentences can be found in the main text. Please remove these.</p>
    <p>Ex:</p>
    <p>Ln.560-563 and 564- "The experimental protein structural data were obtained from the 30% identity non-redundant dataset released by the Protein Data Bank [72] in 2015 and were then homology-reduced to 25% sequence identity." "All proteins in this source dataset were deposited in the PDB no later than Dec. 2015."</p>
    <p>Ln 380-384 is completely irrelevant and not required.</p>
    <p>## Response:</p>
    <p>We appreciate the reviewer very much for helping us improve the quality of this article. Lines 380–384 of the previous manuscript were removed, so was the Conclusion. We have re-examined the whole article to erase redundancies and simplify the main text, hoping to improve the reader's reading experience. The tracking of Microsoft Word was retained in the "Revised Manuscript with Track Changes" file, showing how extensive the article was edited to cut-short the length.</p>
    <p>------------------------------</p>
    <p>Suggestion:</p>
    <p>After reviewing the article, I strongly encourage the authors to rather develop this methodology as a web-service and compile it for a specialized journal where it shall have its due attention and criticism.</p>
    <p>## Response:</p>
    <p>Sincere thanks to the reviewer for the encouragement. To facilitate the application of the proposed feature set in SSP and other fields, we have established a freely available web server and standalone programs for generating SSE-PSSM. The web server is still simple but will be continuously refined. When the SSE-PSSM feature set is formally integrated with an advanced SSP algorithm, we will publish a paper on the SSE-PSSM-powered secondary structure predictor.</p>

      <bold>Comments to the Author</bold>
    </p>
    <p>1. If the authors have adequately addressed your comments raised in a previous round of review and you feel that this manuscript is now acceptable for publication, you may indicate that here to bypass the “Comments to the Author” section, enter your conflict of interest statement in the “Confidential to Editor” section, and submit your "Accept" recommendation.</p>
    <p>Reviewer #2: All comments have been addressed</p>
    <p>**********</p>
    <p>2. Is the manuscript technically sound, and do the data support the conclusions?</p>
    <p>The manuscript must describe a technically sound piece of scientific research with data that supports the conclusions. Experiments must have been conducted rigorously, with appropriate controls, replication, and sample sizes. The conclusions must be drawn appropriately based on the data presented. </p>
    <p>Reviewer #2: Yes</p>
    <p>**********</p>
    <p>3. Has the statistical analysis been performed appropriately and rigorously? </p>
    <p>Reviewer #2: No</p>
    <p>**********</p>
    <p>4. Have the authors made all data underlying the findings in their manuscript fully available?</p>
    <p>The <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="http://www.plosone.org/static/policies.action#sharing" ext-link-type="uri">PLOS Data policy</ext-link> requires authors to make all data underlying the findings described in their manuscript fully available without restriction, with rare exception (please refer to the Data Availability Statement in the manuscript PDF file). The data should be provided as part of the manuscript or its supporting information, or deposited to a public repository. For example, in addition to summary statistics, the data points behind means, medians and variance measures should be available. If there are restrictions on publicly sharing data—e.g. participant privacy or use of data from a third party—those must be specified.</p>
    <p>Reviewer #2: Yes</p>
    <p>**********</p>
    <p>5. Is the manuscript presented in an intelligible fashion and written in standard English?</p>
    <p>PLOS ONE does not copyedit accepted manuscripts, so the language in submitted articles must be clear, correct, and unambiguous. Any typographical or grammatical errors should be corrected at revision, so please note any specific errors here.</p>
    <p>Reviewer #2: Yes</p>
    <p>**********</p>
    <p>6. Review Comments to the Author</p>
    <p>Please use the space provided to explain your answers to the questions above. You may also include additional comments for the author, including concerns about dual publication, research ethics, or publication ethics. (Please upload your review as an attachment if it exceeds 20,000 characters)</p>
    <p>Reviewer #2: I thank the authors for their painstaking efforts in correcting the manuscript and addressing all of my concerns. I am happy to accept the ms in its current form. However, I would have liked to see the webserver as a part of this article rather than another separate article. It would enhance the impact of the current article and also will provide readers a single point reference for the methodology in the ms.</p>
