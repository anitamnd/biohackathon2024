We optimized and benchmarked DiMeLo-seq by mapping chromatin-binding proteins and histone modifications across the human genome. Furthermore, we identified where centromere protein A (CENP-A) localizes within highly repetitive regions that we re unmappable with short sequencing reads, and we estimated the density of CENP-A molecules along single chromatin fibers.

    <title>Introduction</title>
    <p id="P6">Genomic DNA needs to be decoded and maintained by proteins that read, regulate, replicate, recombine, and repair it. Mapping where and how proteins interact with DNA can provide key insights into how they function or malfunction in healthy and diseased cells. Several powerful approaches have been developed to map where individual target proteins interact with DNA genome-wide, including DamID, ChIP-seq, CUT&amp;RUN, and their derivatives <sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>–<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>. These approaches involve selectively amplifying short DNA fragments from regions bound by a particular protein of interest, determining the sequence of those DNA molecules using next generation sequencing (NGS), and mapping those sequences back to a reference genome, using sequencing coverage as a measure of protein-DNA interaction frequency. While these methods have proven to be extremely useful for studying DNA-binding proteins and chromatin modifications <sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>, they suffer from several limitations.</p>
    <p id="P7">Firstly, the process of DNA amplification fails to copy DNA modification information, e.g., methylation and oxidation, from the native DNA molecules to the amplified and sequenced library DNA. This prevents simultaneous measurement of protein-DNA interactions and DNA modifications and limits the amount of information that can be gleaned about the relationship between these regulatory elements. Secondly, amplification-based enrichment methods often rely on PCR, and have intrinsic biases. Therefore, the sequencing coverage produced by these techniques provides only a semi-quantitative readout of protein-DNA interaction frequencies.</p>
    <p id="P8">Furthermore, these approaches rely on digesting or shearing DNA into short fragments for enrichment, followed by NGS, which produces short sequencing reads typically under 250 bp in length. Short fragment lengths are often necessary for achieving adequate binding site resolution with these techniques.Although it is possible to map multiple protein-DNA interactions on short reads <sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>, shearing the DNA into short fragments can destroy joint long-range binding information, and it hinders the ability to phase reads to measure haplotype-specific protein-DNA interactions. Additionally, repetitive regions of the human genome have presented a major challenge for genome assembly and mapping methods due to the difficulty of unambiguously assigning short DNA sequencing reads to their unique positions in the genome. These limitations hinder our ability to address lingering biological questions about the roles of repetitive sequences in cell division, protein synthesis, aging, and genome regulation.</p>
    <p id="P9">These limitations underline the need for protein-DNA interaction mapping methods that fully leverage the power of long-read, single-molecule sequencing technologies, including their ability to interrogate assembled repetitive regions<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> and to read out DNA modifications directly. To address this need, we developed Directed Methylation with Long-read sequencing (DiMeLo-seq; from <italic toggle="yes">dímelo</italic>, pronounced DEE-meh-low). DiMeLo-seq provides the ability to map protein-DNA interactions with high resolution on native, long, single, sequenced DNA molecules, while simultaneously measuring endogenous DNA modifications and sequence variation. These features provide an opportunity to study genome regulation in unprecedented ways. Recent technologies have begun to take advantage of long-read sequencing to identify accessible regions and CpG methylation on native single molecules, but they cannot directly target specific protein-DNA interactions <sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>–<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>. Here we extend these capabilities to map specific regulatory elements and demonstrate the advantages of DiMeLo-seq by mapping lamina-associated domains, CTCF binding sites, histone modifications/variants, and CpG methylation across the genome including complex repetitive domains.</p>

      <title>DiMeLo-seq workflow</title>
      <p id="P10">DiMeLo-seq combines elements of antibody-directed protein-DNA mapping approaches <sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> to deposit methylation marks near a specific target protein, then uses long-read sequencing to read out these exogenous methylation marks directly <sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>–<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>. Taking advantage of the low abundance of N<sup>6</sup>-methyl-deoxyadenosine (hereafter mA) in human DNA <sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>, we fused the antibody-binding Protein A to the nonspecific deoxyadenosine methyltransferase Hia5 <sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> (pA-Hia5) to catalyze the formation of mA in the DNA proximal to targeted chromatin-associated proteins (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>). First, nuclei are permeabilized, primary antibodies are bound to the protein of interest, and any unbound antibody is washed away. Next, pA-Hia5 is bound to the antibody, and any unbound pA-Hia5 is washed away. The nuclei are then incubated in a buffer containing the methyl donor S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) to activate adenine methylation in the vicinity of the protein of interest <sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>. Finally, genomic DNA is isolated and sequenced using modification-sensitive, long-read sequencing with mA basecalls providing a readout of the sites of protein-DNA interactions (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>). This approach provides a distinct advantage in the ability to detect multiple binding events by the target protein on each long, single DNA molecule, which would not be possible with short-read sequencing (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>). This protocol also avoids amplification biases, enabling improved estimation of absolute protein-DNA interaction frequencies at each site in the genome across a population of cells (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>). Modification-sensitive readout allows for the simultaneous detection of both exogenous antibody-directed adenine methylation and endogenous CpG methylation on single molecules (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref>). Additionally, DiMeLo-seq’s long sequencing reads often overlap multiple heterozygous sites, enabling phasing and measurement of haplotype-specific protein-DNA interactions (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1e</xref>). Finally, long reads enable mapping of protein-DNA interactions within highly repetitive regions of the genome (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1f</xref>).</p>

      <title><italic toggle="yes">Antibody-directed histone-specific DNA adenine methylation of reconstituted chromatin</italic> in vitro</title>
      <p id="P11">We expressed and purified recombinant pA-Hia5 and tested its methylation activity on purified DNA using the methylation-sensitive restriction enzyme DpnI, which only cuts GATC sites when adenine is methylated. DNA incubated with Hia5, pA-Hia5, or Protein A/G Hia5 (pAG-Hia5) in the presence of SAM became sensitive to DpnI digestion, confirming the methyltransferase activity of the purified fusion proteins (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Note 1</xref>, <xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 1a</xref>,<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">b</xref>). To test the ability of pA-Hia5 to target chromatin and methylate accessible DNA <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic>, we reconstituted chromatin containing the histone variant CENP-A using the nucleosome-positioning DNA sequence referred to as “601” <sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 1c</xref>,<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">d</xref>, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Note 2</xref>). Incubating mononucleosomes together with free-floating pA-Hia5 and SAM, followed by long-read sequencing and methylation-sensitive basecalling, showed methylation on 97.1 ± 0.8% of reads (mean ± s.e.m., n=3) (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Notes 3</xref>,<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">4</xref>, <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref>,<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">d</xref>, <xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 1e</xref>–<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">k</xref>). Moreover, we observed almost no methylation at the expected nucleosome-protected region (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref>,<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">d</xref>, <xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 1j</xref>).</p>
      <p id="P12">We reconstituted CENP-A chromatin on biotinylated DNA, bound it to streptavidin-coated magnetic beads, incubated it with CENP-A antibody and pA-Hia5, and washed away any unbound antibody and pA-Hia5 prior to activating methylation with SAM (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>, <xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 1c</xref>). We observed methylation on 65.0 ± 10.0% of CENP-A DiMeLo-seq reads (mean ± s.e.m., n=3) (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>–<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">d</xref>, <xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 1e</xref>–<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">h</xref>,<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">k</xref>), with methylation levels decaying with distance from the nucleosome footprint (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref>). We observed only background levels of methylation on IgG control DiMeLo-seq reads (5.1 ± 0.6% of IgG reads, (mean ± s.e.m., n=2), compared to 4.1 ± 0.5 % of untreated reads, (mean ± s.e.m., n=3)) (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d</xref>, <xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 1e</xref>,<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">k</xref>). While reads from either free-floating pA-Hia5 or antibody-tethered pA-Hia5 conditions showed nucleosome-sized protection from methylation (~150 – 180 bp centered at the dyad, <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref>,<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">d</xref>, <xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 1j</xref>), ~70% of all methylation on reads from antibody-tethered pA-Hia5 fell within 250 bp on either side of the dyad. This result demonstrates that antibody- tethered pA-Hia5 can methylate accessible DNA close to target nucleosomes <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic>.</p>
      <p id="P13">To test the specificity of DiMeLo-seq to identify target nucleosomes on chromatin fibers, we first assessed the ability of pA-Hia5 to methylate accessible regions of DNA on <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> reconstituted chromatin assembled on an 18x array of the 601 nucleosome positioning sequence (<xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 2a</xref>–<xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">c</xref>). Co-incubation of chromatin together with free-floating pA-Hia5 and SAM resulted in structured patterns of oligonucleosome footprinting (<xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 2b</xref>,<xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">g</xref>,<xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">h</xref>), as reported previously for reconstituted chromatin incubated with another exogenous methyltransferase, EcoGII <sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>.</p>
      <p id="P14">We then tested antibody-directed methylation of chromatin arrays reconstituted with either CENP-A or histone H3 containing nucleosomes. We incubated chromatin with CENP-A antibody and pA-Hia5, washed away unbound antibody, and activated methylation with SAM (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2e</xref>). Following activation, we immunostained chromatin-conjugated beads with an anti-mA antibody, demonstrating a significant increase in mA signal when CENP-A chromatin, but not H3 chromatin, was incubated with pA-Hia5 and CENP-A antibody (<xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 2d</xref>,<xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">e</xref>, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Note 5</xref>), indicating antibody-directed methylation. Long-read sequencing detected mA on DNA after CENP-A-directed methylation of CENP-A chromatin (but not H3 chromatin) (<xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 2f</xref>). On average, CENP-A-directed methylation of CENP-A chromatin was depleted at the central axis of the nucleosome where the 601 sequence positions the nucleosome dyad (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2f</xref>,<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">g</xref>). On individual reads, we observed protection from methylation centered at 601 dyad positions, consistent with nucleosome occupancy protecting the DNA from antibody-directed methylation (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2f</xref>,<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">g</xref>) and similar to the free pA-Hia5 condition (<xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 2g</xref>,<xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">h</xref>). In contrast to the free pA-Hia5 condition, for which we observed a high prevalence of methylation on any region not protected by nucleosomes, in the antibody-directed pA-Hia5 condition, we observed ~4-fold lower average probability of methylation (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2f</xref> (inset), <xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 2g</xref> (inset)), consistent with the expectation that tethering of pA-Hia5 produces preferential methylation of deoxyadenosines closest to the antibody-bound nucleosome. Despite this reduction in total methylation of accessible DNA in CENP-A DiMeLo-seq reads compared to free pA-Hia5 treated reads, we detect a similar distribution of nucleosome densities in our chromatin array population (<xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 2i</xref>). We observed similar results for H3-antibody-directed methylation of H3 chromatin using pAG-Hia5 (<xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 2j</xref>–<xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">l</xref>).

      <p id="P15">We next optimized DiMeLo-seq for mapping protein-DNA interactions <italic toggle="yes">in situ</italic> in permeabilized nuclei from a human cell line (HEK293T). To do this, we mapped the interaction sites of lamin B1 (LMNB1), which is often targeted in DamID studies to profile lamina associated domains (LADs) <sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>. Large regions of the genome that are almost always in contact with the nuclear lamina across cell types are called constitutive lamina associated domains (cLADs). Regions that are rarely in contact with the nuclear lamina across cell types and instead reside in the nuclear interior are called constitutive inter-LADs (ciLADs) (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>). Other regions can vary in their lamina contact frequency between cell types and/or between cells of the same type. We chose LMNB1 as an initial target because (i) cLADs and ciLADs provide well-characterized on-target and off-target control regions, respectively; (ii) LMNB1 has a very large binding footprint (LADs have a median size of 500 kb and cover roughly 30% of the genome <sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>), so DNA-LMNB1 interactions can be detected even with very low sequencing coverage; (iii) LMNB1 localization at the nuclear lamina can be easily visualized by immunofluorescence, allowing for intermediate quality control using microscopy during each step of the protocol (<xref rid="F9" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 3c</xref>,<xref rid="F9" ref-type="fig">d</xref>); and (iv) we have previously generated LMNB1 DamID data from HEK293T cells using bulk and single-cell protocols, providing ample reference materials <sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>.</p>
      <p id="P16">To assess the performance of the LMNB1-targeted DiMeLo-seq protocol, we quantified the proportion of adenines that were called as methylated across all reads mapping to cLADs (on-target regions), and across all reads mapping to ciLADs (off-target regions). We evaluated the performance of each iteration of the protocol using both the on-target methylation rate (as a proxy for sensitivity) and the on-target:off-target ratio (as a proxy for signal-to-background), aiming to increase both. We developed a rapid pipeline for testing variations of many components of the protocol, allowing us to go from harvested cells to fully analyzed data in under 60 hours (Methods and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Notes 6</xref>–<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">8</xref>). With this optimization pipeline, we tested over 100 different conditions (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>), varying the following: methyltransferase type (Hia5 vs. EcoGII), input cell numbers, detergents, primary antibody concentrations, the use of secondary antibodies, enzyme concentrations, incubation temperatures, methylation incubation times, methylation buffers, and SAM concentrations (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Note 8</xref>, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). We validated an initial version of the protocol (v1(<ext-link xlink:href="10.17504/protocols.io.bv8tn9wn" ext-link-type="doi">https://dx.doi.org/10.17504/protocols.io.bv8tn9wn</ext-link>), and then further optimized the methyltransferase activation conditions to increase the amount of on-target methylation 50–60% without sacrificing specificity (v2 (<ext-link xlink:href="10.17504/protocols.io.b2u8qezw" ext-link-type="doi">https://dx.doi.org/10.17504/protocols.io.b2u8qezw</ext-link>); see <xref rid="F9" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 3</xref>–<xref rid="F10" ref-type="fig">4</xref>, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Note 8</xref>, and <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>). To confirm that this optimization would apply to other types of proteins, we also examined the results of different protocol variations targeting the protein CTCF and found them to be concordant (<xref rid="F11" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 5a</xref>).</p>
      <p id="P17">We also verified that there is very little loss of performance when using cells that were cryopreserved in DMSO-containing media or lightly fixed in paraformaldehyde, when using between 1–5 million cells per replicate, or when using concanavalin-A coated magnetic beads to carry out cell washing steps by magnetic separation instead of centrifugation (Methods, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Notes 9</xref>–<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">10</xref>, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). To confirm antibody specificity, we performed IgG isotype controls and free-floating Hia5 controls to measure nonspecific methylation and DNA accessibility, respectively (Methods, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). We also generated a stably transduced line expressing a direct fusion between EcoGII and LMNB1 <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic>, as in MadID <sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>, then we detected mAs with nanopore sequencing (<xref rid="F10" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 4a</xref> and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Note 10</xref>). This <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> approach produced threefold more on-target methylation compared to <italic toggle="yes">in situ</italic> DiMeLo-seq with pAG-EcoGII (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>), though this performance is expected to vary with different fusion proteins and their expression levels (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Note 10</xref>).</p>
      <p id="P18">We found that DiMeLo-seq and conventional bulk DamID are highly concordant in the non-repetitive parts of the genome (Spearman correlation = 0.71 in 1 Mb bins), but conventional DamID achieves little-to-no coverage across pericentromeric regions (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c</xref>). This is due in part to the low availability of unique sequence markers to map short reads to in the pericentromere, but also to the low frequency of GATC (the binding motif for Dam and DpnI in the DamID protocol) within centromeric repeats (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c</xref>) <sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>. DiMeLo-seq, unlike DamID, produces long reads that can be uniquely mapped across the centromeric region of chromosome 7, revealing that this region has an intermediate level of contact with the nuclear lamina (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c</xref>,<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">d</xref>).</p>
      <p id="P19">Because DiMeLo-seq directly probes unamplified genomic DNA, each sequencing read represents a single, native DNA molecule from a single cell, sampled independently and with near-uniform probability from the population of cells. This allows for estimation of absolute protein-DNA interaction frequencies, i.e. the proportion of cells in which a site is bound by the target protein, without needing to account for the amplification bias inherent to other protein-DNA mapping methods. We leveraged single-cell Dam-LMNB1 DamID data from the same cell line <sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> to assess the relationship between DiMeLo-seq methylation and an orthogonal estimate of protein-DNA interaction frequencies. This revealed a nearly linear relationship between the two interaction frequency estimates, with a simple linear model achieving an R<sup>2</sup> of 0.71, compared to an R<sup>2</sup> of 0.31 when scDamID-based interaction frequencies are compared to bulk conventional DamID coverage (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3e</xref>, <xref rid="F10" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 4f</xref>). We note that scDamID tends to slightly overestimate intermediate interaction frequencies compared to DiMeLo-seq, attributable to the <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> vs. <italic toggle="yes">in situ</italic> nature of the two protocols <sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>, as well as to the fact that homolog-specific information is collapsed within each hypotriploid HEK293T cell <sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>. This analysis demonstrates that DiMeLo-seq is capable of estimating absolute protein-DNA interaction frequencies without needing to account for amplification bias, while capturing heterogeneity in protein-DNA interactions at the single-cell level.</p>

      <title>Joint analysis of CTCF binding and CpG methylation on single molecules</title>
      <p id="P20">DiMeLo-seq measures protein-DNA interactions in the context of the local chromatin environment by simultaneously detecting endogenous CpG methylation, nucleosome occupancy, and protein binding. To highlight this feature of DiMeLo-seq, we targeted CTCF, a protein that strongly positions surrounding nucleosomes and whose binding is inhibited by CpG methylation <sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>. We first validated that targeted methylation is specific to CTCF in GM12878 cells by calculating the fraction of adenines that are methylated within GM12878 CTCF ChIP-seq peaks relative to the fraction of adenines methylated outside of these peaks. We chose to target CTCF in GM12878 cells because GM12878 is an ENCODE Tier 1 cell line with abundant ChIP-seq reference datasets. We measured a 16-fold increase in targeted methylation over background in our CTCF-targeted sample (<xref rid="F11" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 5b</xref>). We also measured a 6-fold mA/A enrichment in the free pA-Hia5 control in CTCF ChIP-seq peaks, which reflects the fact that many CTCF binding sites overlap with accessible regions of the genome where pA-Hia5 can methylate more easily <sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup>. However, both the free pA-Hia5 and the IgG controls produced significantly less targeted methylation than the CTCF-targeted sample (<xref rid="F11" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 5b</xref>). We confirmed that signal enrichment is caused by CTCF-targeted methylation and not accessibility of CTCF sites by measuring a 1.8X greater proportion of mA in ChIP-seq peaks compared to regions of open chromatin measured by ATAC-seq (<xref rid="F11" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 5c</xref>).</p>
      <p id="P21">As further validation of DiMeLo-seq’s concordance with ChIP-seq data and to visualize protein binding on single molecules, we analyzed mA and mCpG across individual molecules spanning CTCF motifs within ChIP-seq peaks of various strengths (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref>). DiMeLo-seq signal tracks with ChIP-seq signal strength, with mA density decreasing from the top to bottom quartiles of ChIP-seq peak signal. We observed an increase in local mA surrounding the binding motif, with a periodic decay in methylation from the peak center, indicating methylation of neighboring linker DNA between strongly positioned nucleosomes (<xref rid="F11" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 5d</xref>). The 88 bp dip at the center of the binding peak reflects CTCF’s binding footprint <sup><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>–<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> and is evident even on single molecules. CTCF binds to ~50 bp of DNA as determined by DNase I footprinting and ChIP-exo <sup><xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>–<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup>. The larger footprint observed with DiMeLo-seq is likely due to steric hindrance with Hia5 unable to methylate DNA within ~20 bp of the physical contact between CTCF and DNA as efficiently. We also observed an asymmetric methylation profile, with stronger methylation 5’ of the CTCF motif. This increased methylation relative to 3’ of the motif extends beyond the central peak to the neighboring linker DNA. We hypothesized that this asymmetry was a result of the antibody binding the C-terminus of CTCF, thereby positioning pA-Hia5 closer to the 5’ end of the binding motif. To test this hypothesis, we compared DiMeLo-seq binding profiles in top quartile ChIP-seq peaks when using an antibody targeting the C-terminus of CTCF, as is used in <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>, and an antibody targeting the N-terminus of CTCF. We observed methylation enrichment 5’ to the binding motif with C-terminus targeting and 3’ to the motif with N-terminus targeting (p-value: 0.00010, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Note 11</xref>, <xref rid="F11" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 5e</xref>). The free pA-Hia5 control profile supports this finding that the antibody binding site is causing the peak asymmetry, as there is no significant asymmetry in this untargeted case (<xref rid="F12" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 6</xref>).</p>
      <p id="P22">To evaluate the use of DiMeLo-seq for de novo peak detection, we called CTCF peaks using DiMeLo-seq data alone and created ROC curves at increasing sequencing depth using ChIP-seq peaks as ground truth (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Note 11</xref>, <xref rid="F11" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 5f</xref>). At ~25X coverage, we detected 60% of ChIP-seq peaks (FPR 1.6%) and measured an AUC of 0.92 (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Note 11</xref>). Among the peaks detected with DiMeLo-seq that were not annotated ChIP-seq peaks, ten percent overlapped 1 kb marker deserts and gaps in the hg38 reference and are undetectable by ChIP-seq. Another 12% of these peaks fell within 500 bp of a known CTCF motif.</p>
      <p id="P23">We next probed the relationship between CTCF binding and endogenous CpG methylation. Single molecules spanning CTCF binding sites in stronger ChIP-seq peaks exhibited a larger dip in mCpG around the motif compared to the shallower dip in weaker ChIP-seq peaks (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref>). This inverse relationship between CpG methylation and CTCF-targeted methylation reflects previous findings that mCpG inhibits CTCF binding <sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>. We measured both mA and mCpG on the same single molecules and also observed that both A and CpG are preferentially methylated in linker DNA (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b</xref>). The increased methylation of CpG in linker DNA relative to nucleosome-bound DNA surrounding CTCF sites is supported by previous studies that have similarly reported higher levels of mCpG in linker DNA than nucleosomal DNA around CTCF sites <sup><xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup>.</p>
      <p id="P24">CTCF’s known binding motif and abundance genome-wide make it a good target for characterizing the resolution of DiMeLo-seq. To characterize resolution, we estimated the peak center on single molecules spanning the top decile of CTCF ChIP-seq peaks (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Note 11</xref>). The mean single-molecule peak center was 6 bp 5’ of the CTCF motif center, and the peak center on approximately 70% of the reads fell within +/− 200 bp of the motif center (<xref rid="F11" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 5g</xref>). This systematic bias towards predicting the peak center 5’ of the motif can be explained by the observed asymmetry in methylation when targeting the C-terminus of CTCF. Another factor that impacts the resolution of DiMeLo-seq is the reach of the methyltransferase, which can be characterized by measuring the decay rate of methylation density from the peak center. To do this, we fit the average adenine methylation density with respect to the motif center to an exponential function and calculated a half-life of 169 bp (<xref rid="F11" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 5d</xref>). Together, this analysis suggests that DiMeLo-seq can resolve binding events to within about 200 bp; however, this metric is likely dependent on the protein target and influenced by the local chromatin environment.</p>
      <p id="P25">To characterize the sensitivity of DiMeLo-seq for detecting CTCF binding events on single molecules, we performed a binary classification of individual CTCF-targeted DiMeLo-seq reads based on each read’s proportion of methylated adenines within CTCF peak regions, defined as +/− 150 bp around the CTCF binding motif center. For top-decile ChIP-seq peaks, which are regions that are most likely to contain CTCF binding, we classified reads containing CTCF binding events with 54% sensitivity (5.7% FPR, <xref rid="F11" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 5h</xref>,<xref rid="F11" ref-type="fig">i</xref>, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Note 11</xref>).</p>
      <p id="P26">We next investigated the ability of DiMeLo-seq to measure protein binding at adjacent sites on single molecules. We first characterized CTCF occupancy across two binding sites that were spanned by a single molecule. We were able to detect neighboring CTCF motifs that are bound by CTCF at both sites or just one of the two sites, and the detected binding appears to track with ChIP-seq peak strength (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4c</xref>). This analysis demonstrates the potential of DiMeLo-seq to analyze coordinated binding patterns on long single molecules, which is not possible with short-read methods. We further investigated this potential within a specific HLA locus on chr6 where haplotype-specific SNPs within the CTCF binding motif prevent CTCF binding at one of the two neighboring sites (<xref rid="F13" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 7a</xref>). DiMeLo-seq can map haplotype-specific interactions because long reads often span multiple heterozygous sites, allowing reads to be phased. Importantly, at 25X coverage, we were able to detect the binding patterns of both sites on the same single molecule and could attribute the lack of detected binding at one of the two sites to a mutation within the binding motif. The ability to map haplotype-specific interactions is also useful in studying imprinted genomic regions such as the IGF2/H19 Imprinting Control Region, where CpG methylation on the paternal allele prevents CTCF binding, while on the maternal allele, CTCF is able to bind (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4d</xref>). We also reported haplotype-specific CTCF binding profiles at specific sites and broadly across the active and inactive X chromosomes (<xref rid="F13" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 7b</xref>–<xref rid="F13" ref-type="fig">d</xref>). These results demonstrate that DiMeLo-seq can measure the effect of haplotype-specific genetic or epigenetic variation on protein binding.</p>
      <p id="P27">To test the compatibility of DiMeLo-seq with other long-read sequencing platforms capable of modification calling, we performed Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) sequencing of DNA from a CTCF-targeted DiMeLo-seq sample and from an unmethylated control (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Note 12</xref>). We found similar enrichment profiles using both methods (<xref rid="F14" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 8</xref>), indicating that DiMeLo-seq is compatible with PacBio’s circular consensus sequencing technique. However, while PacBio sequencing has reported improved base calling accuracy <sup><xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup>, this approach detected more methylation in the unmethylated control than Nanopore, slightly reducing the signal-to-noise ratio of the measurement (<xref rid="F14" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 8</xref>).</p>

        <p id="P28">To test DiMeLo-seq’s ability to measure protein occupancy in heterochromatic, repetitive regions of the genome we targeted H3K9me3, which is abundant in pericentric heterochromatin. We chose to target H3K9me3 in HG002 cells because the chromosome X centromere has been completely assembled for this male-derived lymphoblast line <sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>, and many different sequencing data types are available for it <sup><xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup>. To validate the specificity of targeted methylation, we calculated the fraction of adenines methylated within HG002 CUT&amp;RUN H3K9me3 peaks <sup><xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup> compared to the fraction of adenines methylated outside of broadly defined peaks (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Note 13</xref>). For H3K9me3 targeting in HG002 cells, the enrichment of mA/A in CUT&amp;RUN peaks was 3.6-fold over background (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a</xref>), indicating enrichment of methylation within expected H3K9me3-containing regions of the genome.</p>
        <p id="P29">Human centromeres are located within highly repetitive alpha-satellite sequences, which are organized into higher order repeats (HORs) <sup><xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>–<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup>. To validate enrichment of H3K9me3-directed mA signal in centromeres, and in particular in HOR arrays, we similarly calculated the fold increase in mA/A and found 1.9-fold enrichment in centromeres and 3.0-fold enrichment in active (kinetochore-binding) HOR arrays <sup><xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup> over non-centromeric regions (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5b</xref>). We next looked at HOR array boundaries and observed a decrease in H3K9me3 across the boundary moving from within to outside of HOR arrays (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5c</xref>). In contrast, for the free pA-Hia5 control, mA/A increases moving from within to outside of the HOR array, as chromatin becomes more accessible (<xref rid="F15" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 9a</xref>) <sup><xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup>.</p>
        <p id="P30">We mapped heterochromatin not only in aggregate across HOR array boundaries, but also in single molecules across the centromere. H3K9me3-targeted DiMeLo-seq reads map across the centromere of chromosome 7, even in regions with over 20 kb between unique markers (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5d</xref>). An IgG isotype control confirmed that adenine methylation in the H3K9me3-targeted sample was not caused by background methylation (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5d</xref>, <xref rid="F15" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 9b</xref>). Unlike methods which rely on amplifying short DNA fragments, such as ChIP-seq and CUT&amp;RUN, we are able to detect single-molecule heterogeneity in chromatin boundaries, as highlighted in the transition from 65.5 Mb to 68 Mbp, where H3K9me3 signal drops as CpG methylation increases (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5d</xref>). However, lower methylation efficiency in heterochromatin and the challenges of mapping even moderately long reads in repetitive regions can still lead to uneven and low coverage in these regions (<xref rid="F15" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 9c</xref>). To improve sensitivity for targeted DiMeLo-seq applications in the centromere, we developed a centromere enrichment method to enhance coverage in active HOR arrays and applied this method to study CENP-A.</p>

        <title>Restriction-based enrichment strategy improves centromere coverage</title>
        <p id="P31">Within alpha satellite HOR arrays, the centromere-specific histone variant CENP-A delineates the site where the functional centromere and kinetochore will form. Population-level studies demonstrate that CENP-A nucleosomes are found at the core of these repeat units where the repeats are the most homogeneous <sup><xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>–<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup>. However, it has not been possible to resolve the positions of CENP-A nucleosomes on single chromatin fibers to determine the one-dimensional organization and density of CENP-A at centromeres. To map the positions of CENP-A nucleosomes at centromeres using DiMeLo-seq, we developed a strategy to enrich specifically for human centromeric DNA in order to avoid sequencing the entire genome.</p>
        <p id="P32">Our enrichment strategy, called AlphaHOR-RES (alpha higher-order repeat restriction and enrichment by size; from <italic toggle="yes">alfajores</italic>), is based on classic centromere enrichment strategies <sup><xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></sup> that involve digesting the genome with restriction enzymes that cut frequently outside centromeric regions but rarely inside them, then removing short DNA fragments (Methods, <xref rid="F16" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 10a</xref>). We added AlphaHOR-RES to our DiMeLo-seq workflow and observed at least 20-fold enrichment of sequencing coverage at centromeres while preserving relatively long read lengths (mean ~8 kb; <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6a</xref>,<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">b</xref>, <xref rid="F16" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 10b</xref>–<xref rid="F16" ref-type="fig">d</xref>, Methods). Thus, this enrichment strategy significantly increases the proportion of molecules sequenced that are useful for investigating CENP-A distribution, saving substantial sequencing time and costs. Furthermore, because AlphaHOR-RES targets the DNA and not the protein in the protein-DNA interaction, and because it is performed after directed methylation is complete, it is unlikely to bias our inferences of protein-DNA interaction frequencies in these regions.</p>

CENP-A-directed mA was found to be higher within both large and small CDRs compared to their adjacent CpG methylated regions, consistent with short-read data for this cell line (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6e</xref>,<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">f</xref>) <sup><xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup>. We found that the density of detected CENP-A nucleosomes increased 5-fold within ChrX CDRs compared to neighboring regions (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6g</xref>). We estimate that 26 ± 5 % of nucleosomes contain CENP-A within the ChrX CDR, whereas only 5 ± 2 % of nucleosomes contain CENP-A within a neighboring region (mean ± standard deviation) (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Note 14</xref>, <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6g</xref>) confirming what ensemble short-read methods cannot: the <italic toggle="yes">density</italic> of CENP-A nucleosomes on single DNA molecules increases in CDRs. IgG isotype controls confirm that this signal is not due to background methylation (2 ± 1 % (mean ± standard deviation) of nucleosomes detected on IgG control reads within ChrX CDR (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6g</xref>, <xref rid="F16" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 10e</xref>)). A previous study estimated the average CENP-A density across endogenous human centromeres to be 1 in 25 nucleosomes, assuming a mean centromere size of ~1 Mb <sup><xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref></sup>. In contrast, we estimate that at least 1 in 4 nucleosomes contains CENP-A within the smaller ~100 kb CDR on ChrX. This demonstrates that CENP-A nucleosome occupancy varies considerably across a human centromere, and further we show that the region with the highest CENP-A density coincides with the CDR. We observe a similar distribution of CENP-A-directed methylation on chromosome 3, where only one of the two HOR arrays was observed to have clear CENP-A-directed methylation (<xref rid="F16" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 10 f</xref>,<xref rid="F16" ref-type="fig">g</xref>). These observations support the finding of one active HOR array per chromosome <sup><xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref></sup>. These findings illuminate the density and positioning of CENP-A nucleosomes within HOR sequences on individual chromatin fibers, which was not previously attainable with existing techniques.</p>

    <title>Discussion</title>
    <p id="P35">Here, we have developed, optimized, and validated DiMeLo-seq, a long-read method for mapping protein-DNA interactions genome-wide. DiMeLo-seq can map a protein’s binding sites within hundreds of base pairs at multiple loci on single molecules of sequenced DNA up to hundreds of kilobases in length. This long read length improves mappability in highly repetitive regions of the genome, opening them up for future studies of their regulation and function. Because DiMeLo-seq involves no amplification, it can be used to better estimate the absolute protein-DNA interaction frequency at each site in the genome. It also provides joint information about endogenous CpG methylation and protein-DNA interactions on the same long single molecules, which can be phased to reveal haplotype-specific binding and methylation patterns.</p>
    <p id="P36">By mapping individual CENP-A nucleosomes on long, sequenced DNA molecules, we found that CENP-A nucleosome density increases on single chromatin fibers in mCpG depleted regions within centromeres. The sensitivity of CENP-A DiMeLo-seq on CENP-A chromatin <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> was measured to be ~65%, suggesting that the estimates of CENP-A nucleosome densities within the ChrX CDR are lower limits, and the actual CENP-A density within CDRs could be even higher than ~25% (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6g</xref>). A source of variation in CENP-A positions is the cell cycle state of chromatin. Because pre-existing CENP-A nucleosomes are thought to epigenetically direct the assembly of new CENP-A nucleosomes in each cell cycle, it will be interesting to understand how CENP-A density varies along the sequence of the active centromere after cell cycle synchronization. We estimated the single-molecule sensitivity of DiMeLo-seq to be between 54–59% for CTCF and LMNB1, at thresholds that achieve 94% specificity compared to off-target regions. However, sensitivity may vary by target protein and antibody, perhaps owing to differences in local steric effects, or to differences in the binding strength of the target protein, antibody, or pA.</p>
    <p id="P37">This study also allowed us to characterize the benefits and tradeoffs of using DiMeLo-seq compared to short-read ensemble methods. Because DiMeLo-seq is an amplification-free method that sequences single native DNA molecules, and because it relies on centrifugation for washing steps, it requires a relatively large amount of starting material to produce cell pellets big enough to easily handle (1–2 million cells per replicate). Using concanavalin-A coated magnetic beads, which we demonstrated to be compatible with the DiMeLo-seq protocol, may help to reduce these cell input requirements in the future (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Note 9</xref>). Additionally, the standard DiMeLo-seq protocol requires the entire genome to be sequenced uniformly, potentially wasting sequencing reads in regions of the genome that are irrelevant for the target protein’s binding domain. For proteins that only target small regions, it is possible to perform targeted DNA sequencing <sup><xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref></sup> or to use DNA enrichment methods like AlphaHOR-RES, the centromere enrichment method we demonstrated here. Another group recently described a complementary approach using a distinct set of restriction enzymes to enrich for centromeric DNA, which may serve as an important alternative to Alpha-HOR-RES <sup><xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref></sup>. It is also possible to use immunoprecipitation to enrich for methylated DNA or DNA bound to a protein of interest, but this would no longer sample DNA molecules uniformly from the cell population, potentially diminishing the ability to infer protein-DNA interaction frequencies from read methylation frequencies.</p>
    <p id="P38">Because Hia5 tends to methylate unbound linker DNA, DiMeLo-seq provides information about local nucleosome occupancy along with the target protein’s footprint. This also means that highly inaccessible regions can be more difficult to methylate, and they may require higher sequencing coverage. Additionally, because DiMeLo-seq is performed <italic toggle="yes">in situ</italic> in conditions meant to preserve chromatin conformation, it may methylate unbound DNA in <italic toggle="yes">trans</italic> if it is close enough to the target protein’s binding sites in 3D space, as does CUT&amp;RUN <sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>. These 3D interactions, and the factors that mediate them, can potentially be investigated by perturbing 3D chromatin structure prior to performing DiMeLo-seq, which may also be a useful approach for improving DNA accessibility in highly condensed regions.</p>
    <p id="P39">We anticipate that DiMeLo-seq will be useful for investigating a wide range of biological questions. For example, because it can allow one to explore the density of a protein’s binding along a single chromatin fiber from a single cell, it can be used to investigate how the exact boundaries between chromatin states vary among single cells, or perhaps how the stoichiometry of a DNA-binding protein in enhancers affects the transcription of nearby genes. We also demonstrated that DiMeLo-seq can read out methyladenines deposited by <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> expression of protein-MTase fusions, as in conventional DamID <sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> or MadID <sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>, instead of antibody targeting <italic toggle="yes">in situ</italic>. This may prove useful for investigating more transient protein-DNA interactions, or proteins that lack suitable antibodies, in cases where the biological system being studied can be readily genetically modified. One can also imagine adding exogenous cytosine methylation marks to provide joint information about DNA accessibility or about a second protein’s binding profile. Although we primarily used Oxford Nanopore Technologies sequencing in this study, we also demonstrated that DiMeLo-seq is compatible with Pacific Biosciences HiFi sequencing, which may be preferred for applications that require highly accurate base calls, such as genome assembly. With this study, we show that DiMeLo-seq provides a versatile approach for characterizing protein-DNA interactions on individual molecules spanning difficult-to-interrogate genomic regions.</p>

      <title>DiMeLo-seq</title>
      <p id="P50">All reagents were prepared fresh, syringe filtered through a 0.2 μm filter, and kept on ice. Cells (1M-5M per condition) were pelleted at 300 × g for 5 minutes and washed with PBS. While live cells were used for experiments targeting CTCF, H3K9me3, CENP-A, and the accompanying controls, both frozen and fixed cells are also compatible with the DiMeLo-seq protocol. Frozen cells stored in freezing medium with DMSO in liquid nitrogen should be thawed on ice and prepared with the same protocol as fresh cells. For optional light fixation, cells can be fixed with 0.1% PFA for 2 minutes with gentle vortexing, followed by the addition of 1.25 M glycine to twice the molar concentration of PFA, a 3 minute spin at 500 × g at 4°C, and then continuation with standard DiMeLo-seq protocol’s nuclear isolation. Pelleted cells were resuspended in 1 ml of Dig-Wash buffer (0.02% digitonin, 20 mM HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM Spermidine, 1 Roche Complete tablet -EDTA (11873580001) per 50 ml buffer, 0.1% BSA) and incubated on ice for 5 minutes. Note: use of detergents other than digitonin and Tween may reduce methylation efficiency (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Note 8</xref>). The nuclei suspension was then split into separate tubes for each condition and spun down at 4°C at 500 × g for 3 minutes. All subsequent spins were performed with these same conditions, and all steps involving pipetting nuclei were performed with wide bore tips. The supernatant was removed and the pellet was gently resolved in 200 μl Tween-Wash (0.1% Tween-20, 20 mM HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM Spermidine, 1 Roche Complete tablet -EDTA per 50 ml buffer, 0.1% BSA) containing the primary antibody at a 1:50 dilution. Note: ensure primary antibody species is compatible with protein A. Antibodies targeted the following: LMNB1 (ab16048), CTCF (targeting C-terminus, ab188408), CTCF (targeting N-terminus, Active Motif 61312), H3K9me3 (Active Motif 39162), CENP-A (targeting Cenp-A N-terminus (amino acids 1–42), Aaron Straight, Stanford University, <sup><xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>,<xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref></sup>), and rabbit IgG isotype control (ab171870). Samples were placed on a rotator at 4°C for 2 hours. Nuclei were then pelleted and washed twice with 0.95 ml Tween-Wash. For each wash, the pellet was completely resolved by pipetting up and down ~10 times and placed on a rotator at 4°C for 5 minutes before spinning down. Following the second wash, the nuclei pellet was gently resolved in 200 μl Tween-Wash containing 200 nM pA-Hia5. pA-Hia5 concentration was measured using the Qubit Protein Assay Kit (Q33211). For pA-Hia5 binding, the nuclei were placed on the rotator at room temperature for 1 hour. Nuclei were then spun down and washed twice with 0.95 ml Tween-Wash with a 4°C rotating incubation for 5 minutes between spins, as in the wash following antibody binding. For the free pA-Hia5 control, nuclei were kept on the rotator at 4°C during antibody binding and pA-Hia5 binding steps, and pA-Hia5 was added at the time of activation. Nuclei were then resuspended in 100 μl of Activation Buffer (15 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 15 mM NaCl, 60 mM KCl, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0, 0.5 mM EGTA, pH 8.0, 0.5 mM Spermidine, 0.1% BSA, 800 μM SAM) and incubated at 37°C for 30 minutes before spinning and resuspending in 100 μl of cold PBS. To increase methylation efficiency, the following protocol changes were made and used when targeting LMNB1 and CTCF for experiments indicated in <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 1</xref> and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 3</xref>: (1) changed pA-Hia5 binding to 2 hours at 4°C, (2) increased activation time to 2 hours, (3) replenished SAM halfway through activation by adding an additional 800 μM final concentration, (4) reduced Spermidine in the activation buffer from 0.5 mM to 0.05 mM. We refer to the protocol with these changes as protocol v2. DiMeLo-seq protocol v2 requires ordinary lab equipment to prepare sequencing libraries (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>).

For detection of pA/G-MTase binding, two different fluorophore-conjugated antibodies were used: a goat anti-mouse IgG antibody conjugated to AlexaFluor647 (Invitrogen A32728), which is not expected to bind to the rabbit primary or goat secondary antibodies but is expected to be bound by pA/G, and a goat anti-V5 antibody conjugated to FITC (Abcam 1274), which is expected to bind to the C-terminal V5 tag on pA/G-MTase. It is also possible to use a chicken anti-HisTag FITC-conjugated antibody (Abcam 3554) to avoid any binding by pA or pG. All antibodies were diluted 1:1000 for immunofluorescence imaging.</p>

End repair incubation time was increased to 10 minutes. 1 μg of end repaired DNA was loaded into barcode ligation. All ligation incubation times were increased to at least 20 minutes. Elution following barcode ligation reaction cleanup was decreased to 18 μl to allow for loading 3 μg of pooled barcoded material into the final ligation.

The cleanup following end preparation was performed by combining 60 μl SRE buffer (Circulomics SS-100-101-01) with the 60 μl end prep reaction, centrifuging at 10,000 × g at room temperature for 30 minutes, or until the DNA had pelleted, and washing with 150 μl 70% ethanol two times with a 2 minute spin at 10,000 × g between washes. The pellet was resuspended in 31 μl EB, and incubated at 50°C for 1 hour and then 4°C for at least 48 hours. Ligation volume was reduced by half for a total of 30 μl DNA in a 50 μl reaction volume. The ligation incubation was increased to 1 hour. The DNA was pelleted at 10,000 × g at room temperature for 30 minutes.

A GeneRuler High Range DNA Ladder (Thermo Fisher SM1351) was loaded in an adjacent lane. To avoid overloading, DNA was loaded with no more than 250 ng per mm of lane width (~30 μg per sample). The gel was run at 2 V/cm for 1 hour and imaged over a blue light transilluminator. The gel was cut to remove fragments smaller than 20 kb, while keeping everything larger, up to the well itself. DNA was purified from the resulting gel slice using a Zymoclean Large Fragment DNA Recovery Kit (Zymo # D4045), with modifications: the gel slice was melted at room temperature on a rotator at 12 rpm, and DNA was eluted from the column twice with the elution buffer heated to 70 °C. The DNA was then quantified by Qubit again. DNA was prepared for sequencing using an ONT LSK-109 native library prep kit, and sequenced on a v9.4 MinION flow cell. CENP-A-targeted DiMeLo-seq was performed on unfixed HG002 cells processed in parallel with IgG-targeted, free-floating pA-Hia5, and untreated samples. For each treatment ~25 million cells were processed in 5 tubes of ~5 million cells each. DiMeLo-seq was initially performed as described above. AlphaHOR-RES was performed on these samples and 250 ng to 1 ug of recovered DNA from each sample was then processed for Nanopore sequencing using method (1), described above.</p>

        <p id="P69">Phased reads across one region on chr6 and two regions on chrX illustrate haplotype-specific CTCF binding due to genetic and epigenetic differences between haplotypes. <bold>a,</bold> A region on chr6 within the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) locus which contains two CTCF binding sites and many heterozygous SNPs useful for phasing reads. Both CTCF binding sites overlap a het SNP within their binding motif. At the first CTCF site, the paternal SNP allele within the motif is associated with weak or no CTCF binding on the paternal haplotype, and the opposite is true at the second CTCF site. Thus, only one of these two neighboring sites tends to be bound on each haplotype, which is clearly visible on reads spanning both CTCF sites. Further, because CpG methylation patterns are similar between the two haplotypes, these binding differences likely owe to the genetic differences present in/near the CTCF binding motifs themselves. <bold>b-c,</bold> Because the GM12878 cell line has two X chromosomes and was clonally derived, one X homolog (the paternally inherited X homolog for this cell line) has undergone X inactivation and remains inactive in all cells. Shown here are one region with CTCF binding on the active X only (b) and one region with CTCF binding on the inactive X only (c). The haplotype-specific CTCF binding patterns in these chrX regions appear to be associated with haplotype-specific CpG methylation, as similarly seen for the imprinted H19 locus shown in <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4d</xref>. <bold>d,</bold> Aggregate enrichment profiles from DiMeLo-seq reads across all CTCF sites on chrX are shown, as in <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b</xref>.
