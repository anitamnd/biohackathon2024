      <p>Bacterial phylogenetic analyses are commonly performed to explore the evolutionary relationships among various bacterial species and genera based on their 16S rRNA gene sequences; however, these results are limited by mosaicism, intragenomic heterogeneity, and difficulties in distinguishing between related species. In this study, we aimed to perform genome-wide comparisons of different bacterial species, namely <italic toggle="yes">Escherichia coli</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Shigella</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Yersinia</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Klebsiella</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">Neisseria</italic> spp., based on their K-mer profiles to construct phylogenetic trees. Pentanucleotide frequency analyses (512 patterns of 5 nucleotides each) were performed to distinguish between highly similar species. Moreover, <italic toggle="yes">Escherichia albertii</italic> strains were clearly distinguished from <italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">Shigella</italic>, despite being closely related to enterohemorrhagic <italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic> in the phylogenetic tree. In addition, our phylogenetic tree of <italic toggle="yes">Ipomoea</italic> species based on pentamer frequency in chloroplast genomes was correlated with previously reported morphological similarities. Furthermore, a support vector machine clearly classified <italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">Shigella</italic> genomes based on their pentanucleotide profiles. These results suggest that phylogenetic analyses based on penta- or hexamer profiles are a useful methodology for microbial phylogenetic studies. In addition, we introduced an R application, Phy5, which generates a phylogenetic tree based on genome-wide comparisons of pentamer profiles. The online version of Phy5 can be accessed at <ext-link xlink:href="https://phy5.shinyapps.io/Phy5R/" ext-link-type="uri">https://phy5.shinyapps.io/Phy5R/</ext-link> and its command line version Phy5cli can be downloaded at <ext-link xlink:href="https://github.com/YoshioNakano2021/phy5" ext-link-type="uri">https://github.com/YoshioNakano2021/phy5</ext-link>.</p>

    <title>Introduction</title>
    <p>Currently, prokaryotic phylogenetic classification depends on 16S rRNA gene sequences, which are ubiquitously present and highly conserved in bacteria, but species with more than ≥ 99% identity based on 16S rDNA sequencing are rarely classified. In such cases, one or more additional conserved genes are often used as a secondary candidate for indexing during phylogenetic analyses, such as <italic toggle="yes">gyrB</italic> for <italic toggle="yes">Shigella</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Salmonella</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0268847.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]; <italic toggle="yes">trpA</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">trpB</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">pabB</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">putP</italic> for <italic toggle="yes">Shigella</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Salmonella</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0268847.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]; and <italic toggle="yes">thrA</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">trpE</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">glnA</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">tmk</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">dmsA</italic> for <italic toggle="yes">Yersinia</italic> spp. [<xref rid="pone.0268847.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Since these candidate genes are not ubiquitously present among different bacterial species, the selection of an appropriate candidate gene is challenging. Furthermore, phylogenetic classification based on a single gene sequence is not reliable because the selected gene may have undergone horizontal transfer among bacterial species, thus not accurately reflecting the background or history or evolutionary of the species.</p>
    <p>To avoid these limitations of phylogenetic analysis based on a single gene, multi-locus sequence analysis/typing (MLSA/MLST) or core genome multi-locus sequence typing (cgMLST) is applied. For <italic toggle="yes">Yersinia</italic>, a genotyping strategy based on five genes was first developed in 2005 [<xref rid="pone.0268847.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], and a seven-gene MLST scheme was established to differentiate among the three human pathogenic species (<italic toggle="yes">Y. pestis</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Y. pseudotuberculosis</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">Y. enterocolitica</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0268847.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]). However, these MLST systems were not applicable at the species level. A genus-wide seven-gene MLST [<xref rid="pone.0268847.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] and core-genome MLST [<xref rid="pone.0268847.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] were developed for phylogenetic analysis of <italic toggle="yes">Yersinia</italic> species, and demonstrated notably better resolution and phylogenetic precision than the previous MLST methods. The core-genome MLST scheme facilitates high-resolution and efficient identification of various pathogens [<xref rid="pone.0268847.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0268847.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. MLST systems with only a few genes do not reflect the evolutionary history of whole genomes. Species-specific, fixed sets of conserved genes throughout the genome can potentially be used by cgMLST.</p>
    <p>Among the aforementioned examples, the evolutionary history of <italic toggle="yes">Yersinia</italic> spp. is poorly understood. <italic toggle="yes">Yersinia</italic> is a Gram-negative bacterium which includes 19 species, 3 being prominent human pathogens: <italic toggle="yes">Y. pestis</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Y. pseudotuberculosis</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">Y. enterocolitica</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0268847.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Various virulence genes from Yersinia species have been reported, and phylogenetic analyses have been performed based on the sequence homology of specific virulence sequences selected from those genes. In this study, we aimed to develop a method to phylogenetically assess any species or subspecies, including non-virulent strains, independent of specific gene sequence homology to characterized species.</p>
    <p>The K-mer frequency in DNA fragments provides a genome-specific parameter for analyzing genome diversity [<xref rid="pone.0268847.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0268847.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Self-organizing maps (SOMs) based on K-mer nucleotide frequency analysis are used to cluster and visualize DNA fragments derived from closely related eukaryotes [<xref rid="pone.0268847.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] or prokaryotes [<xref rid="pone.0268847.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] in environmental samples. Sims et al. (2009) reported an alignment-free method, including the feature (or K-mer) frequency profiles (FFPs) of whole genomes [<xref rid="pone.0268847.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], and a phylogenetic tree of 10 mammalian species was constructed from intron genomes based on 18-mer frequency profiles. The resultant tree closely correlated with the accepted evolutionary history. Furthermore, they reported a whole-genome-based phylogenetic tree of <italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">Shigella</italic>, which was constructed using 24-mer frequency profiles [<xref rid="pone.0268847.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. All possible combinations of the 24-mer fragments produced ca 8.4 million features. In addition, various reports on alignment-free sequence comparisons have been published [<xref rid="pone.0268847.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. However this method does not seem to be widely used to date. The authors have created a web application, Phy5, as well as its command line version Phy5cli, which allow for easy phylogenetic tree analysis using this method.</p>
    <p>In this study, we constructed an web program for phylogenetic analysis based on 512 pentamer frequencies. Here, we describe its application using the phylogenetic separation of <italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Shigella</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Yersinia</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Klebsiella</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">Neisseria</italic> spp. as examples, as well as its command line version for standalone use to generate distance matrix and newick tree files.</p>
    <p>A support vector machine (SVM) is a supervised machine-learning model and is one of the most recently developed types of classifiers. It segregates classes using hyperplanes generated by mapping predictors into a new, higher-dimensional space (the feature space), wherein they can be linearly segregated. We hypothesized that SVM would help classify numerous samples of species based on K-mer frequencies from genetic sequences in a short period, and this application is verified here.</p>

    <title>Results and discussion</title>
    <p>Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences is not suitable for closely related species. A bacterial 16S rRNA gene sequence contains 9 variable regions, and the 500-nucleotide long hypervariable V1–V3 region or the 800-nucleotide long V1–V4 region are used for phylogenetic analysis. In closely related species, these variable regions do not vary sufficiently for accurate analyses. <italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Salmonella</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Shigella</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Yersinia</italic>,and <italic toggle="yes">Klebsiella</italic> from the Enterobacteriaceae family share up to 99% sequence homology of their 16S rRNA gene sequences [<xref rid="pone.0268847.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. In many cases, bacterial operational taxonomic units (OTUs) are defined as 97% homology, thus, species sharing 99% rRNA gene sequence homology cannot be differentiated from one another using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. In addition, prokaryotic species have two types of rRNA operons, and horizontal gene transfer is observed among many bacterial species [<xref rid="pone.0268847.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The genetic interoperability and promiscuity of 16S rRNA in the ribosomes of an extremely thermophilic bacterium, <italic toggle="yes">Thermus thermophilus</italic>, has been reported by Miyazaki et. al. (2019); they suggested that horizontal gene transfer promotes adaptive evolution, and proposed the “random patch model” for ribosomal evolution [<xref rid="pone.0268847.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p>
    <p><xref rid="pone.0268847.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref> shows the scheme of the alignment-free method for the phylogenetic analysis of closely related species that are resistant to multicopy, horizontal transfer, or chimera-formation of the 16S rRNA genes. This method does not require species-specific gene sets, such as MLSA/MLST, and will allow rapid and simple phylogenetic analysis of any species. For example, in the context of attempting interspecies crossing of morning glory without being familiar with the genus, <italic toggle="yes">Ipomoea</italic>, the proposed method can provide rapid and useful information about the phylogenetic relations between a collection of species within the genus to study its genetic characteristics via MLSA/MLST. Whole-genome comparison is required if specific genes are not selected for phylogenetic analysis, and such a comparison would limit inconsistencies due to gene transfer, multicopy, or chimera-formation of the 16S rRNA genes. As mentioned above, SOM based on K-mer nucleotide frequency analysis has been reported for environmental samples [<xref rid="pone.0268847.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0268847.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Frequency analysis of short nucleotide sequences is applicable for any genus or species, as it does not require the selection of specific genes for phylogenetic analysis, as shown in <xref rid="pone.0268847.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>. In addition, complete genome sequences are not required for this method, and accumulations of short nucleotide sequences, such as the results of NGS, are sufficient for the analysis. Based on this concept, we demonstrate the efficiency and practicality of phylogenetic analysis using pentanucleotide frequencies.</p>

    <p>Degenerated pentanucleotide frequencies were calculated from the DNA sequences of 110 <italic toggle="yes">Yersinia</italic> genomes (<xref rid="pone.0268847.s008" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Data</xref>), and phylogenetic analyses were performed according to the results (<xref rid="pone.0268847.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref>). The phylogenetic tree, based on pentamer frequencies with 100% bootstrap values, demonstrated that <italic toggle="yes">Y. pestis</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Y. pseudotuberculosis</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Y. enterocolitica</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">Y. ruckeri</italic> were clearly distinct from one another, as shown in <xref rid="pone.0268847.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref>. This correlated with the MSLT (<xref rid="pone.0268847.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B</xref>), except that 5 strains in <italic toggle="yes">Y. pestis</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">Y. pseudotuberculosis</italic> were separated from the major strains based on MLST analysis. Further examination might provide more suitable housekeeping genes for MLST. This result suggests that this method (using pentanucleotide frequencies) produces almost identical results to MLST, which has been reported to be a superior analysis method, but is based on a completely different approach with far simpler methodology. On the other hand, 16S rRNA gene sequence-based analyses (<xref rid="pone.0268847.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig</xref>) could not distinguish between these species. Furthermore, phylogenetic trees based on tri-, tetra-, penta-, and hexa-nucleotide frequencies (<xref rid="pone.0268847.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0268847.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4</xref> Data) were constructed (<xref rid="pone.0268847.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Fig</xref>). The latter three trees distinguished between three species of <italic toggle="yes">Yersinia</italic> with 100% bootstrap values. Hexamer frequencies distinguished between all strains with ≥ 99% bootstrap values. However, this result does not necessarily determine the minimum number of nucleotide frequencies required for phylogenetic tree analysis. Furthermore, this number cannot be calculated prospectively because the diversity in DNA sequences is not consistent across different species and genera. However, pentanucleotide frequencies are sufficient for the phylogenetic analysis of <italic toggle="yes">Yersinia</italic> and other species described in this study.</p>

    <p><italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">Shigella</italic> are difficult to distinguish between based on their 16S rDNA sequences alone, and numerous alternatives have been proposed for their phylogenetic analysis [<xref rid="pone.0268847.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0268847.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0268847.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. For example, Fukushima et al. reported phylogenetic analyses of <italic toggle="yes">Salmonella</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Shigella</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic> strains based on sequences of the <italic toggle="yes">gyrB</italic> gene [<xref rid="pone.0268847.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], whereas Escobar-Páramo et al. used four chromosomal genes, (<italic toggle="yes">trpA</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">trpB</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">pabB</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">putP</italic>), or three plasmid genes, (<italic toggle="yes">ipaB</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">ipaD</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">icsA</italic>) [<xref rid="pone.0268847.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].

    <p><italic toggle="yes">E. albertii</italic> was originally classified as a <italic toggle="yes">Hafnia alvei</italic>-like strain isolated from human stool samples in the early 1990s, and was suspected of causing diarrhea [<xref rid="pone.0268847.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. It has recently been recognized as a close relative of <italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic>. Further, <italic toggle="yes">E. albertii</italic> strains were found to be closely related to strains of <italic toggle="yes">Shigella boydii</italic> serotype 13, a distant relative of <italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic>, representing a divergent lineage in the <italic toggle="yes">Escherichia</italic> genus [<xref rid="pone.0268847.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Furthermore, Hyma et al. reported that the <italic toggle="yes">E. albertii-Shigella</italic> B13 lineage is estimated to have diverged from an <italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic>-like ancestor 28 million years ago. Herein, we constructed the phylogenetic tree of <italic toggle="yes">E. albertii</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">Shigella</italic> from pentanucleotide frequencies (<xref rid="pone.0268847.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4</xref>). <xref rid="pone.0268847.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4</xref> shows the phylogenetic relationships of lineages of the three species. <italic toggle="yes">E. albertii</italic> and enterohemorrhagic <italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic> strains, including O157, O121, and O111, are closely related and are on separate branches distinct from <italic toggle="yes">Shigella</italic> and nonpathogenic <italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic>, such as strain K-12. <xref rid="pone.0268847.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4</xref> shows that <italic toggle="yes">Shigella</italic> strains are distinguishable from enteroinvasive <italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic> (EIEC), and these groups form a large branch separate from the other <italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic> strains, which includes K12. Three clusters within <italic toggle="yes">Shigella</italic> appear to have diversified over a period of 35,000–270,000 years [<xref rid="pone.0268847.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].

    <p>Sims and Kim (2011) reported the whole-genome phylogeny of the <italic toggle="yes">E. coli/Shigella</italic> group based on FFPs [<xref rid="pone.0268847.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The phylogenetic tree was constructed using all possible features of 24-nucleotide segments, which constituted approximately 8.4 million sequences. The feature compositions were refined to core features of ca 0.56 million, with low frequency and low variability. <xref rid="pone.0268847.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Fig</xref> shows that 512 features of pentanucleotides are adequate to construct a phylogenetic tree for <italic toggle="yes">E. coli/Shigella</italic>.</p>
    <p>This approach can be applied to any species without defining species-specific gene sets. As shown in <xref rid="pone.0268847.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0268847.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6</xref> Figs, <italic toggle="yes">Campylobacter</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Klebsiella</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">Neisseria</italic> species were clearly distinguished as separate phylogenetic lineages. The construction of phylogenetic trees using genome sequences takes approximately 10 min. Furthermore, rather than determining the whole genome sequence, this approach only requires clusters of short (100 bp) sequences determined through pyrosequencing.</p>
    <p>We built an application for phylogenetic analysis of species based on pentanucleotide frequencies as described above. Phy5 is written in R and is freely available at <ext-link xlink:href="http://github.com/YoshioNakano2021/phy5" ext-link-type="uri">github.com/YoshioNakano2021/phy5</ext-link>. The online version of Phy5 can be accessed at <ext-link xlink:href="https://phy5.shinyapps.io/Phy5R/" ext-link-type="uri">https://phy5.shinyapps.io/Phy5R/</ext-link>. FASTA files containing genome nucleotide sequences (one file for one strain) are uploaded onto the site, and Phy5 draws the resultant phylogenetic tree and tables of proportional pentanucleotide frequencies using aggregated data. In addition, a command line version of “Phy5” has been constructed to use in bioinformatic pipelines. It supports a set of FASTA-formatted files, treating each file as a sample, and a single FASTA-formatted file, treating each sequence as a sample. In addition, a file of the resultant distance matrix and a newick format tree file are generated and saved. An R web application is not suitable for command line applications, and so this version is embedded in Python. It is available at <ext-link xlink:href="https://github.com/YoshioNakano2021/phy5" ext-link-type="uri">https://github.com/YoshioNakano2021/phy5</ext-link>.</p>
    <p>One of the authors (Y.N.) attempted to create interspecies hybrids among <italic toggle="yes">Ipomoea</italic> species, including morning glories, and used a phylogenetic tree for choice combinations of species.

The chloroplast DNAs were 162–165 kb long, and it took only a few seconds to calculate pentanucleotide frequencies and construct the phylogenetic tree.

    <p>Reviewer #1: In this manuscript, author presented a useful alternative for phylogenetic analysis of closely related bacterial species. Escherichia coli, Shigella, Yersinia, Klebsiella, and Neisseria spp. or serotypes of Listeria monocytogenes were analyzed, and good results were observed. I think that this method is worth exploring further. This manuscript can be accepted after minor revision.</p>
    <p>Minor comment:</p>
    <p>(i) The paragraph (lines 153-161) is a repetition of the previous one (lines 144-152).</p>
    <p>(ii) Supplementary Data 2-4 is missing from the manuscript.</p>
    <p>(iii) Line 162: stain→strain.</p>
    <p>(iv) Line 174: E. coli should be in italics.</p>
    <p>(v) Line 210: Please revise ‘textitI.’</p>
    <p>Reviewer #2: Review of the manuscript PONE-D-22-13256, titled "Phylogenetic trees of closely related bacterial species and subspecies based on frequencies of short nucleotide sequences".</p>
    <p>The article describes a method of phylogenetic reconstruction based on pentanucleotide frequencies. The method could be potentially useful. Unfortunately the current manuscript does not provide a comprehensive comparison with other methods, which makes it difficult to judge the merit of the new method. Also, the implementation of the method needs a documentation and a command line interface to be useful in practical applications. I think, this could be a useful contribution, if these points are addressed.</p>
    <p>Main comments:</p>
    <p>1. Fig.2 compares trees based on pentanucleotide frequencies and 16S rRNA sequences. However, as you noted in the introduction, MLST methods have been already proposed for distinguishing Yersinia species. Such MLST-based tree, based on alignment of concatenated multiple gene sequences, should be included in this comparison. You should compare your method to available state-of-the art alternatives, not just to the weakest alternative method.</p>
    <p>2. Figs 3, 4, 5 and 6 show trees based on pentanucleotide frequencies. Best known alignment-based methods should be shown in comparison. This would allow judging the accuracy of the proposed new method.</p>
    <p>3. The manuscript needs a clear discussion about scenarios where the new method based on pentanucleotide frequencies should be preferred to other methods, and in which cases it should not be used.</p>
    <p>4. The new method is implemented in an R package "Phy5". The package lacks documentation. There should be a step-by-step manual about how to install it, and apply it to a FASTA-formatted dataset. Ideally two scenarios should be supported: (1) Operating on a set of FASTA-formatted files, treating each file as a sample. (2) Operating on a single FASTA-formatted file, treating each sequence as a sample.

    <p>6. It's not clear what is the unique or novel point of this work. Sequence comparison based on nucleotide frequencies have been studies a lot in the past. A possible contribution of this article could be, e.g., a comprehensive comparison of this method with other methods, and a guide about when it's applicable. Or, a convenient implementation, allowing easy reuse of this method in practical bioinformatic pipelines. But currently the manuscript is also lacking in both of these regards.</p>

    <p>Main comments:</p>
    <p>Reviewer:</p>
    <p>1. Fig.2 compares trees based on pentanucleotide frequencies and 16S rRNA sequences. However, as you noted in the introduction, MLST methods have been already proposed for distinguishing Yersinia species. Such MLST-based tree, based on alignment of concatenated multiple gene sequences, should be included in this comparison. You should compare your method to available state-of-the art alternatives, not just to the weakest alternative method.</p>
    <p>Authors: </p>
    <p>Figure 2B has been replaced with a phylogenetic tree based on the MLST method, and the 16S rRNA-based tree has been renamed as Supplementary Figure 1. The trees generated using pentanucleotide frequencies and MLST have very similar structures.</p>
    <p>Reviewer:</p>
    <p>2. Figs 3, 4, 5 and 6 show trees based on pentanucleotide frequencies. Best known alignment-based methods should be shown in comparison. This would allow judging the accuracy of the proposed new method.</p>
    <p>Authors: </p>
    <p>The MLST method for Yersinia has been reported and we can analyze it according to the previously published papers. In contrast, effective MLST methods for Escherichia coli and Shigella have not been reported, so candidate genes for MLST analysis must be determined. If the reviewer believes that MLST analysis for E. coli and Shigella for Figure 4 and Figure 3 are indispensable for this paper, we will attempt such MLST analysis. However, this will likely take around 6 months to complete based on the timeline of the Japanese academic year.</p>
    <p>MLST or phylogenetic analyses for Ipomoe chloroplasts have also not been reported, so Figure 5 cannot be compared to other alignment-based methods.</p>
    <p>A phylogenetic tree built using 16S rRNA gene analysis has been added to Figure 6 according to the reviewer's suggestion.</p>
    <p>Reviewer:</p>
    <p>3. The manuscript needs a clear discussion about scenarios where the new method based on pentanucleotide frequencies should be preferred to other methods, and in which cases it should not be used.</p>
    <p>Authors: </p>
    <p>This application is useful for analyzing bacterial species whose genome sequences have not yet been determined. Accumulation of short sequences can be used for phylogenetic tree analysis without identification of genes in those fragments. This method is suitable for use as a first candidate, as it can be analyzed without the need for prior knowledge of the genes. In addition, it would be difficult to use other methods in combination with SVM to distribute a large number of samples as draft sequence data.</p>
    <p>Furthermore, other methods would be difficult to identify species based on a large amount of draft sequence data in combination with SVM. These descriptions have been added at the end of the manuscript.</p>
    <p>Figure 6 demonstrates a case where this method should not be used. </p>
    <p>Reviewer:</p>
    <p>4. The new method is implemented in an R package "Phy5". The package lacks documentation. There should be a step-by-step manual about how to install it, and apply it to a FASTA-formatted dataset. Ideally two scenarios should be supported: (1) Operating on a set of FASTA-formatted files, treating each file as a sample. (2) Operating on a single FASTA-formatted file, treating each sequence as a sample. For this method to be useful in practice, there should be a non-interactive way to generate distance matrix (e.g., in PHYLIP format) and a tree (in newick format), from command line.</p>
    <p>Authors: </p>
    <p>"Phy5" is not an R package. It is a web application based on the R package "Shiny". It can be used as a standalone application and its manual would be the same as that for Shiny.</p>
    <p>A command line version of "Phy5" has been constructed to use in bioinformatic pipelines. The command line version supports a set of FASTA-formatted files or a single FASTA-formatted file. In addition, a file of the resultant distance matrix and a newick format tree file are generated and saved.</p>
    <p>R scripts are not very useful for command-line use. In particular, it is not suitable for introducing choices by argv. Therefore, we have made the command line version more user-friendly by integrating it into a Python script.</p>
    <p>Reviewer:</p>
    <p>5. I think the introduction part does not adequately introduce the topic of alignment-free sequence comparison, and the previous related works. It should include more examples of similar work, because a lot of studies have been done on this topic. See, e.g., these resources for some, but there are many more:</p>

    <p>Reviewer:</p>
    <p>6. It's not clear what is the unique or novel point of this work. Sequence comparison based on nucleotide frequencies have been studies a lot in the past. A possible contribution of this article could be, e.g., a comprehensive comparison of this method with other methods, and a guide about when it's applicable. Or, a convenient implementation, allowing easy reuse of this method in practical bioinformatic pipelines. But currently the manuscript is also lacking in both of these regards.</p>
    <p>Authors: </p>
    <p>We have submitted this alignment-free sequence comparison to various journals, and for the first time, we have received constructive comments (one of them demanded proof of the evolution from me). We acknowledge that this is no longer a novel idea, but phylogenetic analysis methods based on the frequencies of short sequences are still not widely used. We hope that another web or command line application may be useful for constructing phylogenetic trees based on genome wide sequences. We absolutely agree that command-line use would be a convenient implementation for practical bioinformatic pipelines, and the command line version of Phy5 has been built and embedded into a Python script.</p>
