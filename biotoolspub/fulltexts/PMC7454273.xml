      <title>Abstract</title>
      <p>Given the scale and rapid spread of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), there is an urgent need for medicines that can help before vaccines are available. In this study, we present a viral-associated disease-specific chemogenomics knowledgebase (Virus-CKB) and apply our computational systems pharmacology-target mapping to rapidly predict the FDA-approved drugs which can quickly progress into clinical trials to meet the urgent demand of the COVID-19 outbreak. Virus-CKB reuses the underlying platform of our DAKB-GPCRs but adds new features like multiple-compound support, multi-cavity protein support and customizable symbol display. Our one-stop computing platform describes the chemical molecules, genes and proteins involved in viral-associated diseases regulation. To date, Virus-CKB archived 65 antiviral drugs in the market, 107 viral-related targets with 189 available 3D crystal or cryo-EM structures and 2698 chemical agents reported for these target proteins. Moreover, Virus-CKB is implemented with web applications for the prediction of the relevant protein targets and analysis and visualization of the outputs, including HTDocking, TargetHunter, BBB predictor, NGL Viewer, Spider Plot, etc. The Virus-CKB server is accessible at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.cbligand.org/g/virus-ckb">https://www.cbligand.org/g/virus-ckb</ext-link>.</p>

    <title>Introduction</title>
    <p>Since late December 2019, the number of individuals infected by SARS-CoV-2/2019-nCoV, which causes an acute respiratory disease (COVID-19) [<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1–5</xref>] particularly in elderly and immune-compromised individuals, has rapidly risen to more than 3 856 211 and is responsible for over 266 463 deaths (as of 7 May 2020). Despite extensive containment efforts, SARS-CoV-2 has spread to over 210 countries and territories with sporadic outbreaks occurring in various locations. Currently, there is no approved medication or vaccine for COVID-19. New and effective anti-COVID-19 drugs are in urgent need, whereas a new drug discovery takes &gt;8 years and costs &gt;$2 billion with an approval rate less than 12%. Results from the rapid identification and sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 and the state-of-the-art molecular modelling techniques have suggested a few drugs to be repurposed for COVID-19, including the anti-Ebola Remdesivir [<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], anti-HIV lopinavir/ritonavir [<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and Chloroquine [<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Study groups were spread out across several countries with small numbers of patients, and it is hard to draw definitive conclusions from these data. Since most of the drugs or drug combinations currently used in clinical trials are chosen empirically or randomly, there is a critical need to leverage innovative technology with available medical resources to rapidly repurpose FDA-approved drugs for anti-COVID-19 before vaccines are available.</p>
    <p>Moreover, some COVID-19 patients who met criteria for hospital discharge or discontinuation of quarantine had positive RT-PCR (reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction) test results 5–13 days after recovery, suggesting that at least a proportion of recovered patients may still be virus carriers [<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In addition, co-existing diseases such as diabetes, hypertension and cardiovascular diseases are found in about one-third to one-half of reported COVID-19 patients and tend to worsen the patients’ prognosis [<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. These findings indicate that COVID-19 is a complex disease involving simultaneous production of signals from a multitude of transduction pathways. Therefore, a traditional single-target antiviral drug, though it may be highly selective and potent, may not be sufficient to effectively mitigate viral infection. An alternative strategy is to seek simultaneous modulation at multiple nodes in the network of viral infection signalling pathways through a multi-target drug [<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] or drug combinations. There is now abundant evidence of this multi-target drug approach showing the beneficial effects of simultaneously acting on multiple targets [<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Using this method, the higher affinity drug permits a greater ‘effective’ local concentration for the relatively lower affinity drug at the target site, allowing signals from both targets to be elicited and a synergistic therapeutic effect to be produced by simultaneously acting on targets with different mechanistic actions. This strategy also affords a reduction in side effects that would otherwise be produced by the higher concentrations of the lower affinity drug that would be required if used as a single agent.</p>
    <p>Recently, several proteins related to the SARS-CoV-2 invasion and its replication have been released in PDB database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.rcsb.org">www.rcsb.org</ext-link>), including the spike protein (S-protein) complexed with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) [<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], 3C-like cysteine protease (3CL<sup>Pro</sup>) [<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) [<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], in which the drugs or chemical agents targeting on these proteins will provide therapeutic potential for the treatment of COVID-19. Moreover, a few computational tools and algorithms have been developed and reported to meet the urgent need of drug discovery for COVID-19, including MolAICal (a de novo approach, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://molaical.github.io/quickstart.html">https://molaical.github.io/quickstart.html</ext-link>), COVID-19 Docking Server (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://ncov.schanglab.org.cn/">https://ncov.schanglab.org.cn/</ext-link>) [<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] and a network-based approach for drug repurposing [<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. However, there is no platform to automatically screen and discovery drug candidates for COVID-19 simultaneously acting on targets with different mechanistic actions.</p>
    <p>In this work, we present an integrated viral-associated domain-specific chemogenomics knowledgebase (Virus-CKB) to facilitate viral infection research. State-of-the-art computational chemistry, chemoinformatics and chemogenomics systems pharmacology-target (CSP-Target) mapping will be implemented in our chemogenomics database, which will help characterize viral-specific traits. It will also facilitate information exchange and data sharing among relevant scientific communities. To our knowledge, no such domain-specific database exists for the proposed computational applications.</p>

      <title>Workflow of the Virus-CKB</title>
      <p>The Virus-CKB server is an integrated web server that combines our established tools and algorithms (HTDocking [<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18–22</xref>], TargetHunter [<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], blood–brain barrier (BBB) predictor [<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20–22</xref>] and Spider Plot [<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]) and other third-party software (Open Babel [<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], JSME Molecular Editor [<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], idock [<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] and NGL Viewer [<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]) for target identification and network systems pharmacology analysis. The Virus-CKB pipeline is shown in <xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">Figure <bold>1</bold></xref>.</p>

      <p>Our platform intrinsically works on a set of conformations of viral-related crystal or cryo-EM structures and their relevant compounds. Users can submit up to five different compounds to our platform for calculations. The platform first queues a task for each query compound and afterwards converts its input format such as SMILES or SDF to PDB and PDBQT format with the help of Open Babel. Subsequently, the BBB predictor is applied to predict the BBB penetration for each query compound based on its structure. Simultaneously, the revised idock automatically docks each query compound into the previously defined binding pockets in different conformations of a target protein and generates docking scores, while the TargetHunter calculates the similarity score based on the molecular fingerprints using the Tanimoto coefficients (from 0.0 to 1.0, totally different to 100% similar) against its known active compound dataset. Finally, a target classification is performed by docking scores and similarity score, and the classification results are then passed to Spider Plot for visualization of the drug target interaction network.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec4">
      <title>Genes and proteins</title>
      <p>Genes and proteins related to viral infection were collected from several public databases such as UniProt [<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.uniprot.org/">http://www.uniprot.org/</ext-link>), Protein Data Bank [<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.rcsb.org/">https://www.rcsb.org/</ext-link>), TTD (Therapeutic Target DB) [<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31–36</xref>] and recent literature. In the current version, we collected 107 related targets with 189 available 3D crystal or cryo-EM structures that could be the potential targets for viral infection.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec5">
      <title>Drugs and chemicals</title>
      <p>Using ‘viral’ and/or ‘HIV’/‘Flu’ as the keyword(s), we searched the ChEMBL [<xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] (version 23 contains 1 735 442 compounds (of which 1 727 112 have mol files), 11 538 targets, 14 675 320 activities and 1 302 147 assays) and DrugBank [<xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] database (version 5.1.5 contains 13 490 drug entries including 2636 approved small molecule drugs, 1365 approved biologics, 131 nutraceuticals and over 6350 experimental drugs) and retrieved 65 antiviral drugs in the market and 2698 chemical agents to be compiled into the Virus-CKB platform. Compounds with IC50 lower than 1 μM towards a viral-related target were considered as the active ligands, while those larger than 10 μM were regarded as the inactive ones. The detailed protocol for data mining and preparation of drugs and chemicals can be found in our recent publication [<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec6">
      <title>Database infrastructure</title>
      <p>Users can submit their query compound(s) through JSME Molecular Editor v2017-03-01 [<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Virus-CKB was constructed based on our established molecular database prototype DAKB-GPCRs [<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.cbligand.org/dakb-gpcrs/">https://www.cbligand.org/dakb-gpcrs/</ext-link>) using the same management systems and servers as described previously [<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec7">
      <title>Blood−brain barrier predictor</title>
      <p>Our established [<xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>, <xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] blood−brain barrier (BBB) predictor [<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20–22</xref>] was integrated into Virus-CKB, in which BBB predictor will predict whether a query compound can move across the BBB to the central nervous system (CNS).</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec8">
      <title>HTDocking</title>
      <p>Virus-CKB was equipped with HTDocking [<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18–22</xref>], an online high-throughput molecular docking technique, for the identification of possible interactions between target proteins and the user-inputted compound(s). Up to three different conformations with the highest resolutions for each viral-related protein were cleaned and collected in Virus-CKB, depending on the availability of PDB files. Then, HTDocking powered by idock [<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] will automatically dock each query compound into the previously defined binding pockets of these different conformations and generate docking scores respectively. More detail about HTDocking can be found in our previous publication [<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec9">
      <title>TargetHunter</title>
      <p>Another powerful web-interfaced chemoinformatics tool integrated in Virus-CKB is called TargetHunter [<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], a target identification tool for predicting the potential therapeutic targets of the submitted compounds. Basically, TargetHunter calculates the similarity based on the molecular fingerprints using the Tanimoto coefficients (from 0.0 to 1.0, totally different to 100% similar) against the prepared active compound dataset of each target protein that is collected from <bold>Drugs and Chemicals</bold>.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec10">
      <title>Spider Plot</title>
      <p>CSP-Target Mapping or Spider Plot [<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] is also integrated into Virus-CKB for visualizing the molecule–protein interaction network based on the output of HTDocking and TargetHunter. The detailed information related to Spider Plot can found in our recent publication [<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec11">
      <title>Software requirements</title>
      <p>The Virus-CKB website is compatible with modern web browsers (such as Chrome, Firefox, Microsoft Edge and Safari) provided JavaScript and cookies are enabled. We recommend the latest release version of these web browsers for better rendering.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec12">
      <title>Benchmarks</title>

      <title>Virus-CKB server</title>
      <p>The Virus-CKB server is built on ASP.NET Core 3.1 (a high-performance MVC web framework) and is deployed on a Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 7.4 server of an Intel® Xeon® E5–2690 CPU and 8GB memory. Virus-CKB shares the exact same codebase and infrastructure with our pre-existing knowledgebase DAKB-GPCRs [<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.cbligand.org/dakb-gpcrs/">https://www.cbligand.org/dakb-gpcrs/</ext-link>). In particular, the Apache server is used as the reverse proxy of the Kestrel server of ASP.NET Core; Entity Framework Core (an ORM framework) is used for data access; SignalR over WebSocket is used for real-time browser–server communication; SQLite (an in-process DBMS) is used for data persistence; FFmpeg is used for generating the images of the protein 3D structures; and Hangfire is used for background job dispatching and management.</p>
      <p>In the current version of Virus-CKB, we integrated 6 HIV-related targets, 7 BCV/HCV-related targets, 49 influenza-related targets, and 39 coronavirus-related targets that included 6 targets from SARS, 8 targets from SARS-CoV-2 and 31 targets from other coronavirus into our Virus-CKB, with a total number of 107 related targets. Since eight targets from SARS-CoV-2 including S-protein (PDB ID: 6M0J, 6LZG), ACE2 (PDB ID: 1R4I), 3CL<sup>Pro</sup> (PDB ID: 6 LU7), RdRp (PDB ID: 7BV2), NSP16/NSP10 (PDB ID: 6 W61), NSP3 (PDB ID: 6W6Y), PLP (PDB ID: 6W9C) and NSP15 (PDB ID: 6 W01) are directly involved in the process of COVID-19 infection, targeting these key proteins or enzymes will allow us to develop drug therapies for COVID-19. For example, Gilead Science tracked the responses to Remdesivir intervention therapy for 53 patients with COVID-19 and observed a 13% death rate [<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], in which Remdesivir or GS-5724 that inhibits the RdRp of the Ebola virus and Marburg virus has demonstrated <italic>in vitro</italic> activity against the viral pathogens 2019-nCoV [<xref rid="ref41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Moreover, we also collected other viral-related targets because different antiviral drug(s) or their combination is used in clinical trials. For example, a combination of flu and HIV medications was recently used to treat severe cases of 2019-nCoV in Thailand. The approach used large doses of the flu drug oseltamivir in combination with HIV drugs lopinavir and ritonavir and improved the conditions of several patients. Other countries have also shown interest in using HIV drugs against the new coronavirus. China’s National Health Commission recently began recommending lopinavir and ritonavir.</p>

      <title>Interaction network plotting</title>
      <p>The graphical user interface of Spider Plot is developed in TypeScript language over the HTML5 canvas element which allows fast dynamic rendering of 2D or 3D shapes and bitmap images. In plotting, the submitted compounds (such as oseltamivir in <xref rid="f7" ref-type="fig">Figure <bold>7</bold></xref>) are presented as rounded rectangles labelled with the given compound name and the molecule depiction, while the predicted Virus-CKB targets are presented as circular discs labelled with the target symbol (either the protein symbol or gene symbol, user customizable). The solid or dashed connection lines represent the predicted interactions which are labelled with the average docking scores. In case one, multiple binding cavities exist in a protein, and the score of the cavity with the worst average score is plotted. By default, green target nodes connected with green solid lines represent the assay-proved targets of the compound(s) or highly potentially targets who have an assay-proved compound highly similar (similarity score ≥ 0.95) to the connecting submitted compound. For example, in <xref rid="f7" ref-type="fig">Figure <bold>7</bold></xref>, one green target node NA_INFB (Neuraminidase, Influenza B virus) connects to oseltamivir with green solid lines, which is consistent with the fact that oseltamivir shows high activity at its known target NA_INFB. In addition, clicking on any node will show the user a toolbox on the left of the canvas providing a quick way for customizing the styling of the graphic. Additional customization like rearranging all the nodes and toggling the display of molecule depictions and the docking scores on the interaction lines can be achieved with the help of keyboard shortcuts.</p>

        <graphic xlink:href="bbaa155f7"/>
      </fig>
      <p>Spider Plot supports any number of submitted compounds (though we currently have a limitation of up to five submitted compounds on job creation) and arranges the nodes optimally. It first scans all compounds and groups them based on the information of interactions with the disjoint-set data structure. Compounds that share no common targets with other compounds are placed alone on a side of the canvas. The remaining compounds are sorted so that the number of crossing interaction lines and overlapped nodes are minimized. To achieve the best visual effect and readability, Spider Plot also tentatively applies the layout strategy by simulating the layout of other parts in the graphic.</p>

      <title>Proposed drug repurposing for 3CL<sup>pro</sup> and drug combination for COVID-19 by Virus-CKB</title>
      <p>To further validate our Virus-CKB, we predicted potential FDA-approved antiviral drugs as well as the nonviral ones that may bind to 3CL<sup>pro</sup>.</p>
      <p>First, our results show that several antiviral drugs that included saquinavir (anti-HIV drug), bictegravir (anti-HIV drug) and paritaprevir (anti-HCV drug) are predicted to bind to 3CL<sup>pro</sup> (3C-like cysteine protease) of SARS-CoV-2, as shown in <xref rid="f7" ref-type="fig">Figure <bold>7</bold></xref>. Second, we also conducted the predictions for several FDA-approved nonviral drugs, as shown in <xref rid="f8" ref-type="fig">Figure <bold>8</bold></xref>. Our results showed that Digoxin (anti-cardiovascular), eltrombopag (for thrombocytopenia) and proscillaridin (anti-cardiovascular) were predicted to bind to 3CL<sup>pro</sup> (Node: PR_SARS2) of SARS-CoV-2, which our findings is supported by a recent study, in which digoxin, eltrombopag and proscillaridin exhibited antiviral efficacy (0.1 μM &lt; IC50 &lt; 10 μM) against SARS-CoV-2 [<xref rid="ref42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. All these findings may lead to rapid identification of FDA-approved drugs which can quickly progress into clinical trials to meet the urgent demand of the 2019-nCoV outbreak.</p>

      <p>Besides repurposing the FDA-approved drugs, our research has shown that combinations of different medications may have a synergic effect on treating COVID-19, as shown in <xref rid="f9" ref-type="fig">Figure <bold>9</bold></xref>. Taking remdesivir and chloroquine as an example, we found that one green target node RDRP_SARS2 (RNA-dependent RNA polymerase) connects to remdesivir with green solid lines and another green target node ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2) connects to chloroquine with green solid lines, indicating the algorithms in our platform are reliable. Since ACE2 involves in SARS-CoV-2 invasion and RdRp is responsible for the virus replication, we suggested the combination of remdesivir and chloroquine may exert the synergistic effect for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Of course, <italic>in silico</italic> identified drug repurposing and drug combination will require the <italic>in vitro</italic> target validation experiments as well as human clinical studies, which are currently underway via collaborations.</p>

    <title>Conclusion</title>
    <p>In this study, we provided a platform of national viral-associated computing resources and tools to help researchers in a broad range of disciplines and to help advance our knowledge about potential drug repurposing and drug combinations. This work demonstrates that the use of a knowledgebase and CSP-Target Mapping can facilitate rapid drug development to meet the urgent demand of the COVID-19 outbreak. We will integrate the information of gene signatures and signalling pathways of target proteins as well as our newly developed algorithms or tools into our Virus-CKB server in the future. Moreover, we will include or develop more techniques (such as NLP) into our database to improve the accuracy and user interface. Recently, adverse events were reported from the clinical data of remdesivir [<xref rid="ref43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], which require the further improvement of drug properties. We will integrate tools or algorithms for further optimization of drug-like properties of the compound or lead in the future.</p>
