    <abstract>
      <p>The reversible lipid modification protein S-palmitoylation can dynamically modify the localization, diffusion, function, conformation and physical interactions of substrate proteins. Dysregulated S-palmitoylation is associated with a multitude of human diseases including brain and metabolic disorders, viral infection and cancer. However, the diverse expression patterns of the genes that regulate palmitoylation in the broad range of human cell types are currently unexplored, and their expression in commonly used cell lines that are the workhorse of basic and preclinical research are often overlooked when studying palmitoylation dependent processes. We therefore created CellPalmSeq (<ext-link xlink:href="https://cellpalmseq.med.ubc.ca/" ext-link-type="uri">https://cellpalmseq.med.ubc.ca</ext-link>), a curated RNAseq database and interactive webtool for visualization of the expression patterns of the genes that regulate palmitoylation across human single cell types, bulk tissue, cancer cell lines and commonly used laboratory non-human cell lines. This resource will allow exploration of these expression patterns, revealing important insights into cellular physiology and disease, and will aid with cell line selection and the interpretation of results when studying important cellular processes that depend on protein S-palmitoylation.</p>

    <title>1 Introduction</title>
    <p>Protein <italic>S</italic>-palmitoylation is a reversible post-translational modification, in which the 16-carbon fatty acid, palmitate, is attached to a thiol group of specific cysteine residues <italic>via</italic> a labile thioester bond. As the most common form of <italic>S</italic>-acylation, this modification has profound influence over protein function and cellular signaling in the brain (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Globa and Bamji, 2017</xref>; <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Matt et al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Ji and Skup, 2021</xref>), immune system (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Lin, 2021</xref>; <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2021</xref>) and cardiovascular system (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Essandoh et al., 2020</xref>). Furthermore, dysregulated <italic>S</italic>-palmitoylation is also associated with metabolic disorders (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Qu et al., 2021</xref>), brain disorders (<xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">ZarÄba-KozioÅ et al., 2018</xref>) and viral infection (e.g., SARS-CoV-2) (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Abdulrahman et al., 2021</xref>; <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">Wu et al., 2021</xref>; <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2022</xref>). In recent years, considerable evidence has accumulated that <italic>S</italic>-palmitoylation of oncogenes can play a critical role in cancer progression, with the palmitoylating and depalmitoylating enzymes being investigated as drug targets to modify tumor growth (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Ko and Dixon, 2018</xref>). <italic>S</italic>-palmitoylation is mediated by a family of 24 human ZDHHC enzymes that differ structurally but share a consensus âDHHCâ catalytic motif (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Malgapo and Linder, 2021</xref>; <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Puthenveetil et al., 2022</xref>). These enzymes can associate with several known ZDHHC accessory proteins that regulate their function and stability (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Salaun et al., 2020</xref>). Furthermore, depalmitoylation is mediated by a growing number of acyl-protein thioesterase enzymes, which are still in the process of being fully characterized (<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">Won, Cheung See Kit and Martin, 2018</xref>). However, the precise distribution of these enzymes within the broad range of cell types and tissues in the human body has not been characterized, and is often overlooked when using model systems to study biological and pathological processes that are regulated by <italic>S</italic>-palmitoylation.</p>
    <p>Cell lines are the workhorse of many laboratories and are often used for basic and clinical research in place of primary cell culture. In addition to being cost effective, easy to use, and generating relatively reproducible data, cells lines also bypass the need for ethical approval that is associated with human and non-human animal tissue. Furthermore, human cancer cell lines that share many transcriptomic similarities with primary tumors (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Barretina et al., 2012</xref>), are the primary preclinical model systems for the investigation of cancer biology and testing the efficacy of anticancer drugs (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Gonzalez-Nicolini and Fussenegger, 2005</xref>).</p>
    <p>In addition to the numerous cancer cell lines that are central to cancer research, alternative animal cell lines are used across a huge variety of research disciplines, in fields as diverse as primary research, vaccine production, study of gene function, protein production and drug toxicity research (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Allen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Khan, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Genzel, 2015</xref>) (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Allen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Khan, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Genzel, 2015</xref>). However, the influence of the background transcriptome of a given cell line is not always taken into account when utilizing these models to study cellular processes.</p>
    <p>The recent publication of numerous large scale RNAseq studies has enabled the transcriptional profiling of a large variety of tissues, including from human samples, animal model systems and immortalized cell lines. Importantly, this wealth of expression data is publicly available through web resources such as the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and other purpose designed web resources. However, there are often barriers to easy access of this data, particularly when web resources for data viewing are not available.</p>
    <p>A recent study from our lab collated and analyzed publicly available RNAseq data revealing considerable heterogeneity in the expression patterns of the genes that regulate <italic>S</italic>-palmitoylation in the mouse brain, and demonstrated how these expression patterns can be used to better understand the etiology of diseases that are related to dysregulated <italic>S</italic>-palmitoylation, and to predict and validate enzyme-substrate interactions (<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">Wild et al., 2022</xref>). However, a resource for non-brain RNAseq data in human tissues and commonly used cell lines is currently lacking. We have therefore applied a similar approach to RNAseq data curation and visualization for genes that regulate <italic>S</italic>-palmitoylation, this time assessing their expression patterns in human bulk and single-cell RNAseq datasets, in addition to human and non-human cell lines that are a mainstay of basic biological and preclinical research. To create an accessible resource for visualizing the expression of the <italic>S</italic>-palmitoylationg and depalmitoylating enzymes across a vast number of cell lines, we curated data from several large scale RNAseq databases that cover hundreds of human cancer cell lines, and also curated GEO expression data from several of the most commonly used non-human and human laboratory cell lines. We then created a webtool (CellPalmSeq; <ext-link xlink:href="https://cellpalmseq.med.ubc.ca/" ext-link-type="uri">https://cellpalmseq.med.ubc.ca</ext-link>) to allow easy interrogation of this multi-study data using simple interactive heatmaps.</p>

      <title>2.1 Creation of CellPalmSeq, an interactive database and webtool for visualization of the expression patterns of the genes that regulate <italic>S</italic>-palmitoylation</title>
      <p>In recent years, numerous RNAseq studies of varying scales have characterized the transcriptomes of human tissues and hundreds of commonly used cell lines. However, this data is often difficult to access and visualize, with no single resource existing with transcriptomic data from a large number of non-human cell lines. Furthermore, datasets from individual studies are challenging for non-bioinformaticians to access, and available webtools often do not allow comparison of the expression of multiple genes at once. We therefore created âCellPalmSeqâ, an interactive resource for visualization of expression data for the genes that regulate <italic>S</italic>-palmitoylation, curated from multi-study RNAseq datasets from non-diseased human tissues, human cancer cell lines and commonly used non-human laboratory cell lines. We processed data for the 24 ZDHHC enzymes (<italic>ZDHHC1</italic>-<italic>ZDHHC24</italic>, plus <italic>ZDHHC11B</italic> and omitting <italic>ZDHHC10</italic> which is not included in the ZDHHC genes), the known ZDHHC accessory proteins (<italic>GOLGA7</italic>, <italic>GOLGA7B</italic> and <italic>SELENEOK</italic>; <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Salaun et al., 2020</xref>) and the depalmitoylating enzymes that have been well characterized and/or are inhibited by the depalmitoylating enzyme blockers (HDFP) and Palmostatin B (<italic>LYPLA1, LYPLA2, PPT1, ABHD4, ABHD6, ABHD10, ABHD12, ABHD13, ABHD16A, ABHD17A, ABHD17B, ABHD17C;</italic>
<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Lin et al., 2017</xref>). To compare across datasets, we present all datasets in the same expression units and reanalyzed from the raw reads where needed. All data are freely available for download on CellPalmSeq, so that users can replot data in their preferred format. We then utilized this resource to study the expression patterns of this gene family in order to highlight the importance of accounting for their expression when studying cellular signaling in different cell types, tissues, and cellular model systems.</p>

      <title>2.2 Expression of the genes that regulate <italic>S</italic>-palmitoylation in human single cell types</title>
      <p>We first curated single-cell RNAseq data from the Human Protein Atlas, which analyzed collated data from 26 studies of cells from non-diseased human tissues and organs, identifying 76 broad single-cell types, divided into 15 cell type clusters (<ext-link xlink:href="https://www.proteinatlas.org/" ext-link-type="uri">https://www.proteinatlas.org/</ext-link>; <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Karlsson et al., 2021</xref>). Single-cell RNAseq data reveal the gene expression profile of a particular cell type, as opposed to bulk tissue which is composed of multiple cell types. We downloaded expression data (normalized transcripts per million; nTPM) for the genes that regulate <italic>S</italic>-palmitoylation from this dataset and plotted heatmaps of ZDHHC expression. We found initially that a small number of the ZDHHC genes were expressed considerably higher than others, making visual comparison between the majority of genes difficult within a single heatmap (notably <italic>ZDHHC3</italic> and <italic>ZDHHC19</italic> in late spermatids, see CellPalmSeq for interactive heatmaps). Therefore, we plotted individual heatmaps of ZDHHC expression <italic>within each cell-type cluster</italic>, with heatmaps scaled separately for each cell type cluster (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). Overall, when looking at expression by cell type cluster, we observed highly heterogeneous expression, in line with specific functions of the various components of the <italic>S</italic>-palmitoylation machinery in different cellular contexts. Certain cell type clusters showed a preference for a very select group of ZDHHC enzymes, whereas others expressed a broader range of ZDHHC enzymes. On average, <italic>ZDHHC3</italic> was the highest expressing ZDHHC enzyme across all cell types, followed by <italic>ZDHHC12</italic>, <italic>ZDHHC21,</italic> and <italic>ZDHHC4</italic>. For the ZDHHC accessory proteins (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>), <italic>GOLGA7</italic> was broadly expressed within the majority of cell type clusters, whereas <italic>SELENOK</italic> expression was highly heterogeneous. For the depalmitoylating enzymes (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>), <italic>LYPLA1</italic> had the highest expression on average and was expressed highly in a number of cell types such as squamous epithelial cells, cardiomyocytes, and hepatic stellate cells, while <italic>PPT1</italic> was the depalmitoylating enzyme with the highest expression in immune cells. Interactive heatmaps for this (and all other) data are available on CellPalmSeq to plot expression data according to user preferences.</p>

      <p>Next, to visualize the relative expression of each individual ZDHHC enzyme <italic>across all cell types</italic>, we plotted z-scores for each ZDHHC enzyme, calculated from expression values across all cell types examined (<xref rid="s10" ref-type="sec">Supplementary Figure S1</xref>). A positive or negative z-score indicates enriched or depleted expression, respectively, in a given cell type. Several ZDHHCs were highly enriched in certain cell types, for example, ZDHHC19 in late spermatids and ZDHHC16 in extravillous trophoblasts. Depalmitoylating enzymes showed similarly enriched expression, including <italic>ABHD17A</italic> in NK cells, and <italic>ABHD17B</italic> in oligodendrocytes (<xref rid="s10" ref-type="sec">Supplementary Figure S2</xref>). For the accessory proteins, <italic>GOLGA7B</italic> was highly enriched in cells of the nervous system, particularly neuronal cells, mirroring previous findings of enrichment of <italic>Golga7b</italic> in mouse neuronal cells (<xref rid="s10" ref-type="sec">Supplementary Figure S2</xref>; <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">Wild et al., 2022</xref>).</p>
      <p>In addition to the single-cell RNAseq data presented here, bulk RNAseq data of the major human tissues curated from the Human Protein Atlas are also available on the CellPalmSeq website.</p>
      <p>Together, these expression patterns give insight into the specialized roles that certain palmitoylating and depalmitoylating enzymes are likely to have in different cell types within the human body, and can be used to make predictions about potential substrate interactions between this machinery and cell type enriched substrates (<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">Wild et al., 2022</xref>). Furthermore, these patterns of enrichment will aid in the understanding of potential off target effects of drugs developed to modify the <italic>S</italic>-palmitoylation machinery, in non-target tissues.</p>

      <title>2.3 Expression of the genes that regulate <italic>S</italic>-palmitoylation in human cancer cell lines</title>
      <p>Cancer cell lines are heavily utilized as preclinical model systems for cancer research (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Barretina et al., 2012</xref>), and have been critical for the discovery of many fundamental processes in cell biology, such as the characterization of the signaling machinery engaged by T-cell receptors using tumor derived Jurkat cells (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Abraham and Weiss, 2004</xref>). Importantly, <italic>S</italic>-palmitoylation is known to play a role in the activation of oncogenic signaling networks, and the enzymes that regulate <italic>S</italic>-palmitoylation are known to be dysregulated in a number of cancers (<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">Yeste-Velasco et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Anderson and Ragan, 2016</xref>; <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Fhu and Ali, 2021</xref>). We next investigated two large scale cancer RNAseq compendia, the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE; 1406 cell lines; <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Barretina et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Ghandi et al., 2019</xref>) and Cell Model Passports (CMP; 442 cell lines; <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Garcia-Alonso et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Picco et al., 2019</xref>), that measured gene expression across several hundred cancer cell lines. Expression data (transcripts per million; TPM) were again downloaded for the genes that regulate <italic>S</italic>-palmitoylation and are available for interactive plotting on CellPalmSeq. To provide an overview of differential enrichment of these genes, we averaged expression according to the primary disease tissue (or cancer type) from which the cell lines were isolated, and plotted heatmaps that revealed highly heterogeneous expression of the genes that regulate <italic>S</italic>-palmitoylation across cancer cell lines for both the CCLE (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>) and CMP datasets (<xref rid="s10" ref-type="sec">Supplementary Figure S3</xref>). The heatmap columns were ranked by descending averages to determine which genes had the broadest expression across cancer cell lines. For the ZDHHC enzymes, <italic>ZDHHC4, ZDHHC5, ZDHHC6, ZDHHC7, ZDHHC12, ZDHHC16</italic>, <italic>and ZDHHC20</italic> were the highest expressing ZDHHC enzymes across cell lines in both datasets, although their ranked expression differed in each set. This is likely due to differences in the number of unique cell lines selected for testing, as only 161 out of 442 cell lines from the CMP dataset were also tested in the CCLE panel. Conversely, expression of <italic>ZDHHC15</italic> and <italic>ZDHHC19</italic> was very low in the majority of cell lines in both studies. Some patterns of expression were consistent across the two datasets (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>; <xref rid="s10" ref-type="sec">Supplementary Figure S3A</xref>), including high expression of <italic>ZDHHC3</italic> and <italic>ABHD6</italic> in bone cancer derived cell lines, particularly those derived from Ewingâs sarcoma tumors. <italic>ZDHHC7</italic> was elevated in kidney cancer cell lines in both datasets, and <italic>PPT1</italic> was highly expressed in cell lines from breast cancer tumors. Conversely, <italic>ZDHHC9</italic> expression was markedly lowest in cell lines derived from leukemia and lymphoma tissues in both datasets. Because human cancer cell lines often share many transcriptomic similarities with primary tumors (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Barretina et al., 2012</xref>), this resource to examine the expression patterns of the genes that regulate <italic>S</italic>-palmitoylation across cancer cell lines and cancer types may enable hypothesis generation regarding how <italic>S</italic>-palmitoylation is regulated in certain cancers.</p>

      <p>We next plotted the expression data for <italic>S</italic>-palmitoylation associated genes across several of the most commonly used human cell lines (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). Although these cell lines have been used extensively for cancer research, many have been utilized outside of this field for fundamental research into cell biology and drug discovery (<xref rid="s10" ref-type="sec">Supplementary Table S1</xref>). Furthermore, the HEK-293 human cells are included as they are commonly used in basic research, although this cell line was derived embryonic kidney cells transformed with adenovirus, and not from tumor tissue (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Graham et al., 1977</xref>). Heterogeneous expression of the palmitoylating enzymes, their accessory proteins and the depalmitoylating enzymes was again observed across these cell lines, highlighting the importance of considering the expression of this family of enzymes when choosing cell lines as model systems for research on processes that are regulated by <italic>S</italic>-palmitoylation.</p>

      <title>2.4 Correlation of RNA and protein expression for genes that regulate <italic>S</italic>-palmitoylation in human cancer cell lines</title>
      <p>Although RNA expression patterns are a useful tool to predict the protein expression in a given cell type, the correlation between RNA and protein expression can be poor, due to post-translational protein processing and degradation (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Vogel and Marcotte, 2012</xref>). To determine which of the <italic>S</italic>-palmitoylation associated genes have RNA expression patterns that are maintained at the protein level in human cancer cell lines, we compared RNA (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Ghandi et al., 2019</xref>) and protein (mass spectrometry proteomics; <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Nusinow et al., 2020</xref>) expression data, both generated by the CCLE study (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). We found 251 cell lines that were present in both datasets, however, not all of our proteins of interest were detected across all cell lines. We therefore only performed correlations on cell lines that had values for both RNA and protein for a given gene, and converted the expression values into z-scores across these cell lines in order to perform a comparison of cell line enrichments (<xref rid="s10" ref-type="sec">Supplementary Table S2</xref>). In addition, several genes were not detected at all at the protein level, including <italic>ZDHHC1, ZDHHC11, ZDHHC11B, ZDHHC12, ZDHHC19</italic> and <italic>ZDHHC22</italic>. We found that 21 out of the 33 genes examined showed a moderate or strong positive correlation (R &gt; 0.4; <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) between RNA and protein z-scores (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>), indicating that RNA expression patterns are predictive of protein abundance for the majority of <italic>S</italic>-palmitoylation associated genes. There were however several notable examples of very poor correlation, including <italic>ZDHHC8</italic>, <italic>GOLGA7B</italic> and <italic>ABHD10</italic>.</p>

      <p>Closer examination of examples of genes with high correlations between RNA and protein revealed that certain genes were either enriched or depleted within certain cancer cell line clusters (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>). For example, ZDHHC13 RNA and protein were highly enriched in esophageal and pancreatic cancer cell lines, and depleted in liver cancer cell lines, while ABHD12 was enriched in kidney and liver cancer cell lines. Conversely, GOLGA7B and ABHD10 showed very poor correlation, indicating that caution should be taken if attempting to infer expression patterns of these genes from RNA expression patterns alone.</p>

      <title>2.5 Expression of the genes that regulate <italic>S</italic>-palmitoylation in commonly used non-human cell lines</title>
      <p>Numerous non-human cell lines are widely utilized in basic and pre-clinical research and have been used for the study of basic cell biology, drug toxicity, gene therapy and vaccine production (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Verma et al., 2020</xref>). However, to our knowledge no single resource exists that has performed a multi-cell line RNAseq study on the most commonly used non-human cell lines. We therefore turned to the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO; <ext-link xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/" ext-link-type="uri">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/</ext-link>), a database repository of high throughput gene expression data, to manually curate available RNAseq data for the several of the most commonly used cell lines including: NIH/3T3, PC12, MDCK, BHK21, CHO, VeroE6, and Calu3 (<xref rid="s10" ref-type="sec">Supplementary Table S3</xref>). We curated studies according to the following criteria: i) datasets were associated with a peer reviewed publication; ii) control samples had been tested with minimal manipulation and iii) the source of the cell line used was well defined or the cell line had been authenticated by short tandem repeat (STR) profiling. We then reanalyzed control samples from these curated datasets from the raw reads using the same analysis pipeline. The predicted ensembl (<ext-link xlink:href="https://ensembl.org" ext-link-type="uri">https://ensembl.org</ext-link>) gene set for each species was used to extract the <italic>S</italic>-palmitoylation genes but as expected, not all genes we previously analyzed in human are identified in each species, therefore only those identified are included. All of these datasets are available for interactive visualization and download on CellPalmSeq.</p>
      <p>We began with the mouse NIH/3T3 cell line, which is one of the most commonly used embryonic fibroblast lines with 8,826 citations on <ext-link xlink:href="http://PubMed.gov" ext-link-type="uri">PubMed.gov</ext-link>. We found that expression patterns for the genes that regulate <italic>S</italic>-palmitoylation were very similar across four independent studies, particularly for the ZDHHC enzymes, despite the cell lines originating from three independent sources (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>; <xref rid="s10" ref-type="sec">Supplementary Table S3</xref>). <italic>Zdhhc3</italic>, <italic>Zdhhc4</italic> and <italic>Zdhhc16</italic> were the highest expressing ZDHHCs across studies, while numerous ZDHHCs were not detected at all. <italic>Abhd17a</italic>, <italic>Lypla1</italic>, and <italic>Ppt1</italic> were the highest expressing depalmitoylating enzymes, and of the accessory proteins, all were detected except <italic>Golga7b</italic>.</p>

      <p>The expression patterns were markedly different in PC12 cells derived from rat adrenal medulla, that share many common features with neuronal cells (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>; <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">Westerink and Ewing, 2008</xref>). Notably, <italic>Zdhhc2</italic> and <italic>Zdhhc5</italic> were on average the highest expressing ZDHHCs across three studies analyzed. Overall, less cross study similarity was observed, highlighting the potential transcriptional heterogeneity in this cell line when derived from different sources. Unlike NIH/3T3 cells, <italic>Golga7b</italic> expression was detected in two of the three studies of PC12 cells, consistent with the neuronal expression for this accessory protein (<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">Wild et al., 2022</xref>).</p>
      <p>Analysis of MDCK cells derived from canine epithelial cells (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Dukes et al., 2011</xref>), which have been used in broad applications in biological research and vaccine production, and have been cited over 11,000 times on PubMed, revealed again differences in the highest expressing enzymes, this time with <italic>ZDHHC6</italic> and <italic>ZDHHC20</italic> having the highest expression on average of the ZDHHCs and <italic>ABHD12</italic> being the highest expressing depalmitoylating enzyme (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>).</p>
      <p>Finally, we analyzed several of the most commonly used cell lines for SARS-CoV-2 research, as <italic>S</italic>-palmitoylation of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein is essential for viral membrane fusion and infectivity (<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">Wu et al., 2021</xref>). We collated data for VeroE6 from African Green Monkey and Calu-3, which is a human derived cancer cell line. These cell lines are often selected for SARS-CoV-2 research due to their expression of the ACE-2 receptor, which is required for SARS-CoV-2 entry into the cell (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Kumar et al., 2021</xref>). We plotted the average of VeroE6 and Calu-3 datasets collated from GEO, along with data from several human cell lines that have been used to identify the palmitoylating enzymes for SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (<xref rid="s10" ref-type="sec">Supplementary Figure S4</xref>; <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Mesquita et al., 2021</xref>; <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Puthenveetil et al., 2021</xref>; <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Ramadan et al., 2022</xref>). We found that expression of the putative ZDHHC enzymes that palmitoylate the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (<italic>ZDHHC3</italic>, <italic>ZDHHC5</italic>, <italic>ZDHHC8</italic>, <italic>ZDHHC9</italic> and <italic>ZDHHC20</italic>; red bars <xref rid="s10" ref-type="sec">Supplementary Figure S4</xref>) differed across the cell lines, which could alter <italic>S</italic>-palmitoylation of the spike protein, and in turn viral infectivity. Overall, these results reveal how understanding the composition of the <italic>S</italic>-palmitoylation related machinery in a cell line might aid with cell line selection, the design of experiments and the interpretation of results, when using cell lines to study important biological processes that depend on protein <italic>S</italic>-palmitoylation.</p>

    <sec id="s3-1">
      <title>3.1 Heterogeneous expression of the genes that regulate <italic>S</italic>-palmitoylation across human cell types</title>
      <p>Protein <italic>S</italic>-palmitoylation is a dynamic regulator of numerous signaling pathways that are critical for normal cell function (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Main and Fuller, 2022</xref>). It is estimated that over 10% of proteins in the human proteome are <italic>S</italic>-palmitoylation substrates (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Blanc et al., 2015</xref>), therefore the majority of cellular signaling pathways are likely to be regulated by this post translational modification. The list of <italic>S</italic>-palmitoylated proteins that are known to be critically involved in human diseases is expanding (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Fraser, 2019</xref>), and therefore understanding the unique makeup of the <italic>S</italic>-palmitoylation machinery in a given cell type is essential when studying processes that are regulated by <italic>S</italic>-palmitoylation.</p>
      <p>Recent advances in RNAseq technologies have enabled the detailed characterization of cellular transcriptomes at a reduced monetary cost, with increased sequencing depth and single cell resolution. This has been accompanied by an increase in the number of studies performed on human tissue, and an appreciation for the importance of open data that can be accessed by the research community in order to reveal novel insights into human physiology and disease. Here, we capitalized on these advances by using open data to investigate the expression patterns of the genes that regulate <italic>S</italic>-palmitoylation in human single cell types, tissues and cancer cell lines, and created an interactive resource to give other researchers easy access to this data.</p>
      <p>When examining the distribution of the genes that regulate <italic>S</italic>-palmitoylation in the various cell types from isolated human tissues, we observed that many cell types express a unique compliment of palmitoylating and depalmitoylating enzymes. Because members of this family of proteins are targeted to different subcellular organelles (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Globa and Bamji, 2017</xref>), and this subcellular targeting can influence the localization and trafficking of substrates (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Solis et al., 2022</xref>), differential expression of these enzymes and accessory proteins will have a profound influence on substrate function in different cellular contexts. For example, the ZDHHC5 accessory protein GOLGA7B, which is known to regulate ZDHHC5 cell membrane localization, was expressed in neuronal cells, but not detected in cardiomyoctyes. Because ZDHHC5 is known to have an important role in both of these cell types (<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">Woodley and Collins, 2021</xref>), this differential expression of GOLGA7B could alter the function of ZDHHC5 in these different cellular contexts.</p>
      <p>Drugs that target the ZDHHC palmitoylating enzymes are a potential avenue to treat disorders that are associated with dysregulated <italic>S</italic>-palmitoylation (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Fraser, 2019</xref>). Efforts are currently underway to develop drugs that selectively target individual ZDHHC enzymes (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Salaun et al., 2022</xref>). However, a large number of proteins can be <italic>S</italic>-palmitoylated by more than one ZDHHC enzyme, resulting in functional redundancy within this enzyme family that may reduce the therapeutic potential of selective inhibition of individual ZDHHCs. Examination of the relative expression of functionally related ZDHHC enzymes within a given cell type using CellPalmSeq will therefore facilitate predictions of the therapeutic efficacy of selective ZDHHC inhibitors. Furthermore, this data will enable researchers and clinicians to identify ZDHHCs with enriched expression in target cell types and tissues, and better predict off-target effects of selective inhibitors in non-diseased tissues.</p>

      <title>3.2 Expression patterns of the genes that regulate <italic>S</italic>-palmitoylation in cancer cell lines may give insight into cancer pathologies</title>
      <p>The role of <italic>S</italic>-palmitoylation in cancer pathology is now well established (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Anderson and Ragan, 2016</xref>; <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Lin et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Ko and Dixon, 2018</xref>; <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Lobo, 2019</xref>). A recent study identified 299 cancer driving genes (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Bailey et al., 2018</xref>), of which 78 are substrates for <italic>S</italic>-palmitoylation (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Ko and Dixon, 2018</xref>). Furthermore, altered expression of almost all of the 24 ZDHHC enzymes is associated with positive or negative prognosis in various cancers (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Ko and Dixon, 2018</xref>). Interestingly, several of the expression patterns of the genes that regulate <italic>S</italic>-palmitoylation that we found here in certain cancer cell lines have also been previously reported in the literature. For example, we observed elevated expression of <italic>ABHD6</italic> in cell lines with a bone cancer origin, particularly those from Ewingâs sarcoma cell lines. High expression of <italic>ABHD6</italic> in Ewingâs sarcoma cell lines were found previously (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Max et al., 2009</xref>), while another study found a carcinogenic role for ABHD6 in metastatic seeding of murine pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cells <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">GrÃ¼ner et al., 2016</xref>). Although ABHD6 has an important function in degrading the endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoylglycerol, the role of ABHD6 as a depalmitoylating enzyme has not yet been studied, despite being potently inhibited by depalmitoylating enzyme inhibitors HDFP and PalmB (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Lin et al., 2017</xref>). We also observed across studies highly elevated expression of <italic>ZDHHC7</italic> in kidney cancer cell lines and <italic>PPT1</italic> in breast cancer cell lines, opening potential avenues for research into the role of these enzymes in these cancers. Extensive RNAseq datasets are now available that have characterized gene expression in patient isolated tumors. Investigation of the expression patterns of the genes that regulate <italic>S</italic>-palmitoylation from these data will further expand any insight into the role of this family of proteins within certain cancer types.</p>
      <p>While RNAseq expression patterns are useful for the prediction of protein abundance in certain cell types, RNA and protein expression do not often correlate well due to post translational protein processing (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Vogel and Marcotte, 2012</xref>). Furthermore, the sensitivity of proteomic assays currently lags behind that of RNA sequencing, as unlike RNA, protein cannot be amplified to enhance detection. Here we took advantage of the availability of both RNAseq and proteomic datasets covering a large number of cancer cell lines, which allowed us to perform an in-depth study of the correlation between RNA and protein expression for the majority of the genes that regulate <italic>S</italic>-palmitoylation. Although we observed moderate or strong positive correlation for the majority of genes tested, there are notable exceptions including ZDHHC8, ZDHHC24, GOLGA7, GOLGA7B, and ABHD10 which correlated poorly. Particular caution is therefore advised when inferring protein abundance from RNA expression for these proteins, which may be subject to more extensive post transcriptional regulation.</p>

    <sec id="s3-3">
      <title>3.3 Consideration of the expression of the genes that regulate <italic>S</italic>-palmitoylation when using cellular model systems to study biology and disease</title>
      <p>We have used examples of non-human cell lines and the cell lines that are most commonly used for SARS-CoV-2 research to demonstrate that heterogeneity in ZDHHC expression should be taken into account when choosing cell lines for research and interpreting results, particularly when studying <italic>S</italic>-palmitoylation dependent processes. For example, when selecting cell lines for SARS-CoV-2 research, we show that the expression of the putative ZDHHC palmitoylating enzymes for the spike protein differed across cell lines that are commonly used for this research. In addition, consideration of the similarities in expression profiles between laboratory cell lines and the endogenous cell types being studied will also be beneficial. For studies on SARS-CoV-2 infection, which predominantly affects respiratory ciliated cells (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Hou et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Robinot et al., 2021</xref>), the single-cell expression profile for this cell type detailed in <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>, combined with the expression profiles of the popular cell lines used for SARS-CoV-2 research in <xref rid="s10" ref-type="sec">Supplementary Figure S4</xref>, can guide the selection of the most suitable cell line.</p>
      <p>Finally, we found that certain cell lines were more consistent in their expression of the ZDHHC enzymes, when derived from multiple sources, and researchers are recommended to sequence their own cell lines for most accurate assessment of gene expression. When available, we believe that the large panel screens of multiple cell lines that use systematic and standardized culture and RNAseq protocols (such as CCLE and CMP) are the most reliable resource for assessing relative trends in expression profiles of these genes.</p>
      <p>CellPalmSeq will be an invaluable resource that will enable researchers and clinicians to easily interrogate the expression patterns of the <italic>S</italic>-palmitoylation machinery in the human body and cell line model systems, and therefore will facilitate research into the role of <italic>S</italic>-palmitoylation in cellular biology and disease.</p>
