      <p>Despite rapid evolution in the area of microbial natural
products
chemistry, there is currently no open access database containing all
microbially produced natural product structures. Lack of availability
of these data is preventing the implementation of new technologies
in natural products science. Specifically, development of new computational
strategies for compound characterization and identification are being
hampered by the lack of a comprehensive database of known compounds
against which to compare experimental data. The creation of an open
access, community-maintained database of microbial natural product
structures would enable the development of new technologies in natural
products discovery and improve the interoperability of existing natural
products data resources. However, these data are spread unevenly throughout
the historical scientific literature, including both journal articles
and international patents. These documents have no standard format,
are often not digitized as machine readable text, and are not publicly
available. Further, none of these documents have associated structure
files (e.g., MOL, InChI, or SMILES), instead containing images of
structures. This makes extraction and formatting of relevant natural
products data a formidable challenge. Using a combination of manual
curation and automated data mining approaches we have created a database
of microbial natural products (The Natural Products Atlas, <uri xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="http://www.npatlas.org">www.npatlas.org</uri>) that includes
24 594 compounds and contains referenced data for structure,
compound names, source organisms, isolation references, total syntheses,
and instances of structural reassignment. This database is accompanied
by an interactive web portal that permits searching by structure,
substructure, and physical properties. The Web site also provides
mechanisms for visualizing natural products chemical space and dashboards
for displaying author and discovery timeline data. These interactive
tools offer a powerful knowledge base for natural products discovery
with a central interface for structure and property-based searching
and presents new viewpoints on structural diversity in natural products.
The Natural Products Atlas has been developed under FAIR principles
(Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) and is integrated
with other emerging natural product databases, including the Minimum
Information About a Biosynthetic Gene Cluster (MIBiG) repository,
and the Global Natural Products Social Molecular Networking (GNPS)
platform. It is designed as a community-supported resource to provide
a central repository for known natural product structures from microorganisms
and is the first comprehensive, open access resource of this type.

    <title>Introduction</title>
    <p>The field of natural products is enjoying
a period of rapid innovation
and technological advancement as new tools are developed for unbiased
characterization of natural product mixtures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref></sup> These include chemical,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref></sup> biological,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref></sup> and bioinformatic<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref></sup> approaches
which are broadening our viewpoint on the diversity, distribution,
and functions of natural products. However, despite the rapid evolution
in this area, there is currently no open access database containing
all microbially produced natural product structures. Lack of availability
of these data is hampering the implementation of new ideas and approaches
in this area. Many of these strategies, such as the prediction of
mass spectrometry fragmentation patterns,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref></sup> rely
on the availability of known compound databases against which to compare
experimental data. In addition, the absence of a consensus structure
data set precludes the integration of information from different natural
products characterization platforms (e.g., MIBiG<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref></sup> and GNPS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref></sup>), limiting the interoperability
of these individual resources.</p>
    <p>The current landscape for microbial
natural products databases
is large, but fragmented. Existing databases are either commercial
and do not make all structures accessible (e.g., Antibase, MarinLit,
The Dictionary of Natural Products), or are free but have limited
information on compound origin (e.g., Supernatural II<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref></sup>), are not easily downloadable (e.g., NPEdia), or are narrowly
defined (e.g., StreptomeDB,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref></sup> AfroDB,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref></sup> and NuBBE<sub>DB</sub><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref></sup>). In addition, most existing databases are not accurately referenced,
with many data points being presented without details about their
primary source. Absence of accurate referencing limits the value of
these data, preventing researchers from easily evaluating the original
source material for accuracy and validity. Many natural product databases
are available to the community (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="other">Table <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="other">1</xref></xref>), each of which offer different content and analysis
tools. However, none of these provide comprehensive coverage of microbial
natural product structures under FAIR principles.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref></sup> For this reason, we elected to create a new microbial natural
products database, termed the Natural Products Atlas (<uri xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="http://www.npatlas.org">www.npatlas.org</uri>).</p>

    <p>At a minimum, any natural product database should
contain information
on compound structures, names, producing organisms, and isolation
reference. Extracting even these basic data from the primary literature
for all microbial natural products is a challenging objective. Structures
have been reported as early as the late 1800s (e.g., polyporic acid,
1877<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref></sup>). Over the intervening period, both
article layout (e.g., structure representation) and style (e.g., phraseology
and terminology) have changed significantly, making it difficult to
define rules for text mining across the full scientific literature.
In addition, natural products science is an international discipline,
and discoveries are reported in a broad range of languages beyond
English, which limits options for text-based article prioritization.
Finally, many of the early journal articles are either unavailable
or are only available as images, making them unsuited for automated
data extraction.</p>
    <p>Natural product structures have been reported
in a broad cross-section
of journals, broadening the search scope substantially. Further, despite
the excellent coverage provided by PubChem, ChEMBL, ChemSpider, and
other resources, not all structures are currently available in open
access structure repositories. When combined with issues of structure
misassignment, structure reassignment, synonym creation, and taxonomic
revision, it is perhaps clear why no such database is currently publicly
available.</p>
    <p>In order to address this issue, we have created a
new automated
curation platform designed to identify articles related to natural
products discovery and extract the relevant information for final
manual verification (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref></xref> and <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acscentsci.9b00806/suppl_file/oc9b00806_si_001.pdf">Supporting Information</ext-link>). From
this curation effort, we have extracted 24 594 compounds from
10 481 journal articles spanning 306 journal titles. These
results were inserted into a MySQL relational database, and an interactive
online web portal was created to permit searching, filtering, and
visualization of the data set. This online knowledge base contains
a growing fraction of published microbial natural products and is
designed to encourage additional data deposition and curation from
the natural products community. To this end, we have incorporated
online tools for new data deposition and the correction of existing
data. It is hoped that this community-driven model will help to ensure
that the data are of high quality, will improve the database in terms
of overall coverage, and will assist with the long-term sustainability
of this resource.</p>

      <title>The Structure of the Natural Products Atlas</title>
      <p>The Natural
Products Atlas project aimed to create a comprehensive database of
all microbially derived natural products and to make this database
freely accessible to the research community. The long-term vision
for the database is to include:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Both primary literature and patents</p></list-item><list-item><p>All microbial natural product structures, compound names,
and synonyms</p></list-item><list-item><p>Physicochemical data (optical
rotation, infrared, and
ultraviolet absorptions and direct links to nuclear magnetic resonance
and mass spectrometry databases)</p></list-item><list-item><p>Bioactivity
data</p></list-item><list-item><p>All instances of total synthesis</p></list-item><list-item><p>All structural reassignments</p></list-item><list-item><p>Taxonomy for the original producing organism</p></list-item><list-item><p>Full list of all producing organisms</p></list-item></list></p>
      <p>In addition, the database should comply with the requirements
that:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>All data are fully referenced</p></list-item><list-item><p>Entries include the original isolation paper for each
compound (first instance where complete structure reported)</p></list-item><list-item><p>Curation and optimization should be community-driven</p></list-item><list-item><p>The data be open access and fully downloadable</p></list-item></list></p>
      <p>In this initial release, we have accomplished many of
these goals,
while reserving others for future expansion. Specifically, we have
focused on data from the primary scientific literature covering the
period 1941–2018. Currently, these entries include both original
isolation name and the original published taxonomy for the producing
organism. With contributions from a large group of volunteer curators,
we have incorporated ∼25 000 microbial natural product
structures from this period. To be of the highest value, the Natural
Products Atlas should be related to other natural products data resources.
We have invested significant curation effort to generate accurate
links between the Natural Products Atlas and both MIBiG (a biosynthetic
gene cluster database) and GNPS (a database of mass spectrometry data
for natural products). In addition, we have incorporated references
to instances of total synthesis for Natural Products Atlas entries,
as well as instances of structure reassignment through synthesis or
reisolation.</p>
      <sec id="sec2.2.1">
        <title>Compound Selection</title>
        <p>There is likely no single definition
of “natural product” that would satisfy all researchers
in the field. Nevertheless, we required a set of guiding principles
for compound inclusion in order to construct the Natural Products
Atlas. For this application, “natural product” was defined
as any naturally occurring metabolite with a molecular weight less
than 3000 Da produced by a microorganism. Primary metabolites, as
defined by the KEGG database,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref></sup> were excluded.
Shunt products from biosynthetic gene clusters were included if detected
in wild-type organisms, but excluded if only found through genetic
manipulation. Compounds derived from augmenting fermentation media
with biosynthetic feedstocks were included if those feedstocks could
plausibly have been found in nature (e.g., proteinogenic amino acids)
but excluded if of synthetic origin (e.g., <italic>p</italic>-fluoro-phenylalanine).
Finally, compounds produced by biotransformation (modification of
a purified natural product by microbial fermentation with a different
organism) were excluded.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec2.2.2">
        <title>Taxonomic Boundaries</title>
        <p>The definition of microorganism
was also complicated by a number of edge cases. We elected to include
natural products from both lichens and macroscopic fungi (Basidiomycetes)
as both are classified as fungi in most modern taxonomic ontologies.
We included cyanobacteria, but excluded eukaryotic phytoplankton and
other photosynthetic microalgae. Further, some taxonomic assignments
have changed over time, meaning that the genus and species reported
in the original literature have now been reassigned. Currently, the
Natural Products Atlas contains taxonomic assignments as originally
defined. A future goal is to align these taxonomic assignments with
the Integrated Taxonomic Identification System (ITIS; <uri xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="http://www.itis.gov">www.itis.gov</uri>). This would provide
automatic updates to species assignments and would improve interoperability
with other taxonomy-based resources.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec2.2.3">
        <title>Natural Products Atlas Structure</title>
        <p>The Natural Products
Atlas knowledge base is divided into three main sections: Search,
Explore, and Discover (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>). The search pages (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>A) provide several different searching modalities and
are designed to prioritize ease of use and flexibility. The basic
search page permits rapid searching using a range of terms including
structure, name, taxonomy, and so on. Substructure and similarity
structure searching are both enabled, allowing researchers to dereplicate
isolated compounds based on partial structures, or compare new compounds
to the structural diversity of the known natural products world. The
advanced search page allows more complex Boolean searches (e.g., molecular
weight range <italic>x</italic> and date range <italic>y</italic>)
and permits combinations of structure and text criteria. Results from
these searches are displayed in paginated tables online or can be
exported for offline use. For example, if a researcher is studying
a given genus and wishes to create a compound reference library in
a proprietary software package (e.g., LCMS software), they can search
the genus name in the basic search page and then export the full results
set as a single file.</p>

        <p>The Explore section (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>B) provides different viewpoints on chemical
similarity in
natural products chemical space. Four levels of resolution are provided:
compound, cluster, node, and global. This visualization is analogous
to views of house, town, province, and globe in mapping applications
like Google Maps. The compound page (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref></xref>A) provides detailed information about each
individual compound and includes export of various data types (compound
MDL MOLfile, compound image, full TSV file for all compound data).
This page also provides citations for the original isolation reference,
instances of total synthesis, and instances of structural reassignment,
each of which is accompanied by a DOI hyperlink to the journal article
page.</p>

        <p>The cluster pages (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref></xref>B) present groups of compounds in the Natural
Products Atlas
with close structural similarities. Structural similarity is defined
by Morgan fingerprinting (radius = 2) and Dice similarity scoring
(0.75 cutoff). This tool allows users to easily visualize the scope
and diversity of similar structures in the data set. The next visualization
layer, nodes, illustrates how clusters are related to one another
at the level of compound class. These relationships are determined
by taking the most interconnected member of each cluster and then
scoring structural similarities between these cluster representatives
using a less stringent similarity scoring method (Atom pairs fingerprinting
and Dice similarity scoring (0.7 cutoff)). In the node networks (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref></xref>C), node diameter
is proportional to the number of compounds in each node. Finally,
the global view (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref></xref>D) presents all of the nodes in the Natural Products Atlas, arrayed
as a spherical plot. The distribution of nodes in this spherical plot
is an extension of van Krevelen diagrams,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref></sup> which represent molecules using C:H and C:O ratios from their molecular
formulas. In the global plot, the C:H ratio defines the polar angle
(the radial value in the xy-plane), the C:O ratio defines the azimuth
value (the angle with the <italic>z</italic>-axis), and the C:N ratio
sets the radius (distance from the origin). Because these three properties
are typically similar for molecules of the same compound class, nodes
cluster in the global view based on compound type. Importantly, this
coordinate system is dependent on compound physical properties, so
the positions of existing nodes will not change as new data are added
to the Natural Products Atlas over time.</p>
        <p>All the layers of the
Explore section are interconnected, so that
users can navigate between viewpoints from compound through to global
(<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref></xref>). Node highlighting
has been implemented to illustrate the position of compounds of interest
in the plots. For example, if a user starts on a compound page (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref></xref>A) and navigates
from there to the corresponding cluster (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref></xref>B), the position in the cluster network corresponding
to the original compound is highlighted in red. This highlighting
tracks through both node (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref></xref>C) and global (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref></xref>D) views, which helps users navigate these representations
of the natural product chemical space.</p>
        <p>In addition, search results
can be projected onto the global view,
illustrating the distribution of compound subsets in global chemical
space. For example, functional group prevalence and distribution can
be visualized by searching this group in the basic search structure
section, and clicking the “project all results to global view”
button on the results page. This generates a global visualization
where every node containing this functional group is highlighted in
red. A substructure search for compounds containing a pyridine motif
returns 791 compounds, whose distributions in chemical space can be
displayed by projection to the global view (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref></xref>). Similar visualizations can be generated
for any combination of search terms, making this a versatile tool
for examining distributions of structural or taxonomic phenomena across
microbial natural products chemical space.</p>

        <p>The Discover section (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>C) is a suite of dashboards designed to present
alternative
viewpoints on natural products diversity. Currently the Natural Products
Atlas contains three dashboards: Overview, Author, and Known Compound.
The Overview dashboard provides general statistics about the contents
and distribution of compounds and taxonomy in the database. The Author
dashboard retrieves all linked publications for a given author from
the ORCID database (<uri xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://orcid.org">https://orcid.org</uri>), and displays information about the compounds discovered in these
publications, including discovery timelines, distribution of journals,
and compound and citation links. The Known Compound dashboard presents
an overview of pertinent data for compounds currently in the database,
including timelines of discovery for cluster members and structures
of related compounds.</p>
        <p>It is envisioned that this section of
the Web site will grow over
time, as users request dashboards presenting alternative viewpoints
on the data. For example, dashboards incorporating dereplication tools
from mass spectrometry or nuclear magnetic resonance data are possible
and could conceivably be of high value to the natural products community
for rapidly identifying candidate structures from spectral data.</p>

      <sec id="sec2.2.4">
        <title>The Open Data Model</title>
        <p>Open data principles are central
to the design of the Natural Products Atlas. Committing to the open
data model was critical to recruiting volunteer curators and getting
buy-in from the natural products community. In line with these principles,
the database is covered by a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International
license and all data can be downloaded as a single flat file. Alternatively,
results from searches can be downloaded as selected data files to
permit simple data filtering, and data for individual compounds can
be downloaded directly from the compound page in a standard format.
The web interface is designed to be easy for other resources to link
to. To facilitate the creation of links to individual pages, each
compound page URL terminates in the Natural Products Atlas ID number
(NPAID), making it straightforward to automate the generation of hyperlinks.
Further, all pages on the Web site are open and do not require login
credentials, with the exception of pages for data deposition.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec2.2.5">
        <title>Database Versioning</title>
        <p>The Natural Products Atlas infrastructure
includes support for database versioning. This is important because
the addition of new compounds can impact both the contents and numbering
of compound clusters and nodes. For example, addition of a new hybrid
structure may create a link between two clusters that were previously
separate. This could conceivably be very frustrating for researchers
in the middle of a complex study using these data. To address this,
the Web site presents the most recent data by default but permits
users to specify any previous database version through a dropdown
menu. It is also possible to download any of the previous versions
of the database from the downloads section.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec2.2.6">
        <title>Database Construction</title>
        <p>The Natural Products Atlas database
was created by <italic>de novo</italic> searching of the primary literature
using a two-stage process. Initially, we selected 30 journals known
to contain articles reporting novel natural products discovery. A
simple scoring system was used to compare title and abstract text
against lists of positive and negative keywords. For example, “structure
elucidation” and “natural product” were positive
keywords, while “organometallic” and “essential
oil” were negative score drivers. In addition, we prioritized
any article containing one or more microbial genus names (excluding
common pathogens) on the basis that most of these chemistry articles
relate to natural products discovery. Articles that scored positively
were formatted for manual review using an in-house curation software
tool, and corrected to ensure that compound names, structures, source
organisms and citation information were accurate for each article.
Using this approach, the team reviewed ∼30 000 articles
by hand to create an initial set of 12 924 compounds. Manual
review of selected journal years suggested that this method captured
∼80% of all relevant articles.</p>
        <p>This initial manual curation
effort yielded a large training set of article titles and abstracts,
divided into two groups; articles pertaining to natural products discovery,
and those unrelated to natural products isolation. This training set
is well suited for use in machine learning applications. Using a Support
Vector Machine (SVM) model, we scanned titles and abstracts from 90
priority journals (1941–2018) to identify articles describing
microbial natural products discovery. Compound names were extracted
from titles and abstracts using an in-house text mining tool and the
associated chemical structures extracted from public databases (PubChem,
ChEMBL, ChemSpider) where available. Finally, CrossRef was used to
confirm citation and DOI information, and the full data for each article
was reviewed manually using an in-house online curation platform.
Following this approach, we reviewed a further 14 700 articles,
yielding a total of 13 236 compounds. To augment this data
set, we performed manual searches based on common compound names,
priority genera, and targeted authors. These searches filled in gaps
in the data set (e.g., incomplete compound families) and captured
compounds in journals not included in our original set of 90 titles.

      </sec>
      <sec id="sec2.2.7">
        <title>Data Validation</title>
        <p>Prior to insertion into the Natural
Products Atlas, all data are validated to ensure data standardization
and eliminate data duplication. This validation tool contains over
30 checks, including citation validation (e.g., is the journal name
contained in the list of allowed journal names?), taxonomic validation
(does this genus belong to the validated list of bacterial or fungal
genera in the List of Prokaryotic names with Standing in Nomenclature
(LPSN)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref></sup> or MycoBank?<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref></sup>) and structure validation (is this structure already present
in the database?). Structure validation is particularly important,
as the same structure can be present in the literature with different
synonyms and different levels of configurational assignment. Without
careful review, these structures would be entered as independent entries,
erroneously increasing the number of entries in the database. For
additional details about data validation, see <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acscentsci.9b00806/suppl_file/oc9b00806_si_001.pdf">Supporting Information</ext-link>.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec2.2.8">
        <title>Natural Product Atlas Identification Numbers</title>
        <p>Articles
that pass the validation step are inserted into the database, and
each new compound is assigned a unique Natural Products Atlas Identification
number (NPAID). These NPAIDs provide a fixed reference for each natural
product that is independent of structure, taxonomy, or citation data.
This is an important element of the Natural Products Atlas infrastructure,
as it means that links to compounds can be maintained even if core
information, such as structure or taxonomy, is updated or corrected.
This improves interoperability with other resources, and provides
a stable point of reference to each compound that will be preserved
as the database expands.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec2.2.9">
        <title>Connectivity with Other Natural Products Databases</title>
        <p>Numerous online repositories now exist that contain data related
to microbial natural products. For example, in the area of biosynthesis,
the Minimum Information about a Biosynthetic Gene cluster database
(MIBiG) contains data on ∼1800 biosynthetic gene clusters and
their associated natural products. This repository includes links
to relevant manuscripts describing these gene clusters and includes
tools to highlight other related gene clusters in the database. In
the area of analytical chemistry, the Global Natural Products Social
molecular networking database (GNPS) contains mass spectrometry and
fragmentation data for a large number of natural products-based data
sets and incorporates a growing suite of tools for comparing spectra
between samples and the de novo prediction of fragmentation spectra.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, in many cases, the integration between independent
natural products resources is poor. This is due to both variations
in compound content between databases and to challenges with standardization
of compound structures and trivial names. The Natural Products Atlas
has collaborated with the developers of both MIBiG and GNPS to standardize
structure representations between the three platforms, and to create
bidirectional links to each database. Compounds which have entries
in either platform display links to the respective databases on the
compound page. In addition, the Natural Products Atlas data can be
searched and filtered to include only compounds that have entries
in one or both of these databases using terms in the Advanced Search
section. It is envisioned that future releases of the Atlas will include
links to a wider array of external databases including, for example,
NMR spectra, biological activity data, or biogeographic information
about compound collections.</p>

    </sec>
    <sec id="sec2.3">
      <title>The Value of the Natural Products Atlas</title>
      <p>Rather than
presenting a static list of natural product structures, the Natural
Products Atlas is designed to offer users an interactive portal for
natural products discovery. As data sets increase in size, methods
for data filtering and visualization have a greater and greater impact
on interpretation. The user interface for the Natural Products Atlas
contains a suite of visualizations that we envisage will provide value
to the natural products community by presenting compounds and search
results from a variety of different perspectives. The expectation
is that these tools will enable new modes of discovery in a range
of subject areas, including natural products isolation, medicinal
chemistry, and computational predictions for natural products spectral
data.</p>
      <p>For natural products isolation, the basic search page
can be used to rapidly dereplicate compounds based on spectral characteristics.
The data set can be filtered by accurate mass values (from mass spectrometry)
or the presence of one or more functional groups (from NMR or MS/MS
data). If the source organism is known, these results can be filtered
on the basis of taxonomy, either by selecting only bacterial or fungal
compounds, or by restricting results to a specific genus. If more
than one genus is required, the Advanced Search page provides an expanded
set of options for building more complex queries.</p>
      <p>The structure-based
search pane can be used in several different
modalities. Structures can be directly compared to the existing data
set using the Full Structure option. If chiral centers are defined,
then results are restricted to direct matches. If chiral centers are
left undefined, then all molecules with the same planar structure
are returned as candidate matches. Substructure searching is available
through the Substructure option. This option permits one or more substructures
to be included in a single query, allowing users to identify candidate
matching structures from partial NMR structural information. Finally,
structurally related compounds can be identified using the Similarity
Threshold option. This option is valuable for placing new discoveries
in context with known natural product chemical space. For example,
compounds that have few or no matches to known natural products even
with a low similarity threshold cutoff might be of higher priority
for biosynthetic investigation than compounds with large numbers of
closely related analogues.</p>
      <p>This concept of positioning in chemical
space can be further explored
using the tools in the Explore section. For example, if a known compound
(e.g., guanacastepene E,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref></sup> NPAID 2040)
is identified in a discovery project, the Cluster page can be used
to determine other known natural products with close structural similarity
in the same cluster (cluster 1223, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref></xref>A). Switching to the Node view (Node 198, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref></xref>B) reveals that this
group of compounds is also related to many other structures, some
closely (e.g., Cluster 593) and others more distantly (e.g., Cluster
504). Searching for Node 198 in the advanced search page affords a
downloadable results table that includes relevant data for all the
members of this node, including structures, taxonomy, and isolation
references, permitting a more detailed evaluation of the relevant
existing literature. This search modality is different to the results
that would be obtained from a simple similarity search. The Node view
includes “chaining” of clusters to highlight compounds
with more distant structural relationships that are returned from
similarity searches. This highlights common structural motifs and
sites of variation within the full set of known microbial natural
products, providing a more comprehensive view of related microbial
natural product chemical space.</p>

      </fig>
      <p>The Natural Products Atlas also offers a number
of valuable resources
for medicinal chemists. At the simplest level, substructure searching
can be used to identify compounds containing pharmacophore features
of interest. Compounds can also be filtered on the basis of reports
of total synthesis, highlighting molecules for which synthetic routes
already exist or clusters of compounds for which no total synthesis
has yet been reported. In situations where a specific compound has
been identified as of interest for further development, the cluster
and node views can be used to explore natural variations in structural
features and, where published activity data exists, explore SAR features
by compound class. Finally, data from the Natural Products Atlas can
be used to identify areas of chemical space <italic>not</italic> occupied
by a particular compound class. This information could be used to
design non-natural diversity libraries around specific scaffolds or
to create natural product mimics containing features and functional
groups not encountered in these classes in the natural world.</p>
      <p>Lastly, this database offers a valuable reference set for tools
designed to predict spectral properties of natural products. For example,
data sets containing predicted NMR chemical shifts or MS/MS fragmentation
patterns could be used to improve annotation of unknown metabolites
from complex mixtures. Indeed, the data from the Natural Products
Atlas have already been incorporated into the network Annotation Propagation
tool in GNPS with planned support for other in silico tools including
DEREPLICATOR and DEREPLICATOR+.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref></sup> These
tools predict compound identities from mass spectrometry fragmentation
data by comparing experimental fragmentation patterns to those predicted
from compound structure libraries. The inclusion of structures from
the Natural Products Atlas increases the coverage of available chemical
space, improving the percentage of known compounds with theoretical
fragmentation spectra in the reference set. In an analogous future
direction, detailed knowledge about the distribution and grouping
of functional groups for different biosynthetic classes of natural
products could prove valuable in predicting the functions of hypothetical
proteins in biosynthetic gene clusters and for relating biosynthetic
gene clusters and compound classes in large genome sequencing projects.</p>

        <title>Maintenance and Future Expansion</title>
        <p>Community involvement
is critical to the long-term viability of the Natural Products Atlas.
Currently the database is growing at a rate of ∼1200 compounds
per year, mostly through curation efforts by the authors of this manuscript.
We hope that, as the profile of the Natural Products Atlas increases,
users will be incentivized to deposit new compounds because of the
annotation tools available in the platform. In order to facilitate
user contributions, we have created a Deposit page where researchers
can easily upload data from new articles. Deposition requires only
the article DOI, compound names, SMILES structures, and the genus
and species of the producing organism. We expect that most articles
can be deposited in under 5 min, provided that authors have the structure
files available. Similarly, we have created pages for reporting corrections
and additions to existing entries. These pages each require fewer
than five pieces of information and include both text and structure
drawing tools as options for reporting structural corrections where
required.</p>
        <p>In addition to the incorporation of new compounds,
ongoing effort is required to improve the coverage of the historical
literature. To extend our coverage in this area, we continue to create
targeted tools for highlighting missing compounds. For example, the
names of compounds in the existing database can be used to identify
missing members from compound series (e.g., salinipostins A–K)
which can then be targeted for literature searching. To complement
this effort, we are exploring options to integrate data from related
databases from academia and industry to improve the coverage of compounds
from previous decades.</p>
        <p>In addition to the expansion of the database,
we aim to increase
both the types of data included in the Natural Products Atlas, and
the range of tools available for data analysis. This effort is part
of our ongoing development of the platform with input from a wide
range of stakeholders. Possible future expansions include:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Extension of taxonomic classifications to include higher
designations (phylum, order, etc.)</p></list-item><list-item><p>Addition
of biosynthetic class assignments</p></list-item><list-item><p>Increased
coverage of the patent literature</p></list-item><list-item><p>Increasing
the number and variety of Discover dashboards</p></list-item><list-item><p>Increased coverage of structure reassignment and total
synthesis data</p></list-item><list-item><p>Creation of a full application
programming interface
(API)</p></list-item></list></p>
        <p>Both the MySQL database and the JavaScript front-end
have been
designed with scalability in mind. The infrastructure is therefore
already in place to extend the content beyond microbial natural products.
With appropriate resources and sufficient community involvement, the
Natural Products Atlas would be well-positioned to incorporate natural
products from marine invertebrates and ultimately plant natural products.</p>

    <title>Conclusions</title>
    <p>The Natural Products Atlas is the first
fully open access knowledge
base of microbial natural product structures build on FAIR principles.
It contains a suite of interactive visualization tools to explore
the chemical diversity of microbial natural products and is fully
searchable and downloadable, permitting researchers to query and filter
the data from a wide array of different perspectives. The base frameworks
for both data curation and online visualization are scalable and could
readily be extended to other classes of source organisms. We hope
that the Natural Products Atlas will become a central point of reference
for tools and resources that pertain to microbial natural product
structures and that this will catalyze the integration of data sets
that focus on a wide array of attributes of natural products.</p>
