      <title>Abstract</title>
      <p>To understand the molecular pathogenesis of human disease, precision analyses to define alterations within and between disease-associated cell populations are desperately needed. Single-cell genomics represents an ideal platform to enable the identification and comparison of normal and diseased transcriptional cell populations. We created cellHarmony, an integrated solution for the unsupervised analysis, classification, and comparison of cell types from diverse single-cell RNA-Seq datasets. cellHarmony efficiently and accurately matches single-cell transcriptomes using a community-clustering and alignment strategy to compute differences in cell-type specific gene expression over potentially dozens of cell populations. Such transcriptional differences are used to automatically identify distinct and shared gene programs among cell-types and identify impacted pathways and transcriptional regulatory networks to understand the impact of perturbations at a systems level. cellHarmony is implemented as a python package and as an integrated workflow within the software AltAnalyze. We demonstrate that cellHarmony has improved or equivalent performance to alternative label projection methods, is able to identify the likely cellular origins of malignant states, stratify patients into clinical disease subtypes from identified gene programs, resolve discrete disease networks impacting specific cell-types, and illuminate therapeutic mechanisms. Thus, this approach holds tremendous promise in revealing the molecular and cellular origins of complex disease.</p>

    <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
    <p>Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-Seq) provides the unique ability to profile transcripts from diverse cell populations along a continuum of related or disparate cell types (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). In addition to defining known and novel cell populations, single-cell technologies can identify disease-related gene regulatory programs which underlie molecular and cellular dysfunction. While diverse single-cell experimental platforms exist to facilitate such analyses, there is an urgent need for integrated and easy-to-use computational approaches to identify discrete differences between comparable diseased and healthy cells. Given that most scRNA-Seq analyses will potentially identify dozens of cell populations, such an exercise becomes non-trivial, as distinct cell populations will have different transcriptional, cellular, pathway and gene regulatory network impacts. Furthermore, cellular and molecular differences can occur in either a cell type-specific manner or across a spectrum of related cell populations, requiring new holistic analysis solutions. Given the complexity of the analyses required to achieve these goals, automated solutions that can be applied by both experienced bioinformaticians and conventional laboratory biologists are ultimately required.</p>
    <p>The development of workflows to provide disease-level insights requires reproducible mapping and comparison of single-cell transcriptomes across one or more samples. Two principal classes of algorithms are designed to align and compare scRNA-Seq datasets: (i) label projection and (ii) joint alignment. Label projection methods consider a reference scRNA-Seq dataset with already defined clusters as the basis for assigning those cell type annotations to new datasets. In the case of disease, the objective of such algorithms is to annotate perturbed cell states according to their most closely related normal equivalents, without considering novel cell populations observed uniquely in disease. A number of algorithms have been recently developed to perform this objective including scmap, Seurat3, conos, Garnett, CHETAH and SingleCellNet (see Table <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">1</xref> for a comparison of features and methods) (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2–6</xref>). Notable among these tools are conos and Seurat, which enable the downstream comparison of cell-populations using differential expression analyses. A potential limitation of this analysis for conos is that two individual datasets cannot be compared by this method, as it requires biological replicate scRNA-Seq experiments for analysis with DESeq2. While Seurat enables the direct comparison of cells within the same population across conditions (differential expression analysis), it currently provides no means to integrate these results over potentially dozens of cell populations or prioritize impacts within specific cell types to obtain systems-level insights.</p>

    <p>In contrast to label projection, joint-alignment methods simultaneously align similar cells into to common or distinct clusters independent of batch, donor, or other technical effects. Such tools include conos and Seurat 3 (which perform both label projection and joint-alignment), Biscuit, LIGER, Scanorama, scMerge, scVI and Harmony (Table <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">1</xref>) (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7–12</xref>). As such, these tools can identify similar cell populations that occur in independent datasets, highly distinct cell populations that are unique to one dataset or cell type which potentially represent divergent lineage programs. While in principle such methods would appear to be a more appropriate for comparing healthy and disease states, there are a number of important caveats that can potentially limit the use of joint-alignment methods over those for label projection. Firstly, label projection methods are designed to explicitly align disease cell types to appropriately similar healthy states, whereas joint-clustering methods will often produce overly specialized clusters in which separate disease and healthy clusters are obtained for the same cell type (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13–15</xref>). In such cases, no direct correspondence to diseased cell states and normal will be provided, hindering their direct comparison. Second, healthy references can include curated cell states or clusters, in which cell types have been initially defined, rather than redefining such cell populations through joint clustering. Indeed, it is most appropriate to annotate cell populations in healthy rather than disease, in which known cell type gene expression programs are have already been defined. Thirdly, for studies in which new samples such as diseased tissues are accrued over time, it is challenging to continuously re-annotate datasets with the addition of new samples using joint-alignment, which inherently rederives clusters in each new analysis. Although label projection remains a potentially powerful approach to compare scRNA-Seq datasets using unperturbed references, several challenges remain. First, it is unclear whether disease cell states contain core cell-type identity programs to enable accurate alignment to healthy references. Once aligned, accurate means for automated gene expression comparison are needed. Finally, no existing single-cell approaches organize and order gene expression changes to highlight differences that are unique to one cell type or shared across multiple related or dissimilar cell types.</p>
    <p>Herein, we describe a new approach called cellHarmony, which provides the unique ability to obtain a unified systems-level view of molecular, cellular, pathway, and network-level differences between all aligned query and reference cell populations in an automated manner. This workflow performs three essential steps: (i) label projection of one scRNA-Seq dataset onto another, (ii) pairwise molecular and cellular comparisons of all aligned cell types and (iii) systems-level functional and regulatory analyses (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). This program is implemented as stand-alone alignment python package and is integrated into the software AltAnalyze for more streamlined scRNA-Seq analysis (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). We observe that in comparable disease and normal datasets, the cellular-identity programs (core genes) are retained, providing an appropriate reference for secondary comparison analyses. For label projection, cellHarmony creates a k-nearest neighbor graph of each sample to match similar sample communities (Louvain clustering) and then directly matches the cells within those communities. This strategy enables the fast alignment of similar small communities without biasing the alignment to outliers. When compared to other label projection approaches, cellHarmony results in improved alignment accuracy. Once aligned, clusters or cell-type names from one dataset can be mapped onto another and placed within a continuum of differentiation. These data are integrated and jointly visualized in multiple formats. To identify the precise impact of genetic, chemical, disease, or other perturbation, cellHarmony extracts cell type-specific differences (cell frequency and gene expression), finds, organizes, and visualizes co-regulated cell populations, examines the pathway-level impact on distinct gene modules, and produces putative gene-regulatory networks based on prior knowledge. Through seamless integration within AltAnalyze, users can jointly perform the unsupervised analysis of extremely large scRNA-Seq datasets using the algorithm Iterative Clustering and Guide-gene Selection (ICGS, version 2) prior to alignment, with little to no required bioinformatics expertise (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Automation becomes a necessary step in these analyses, where dozens of cell populations are likely present in large single-cell RNA-seq datasets. Using this approach, we are able to effectively recapitulate previously observed disease genetic and cellular observations from models of cardiac ischemia and Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML), determine the developmental origins of malignancy, identify novel prognostic disease biomarkers in AML, determine the cellular specificity of previously described drug targets and propose novel gene regulatory networks in these diseases.</p>

        <p>Integrated and automated holistic discovery of cell population-specific perturbations. Illustrated automated workflow of the cellHarmony analysis pipeline. (<bold>A</bold>) Small and large (&gt;100k cell) scRNA-Seq datasets can be pre-processed in the parent software AltAnalyze (expression scaling, outlier exclusion) for the query and reference dataset. Raw data can be input from multiple file formats (Methods). Both query and reference can be individual samples or combined collections (joined and analyzed or merged post unsupervised analysis with the cellHarmonyMerge function). The default unsupervised clustering population prediction method in AltAnalyze is ICGS version 2.0 (ICGS-NMF output), which provides different input options (population marker genes or guide-gene correlated results). (<bold>B</bold>) Alignment of individual cells from the query to the reference is accomplished through community clustering of each dataset, following the creation of a k-nearest neighbor graph in each dataset. Prior to matching cells, Louvain partitions (cluster centroids) are matched between datasets to define the nearest neighborhoods (Pearson coefficient). Labels provided for the reference clusters (stem cell, macrophage…) can be provided as alternatives to cluster labels (c1,c2,c3…), based on the ICGS cluster cell-type predictions (curated by the user). (<bold>C</bold>) Query cells that meet a minimum correlation threshold (Pearson coefficient &gt; 0.4, default) are placed adjacent to their aligned reference cell in the ICGS heatmap and projected into a common UMAP coordinate space to determine the mixing of cells and qualitative transcriptomic differences. (<bold>D</bold>) Quantitative transcriptome differences between query and reference cells are computed using a multi-step differential expression analysis between matched cell clusters and (<bold>E</bold>) population proportion differences reported (Fishers Exact test). (<bold>F</bold>) Gene-level statistical differences are used to identify the most similar impacted cell clusters (co-regulated), defined by comparing the frequency of genes similar patterns of regulation from a binarized <italic>P</italic>-value and fold-change matrix. Genes with expression best described by global regulation (impacted across all cell populations), co-regulated clusters (regional) or that are most restricted in their differences to specific cell clusters (local) are ordered statistically in a combined heatmap (left). Integrated with this heatmap are statistically enriched pathways and transcription-factor targets to determine the perturbation-specific impacts along a continuum of related and distinct cell populations. Putative transcriptional regulatory and curated protein-protein interaction networks are derived from each cell population or co-regulated comparison to identify likely regulators and their targets among these impacted populations (right).</p>

        <p>cellHarmony is compatible with Python 2.7 and is distributed as dedicated python source code for the community clustering alignment algorithm (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/AltAnalyze/cellHarmony-Align">https://github.com/AltAnalyze/cellHarmony-Align</ext-link>) and as a component of the software AltAnalyze (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/nsalomonis/altanalyze">https://github.com/nsalomonis/altanalyze</ext-link>). AltAnalyze is an easy-to-use data analysis toolkit that provides both automated workflows (e.g. RNA-Seq raw data processing, alternative splicing, scRNA-Seq unsupervised analysis, microarray analysis) and separate à la cart analyses through the command-line and a dedicated graphical-user-interface. This code is supported for Linux, Mac, and Windows, using computers with a minimum of 8GB of RAM (16GB+ recommended). Additional documentation, optional R pre-processing scripts (for Seurat input references), and tutorial videos are available from: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.altanalyze.org/cellHarmony">http://www.altanalyze.org/cellHarmony</ext-link>. When run through AltAnalyze, cellHarmony works seamlessly with the embedded unsupervised analysis software, Iterative Clustering and Guide-gene Selection (ICGS) version 2 as input (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). To run cellHarmony through the AltAnalyze graphical user-interface, the user must start the program, select the appropriate species, select the Additional Analyses Menu and then Cell Classification Menu. Pre-compiled graphical user-interface distributions are provided from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://altanalyze.org">http://altanalyze.org</ext-link> and the command-line version from GitHub or via installation from PyPI. Details regarding required and optional input files and additional information regarding the use of cellHarmony on a computational cluster are provided in Supplemental Information.</p>

        <title>Cell-alignment from community clustering</title>
        <p>To identify equivalent cell-types or cell-states from two independent scRNA-Seq datasets, cellHarmony employs a community clustering strategy to produce a network graph and define communities in both the reference and query dataset. In short, this approach initially matches communities of cells across samples and then selects the closest matching reference cell for each query cell, where a single reference cell can match to multiple query cells. This function performs the following steps:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p><italic>Define communities (partitions) within each of the datasets</italic>: Prior to defining communities, each dataset is restricted to the cell-population specific marker genes previously defined for the reference. When using ICGS version 2 unsupervised results (default), these markers are the top 50 cluster-specific marker genes for each cluster. The query and reference files are imported as Cell Ranger (10× Genomics, version 1.0–3.0 supported) sparse matrices (h5 or mtx) or as tabular input files (counts or scaled). By default, cellHarmony uses the ICGS-NMF produced output heatmap tab-delimited text file as its reference with log2 barcode normalized counts data (Supplemental Information – Input Data). Utilization of each of these inputs produces equivalent downstream results. From this sparse matrix data, the program identifies the <italic>k</italic>-nearest neighbors (<italic>k</italic> =10 by default) for each cell using the python package Annoy (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>) and creates a graph of these neighborhoods using the networkx python package. Once created, Louvain clustering is performed with the lowest possible resolution to find maximal partitions (<italic>r</italic> = 0). We denote the resulting communities of reference sample cells by {Cr<sub>1</sub>, Cr<sub>2</sub>, …, Cr<sub>s</sub>} and {Cq<sub>1</sub>, Cq<sub>2</sub>, …, Cq<sub>t</sub>} for the query sample communities.</p></list-item><list-item><p><italic>Find the closest matching communities between the query and reference</italic>: For each community in the reference sample (Cr<sub>i</sub>), a centroid mCr<sub>i</sub> is calculated from the constituent cells using a simple mean for each gene and likewise for each query sample community (mCq<sub>i</sub>).

The original cluster label (i.e. user-supplied label or ICGS/Seurat cluster number) assigned to the closest matching reference cell is then projected to the query cell. A new heatmap is created wherein every query cell is placed adjacent to its closest matching reference cell, reference cells being grouped by the original clustering (see Input Data). However, query cells with a Pearson alignment correlation coefficient lower than the user defined threshold (default = 0.4) are excluded from downstream combined data visualizations, differential expression, and system level prediction analyses. The result is a set of aligned cell populations wherein each cell population consists of all reference cells with a common label and any query cells with that label. We denote the set of aligned cell populations by {<italic>A<sub>k</sub></italic>, <italic>k</italic> = 1, …, <italic>K</italic>} where <italic>K</italic> is the number of ‘original’ clusters in the reference dataset. The relative frequency distribution of the (aligned) populations within the reference and query samples is compared using a series of <italic>K</italic> Fisher's exact tests. Alternative options for running these functions and performance are described in the Supplemental Information.</p></list-item></list></p>

        <title>Differential expression analysis</title>
        <p>To identify impacted genes, networks, and cellular processes across cell-populations, cellHarmony performs a differential expression (DE) analysis between each aligned query and reference cell population {<italic>A<sub>k</sub></italic>, <italic>k</italic> = 1, …, <italic>K</italic>}. Differential expression is performed using an empirical Bayes moderated <italic>t</italic>-test with Benjamini–Hochberg (BH) false discovery rate (FDR) correction applied separately within each cell-type population. An overall moderated t-test for each gene comparing the pooled query cells to pooled reference cells is also performed, with the BH correction applied. We denote the adjusted <italic>P</italic>-values from these analyses by {<italic>p</italic><sub>1</sub>, <italic>p</italic><sub>2</sub>, …, <italic>p<sub>K</sub></italic>} and <italic>p</italic><sub>O</sub> for the overall test. The default threshold for differential expression is fold &gt;1.5 and <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05 (FDR corrected). Users can modify these thresholds within the graphical user interface or from the command-line (Supplemental Information). This process is automated for cell populations in the two compared datasets that share the same provided or assigned labels between the reference and query, respectively. The K pairwise query-to-reference comparisons are performed for cell populations in which at least 20 cells are present from both the query and reference datasets. For datasets with fewer than 200 total cells (i.e. Fluidigm C1), this requirement is relaxed to 4 cells in each aligned cluster. The results are saved to tab-delimited text files with summary statistics and basic annotations, along with summary graphical outputs, and are used for downstream systems-level analyses.</p>

        <title>Systems-level predictions</title>
        <p>In comparisons where a molecular, genetic, or chemical perturbation results in abnormal cell biology, cellHarmony can be used to identify which cell populations are principally impacted in both cell frequency and gene expression. By examining the differences that are shared among different cell clusters and those that are unique to a specific cell clusters, cellHarmony enables the determination of holistic pathway and gene regulatory network impacts. Specifically, cellHarmony determines whether gene expression differences across cell clusters are global (impacted in most cell populations), local (i.e. cell cluster-specific), or co-regulated/regional (i.e. specific to a subset of cell clusters). Note that although some clusters can be excluded from the differential expression analysis due to insufficient cell population size (see above), we continue using the notation for the full set of aligned clusters {<italic>A<sub>k</sub></italic>: <italic>k</italic> = 1, …, <italic>K</italic>}.</p>
        <p>To assess global gene up- and down-regulation, the differential expression analysis is repeated for all query cells compared to all reference cells, regardless of the cluster to which they are aligned. Only genes for which <italic>p</italic><sub>O</sub> &lt; 0.05 and <italic>p</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> &lt; 0.05 for at least 2 {<italic>i</italic>:1, …, <italic>K</italic>}, with consistent direction of fold change, are considered as candidates for the globally up-regulated or globally down-regulated group, depending on the direction of the fold change. Genes that meet the DE criteria stated above <italic>for only one cell population</italic> form the local DE groups (i.e. <italic>p<sub>i</sub></italic> &lt; 0.05 for only one {<italic>i</italic>:1, …, <italic>K</italic>}) and represent cell cluster-specific profiles. To define additional predominant patterns of co-regulation (common effect among multiple but not all clusters) for each gene, the cell cluster-specific <italic>P</italic>-values comparing each query to reference cluster (<italic>A</italic><sub><italic>k</italic></sub>) are collected into a vector of length <italic>K</italic>. The vector is recoded to entries of 1, –1 or 0 as follows: 1 if <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.10 &amp; sgn(logfc) = 1, –1 if <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.10 &amp; sgn(logfc) = –1, 0 otherwise to indicate up-regulation (1), down-regulation (–1), or no significant alteration (0). The <italic>P</italic>-value threshold of 0.10 was chosen to provide increased sensitivity in clusters with small numbers of cells. For example, a gene with pattern [0,1,0,1] would represent co-regulated DE for clusters 2 and 4. The four most frequently occurring patterns of co-regulation (excluding global and cell cluster-specific patterns) are selected for an additional round of differential gene expression analyses, comparing query to reference cells in the resulting aggregated cells clusters. For example, if the top pattern is [1,1,0,0], a test of pooled clusters 1 &amp; 2 in the query will be compared to clusters 1 &amp; 2 in the reference scRNA-Seq dataset, yielding <italic>P</italic><sub>(co-reg)</sub>. Each gene from the cell cluster-specific comparisons (local), is then assigned to the specific comparison group (global, local, or co-regulated) in which they are most altered, based on the smallest <italic>P</italic>-value of all comparisons, i.e. among {<italic>p<sub>i</sub></italic>: <italic>i</italic> = 1, …, <italic>k</italic>, <italic>p</italic><sub>O</sub>, <italic>p</italic><sub>(co-reg)</sub>}. The final genes are limited to significant genes in the first cell cluster differential analysis, excluding new genes identified in the global or regional analysis, to prevent bias due to cell-type frequency variation in the query and reference (e.g. more B-cells in query versus reference, highlighting B-cell upregulated gene expression).</p>
        <p>To produce a unified representation of these differences, which can consist of dozens of differential expression comparisons, cellHarmony creates a combined heatmap with genes assigned to specific comparison groups. The cells in the heatmap are ordered by the original cell populations, with the genes ordered according to global, co-regulated, and local categorizations (p-value ranked), with up-regulated and down-regulated genes displayed as adjacent clusters. A gene set enrichment analysis is performed on the resultant gene clusters with the Pathway Commons database (human and mouse) or Gene Ontology (other species) (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). Putative gene regulatory relationships in these gene modules are predicted using a second gene set enrichment analysis with the TRRUST, PAZAR and Amadeus databases combined to identify likely upstream transcriptional regulators and highlight clustered embedded transcription factors (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). Finally, these gene regulatory networks are further visualized using the ‘igraph’ pathway library and these same transcription factor target databases for each comparison.</p>

      <p>To evaluate the agreement in label assignments for different label projection methods, we used the Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) as proposed by Hubert and Arabie (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>) using the R package ‘clues’ (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). Accuracy is assessed as the proportion of correct assigned labels for a given alignment algorithm, where perfect accuracy is defined as matching aligned and author assigned labels. To evaluate methods for differential expression analysis, we used type I error probability and false discovery rate (FDR), each assessed at a nominal error rate of 0.05 (5%), and statistical power (see Supplemental Information for definitions).</p>

    <title>RESULTS</title>
    <p>The cellHarmony pipeline was created to rapidly and accurately align comparable scRNA-Seq datasets to identify the global, regional, and local molecular impacts of diverse perturbations. For this purpose, cellHarmony uses a graph-based strategy to produce disjoint networks from a clustered single or combined reference against an un-clustered query (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">B</xref>). Alignment through community clustering provides three important advantages in the alignment of different scRNA-Seq datasets. First, individual cells can be quickly matched between large scRNA-Seq datasets by finding the most similar communities between datasets prior to matching individual cells in those partitions. Second, the produced alignments will be more stable than individual cell alignments which are inherently biased towards outlier cells. Finally, the alignment to cell centroids is highly reliant on the final cluster definitions, in which sub-clusters may be present or clusters inappropriately aggregated. Cell populations and cluster labels (e.g. cell-type names optionally provided by the user) in the reference can be automatically assigned using the embedded unsupervised algorithm Iterative Clustering and Guide-gene Selection (ICGS) (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>), which has been consistently shown to identify transitional cell states and exceedingly rare cell types from large scRNA-Seq datasets (ICGS-NMF output) (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25–29</xref>). While reference cell alignment is an important independent objective in many studies (i.e. developmental ordering of cells, cell-type identification), cellHarmony's primary innovation is the creation of systems-level models of cellular and transcriptional differences in discrete and co-regulated cell populations. The result is a global view of molecular perturbations across cell types to determine which cell-populations, associated pathways, and transcriptional networks are impacted. To achieve this aim, the software implements a unique comparison and aggregation approach to identify impacted gene and regulatory programs that may be restricted to individual cell clusters, shared more broadly between specific cell clusters, or that are common to all populations (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">F</xref>). Visualization of these organized gene modules allows for the determinations of which pathways and gene networks are playing important roles in which cell populations.</p>
    <sec id="SEC3-1">
      <title>Label projection performance</title>
      <p>To specifically evaluate the performance of cellHarmony relative to alternative label projection methods, we applied cellHarmony, conos, Seurat3, scmap, CHETAH and SingleCellNet to a large mouse cell atlas (MCA) dataset (Tabula Muris) with previously defined Cell Ontology classifications (n=46). This dataset includes 12 matched tissues profiled using two complementary scRNA-Seq technologies (10x Genomics and SMART-Seq2) and capture methods (unbiased versus Flow Cytometry). As such, cell-type definitions are considered highly rigorous, although additional undefined cell clusters are expected. It should be noted that another label projection method, Garnett, could not be evaluated as it requires unique genes for all evaluated cell populations, which is not the case for the 46 MCA cell-types (i.e. B-cells from different tissues) (Supplemental Information). Similarly, the algorithms RCA (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>) and MNN (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>) do not explicitly perform label projection and hence were also excluded (see Table <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">1</xref>, Supplemental Information). Although the two scRNA-Seq datasets generated by the Tabula Muris consortium were produced using independent single-cell methodologies, UMAP and heatmap projections of cellHarmony-aligned datasets indicate highly overlapping cell type projections for the major cell populations (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S1A, B</xref>). Using the Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) for alignment of the 10× Genomics query to the SMART-Seq2 reference to quantify similarity, community-based alignment in cellHarmony had improved similarity to the author-defined ground truth (ARI = 0.85) with high accuracy (83%), relative to conos (ARI = 0.81, accuracy = 81%), Seurat3 (ARI = 0.84, accuracy = 73%), scmap (ARI = 0.64, accuracy = 71%), CHETAH (ARI = 0.65, accuracy = 60%), and scNet (ARI = 0.66, accuracy = 70%) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). While cellHarmony was evaluated using markers selected from an unsupervised analysis (ICGS version 2), near identical results were obtained using MCA Ontology cell-population marker genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S1C</xref>). We find that mis-classifications from cellHarmony could largely be explained by alignment of cells with same or highly related cell-types across tissues (e.g. Muscle Macrophage as Trachea blood cell) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S1D</xref>). To determine the thresholds at which cellHarmony predictions fail to be accurate, we excluded two tissue-restricted cell populations that clearly separated out from other cell-types in the UMAP graph, liver hepatocyte and kidney collecting duct, and classified those cells back into the filtered reference dataset. These data indicate that cellHarmony is more likely to produce true positive alignments above a Pearson correlation &gt;0.3 (default cutoff &gt;0.4), with alignments below that range indicating likely false positive associations for cells from the same technological platform (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>). Hence, cellHarmony is accurate across technological platforms to yield high precision cell population alignments for the downstream identification of cell population-specific impacts.</p>

      <title>Cell population comparison of differential expression</title>
      <p>To obtain higher order insights, cellHarmony requires an effective method to determine gene expression differences when comparing query cells to reference cell clusters. For such comparisons, it is expected that the end-user identifies any possible batch-effects and corrects for them as needed prior to performing cellHarmony. For differential expression analysis, cellHarmony applies an empirical Bayes (eBayes) moderated t-test method (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). We speculated that this computationally efficient method would be appropriate for scRNA-Seq datasets in which a high degree of missing values is present, as it moderates the standard error towards a common value. To verify the performance of this method with scRNA-Seq, we compared eBayes to three algorithms frequently applied for scRNA-Seq differential expression analysis (MAST, SCDE and Wilcoxon) using simulated data (splatter package) in addition to matched single-cell and bulk RNA-Seq data (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S2A</xref>, Supplemental Information). Compared to alternative algorithms, we find eBayes can accurately identify cell-type-specific differences in gene expression in scRNA-Seq data with statistical power comparable to state-of-the art algorithms (e.g. MAST), while providing Type I and FDR error control at a nominal 5% levels (mean observed Type I error rate across the five replicates of 0.039 and 0.44 for 50 and 100 cells per group, respectively, and likewise 0.025 and 0.034 for FDR). Application of eBayes to scRNA-Seq with matched bulk RNA-Seq (B-cells versus T-cells), identified a nearly identical proportion of bulk RNA-Seq verified differentially expressed genes as MAST and SCDE (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S2B</xref>).</p>

      <title>Using cellHarmony to identify disease gene networks</title>
      <p>To evaluate the ability of cellHarmony to discover known and novel cell-population impacts, we applied this tool to four scRNA-Seq collections, spanning three technologies (Fluidigm, DropSeq, 10× Genomics) and two diseases (myocardial infarction and Acute Myeloid Leukemia). For both diseases, we selected datasets with comparable bulk RNA-Seq data as a means to validate the observed gene expression differences. Notably, many well-defined drug targets and key driver gene expression changes are already known for both diseases.</p>
      <p>Myocardial infarction (MI), commonly known as a heart attack, is the leading cause of death in developed countries. While decades of transcriptomic analyses have revealed the global impact on cardiac tissue, little is known about the specific impacts to individual cell populations. We performed Drop-Seq on a mouse model of MI and age-matched controls with sham surgery. MI is known to result in large global gene expression changes associated with cell death, cellular infiltration, and injury induced cellular remodeling that make its comparison to controls complex (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). Applying cellHarmony to Seurat clustering of the Sham references finds that, while all cell populations present in the healthy heart are present in the diseased, MI results in gene expression changes that shift the location of cell populations within the combined UMAP graph (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">B</xref>). Specifically, visualization of the aligned MI cells within the cellHarmony heatmap shows that fibroblasts adopts a weak combined smooth muscle, epicardial, and endothelial gene expression program (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S3A</xref>). Further, MI results in a loss of endothelial cells and gain in infiltrating macrophages (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>). It should be noted that joint-alignment using Seurat (version 3) dataset integration finds cell clusters that are restricted to Sham (endothelial) or MI (fibroblasts) that represent distinct cell populations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S3B and C</xref>). While biologically informative, the occurrence of such separate clusters hinders the direct-automated comparison of these populations between MI and Sham.</p>

      <p>In MI, cellHarmony gene expression differences across all cell populations indicate consistent upregulation within each specific and clustered cell population (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref>). While little gene downregulation is denoted in the combined heatmap representation of this data, we find regulation of diverse pathways with increased cell population-specific gene expression. These changes are broadly reflected in comparable bulk RNA-Seq data from an independent study (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>), indicating that differential expression is likely valid rather than a technical artifact (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3E</xref>). Moreover, examination of the predicted transcriptional regulatory networks for each specific cell population comparison identifies well defined MI-associated gene expression differences in human Fibroblasts (up-regulation of <italic>Col1a1, Col1a2, Col3a1, Col4a2, Col5a1, Col5a2</italic> [Collagen scar] <italic>Fn1, Thbs1, Mmp14</italic>) along with novel implicated regulators which agree with prior literature (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3F</xref>) (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34–37</xref>). While the two central transcriptional nodes in this network, <italic>Hif1a</italic> and <italic>Runx1</italic>, have been previously implicated in MI and even as possible targets for therapy, these markers have not been explicitly associated with the MI fibroblasts (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38–40</xref>). While another central node in this fibroblast network, <italic>Egr1</italic> was down-regulated, we note that in the Epicardial network, <italic>Egr1</italic> was also central but up-regulated, in combination with other immediate-early central node genes <italic>Jun</italic> and <italic>Fos</italic> (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3G</xref>).

Hence, automated cellHarmony analysis is able to identify the likely cell populations that underlie therapeutic responses and well-defined cell-type specific mediators of disease.</p>

      <title>Identifying clonal cell origins in cancer</title>
      <p>Cancers of the blood, such AML, can derive from diverse progenitor populations to gain self-renewal potential. While AML results from myeloid progenitors, genomic variants and disease subtypes are likely to derive from distinct stem or progenitor populations, most of which remain largely unknown. The comparison of scRNA-Seq datasets provides a means to determine which cancer clones associate with known healthy progenitor cell types. To understand the diversity of such cancer cell origins and response to therapy, we applied cellHarmony to three AML scRNA-Seq collections: (i) a murine model of cytogenetically normal (CN) AML, (ii) an erythro-leukemia patient with patient matched control and (iii) a time-course of AML therapy.</p>
      <p>In the murine model of CN-AML, mice carrying both Flt3-ITD and Dnmt3a mutations (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>) were compared to healthy bone marrow hematopoietic progenitors (BM) (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>) which include well-defined and experimentally validated transition cell states. Here, cellHarmony primarily aligned AML cells to wild-type dendritic cells, monocyte progenitors and a newly described population of bi-potential monocytic or granulocytic progenitors (IG2) cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">B</xref>). As IG2s are considered short-lived cellular intermediates, their role in both normal and abnormal hematopoiesis is unknown. While hundreds of genes were differentially expressed between matched AML and healthy BM, the cellHarmony integrated visualization indicates that these genes largely segregate those shared among discrete lineage transitions, including those with apparent monocytic restricted potential, and those specifically impacted in distinct cell types (e.g., dendritic cells), with specific pathway and gene-regulatory impacts (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">D</xref>). For example, genes consistently up-regulated in the transition to monocytes are characterized by activation of C-MYC and NF-kB, whereas down-regulated genes in both monocyte and dendritic cell progenitors show an exit from cell-cycle. This analysis further highlights hematopoietic stem progenitor (HSCP) programs (<italic>Gfi1b, Meis1, Gata3, Ikzf2</italic>) are active in later progenitor populations (AML IG2 and monocytic), where they should normally be down-regulated (1). These genes were previously shown to be aberrantly expressed in human AML (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45–48</xref>). Notably these cell type-specific differences were reflected in in bulk RNA-Seq from these same cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4E</xref>).</p>

      <p>To see whether cellHarmony is effective at identifying cell population-level genomic differences relevant in diseased patient samples, we analyzed human leukemia scRNA-Seq datasets before, during, or following therapy. To minimize potential batch and donor effects for differential analyses, we selected scRNA-Seq from a pre-transplantation leukemia bone marrow biopsy relative to a post-transplantation biopsy on the same patient, although the donor genetics will differ from the recipient (<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>). Alignment of the diagnostic query to the post-transplantation sample reference found an expected decrease in cellular diversity in the leukemia diagnostic sample and significant expansion of erythroblast compartment in the leukemia by UMAP visualization (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S4A</xref>). Consistent with this observation, this patient was diagnosed with erythro-leukemia, which is characterized by proliferation of erythroblastic precursors (<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>). Interestingly, the most divergent gene expression differences in pre- versus post-transplant are found in Erythroblasts, which were characterized predominantly by gene down-regulation, where as other cell-types were principally characterized by up-regulation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">E</xref>). To determine whether such signatures were diagnostic for leukemia type, we analyzed bulk-RNA-Seq in a large un-annotated adult AML cohort consisting of 438 patients (Leucegene) and 16 donor CD34+CD45RA- cord-blood samples for the same gene modules (<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>). Comparison of patients with the high-GATA1 signature (and low inflammatory) to the high inflammatory (and low-GATA1) yields genes with expected enrichment in previously described erythro-leukemia and inflammatory/autoimmune disorder disease ontology terms, respectively, providing evidence that these signatures are indeed diagnostic (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5F</xref>).</p>

      <p>As a final evaluation, we considered a recent AML treatment scRNA-Seq time-course (Days 0, 2 and 4) with a combinatorial drug therapy to induce durable remission. The study authors use this data to demonstrate a loss in blood leukemic stem cell populations during therapy and metabolic disruption. Similarly, cellHarmony automatically indicates the same gradual loss in stem cell blood populations during treatment and enriched gene expression changes in analogous metabolic pathways (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5G</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">I</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>). However, our analysis also implicates time and cell-type dependent transcriptional regulatory networks, which suggest that the major population gene expression impacts happen at Day 2 of therapy (global and cell population specific up-regulation) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5J</xref>). Among the gene expression differences most pronounced at Day 2 were those restricted to the two Leukemia stem cell-like populations. Examination of these changes reveals dozens of highly significant impacted pathways, notably syndecan-1, IL5, TGF-beta, EGFR, IFN-gamma, IGF-1, ErbB1, integrin and mTOR mediated signaling pathways (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>). These impacted pathways have well-described regulatory roles in proliferative signaling, which is enriched among up-regulated genes (Mitotic G1-G1/S phases) in concert (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5J</xref>). These differences were further exemplified by the cellHarmony predicted gene-regulatory network for differentiating HSCs, which highlight a core stem cell and proliferative regulatory program orchestrated by up-regulation of <italic>RUNX1</italic>, <italic>JUN</italic> and <italic>HDAC1</italic> (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5K</xref>). Such transcriptional differences represent new potential biomarkers for intermediate response to therapy as well as novel possible therapeutic targets.</p>

    <title>DISCUSSION</title>
    <p>Single-cell RNA-Seq continues to enable exciting insights from healthy and diseased tissues. Standardized and efficient workflows to explore such diversity benefit the research community by highlighting global and cell population-specific programs that can otherwise remain hidden. cellHarmony provides such reproducibility through the fast alignment of independent scRNA-Seq graphs using a community alignment approach. As such, the approach remains scalable to large datasets, due to its low memory footprint, and will be less sensitive to outlier effects through the use of neighborhood matching. To maximize the use of this application, both a stand-alone python implementation of this tool is provided along with an integrated workflow with a graphical user-interface. While this method can accurately align diverse cells from different tissues and across different single-cell technologies, its principle power is in the determination of global, regional, and local differences among cell clusters at the transcriptional, pathway, and regulatory-network level. As demonstrated, such insights include the localization of critical disease transcriptional changes to specific cell types, improved understanding of the specificity of drug targets to specific cell types in disease, improved diagnostic biomarkers, and novel regulatory and signaling networks that can inform therapy. Importantly, we are unaware of any other scRNA-Seq pipelines that can perform these integrated tasks (see Table <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).</p>
    <p>While cellHarmony is able to yield exciting new insights from disease scRNA-Seq datasets, a number of important challenges still remain. These challenges include the comparison of large single-cell patient cohorts, with variable cell numbers per sample, confounded by batch, genetics, and other effects and the explicit integrated analysis of multi-time-point datasets. Further, cellHarmony reported gene expression differences will inherently be less confident when comparing aligned clusters with highly varying sizes (e.g. dozens of cells versus thousands). Likewise, there is always the chance that similar, but not exact cell types will be inappropriately labeled in different datasets. As such, this approach should be considered along with those for joint-alignment to identify additional cellular granularity not clear from the reference alone. Although new specialized and integrated approaches are needed to address these goals, our approach provides an important starting framework for more complex study designs involving scRNA-Seq through community alignment. With increasing use and decreasing expense of scRNA-Seq technologies, we anticipate approaches such as cellHarmony to become necessary to derive higher order insights into the investigation of pharmacological and disease heterogeneity.</p>
