    <abstract id="Abs1">
      <p id="Par1">Functional enrichment analysis is an analytical method to extract biological insights from gene expression data, popularized by the ever-growing application of high-throughput techniques. Typically, expression profiles are generated for hundreds to thousands of genes/proteins from samples belonging to two experimental groups, and after ad-hoc statistical tests, researchers are left with lists of statistically significant entities, possibly lacking any unifying biological theme. Functional enrichment tackles the problem of putting overall gene expression changes into a broader biological context, based on pre-existing knowledge bases of reference: database collections of known expression regulation, relationships and molecular interactions. STRING is among the most popular tools, providing both protein–protein interaction networks and functional enrichment analysis for any given set of identifiers. For complex experimental designs, manually retrieving, interpreting, analyzing and abridging functional enrichment results is a daunting task, usually performed by hand by the average wet-biology researcher. We have developed reString, a cross-platform software that seamlessly retrieves from STRING functional enrichments from multiple user-supplied gene sets, with just a few clicks, without any need for specific bioinformatics skills. Further, it aggregates all findings into human-readable table summaries, with built-in features to easily produce user-customizable publication-grade clustermaps and bubble plots. Herein, we outline a complete reString protocol, showcasing its features on a real use-case.</p>

    <title>Introduction</title>
    <p id="Par2">In the recent years, -omics techniques—which allow the analysis of samples “as a whole”, including genomics and epigenomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics and lipidomics—have rapidly transitioned from niche commodities to widespread tools<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Array- or next generation sequencing-based methods allow for the simultaneous analysis of the expression profile of tens of thousands of genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>, and mass-spec based methods can quantitatively resolve hundreds of different proteins within a sample<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>.</p>
    <p id="Par3">In a typical experimental workflow, the abundance of mRNA transcripts or proteins are obtained for hundreds to thousands of analytes at the same time, and their increased or decreased abundance with respect to a reference experimental group is evaluated with <italic>ad-hoc</italic> statistical tools. The analytes that survive the false discovery rate (FDR) threshold face researchers with the challenge of extracting biologically relevant information from them.</p>
    <p id="Par4">Usually, genes with the most extreme fold change between experimental groups (likely mirrored by lower FDR) are investigated to a deeper level in search of a biological mechanism, yet often the vast majority of leftover genes are so numerous, showing only moderated fold changes, that the challenge of extracting more information requires more advanced tools. Noteworthily, a meager ~ 20% difference in the expression levels of genes all members of the same pathway may hold more clues than a 20-fold change in the expression of a single gene<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>.</p>
    <p id="Par5">To put all the changes in the abundance of analytes into a wider biological context, these are arranged into sets on the basis of pre-existing knowledge about their biological function, including—but not limited to—functional properties, known interactions, shared regulation, phenotype associations and molecular products. An incredible variety of different methods has been generated to analyze these sets as a whole<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Further, there is a broad choice of knowledge bases, including the famed Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>, Gene Ontology (GO) terms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup> and Reactome pathways<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. By tapping these knowledge bases, functional enrichment analysis can really extract biological insights from -omics data, in their literal meaning of “as a whole”.</p>
    <p id="Par6">Many websites offer friendly frontends to provide users with the possibility of upload custom lists of identifiers and retrieve functional enrichment info, such as DAVID<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://david.ncifcrf.gov/">https://david.ncifcrf.gov/</ext-link>), Enrichr<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://maayanlab.cloud/Enrichr/">https://maayanlab.cloud/Enrichr/</ext-link>), WebGIVI<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://raven.anr.udel.edu/webgivi/">http://raven.anr.udel.edu/webgivi/</ext-link>), g:Profiler<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://biit.cs.ut.ee/gprofiler/gost">https://biit.cs.ut.ee/gprofiler/gost</ext-link>) and STRING<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://string-db.org/">https://string-db.org/</ext-link>). While this approach might be handy for a few searches, this manual approach rapidly becomes extensively tiring and time-consuming. While it is possible to automatize the process by interacting with most of these services via custom APIs (application programming interface), this approach is viable only to those researchers with specific bioinformatics skills.</p>
    <p id="Par7">We have developed reString, a software that leverages STRING APIs to automatically perform functional enrichment analysis on multiple user-provided gene/protein lists, rendering the handling of even the most complicate experimental layout a lightweight task. One key feature of reString is the ability of aggregating the results from functional enrichment of different experimental comparisons, and produce human-readable summaries that can be furthermore tailored to the user’s needs, visualized and saved as publication-grade clustermaps and bubble plots. reString is cross-platform and all its features can be easily accessed via a graphical user interface (GUI).</p>
    <p id="Par8">Herein, we outline reString features by outlining a detailed step-by-step protocol that can be easily practiced with included sample files. Further, we process differentially expressed gene lists from an own, real-world dataset to further showcase the reString application.</p>

    <sec id="Sec7">
      <title>Procedure–installation</title>
      <p id="Par13">The following describes a general protocol to set up Python 3.x in the system as well as to install reString.</p>
      <p id="Par14">For a more specific protocol, please refer to the online documentation or Supplementary Materials and Methods at “Installation in depth” to watch YouTube videos with step-by-step instructions tailored for Windows 10, Ubuntu GNU/linux, Raspberry Pi OS and Mac OS fresh installs, or search YouTube for “How to install reString in” followed by your OS name. A following section, “Installation troubleshooting”, will cover and provide solutions to most common hiccups that might happen during the installation.</p>
      <p id="Par15">Some commands need to be executed from the UNIX shell (the Terminal app) and are prefixed by the “$” symbol, which shall not be inputted with the commands. The same commands can be inputted in the Windows Command Prompt (Users would see a “&gt;” symbol at the end instead of a “$” symbol).<list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par16"><italic>Download and install Python.</italic> Head over to <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">https://www.python.org/downloads/</ext-link> and get the latest Python release for your operating system. Windows users can also install Python through the Microsoft store. Please note that Python might already be installed in your system; check whether this is the case and also whether its version is 3.8 or greater (open a terminal—see below—and type ‘python --version’; inspect the output. Windows users should alternatively search for Python in the Start Menu, or type ‘py’ in a terminal). Install the software by following on screen instructions.</p></list-item></list>An alternative easy way to obtain an up-to-date Python distribution, packed with pre-installed scientific libraries, is installing the free and open source Individual Edition of Anaconda, available for Windows, Linux and Mac (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.anaconda.com/">https://www.anaconda.com/</ext-link>), as outlined here<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>.<list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par18"><italic>Optional for GNU/linux</italic>: While all libraries needed by reString are included by default (or being installed) in MacOS and Windows, GNU/Linux distros vary greatly in this respect.We can assume that the average GNU/Linux user will be able to address any installation/dependency issue that may incur. A few tips: many distros may bundle both Python 2.x and 3.x: in this case, python3 and pip3 should be used instead of python and pip commands. Additionally, not all Debian-based distro include tkinter, a library which reString rely upon. This can be fixed with this terminal command (please otherwise refer to updated or specific distros documentation for any issue):<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><label/><p id="Par19">$ sudo apt-get install python3-tk</p></list-item></list></p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par20"><italic>Open a terminal</italic>. On macOS, this is done by running the Terminal app from the Utilities (to access Utilities, from Finder ⌘ + ⇧ + U, or Go &gt; Utilities). On Windows, bring up the Start menu and type ‘cmd’ in the search field, then run it.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par21"><italic>Install reString</italic>. reString and its dependencies can be automatically installed from the command line. Type:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><label/><p>$ pip install restring</p></list-item></list></p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par23"><italic>Optional troubleshooting for Windows</italic>: it is possible that after the installation the system does not know where to find pip, the Python package manager. Should this occur, locate the folder containing it by typing in a terminal:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><label/><p id="Par24">&gt; cd\</p><p id="Par25">&gt; dir pip.exe /a /s</p></list-item></list></p><p id="Par26">The folder containing it (for example: C:\Users\username\AppData\Local\Programs\Python39\Scripts) needs to be added to the environment PATH variable. Start typing “environment variables” in the Windows search box, and click on “Edit the system environment variables”. Open a dialog by clicking on “Environment variables”, then double-click on PATH. Add the folder to the list, OK and exit. Close and reopen the terminal.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par27"><italic>Run reString</italic>. The installation takes care of creating a script that automatically runs the graphical user interface (GUI), that can be invoked directly from the terminal:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><label/><p>$ restring-gui</p></list-item></list></p><p id="Par29">reString should launch and the User should see the program’s main window (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">S1</xref>). Steps 1 and 3 will not be needed anymore to run reString.</p><p id="Par30">If the program fails to start (this might happen on some GNU/linux systems and Windows), alternatively type:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><label/><p>$ python -c "import restring; restring.restring_gui()"</p></list-item></list></p><p id="Par32">Please note that on some Windows setups the antivirus might scan restring-gui.exe for threats. This is normal and should not take longer than a few seconds. Also on Windows, if the system fonts are scaled to 125% or above, reString fonts might be displayed too large. Reduce system fonts scaling to 100% to solve the issue.</p><p id="Par33"><italic>Update reString</italic>. To periodically ensure that reString is up to date, type in the terminal:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><label/><p id="Par34">$ pip install restring --upgrade</p></list-item></list></p></list-item></list></p>

    <sec id="Sec8">
      <title>Procedure–analysis</title>

    <title>Results and discussion</title>
    <p id="Par58">We have developed reString as a tool to help Researchers without prior bioinformatics knowledge tackle the issue of retrieving, analyzing, and summarizing functional enrichment results from complex experimental layouts.</p>
    <p id="Par59">A typical, moderately sized experimental layout is shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>. Therein, three different sample types (in our example, identified with different colors: red, blue and green) are subjected to two different treatments, whose impact is assayed at two different time points by RNAseq. This translates to 12 different comparisons, if the focus of the experiment is prioritizing the differences among the genotypes, as schematized in Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>. The task of manually retrieving, inspecting and analyzing functional enrichment results from all these analyses looks daunting, yet that is how it is managed in a sizeable number of research groups.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Hypothetical scheme of an experimental setup. Modern high-throughput -omic approaches generate huge lists of differentially expressed (DE) genes/proteins, which can in turn be used for functional enrichment studies. Manually reviewing a large number of such analyses is time consuming, especially for experimental designs with more than a few groups. A prototypical example is shown in the picture. This example setup has two treatments, given at two time points to three different sample types (represented with different colors). While this represents a fairly common experimental design, the inspection of functional enrichment results for such all possible combinations would require substantial effort. reString makes it easy to automatically deal with this situation.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="41598_2021_2528_Fig2_HTML" id="MO2"/></fig><fig id="Fig3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Comparisons generated from the example experimental setup. The example experimental setup has two treatments, given at two time points to three different sample types (represented with different colors). After quantifying gene expression by RNAseq, the experimental workflow (either managed in-house or sent to the Researcher by a company) generates DE genes lists for every comparison. As in many experimental pipelines, each list of DE genes is investigated with functional enrichment tools, such as STRING. Every comparison generates one or more tables (depending on the criteria the genes of interested are selected with), and reString makes it easy to generate summary reports from all of them, automatically.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="41598_2021_2528_Fig3_HTML" id="MO3"/></fig></p>
    <p id="Par60">reString was designed to work with input tables that are only required to contain the desired genes and the fold change information of each gene (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">S2</xref>). To obtain a list of genes or proteins to work with, a conventional approach is filtering the full list of entries, that can comprise hundreds to thousands of identifiers, by means of P-value, false discovery rate or desired fold change threshold. RNAseq or proteomics services provide tabular data that contain this information which can be easily handled by simple spreadsheets, such as Microsoft Office’s Excel or LibreOffice’s Calc.</p>
    <p id="Par61">With reString, retrieving functional enrichment data and producing summaries from the 12 sample data tables takes no longer than ~ 5 min. With a few further clicks, results can be visualized and saved as clustermaps and bubble plots.</p>
    <p id="Par62">reString leverages STRING APIs to automatically retrieve functional enrichment information from KEGG<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>, GO<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup> (Biological Processes, Molecular Function, Cellular Component), and Reactome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup> pathways knowledge bases. For each User-supplied file, reString (depending on the analysis settings) either splits the gene list into up- or downregulated genes, or takes all genes, and queries the remote server retrieving functional annotation information, if the gene lists contain sufficient elements to produce statistically significant results. The five knowledge bases considered produce tab-delimited text files that are each saved in a folder bearing the same name of the input file from which it was generated, and are available to the Researcher for further inspection. These files are analogous to the ones that would be downloaded by hand from the STRING website (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">S6</xref>). File names are prepended by reString with either “UP_, “DOWN_” or “ALL_” as a way to identify whether they were produced with upregulated, downregulated or all genes of each input file, respectively. After fetching functional enrichment data, for each knowledge base (internally referred to as <italic>kind</italic> within the application code and documentation), reString produces two types of abridged summaries by aggregating information from files of all comparisons (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The whole procedure is summarized in Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>Schematics of reString workflow. reString works with user-supplied files that contain gene or protein identifiers, along with information of their expression in two experimental conditions in the form of fold change. For each input file, reString retrieves functional enrichment from the remote STRING server, then creates a folder where it stores the results (for KEGG Pathways, Reactome Pathways, and gene Ontology Biological Processes, Molecular Function and Cellular Component). Depending on the analysis settings, results can be retrieved for upregulated or downregulated genes only, for both up- and downregulated genes taken separately, or from all genes simultaneously. Then, results are condensed and abridged into user-friendly summaries.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="41598_2021_2528_Fig4_HTML" id="MO4"/></fig></p>
    <p id="Par63">Summary-type tables contain, for each term (the nature of the term depends on the type of knowledge base queried, for instance KEGG pathways or Reactome pathways), the lower P-value score ever observed across all comparisons, the number of comparisons where the term has been found enriched in a statistically significant way (indicated with “occurrence” in the table), a list of unique identifiers gathered from all comparisons (“all_genes” column), and a list of identifiers that is shared between all comparisons where the term is statistically significant (“common_genes” column). In the case there are no shared genes, even though the term is found across multiple comparisons, reString marks the condition as “No common gene”. Conversely, if the term shows up in only one comparison, reString marks the condition as “n/a: just one condition”, and the gene identifiers of that one condition can be found under “all_genes” (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>A). This summary is useful to rapidly identify the strongest (by statistical significance) terms with respect to all comparisons simultaneously—or a subset thereof, as well as to readily identify the underlying genes.</p>
    <p id="Par64">Results-type tables contain, for each term, the genes that were found common among all comparisons, as well as the corresponding FDR-value of that term in every comparison (one column per comparison, Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>B). In the case a comparison failed to enrich in a statistically significant way for the term being considered, a <italic>P</italic> value of 1 is assigned by default. In case the aggregation is set to consider upregulated and downregulated genes separately (see “<xref rid="Sec9" ref-type="sec">Procedure–analysis parameters</xref>” in Materials and methods), in the unlikely case the term is enriched in both, the lowest P-value is taken into account. This summary is especially useful to map the distribution of the statistical significance of each term across all comparisons, and to present this result graphically with the reString built-in clustermap drawing tool (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">S11</xref>).</p>
    <p id="Par65">An example of a clustermap drawn from aggregated results of Reactome pathways from sample data is shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>. In addition to rapidly conveying the message of which terms are enriched in a particular comparison, with respect to the entirety of experimental conditions, the way reString organizes the functional enrichment files makes it easy to retrieve which genes are contained in a clustermap block. For instance, to investigate the genes related to Immune System term in the Reactome Pathways, it is sufficient to open the corresponding folder of the desired experimental condition (for instance, treatment_t1_red_VS_treatment_t1_blue_FC), and pick the corresponding RCTM tables (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">S14</xref>). Furthermore, if the analysis was run with up- and downregulated genes separately (as per default), it is easy to determine what list the term is contained in.<fig id="Fig5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p>Visualization of a “results”-type table with built-in clustermap tool. The clustermap showing the results for Reactome Pathways obtained with the sample files is shown in (<bold>A</bold>). After running reString with sample input files, it is possible to quickly personalize and draw a clustermap of the results via the built-in clustermap tool (<bold>B</bold>). In this example, the FDR values have been log-transformed, and a cutoff of 5 (corresponding to FDR &lt; 0.00001) has been applied to restrict the plot to the most significant enriched terms. Further, it is possible to remove form the plot terms that are deemed unfit, as shown in (<bold>C</bold>).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="41598_2021_2528_Fig5_HTML" id="MO5"/></fig></p>

This kind of visualization helps identifying, at a glance, the terms that contain the highest number of enriched genes, the number of shared genes across considered experimental conditions and the corresponding FDR. This tool, smoothly integrating with the clustermap tool, helps providing a clearclut graphical visualization of relevant information of common elements of the functional enrichment of a large number of experimental conditions.<fig id="Fig6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p>Visualization of a “summary”-type table with built-in bubble plot tool.

    <p id="Par67">The software tool described in the present manuscript has already been employed previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. To further demonstrate the usefulness of reString in the handling of functional enrichment results from complex experimental layouts in just a few clicks, we used it to process RNAseq data generated in our laboratory. To this aim, we performed RNAseq on mouse aortas of two different mouse strains, knockout for Apoe (EKO), the gene encoding for apolipoprotein E, and double knockout for Apoe and Apoa1, the gene encoding for apolipoprotein A-I (DKO). Both genotypes are severely dyslipidemic (EKO mice are strongly hyperlipidemic, DKO almost completely lack high-density lipoproteins) and are prone to atherosclerosis development. For each mouse line, the experimental plan envisaged two different time points, and two different dietary treatments, a standard laboratory diet (NLD), extremely low in dietary fats and without cholesterol, or a Western-type diet, enriched in fats and cholesterol (WD—Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">S15</xref>).</p>
    <p id="Par68">Atherosclerosis development was evaluated in the whole aorta. After 6 weeks on NLD, no atherosclerotic plaques were visible in any genotype, whereas on WD both EKO and DKO mice showed initial atherosclerosis development. A comparable plaque development was observed in mice of both genotypes even after 22 weeks at NLD. Twenty-two weeks on WD worsened atherosclerotic plaques, dramatically increasing lesion size in both DKO and EKO mice (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">S16</xref>).<fig id="Fig7"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><p>Quantification of aortic plaque area by en-face analysis. At the end of the dietary treatments, whole aortas were collected and the <italic>en-face</italic> analysis was performed to quantify the percentage of aortic surface covered by atherosclerotic plaques (white areas) (<bold>A</bold>–<bold>D</bold>). Data is shown as box plots, with upper and lower ends of the boxes indicating the 25th and 75th percentiles, respectively (<bold>E</bold>).

    <p id="Par69">After the necessary bioinformatic analyses (reads QC, trimming, mapping, transcript abundance estimation, etc.), we produced reString-compliant lists of DE genes for twelve comparisons. As an example, aggregated results for KEGG Pathways are shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>. Transcript abundance estimation was validated by quantitative polymerase chain reaction on 6 randomly picked genes and was found to closely match RNA-seq results (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">S17</xref>).<fig id="Fig8"><label>Figure 8</label><caption><p>Aggregation of functional enrichment results—KEGG. reString was used to retrieve and process functional enrichment data of from lists of differently expressed genes, taken from multiple one-to-one comparisons. Aggregated data for KEGG Pathways has been processed and customized with reString, and it is shown unmodified from the program (to the exception of the graphical legend, <bold>A</bold>–<bold>L</bold>). Eyeing the clustermap immediately delivers take-away messages that would have been otherwise tricky to obtain, such as: (i) the two genotypes show differences at the latest time point. At WD, pathways show more robust FDR scores (<bold>C</bold>,<bold>D</bold>); (ii) diet differences push changes in gene expression at the latest time point in EKO (<bold>G</bold>) but not in DKO (H); (iii) eating WD rather than NDL drives dramatic changes in the metabolism of EKO at 6 (<bold>I</bold>), but not at 22 weeks (<bold>K</bold>); conversely, the passing of time does yield less dramatic changes in gene expression in DKO (<bold>J</bold>,<bold>L</bold>).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="41598_2021_2528_Fig8_HTML" id="MO8"/></fig></p>
    <p id="Par70">Although there was a comparable plaque development in the two genotypes, the transcriptome analysis revealed different gene expression signatures.</p>
    <p id="Par71">The comparison between genotypes (Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>A–D), in accordance with the absence of plaque development after 6 weeks on NLD, did not reveal significantly enriched pathways between EKO and DKO (Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>A), and showed the greatest differences after 22 weeks of dietary treatments (Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>C,D). The comparison between diets (Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>E–H) clearly showed that DKO had a more pronounced response to dietary treatment after 6 weeks (Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>F), whereas EKO had a massive increase in enriched pathways after 22 weeks on WD (Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>G).</p>
    <p id="Par72">The intra-genotype comparison between time points (Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>I–L) strikingly shows how, albeit with different contributions of the different dietary treatments, there are profound changes in the gene expression profile that are still ongoing in EKO in the transition between 6 and 22 weeks (Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>I,K) that are mostly absent in DKO (Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>J,L). We hypothesize that DKO mice might reach a transcriptional steady state earlier than EKO.</p>
    <p id="Par73">By scrutinizing reString aggregated results (Supplemental <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">Data Sets</xref>) we could readily observe interesting trends in some of the pathways that were modulated across all experimental conditions:</p>
    <p id="Par74"><italic>Hematopoietic cell lineage</italic> (mmu04640). The aggregated results showed that the “Hematopoietic cell lineage” was the most influenced pathway, the expression level of its constituent genes being impacted in 8 out of 12 experimental conditions. Compared to DKO, EKO had this pathway enriched at the longest time point, regardless of the diet administered. In EKO, WD administration and the passing of time synergistically enriched this pathway. Conversely, in DKO, WD only increased the expression of these genes mainly after 6 weeks.</p>
    <p id="Par75"><italic>Lysosome</italic> (mmu04142) and <italic>Phagosome</italic> (mmu04145). These pathways were also among the ones mostly affected, being significantly enriched in 6 comparisons. EKO fed WD for the longest time had the highest enrichment of the Lysosome pathway, compared to DKO. Yet, six weeks at WD were already sufficient to change the expression of these genes in both genotypes, although only in EKO the passing of time further enriched it.</p>
    <p id="Par77">Similarly, EKO fed WD for the longest time showed the highest enrichment of the Phagosome pathway, compared to DKO (Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>D). In the diet comparisons, DKO had this pathway enriched at both time points (Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>F,H)—only at the latest for EKO (Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>G); in the time point comparisons, this pathway was enriched only in EKO in both dietary treatments (Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>I,K), with the highest enrichment at WD.</p>
    <p id="Par79"><italic>PPAR signaling pathway</italic> (mmu03320) and <italic>Fatty acid metabolism</italic> (mmu01212). These pathways were enriched in 5 out of 12 comparisons and showed no difference between the two genotypes, when fed the same diet for the same time.</p>
    <p id="Par80">The most striking visual impact of the reString output heatmap is the block containing <italic>Metabolic pathways</italic> (mmu 01100), <italic>Oxidative phosphorylation</italic> (mmu 00190) and <italic>Thermogenesis</italic> (mmu 04714) in the time comparison. At NLD, the enrichment of those pathways in EKO is paramount (Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>I). These pathways are also enriched at WD (Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>K), but their enrichment is lower than at NLD, suggesting that the feeding at WD initiates earlier to modulate the expression of the genes annotated in those pathways, and that the transcriptional equilibrium that is reached at 22 weeks at WD is more similar to the one already established at 6 weeks at WD, than what happens at NLD at later stages. Interestingly, no such thing happens in DKO mice. This finding is further supported by the “immune-metabolic” block of pathways enriched at 22 weeks in EKO in the diet comparison (Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>G), but again not in DKO (Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>H).</p>
    <p id="Par81">In conclusion, we developed reString, a cross-platform software with a graphical user interface, written in Python, to enable all Researchers—especially including those without specific bioinformatics skills—the possibility of broadening the exploration of their RNAseq or high-throughput proteomics datasets, effortlessly automating a series of tasks that would be otherwise daunting if performed by hand. Furthermore, reString is actively maintained. While the tool is feature-complete, we plan to expand its features with new styling/charting options, broaden its support to STRING APIs—especially focusing on the Users’ feedback—and releasing bugfixes. Users can give feedback for troubles they may experience (“Help &gt; Give feedback/Report an Issue” or “Help &gt; Report a Bug”), or actively steer the app’s development by requesting new features (“Help &gt; “Request a new feature”). We will also ensure compatibility with future STRING API versions. Last, reString is an open-source project and anyone with the adequate skill is welcome to peek into, exploit, contribute to and fork the project in order to expand and adapt it.</p>
    <p id="Par82">We detailed and showcased a full reString workflow by using sample data, and further demonstrated its applicability with a new RNAseq dataset.</p>
