      <p id="Par1">Single-cell RNA sequencing methods focusing on the 5′-end of transcripts can reveal promoter and enhancer activity and efficiently profile immune receptor repertoire. However, ultra-high-throughput 5′-end single-cell RNA sequencing methods have not been described. We introduce FIPRESCI, 5′-end single-cell combinatorial indexing RNA-Seq, enabling massive sample multiplexing and increasing the throughput of the droplet microfluidics system by over tenfold. We demonstrate FIPRESCI enables the generation of approximately 100,000 single-cell transcriptomes from E10.5 whole mouse embryos in a single-channel experiment, and simultaneous identification of subpopulation differences and T cell receptor signatures of peripheral blood T cells from 12 cancer patients.</p>

    <title>Background</title>
    <p id="Par2">Droplet microfluidic-based 5′-end or 3′-end single-cell and single-nucleus RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq and snRNA-seq) have emerged as central tools for interrogating the cellular states of whole organs and entire organisms. While with similar capability for cell typing, 5′-end based methods offer several advantages over 3′-end. First, 5′-end single-cell transcriptomics can detect the location of cis-regulatory elements (CREs; including promoters and enhancers) and quantify their in vivo activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Cell atlas studies that rely on 5′-end sc/snRNA-seq to infer cis-gene regulatory network in the human body have been launched [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Second, the 3′-end method is difficult to identify full-length immune receptor (TCR and BCR) sequences in a typical short-read sequencing setting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. 5′-end scRNA-seq coupled with single-cell V(D)J sequencing has become the most popular approach to reveal the clone type-specific transcriptional signatures which is a challenge for conventional bulk immune receptor sequencing. The procedure has been widely applied to the study of antibody–drug discovery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] and characterizes the immune response in patients of COVID-19 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], cancer, autoimmune diseases, and neurodegenerative diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Third, for snRNA-seq, which is critical for profiling tissues that are hard to dissociate or frozen clinical samples, the 5′-end method provides a unique opportunity to improve the transcriptome complexity through reverse transcription by customized oligo priming. Furthermore, by introducing a primer that targets a conserved region of bacterial 16S rRNA, the 5′-end method enables to co-detect the presence of intratumoral bacteria and transcriptome in the same single tumor cell simultaneously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. However, only a limited number of protocols have been developed to capture the 5′-end of transcripts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The existing droplet-based 5′-end single-cell transcriptomics approaches are costly and preclude large-scale studies on millions of cells or thousands of samples.</p>
    <p id="Par3">The droplet microfluidic system uses an ineffective way to minimize the doublet rate in single-cell analysis, which is constrained by a Poisson-like distribution. The single-cell suspension is loaded into the microfluidic device at very low concentrations (typically 500–8000 cells), making it unlikely that two cells enter the same droplet (~ 100,000 droplets per channel for Chromium Controller, ~ 200,000 droplets for Chromium X). Sample multiplexing has been developed to overcome this throughput limitation by identification and removal of doublets and achieve experimental cost-reducing and batch effects removal by allowing overloading. The strategies are initially introduced by using natural genetic variations and expanded by oligo-tagged antibodies (Cell hashing) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], lipid-tagged indices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], lentiviral-based CellTag Indexing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], methyltetrazine-modified DNA oligonucleotides [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], and so on. However, those strategies only increase the cell throughput modestly as the data of doublets are not resolved and need to be discarded after being sequenced.</p>
    <p id="Par4">Conceptually different approaches that use droplet microfluidic to accomplish single-cell combinatorial indexing have emerged recently. DsciATAC-seq [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], scifi-RNA-seq [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], and SCITO-seq [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] have achieved ultra-high-throughput analysis for chromatin accessibility, 3′-end gene expression, and surface protein expression, respectively. The target molecules (open chromatin DNA, transcripts, antibody-derived tags) are first labeled by a well-specific barcode and subsequently by a large number of droplet-specific barcodes in a two-round barcoding experiment. The droplet is not considered as a way to isolate single-cell but a physical compartment that is conceptually equivalent to a “well” in split-pool single-cell combinatorial indexing protocols, such as sci-RNA-seq [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] and SPLiT-seq [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Compared with the sample multiplexing-based doublets removing methods, those strategies can substantially increase the cell throughput as the data of doublets will be resolved rather than discarded. Compared with plate-based single-cell combinatorial indexing laboratory protocols, which typically need 3- or 4-round barcoding, those strategies are much easier to perform by leveraging the powerful indexing ability of droplet microfluidic for the second round. However, the droplet microfluidic-based combinatorial indexing 5′-end single-cell RNA-seq has not been described.</p>
    <p id="Par5">Here, we developed FIve PRime End Single-cell Combinatorial Indexing RNA sequencing (FIPRESCI), a simple and highly efficient workflow for 5′-end scRNA-seq and snRNA-seq. Our approach combines preindexing of the whole transcriptomes in situ through Tn5 transposome with droplet template switch oligo (TSO) barcoding in a commercial microfluidic platform. We demonstrate the signal from FIPRESCI sc(n)RNA-seq colocalizes with cis-regulatory elements detected from ATAC-seq. We further demonstrate FIPRESCI sc(n)RNA-seq can increase the cell throughput by at least tenfold over the existing standard procedure and resolve the cellular diversity of whole mouse E10.5 embryo. Finally, we demonstrate the ability of FIPRESCI for sample multiplexing and multimodal profiling of the whole transcriptome and immune receptor repertoire.</p>

      <title>FIPRESCI overview</title>
      <p id="Par6">Previous studies have shown that the Tn5 transposase enzyme maintains the contiguity of target dsDNA, and the protein-DNA complex is only dissociated after the addition of a protein-denaturing agent such as SDS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Recently, the Tn5 transposome has been reported to also possess in vitro tagmentation activity towards both strands of RNA/DNA hybrids which are typical products of reverse transcription step during RNA-seq experiment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Motivated by these observations, we asked whether or not the Tn5 transposase also stayed bound to its RNA/cDNA substrate after transposition. The results indicate that each RNA/cDNA molecule subjected to transposition retained its high molecular weight and was only fragmented when exposed to SDS (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S1a). We, therefore, postulated that in a condition without a protein-denaturing agent, indexed Tn5 transposome could be used to preindex whole transcriptomes at a single molecular level after reverse transcription inside single nuclei or permeabilized cells. The in situ reverse transcriptions followed by a Tn5 tagmentation step did not change the morphological property of nuclei or permeabilized cells (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S1b). We further confirmed that the Tn5 barcoded 5′-end transcript can be captured by TSO-containing barcoding primers used in microfluidic droplet single-cell sequencing. The success of highly efficient two-round combinatorial indexing of FIPRESCI is built on the key insight that droplet microfluidic can tolerate substantial overloading while maintaining a low collision rate when single molecular preindexing is available to resolve transcriptome of different cells/nuclei within the same droplet.</p>
      <p id="Par7">The workflow of FIPRESCI is described in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a (see also Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S2). Briefly, (i) prepare permeabilized cells or nuclei; (ii) fixed and permeabilized cells or nuclei are reverse transcribed using an Oligo d(T) primer or random primer; (iii) permeabilized cells or nuclei are distributed in multiwell plates (we use one 96-well) to be labeled with well-specific preindexing (round1) barcodes by indexed Tn5 transposase to mark cDNA; (iv) the cells or nuclei with preindexed cDNA are pooled, randomly mixed, and encapsulated into emulsion droplets with a high degree of overloading. Inside these overloaded droplets, the 3′-end of cDNA which was added with 2–5 untemplated nucleotides by the Moloney murine leukemia (M-MLV) reverse transcriptase, are labeled with oligonucleotides containing droplet-specific barcode (round2), UMI, and template switch oligo (TSO) by template-switching and cDNA extension. Such, the round1 barcodes are shared between all cells from the same well, the round2 barcodes are shared between all cells in the same droplet, but the combination of the two barcodes uniquely identifies transcripts derived from the same single cell; (v) the droplets are broken and pooled after template switch reaction mixtures are recovered; (vi–vii) cDNA labeled with round1 and round2 are enriched by PCR amplification and prepared for sequencing; (viii) (optional) for immune cells, T cell receptor (TCR), or B-cell immunoglobulin (Ig) transcripts can be enriched from the cDNA products via PCR amplification with primers specific to either the TCR or Ig constant regions to measure immune repertoire information.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Overview and validation of FIPRESCI.<bold> a</bold> The FIPRESCI schematic workflow and detailed method design.

      <title>FIPRESCI validation</title>
      <p id="Par8">As a proof of concept, we performed FIPRESCI on a mixture of human (Jurkat) and mouse (NIH 3T3) cell lines. During the first round of indexing, 96 wells contained 1:1 mixed human and mouse cells, and then 15,300 cells which is the maximum recommended loading concentration were loaded to generate emulsion droplets by the 10X Genomics Chromium system. We recovered 8049 high-quality (UMI &gt; 1000) single-cell transcriptomes and readily assigned cells as human or mouse (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b). Notably, nearly all (99.8%) of the uniquely barcoded cells were unambiguously assigned to a single species (&gt; 90% of reads aligned to a single genome), only 17 cells representing barcode collisions between mouse and human cells were identified, representing a remarkably low 0.2% collision rate, which is much lower than expected multiplet rate of 7.6% when the same number of cells are loaded in the standard 10X Genomics procedure (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>c, and Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S3a). Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>d shows the number of UMI counts plotted against detected genes from species-mixing experiments.</p>
      <p id="Par9">After assessing technical feasibility, we sought to benchmark the scalability and performance of FIPRESCI by performing scRNA-seq and snRNA-seq using 3 human cell lines (HEK293T, Jurkat, and K562) with variable cell size and mRNA content. Permeabilized cells and nuclei were processed with FIPRESCI workflow respectively. We marked technical replicates of each cell line with different round1 barcodes by seeding each cell line to 32 wells of a 96-well plate, then in both cases loading 100,000 cells/nuclei per microfluidic channel (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S3b). We recovered transcriptome from 58,771 cells and 59,622 nuclei, with a recovery rate of over 58%. We also calculated the effective number of individual nuclei or cells (as identified by round1 barcodes) in each droplet (as identified by round2 barcodes) from the sequencing data. Most droplets (96.38% for scRNA-seq, 98.25% for snRNA-seq) contain 1–3 cells (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S3c-d). After dimension reduction using uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP), all three cell lines were separated by their transcriptomes in both permeabilized cells and nuclei (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>f). The recovery rate of these cell lines is similar, suggesting it is cell size and mRNA content independent. Differential expression of marker genes validated these cluster identities. In addition, the marker genes of three cell lines were consistently highly expressed in the permeabilized cells and nuclei data (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>g). Estimates of gene expression from the aggregated transcriptomes of nuclei and cells were well correlated [Spearman correlation coefficient (<italic>r</italic>) = 0.81 for HEK293T, 0.89 for K562, and 0.85 for Hela; Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>e]. These experiments confirm that FIPRESCI is robust across different input materials and scales well while maintaining a high recovery rate.</p>

      <title>Optimization of FIPRESCI</title>
      <p id="Par10">We attempted to optimize the performance of FIPRESCI so that the methods are improved with sensitivity and compatible with a broader range of samples. We first try to find robust conditions for an efficient tagmentation on RNA/DNA hybrid heteroduplexes within permeabilized cells or nuclei. We focused on the Hela cell line and performed a set of experiments with different reaction buffers and variations according to the previously published studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] and three available commercial tagmentation buffers (the detailed components of these tagmentation buffers and the design of the experiments are provided in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S4a.c and Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">3</xref>). Commercial buffer 1 showed the best performance. In addition, Tris-based or TAPS-based buffer only containing dimethylformamide (DMF) also showed the efficient tagmentation of FIPRESCI at matched sequencing depths compared with other custom buffers (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a, and Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S4b). Therefore, for the rest of the subsequent experiments, we used the customized Tris-based DMF tagmentation buffer (10 mM Tris–HCl at pH 7.5, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, and 10% DMF). Unexpectedly, in contrast to the results in tagmentation activity on free RNA/DNA hybrid duplexes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], we found the addition of crowding agents such as PEG 8000 and PEG200 showed poor performance (merely 10–30% lower average genes per cell detected compared with the buffers containing DMF only) on FIPRESCI. We speculate that since in FIPRESCI transposition reaction occurs inside intact nuclei or cells, the presence of crowding agents may hinder the penetration of Tn5 or magnesium ions into the cells/nuclei.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Optimization and expanded application of FIPRESCI.<bold> a</bold> Violin plot showing sensitivity in FIPRESCI generated with a set of TN5 tagmentation buffers.

      <p id="Par11">Next, we assessed the performance of different RT primers, including oligo d(T), random hexamer primer, and equimolar concentration mix of oligo d(T) and random hexamer primer on FIPRESCI for both permeabilized Hela cells and nuclei. Each condition was marked with 8 different round1 barcodes as technical replicates, (the design of the experiments is provided in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S5a) then all the cells/ nuclei were pooled and loaded into a single microfluidic channel of the Chromium system. After sequencing, we assessed the sensitivity of gene detection in different RT primer methods. At matched sequencing depths, the FIPRESCI for single cell using oligo d(T) primer methods always detected more genes than other primer conditions (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b). As expected, oligo d(T) primer methods in single-nucleus FIPRESCI data detected fewer genes per nucleus compared to FIPRESCI using cells. However, single-nucleus FIPRESCI using mixed RT primers identified more genes than the oligo d(T) primers, and the random primer methods. The sensitivity of gene detection in mixed RT primer was better than the random RT primer for FIPRESCI using nuclei. Thus, mixed RT primer methods could be an attractive strategy to improve the mRNA recovery for single-nucleus RNA-seq. Notably, at a typical sequencing depth of 50 k fragments per cell, we obtain a median of 2239 and a mean of 2150 genes per cell with oligo d(T) primer(Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b), which is comparable with 10X Genomics standard 5′-end scRNA-seq procedure.</p>
      <p id="Par12">In addition, the reads from each method are strongly enriched at the 5′-end of genes and peaked exactly at the annotated transcription start sites (TSSs), suggesting our methods can accurately identify active TSSs (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>c and Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S5b (upper)). Then, we evaluated the sensitivity of enhancers detection in various RT primer methods data by calculating the coverage of reads around the enhancer center. Enhancers were defined as distal ATAC peaks whose distance to the nearest gene TSS is greater than 2000 bp. Notably, in all RT primer conditions, there is a bimodal distribution centered around the start and end site of the distal ATAC peak (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>d). FIPRESCI using nuclei methods showed higher sensitivity, especially by using a random RT primer. If an ATAC-defined enhancer region is enriched with a strong FIPERSCI-seq signal (RPKM &gt; 1 and adjusted <italic>p</italic>-value &lt; 0.01, see “<xref rid="Sec11" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref>”), we defined it as an eRNA locus. About 2% of the reads are generated from eRNA loci(Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S5c). We found FIPERSCI can identify 3898 ~ 4685 eRNA loci, which account for 33.4 ~ 40.1% distal ATAC peaks (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>e,f). Furthermore, the eRNA profile among different conditions is similar, which indicated those eRNAs may be derived from strong enhancers (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>g). Interestingly, we noticed that the rRNA detected in FIPRESCI are unexpectedly low, which is similar to random primer RT-based protocol SUPeR-seq [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. The cell lysis buffer which lacks Proteinase K may contribute to the low rRNA level (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S5d,e,f).</p>
      <p id="Par13">Recent technological advances have made it possible to jointly profile transcriptome and chromatin accessibility within the same single cell. However, the widespread application of single-cell co-assay is challenging due to its experimental complexity, scalability, and cost [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Since FIPRESCI has achieved ultra-high-throughput sc(sn)-RNA-seq and detected enhancers, we further test its feasibility in computationally predicting ATAC-seq data from RNA-seq. We modified BABEL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] to build a deep learning model that can predict scATAC-seq signals from the Hela cells FIPRESCI dataset. We observed that adding enhancer RNA (eRNA) information during training, which is defined as a distal FIPRESCI signal, outperforms the standard models that only include mRNA (gene expression level) (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S5g). The correlation of aggregated predicted ATAC peak signals with bulk ATAC-seq peak signals is 0.33 (restrict to top 6000 peaks) (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S5h). Finally, we found the predicted ATAC signal based on FIPRESCI data recapitulates the actual ATAC-seq signals (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S5i).</p>
      <p id="Par14">In summary, the results demonstrate that FIPRESCI can detect gene expression and identify cis-regulatory elements in the same cell/nucleus. The overall performance of different sample formats and RT primer conditions are similar, while scRNA-seq is suitable to detect more genes and snRNA-seq has the advantage to detect more enhancers.</p>

      <title>5′-end snRNA-seq of mouse whole embryo in a single 10X Genomics channel</title>
      <p id="Par15">To test whether FIPRESCI is feasible for various primary tissue and demonstrates scalability, we performed FIPRESCI snRNA-seq on a mouse E10.5 whole embryo. We collected 2 C57BL/6N × PWK/PhJ hybrid mouse embryos at E10.5. The nuclei isolated from each embryo were pooled, counted, and evenly deposited in 96-well plates with an expectation of 4000 nuclei per well. The first round index introduced by Tn5 does not contain sample identity but will exponentially increase the cell throughput when combined with the second round barcode from droplet microfluidics. We recovered transcriptomes of 117,804 nuclei from a single 10X Genomics channel, which is over tenfold compared to the standard procedure in terms of cell throughput.</p>
      <p id="Par16">Initially, analysis by unsupervised clustering identified 15 well-separated clusters (Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S6a</xref>, left). Multiple distinct cluster-specific marker genes can be found for each cluster (Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S6a</xref>, right), indicating the high quality and complexity of the data. We further annotated each cluster by integration analysis with a reference dataset [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Encouragingly, the majority of the cells (<italic>n</italic> = 101,031, 85.8%) can be assigned a reliable cell type label (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a, left and Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S6b-c). In addition, the proportion of each cell type in FIPRESCI is highly consistent with the counterpart in the reference E10.5 embryo dataset (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>b). What is more, the FIPRESCI captured the 5′-end of the transcripts allowing us to investigate the landscape of TSSs usage in a cell type and single-cell specific manner. For example, Specc1 uses the most upstream TSS in cluster 7 and cluster 9 while using a downstream TSS that skips the first three exons in most of the rest of the clusters (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>c).<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>FIPRESCI enables analysis of E10.5 whole mouse embryo. <bold>a</bold> Label transfer from a scRNA-seq profiled mouse organogenesis atlas to FIPRESCI data.

      <p id="Par17">A previous study has reported that with the brain-related samples, relative TSS usage significantly varied concerning upstream or downstream position within each gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Next, we set out to ask whether FIPRESCI can identify TSS switches during brain development and GABAergic neurogenesis in the E10.5 mouse embryo. First, we isolate the brain cells from the whole embryo dataset and perform a pseudo time analysis. Multiple gene modules which are highly correlated with the trajectory graph are identified (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>e, left, and Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S6d-g). The cell type labels along the inhibitory neuron trajectory confirmed that the neural tube and radial glia cells are more enriched in the early, neural progenitor cells are enriched in the intermediate, and inhibitory neuron progenitors and inhibitory neurons are enriched at late stages (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S6h). Five-gene group dynamic pattern is identified along the pseudo time and mainly include early active (group 4), intermediate active (group 5), and late active (groups 1 and 2) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>e, right). What is more, we aggregate the FIPRESCI signal from the cells of inhibitory neuron lineages based on the pseudo time into three stages and identify several dozens of TSS switches from the paired comparison of adjacent stages (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>f, up). A representative example is Rbfox2 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>f, bottom), also known as RBM9, a multifunction RNA binding protein, which has a well-established role in alternative splicing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] and recruitment of PRC2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Our results clearly show that at the early stage, Rbfox2 mainly uses the most upstream promoter while the downstream promoter which skips the first two exons get strongly activated at the intermediate and late stages (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>f, bottom). Our results provide a resource for future studies to dissect the function and mechanism of the cell type-specific and developmental regulated TSS switch. Collectively, those results suggest FIPRESCI reveals the heterogeneity of complex cellular systems with high efficiency and flexibility and uncover widespread previously unexplored TSS switch (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S6i).</p>

      <title>FIPRESCI enables efficient single-cell transcriptional profiling of human peripheral T cells</title>
      <p id="Par18">To further prove that our method can be used for large-scale single-cell atlas projects by substantially increasing the sample throughput by multiplexing, we applied FIPRESCI to human primary T cells from 14 donors across 5 cancer types and healthy people. Each cancer type contains at least 2 donors. CD3 + T cells are sorted from PBMC by FACS. All the samples are processed in a single FIPRESCI experiment so the batch effects will be minimized. We use 96-plex in the first round of indexing, thus 6–12 different (round1) barcodes may represent the same sample identity and the corresponding data can be considered as technical replicates. In parallel, we enriched the V(D)J sequences from transcriptome libraries by PCR for single-cell T cell receptor(TCR) mapping (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>a, left and middle).</p>
      <p id="Par19">Sample demultiplexing using two-round barcodes and quality-control filtering resulted in a final scRNA-seq dataset including 53,183 cells. It is known that distinct subpopulations of T cells, such as effector, regulatory, and γδ, are hard to be separated by scRNA-seq technologies alone. We, therefore, integrated our data with a well-annotated multimodal reference dataset for PBMC, in which subpopulations are jointly defined by mRNA and surface protein expression from CITE-seq with a ‘‘weighted-nearest neighbor’’ (WNN) analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. After applying the Seurat 4.0.5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] integration procedure, 41,377 cells with high prediction scores were retained. Twelve types of T cells and NK cells appearing on the reference dataset were recovered in our data. These cell types include CD4 + T cells (4 clusters), CD8 + T cells (3 clusters), unconventional T cells (4 clusters), and NK cells (1 cluster) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>a, right). It is encouraging that although the reference dataset includes all the cell types from PBMCs, 41,093 (99.3%) of our data are annotated as T cells, almost no B cells, dendritic cells, erythrocytes, and other monocytes, suggesting the high quality of annotation (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S7a-d). The expression of signature genes and known functional markers confirmed clusters of CD4 + (naïve, effector memory, central memory), conventional CD8 + (naïve, effector memory cells), and regulatory T cells (Treg) (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S8a-b).

      <title>Peripheral T cells exhibit a specific composition and transcriptome in cancer donors</title>
      <p id="Par20">We next compared the composition of the T cell subtypes detected in our data with the CITE-seq dataset from healthy donors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. The proportions of various cell types of our healthy donors were very similar to the reference PBMC atlas (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S9a-b). However, we observed that the frequencies of naïve T cells (including CD4 + and CD8 +) in cancer donors were much lower than that of healthy individuals, and the frequencies of Tregs were substantially higher in most cancer donors (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b-c</xref>, and Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S9a-c), especially in pancreatic cancer donors. Notably, Tregs were abundant in cancer donors’ blood is consistent with the previous report based on flow cytometry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Moreover, Tregs frequency positively correlates with tumor metastasis and poor prognosis in human patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Our data confirmed that an abnormal proportion of T cells from peripheral blood may be a sign of cancer patients.</p>
      <p id="Par21">The FIPRESCI data enables identifying differential expression genes between healthy donors and cancer patients (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S10). Interestingly, some of the T cells’ commonly expressed genes are specifically upregulated in certain cancers type compared with healthy donors. Such as CMSS1 and ZHX2 in uterine cancer, OSBPL8, FAM214A in breast cancer, TPT1, GPRIN3, and VAV3 in pancreatic cancer. Some genes are preferentially expressed in certain T cell subtypes but show a commonly dysregulated pattern in all cancers. For example, AOAH (a lipase acyloxyacyl hydrolase) and MAML2 (a transcriptional coactivator in the NOTCH-signaling pathway) are commonly downregulated in all cancers. On the contrary, CCL5 (a key T cell chemokine) is commonly upregulated in all cancers (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S10). These results indicated that FIPRESCI data of T cell populations isolated from peripheral blood could be used to identify cancer-specific gene signatures for diagnosis and prognosis.</p>
      <p id="Par22">Next, we leverage the FIPRESCI single-cell data to explore the subpopulation difference of Treg cells between cancer and healthy donors. Unsupervised clustering of Treg cells from all donors reveals 5 clusters. Surprisingly, Treg cells from healthy donors are significantly enriched in cluster 1, while cells from cancer donors seem evenly distributed across all the clusters (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>d). Further breakdown of individual donors suggests that Cluster 1 is shared by healthy and cancer donors but mainly from 4 cancer donors, S9, S1, S10, and S3. Clusters 0,2,3,4 are almost exclusively contributed by cancer donors and collectively 2/3 of cancer donors have a distinct pattern compared to the healthy donor (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>e). There is strong heterogeneity across individual patients within the same cancer type except for pancreatic cancer. CytoTRACE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] analysis suggests cluster 1 is a more naïve state while cluster 2,0,3,4 may represent terminally differentiated or effector states (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>f). We construct a “cancer index” based on the ratio of cluster1 and non-cluster1 cells, and the results suggest most cancer can be distinguished from healthy samples although a small proportion of cancer samples may lie in an intermediate zone (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>g). Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) are under intensive study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], and T cells from cancer patients’ peripheral blood are usually only used as a control to identify tumor environment-enriched T cell population. However, our analysis uncover previously unrecognized strong heterogeneity among cancer patients in terms of the extent of crosstalk between peripheral blood and tumor environment. In sum, our results highlight the importance of the classification of cancer patients based on the peripheral blood T cell population before using peripheral blood data as a control to study the TILs.</p>

      <title>FIPRESCI is compatible with single-cell immune repertoire profiling</title>
      <p id="Par23">We enriched the paired single-cell TCR VDJ sequences from FIPRESCI cDNA products of the above T cells by nested PCR according to the 10X Genomics manufacturer’s protocol (Chromium Single Cell V(D)J Reagent Kits). After nested PCR enrichment, the first round of barcodes introduced by Tn5 tagmentation were eliminated. Therefore, in the VDJ-sequencing data analysis, droplets containing more than one cell (multiplets) were detected and removed based on two rounds of barcode information from corresponding scRNA sequencing data. As a result, TCR clonotypes were detected from 4936 cells across all 13 cell types after quality-control filtering (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>b, and Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S12. a). We quantified V gene usage, and the top4 V gene segment usage observed no bias across each cell type (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>a). The V and J gene usage varied in cancer donors, while the use of the TRB V genes in two healthy donors was very similar (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S12a,b). We quantified the length distribution of the CDR3 sequences in each donor and found that the capture of TRA and TRB was unbiased across the donors (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S12c,d). Cells with the same CDR3 sequences for both the TCR α-chain and β-chain were defined as the same clonotype. We observed that clonotype composition in each sample varied by clone size. However, the proportion of the top 100 clone size has increased in most patients compared with healthy controls (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>e, Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S12b).<fig id="Fig5"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption><p>FIPRESCI is compatible with single-cell immune repertoire profiling.<bold> a</bold> UMAP shows the top 4 V genes usages in TRB. <bold>b</bold> Bar plots show the number of cells detected TCR VDJ by cell types (4,983). <bold>c</bold> Box plots showing the TCR clonal diversity.

      <p id="Par24">Moreover, the number of unique clonotypes in each sample varied by cell type. However, compared with most cancer patients, the unique clonotypes of healthy donors were abundant in naïve cells (including CD4 + and CD8 +), while fewer were in Treg cells (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>d, and Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S12c). TCR clonal diversity was significantly lower in endometrial cancer and stomach cancer donors compared with healthy controls, while the diversity of breast cancer and liver cancer patients was comparable to that of healthy people, which may be due to these patients being in the early stages of cancer. (Diversity is calculated using two metrics: (1) Shannon, (2) inverse Simpson) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>e, and Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S12d).</p>
      <p id="Par25">Clonotypes were rarely shared across cancer patients (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S13a-c), and most clonotypes were singletons, representing a diverse repertoire of peripheral T cells. However, many clonotypes resided in multiple cell types in one patient, especially in stomach cancer patients, uterine cancer, and some breast cancer pancreatic patients (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S13c), indicating the clonal expansion of T cells in these patients. Furthermore, the proportions of different types of cells detected with TCR clonotypes varied greatly among donors (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>f). Compared with healthy donors, most patients showed abundant Treg which is consistent with previous transcriptome-based composition analysis. What is more, we found that there are two TCR sequences from patient S2 and one TCR sequence from patient S5 are clustered together with NeoTCRs recently reported (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S13d), raising the possibility of identification of cancer-reactive T cells in peripheral blood by FIPRESCI with deeper sampling. These results suggested that FIPRESCI enables single-cell VDJ analysis and provides a critical additional layer of information of clonotype and antigen specificity to study cancer-related T cells.</p>

    <title>Discussion</title>
    <p id="Par26">In summary, we presented FIPRESCI, a simple, efficient, and massive-scale single-cell transcriptomics approach that is compatible with both fresh or fixed cells and nuclei. In addition, FIPRESCI specifically captures the 5′-end of the transcript, which contains rich information for studying gene regulation as it enables the identification of active TSSs and detects distal transcribed cis-regulatory elements. Only ~ 2% of FIPRESCI data are contributed by eRNA reads, and there may be many eRNAs that are too short to be detected. However, thousands of pairs of eRNA and protein-coding genes can be observed co-expressed in the same single cell, which may provide a unique opportunity to explore gene regulation. Further sophisticated deep learning prediction or imputation models based on multi-omics reference datasets may leverage the scalability of FIPRESCI and extend the utility of data to other modalities, such as chromatin accessibility or protein expression. Moreover, the single-cell RNA-5′end-sequencing method provides a widely used strategy for profiling full-length immune receptor repertoire information and gene expression from the same cell. So far, there is only a limited number of scRNA-seq protocols designed to capture the 5′-end of the transcript. Most of them are low throughput or costly. We demonstrated FIPRESCI can increase throughput by at least tenfold over the standard 10X Genomics 5′ scRNA-seq procedure. We applied FIPRESCI to investigate gene expression and TCR repertoires at single-cell resolution for T cells from PBMC of 14 donors across 5 cancer types and healthy individuals. Distinct composition, transcriptomic features, and TCR clonotype of T cell subtypes across cancer patients were identified from our data. A single experiment of FIPRESCI can be completed by a single person in 12 h. Thus, it will accelerate the large-scale study of the profile of the transcriptomes, regulomes, and immune receptor repertoires from millions of single cells or thousands of samples.</p>
    <p id="Par27">Similar to the previous report, we found methanol fixation does not affect the cell type clustering, but certain types of biological analyses that may be influenced by the GC content or transcript length need to use caution when interpreting the results from FIPRESCI data with methanol fixation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Our approach adds a seamless whole transcriptome single-molecule preindexing step to standard droplet microfluidic 5′ sc(n)-RNA-seq workflow, thus is complementary to other efforts which try to enhance the throughput, flexibility, or efficiency. FIPRESCI is a single-cell combinatorial indexing strategy using droplet microfluidic. It is conceptually distinct from sample multiplexing approaches which can only increase the cell throughput moderately as the data from doublets are not resolved but discarded. FIPRESCI can make the data from doublets useful thus increasing the cell throughput exponentially. Although single-cell combinatorial indexing has built-in support for massive sample multiplexing by using the first round barcode to record the sample identity, a recent study shows that it can be beneficial to incorporate single-cell combinatorial indexing with a sample labeling strategy(nuclear hashing) to achieve high efficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. In addition, the optimization of the reagent chemistry (e.g., the 5′ Library &amp; Gel Bead Kit v1 upgrade to v2) and increasing the number of the droplets (e.g., Chromium Controller upgrade to Chromium X) can straightforwardly be incorporated into the current FIPRESCI workflow without further configuration. FIPRESCI is expected to support multi-omics assays, such as simultaneous expression profiling of the transcriptome and surface proteins from the same cell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], antigen specificity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>], CRISPR screening, and spatial transcriptomics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. In principle, it is feasible to adapt FIPRESCI to other microfluidic or microwell platforms which support TSO barcoding based 5′-end sc(n)-RNA-seq.</p>

    <title>Conclusions</title>
    <p id="Par28">In conclusion, due to the low cost and ultra-high throughput of FIPRESCI, it is suitable for multi-sample and large-scale single-cell transcriptomics profiling, especially when capturing the 5′-end of transcript is important. FIPRESCI enables us to acquire multiple layers of additional information from a single scRNA-seq experiment with high efficiency. We expect that FIPRESCI can be applied immediately to a wide range of fields to provide important insights, such as large-scale cell atlas studies, organ development studies across time and space, single-cell immune receptor repertoire studies for large-scale cohorts of diseases (e.g., cancer, autoimmune, severe pandemics such as Coronavirus disease 2019), high-throughput CRISPR, and/or drug screens.</p>

Remained reads were overlapped with bins from the scATAC-seq bin matrix to get read counts at each peak. Thirdly, we filtered bins occurring in fewer than 0.1% of cells or more than 10% of cells.

To reduce multiple overlaps when coordinate shift, bedtools was implemented to compute the intersection between predicted peaks and whole genome bins (bedtools -f = 0.5), then we got 327,516 bins as bin set A, while from bulk ATAC-seq peaks and whole genome bins, we got 23,284 bins as bin set B (bedtools -f = 0.2). The common bin number in Set A and Set B is 14,676. After ranking overlapped predicted peak bin signals, we computed the correlation between the top 6000 predicted peak signals and experimental bulk peak signals.</p>

      <title>Analysis of E10.5 mouse embryo gene expression profile</title>
      <p id="Par80">We used Seurat (version 4.0.5) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] to analyze the E10.5 mouse embryo gene expression profile from FIPRESCI snRNA-seq. Firstly, cells with mitochondria ratio &gt; 5% and gene number detected &lt; 50 were filtered. After normalization and PCA, the top 20 PCs were used to construct a KNN graph by the Seurat function “FindNeighbors”. Then, the Louvain algorithm was applied to clustering with resolution = 0.4. Differentially expressed genes for each cluster were identified by the Seurat function “FindAllMarkers” (parameters: only.pos = TRUE) and other default parameters. UMAP was performed for visualization.</p>
      <p id="Par81">For integration analysis, we downloaded a public scRNA-seq profiled mouse organogenesis atlas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. For convenient calculation, we used randomly sampled 20,000 annotated E10.5 mouse embryo cells from the atlas as reference. Before label transfer, the normalization method SCtransform [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>] was applied to our FIPRESCI data to reduce the sequencing depth’s impact. Then, we performed label transfer by Seurat function “FindTransferAnchors” (parameters: normalization.method = “SCT”, reference.reduction = “pca”, dim = “1:20”) and Seurat function “TransferData”. After label transfer, we filtered cells whose prediction score is smaller than 0.4.</p>

      <title>Trajectory analysis of E10.5 mouse brain</title>
      <p id="Par82">We mainly used monocle3 (version 1.0.0) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] to analyze the E10.5 mouse brain trajectory. We extracted brain cells from whole E10.5 mouse embryo FIPRESCI data. Then we implemented Scanpy (version 1.8.2) to construct a PAGA (Partition-based Graph Abstraction) graph. UMAP embedding of those cells was renewed by the Scanpy function “Scanpy.tl.umap” (parameters: init_pos = “paga”). Monocle3 was applied to the renewed UMAP embedding cells. Trajectory was learned by monocle3 function “learn_graph” (parameters: close_loop = FALSE) and other default parameters. With the prior knowledge that Neural Tube cells are the earliest cells, we programmatically determined the root principal node in trajectory: firstly, grouping cells according to which trajectory graph node they are nearest to, then calculating what fraction of the earliest cells (Neural Tube) at each node, node who is most heavily occupied by the earliest cells is selected as root (source code is available at monocle3 tutorial pages). Beginning with the root node, pseudo time was assigned to each cell by the monocle3 function “order_cells” with default settings.</p>
      <p id="Par83">Trajectory graph-correlated genes were identified by the monocle3 function “graph_test” with default settings. Then we selected genes with a <italic>q</italic> value smaller than 0.01 after “graph_test”. Gene modules were identified using those genes by the monocle3 function “find_gene_modules” (parameters: resolution = 0.1, partition_qval = 0.01).</p>
      <p id="Par84">Focused on inhibitory neuron trajectory, we selected inhibitory neuron trajectory related trajectory nodes, graphs, and cells to obtain an inhibitory neuron trajectory sub-graph from the whole graph. We also identified trajectory graph-correlated genes by monocle3 function “graph_test”. Genes with <italic>q</italic> value &lt; 0.05 and Moran’s index &gt; 0.05 after “graph_test” are selected as graph-correlated genes. Then <italic>K</italic>-mean clustering (<italic>k</italic> = 5) was performed on those genes (gene verse pseudo time matrix). Finally, we use ComplexHeatmap (version 2.6.2) to show those graph-correlated gene expression’s dynamic changes along pseudo time.</p>

      <title>TSS analysis of E10.5 mouse brain from FIPRESCI</title>
      <p id="Par85">We used the Paraclu peak caller [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>] to identify TSS. For unsupervised clusters, we first grouped unique mapping reads according to clusters. We call peaks by Paraclu peak caller per cluster. Then we merged peaks from all clusters by bedtools (Version v2.30.0) and filter peaks whose width is greater than 300 bp. Finally, peaks whose distance to any annotated TSS (from mm10 reference genome) is smaller than 100 bp would survive. Those survived peaks are regarded as TSS peaks. Reads mapping those TSS peaks can be regarded using the corresponding TSSs.</p>
      <p id="Par86">For inhibitory neuron trajectory TSS analysis, we first grouped unique mapping reads by equally 10 bins of pseudo time. Then we merged the first 3 bins (in pseudo time increasing order) as the early stage of trajectory, the 4th to 7th bins as the medium stage, and the 8th to 10th bins as the later stage. We used the same peak calling strategy described before, the only difference is we used 3 groups of reads (early, medium, and later) rather than 15 unsupervised clusters.</p>
      <p id="Par87">To control for differences in overall gene expression, we computed the relative usage for each TSS by its read proportion of all TSS reads in the corresponding gene. This usage proportion would be converted to an integer by multiple scale factor 100 and then ceiling to the nearest integer. Within a cluster, we treated a gene’s TSS read count value as missing if the sum of its TSSs’ reads is smaller than 0.5 quantile or greater than 0.99 quantiles over the cluster’s gene TSSs’ read count distribution. We compared the relative usage for the set of TSSs in a given gene between each pair of samples using Fisher’s exact test implemented using the R function fisher.test. The test was performed on the 2 (samples used for comparison) by <italic>n</italic> (TSSs within one gene) table. We then took the minimum Benjamini-Hochberg-corrected <italic>p</italic>-value across all comparisons (for the multiple comparisons per gene), reported as the <italic>p</italic>-value for differential usage across the samples within a gene. Within one TSS, the variance between the 2 samples that used the top 2 most proportion of that TSS was reported as the variance of the TSS.</p>
