    <abstract>
      <p>Proteins are biological units whose essence is defined by their functional relationships with other proteins or biomolecules such as RNA, DNA, lipids, or carbohydrates. These functions encompass enzymatic, structural, regulatory, or physical interaction roles. The STRING database (Nucleic Acids Research, 8 Jan 2021;49(D1): D605-12) provides an index that defines the functional interaction networks between proteins in model organisms. To facilitate the identification, visualization, and evaluation of potential functional networks across organisms from different phylogenetic lineages, we have developed PhyloString (<ext-link xlink:href="https://biocomputo.ibt.unam.mx/phylostring" ext-link-type="uri">https://biocomputo.ibt.unam.mx/phylostring/</ext-link>), a web server that utilizes the indices of the STRING database. PhyloString decomposes these functional networks into modules, representing cohesive units of proteins grouped based on their similarity of STRING values and the phylogenetic origins of their respective organisms. This study presents and thoroughly discusses examples of such functional networks and their modules identified using PhyloString.</p>

    <p>Proteins are fundamental units of cells, playing crucial roles in growth, development, maintenance, and functionality by contributing to the structure, metabolism, regulation, and communication within cellular systems. Their essence, as cellular entities, is defined by their physical and functional interactions with other proteins and various types of biomolecules, including DNA or RNA molecules, lipids, carbohydrates, and cofactors. Numerous databases have been established to comprehensively compile and analyze the vast results generated from protein interaction studies. The creation and maintenance of these databases involve methodological and conceptual challenges such as utilizing standardized vocabularies and formats for protein and interaction descriptions, meticulous curation of information from scientific publications, and establishing a consistent approach for identifying the same protein across different databases. These challenges and a review of the most significant protein-protein interaction databases have been extensively discussed in [<xref rid="pone.0297010.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0297010.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p>
    <p>Among the various databases of protein-protein interactions, the STRING database deserves special mention due to its inclusion of physical and functional interactions between sets of two or more proteins [<xref rid="pone.0297010.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. This functional interaction of proteins can arise through various instances, such as sharing the same substrate in a metabolic pathway or being components of the same protein complex [<xref rid="pone.0297010.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p>
    <p>STRING is a comprehensive database that integrates experimentally validated and computationally predicted protein-protein interactions. Its initial version was developed as a web application primarily used to identify functionally related genes in prokaryotic organisms by analyzing the conservation of the same genomic neighborhood across different genomes [<xref rid="pone.0297010.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Over time, STRING has expanded to include additional sources of information, such as (i) genomic context analysis, which involves examining gene fusion events, conservation of genomic neighborhood, and phylogenetic co-occurrence profiles of orthologous gene pairs across different genomes; (ii) primary evidence obtained from experimental protein-protein interactions and gene co-expression experiments, meticulously curated from the scientific literature; (iii) manually curated pathway databases; and (iv) utilization of automatic literature mining techniques to identify genes that are co-mentioned within the abstracts of scientific publications. Afterward, this information is weighted by STRING based on the probabilities of proteins being present in the same metabolic pathway, as defined by the metabolic maps from the KEGG database (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) [<xref rid="pone.0297010.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. These weighted values are then integrated into a meaningful confidence score ranging from zero to 1,000, representing the strength of the physical or functional relationships for all protein interactions.</p>
    <p>A fundamental characteristic of STRING is that the information collected for one organism is transferred to other organisms within its database [<xref rid="pone.0297010.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0297010.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. To achieve this, functional equivalence is assigned to orthologous genes based on the orthologous groups defined by the COG database [<xref rid="pone.0297010.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Consequently, STRING provides a user-friendly web page that presents information on protein-protein interactions as a network. In this network, proteins (or their corresponding orthologous COG groups) serve as nodes (or vertices), while the edges represent the different types of evidence supporting the physical or functional protein-protein interactions.</p>
    <p>From a System Biology perspective, considering the entire network of physical or functional interactions within a cell is crucial to comprehensively define a protein’s function in a specific organism. This implies that while orthologous proteins may share similar physicochemical or enzymatic properties, their functions can vary depending on the presence or absence of their respective interaction partners, which contribute to their functional networks.</p>
    <p>In this study, we have developed PhyloString (<ext-link xlink:href="https://biocomputo.ibt.unam.mx/phylostring/" ext-link-type="uri">https://biocomputo.ibt.unam.mx/phylostring/</ext-link>), a web server that enables the analysis of protein functional modularity across different phylogenetic lineages in biological processes. PhyloString utilizes the functional relationships between proteins as defined in the STRING database [<xref rid="pone.0297010.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. By clustering proteins into modules based on their STRING scores and phylogenetic origins, PhyloString visually represents these modules using a heatmap. Additionally, PhyloString evaluates the statistical significance of protein enrichment within the modules.</p>
    <p>This article presents representative examples of differential protein-protein functional relationship modules identified among phylogenetic lineages using PhyloString. These examples are thoroughly discussed, highlighting the importance of understanding protein functional modularity across different evolutionary lineages.</p>

      <title>Data sources</title>
      <p>The STRING database v12.0 compiles information from 12,535 organisms, out of which 2,426 are categorized as core or reference organisms. Details about these organisms are structured into flat files, which were downloaded from its website at <ext-link xlink:href="https://string-db.org/" ext-link-type="uri">https://string-db.org/</ext-link>. These files included, among others: a) the orthologous groups and their proteins (COG.mappings.v12.0.txt); b) the name of the organisms and their taxonomic IDs (species.v12.0.txt); c) association scores between orthologous groups (COG.links.v12.0.txt); d) the full name of the organism´s lineage (fullnamelineage.dmp).</p>
      <p>This version of STRING includes functional relationships for protein orthology groups found mainly in bacterial organisms (COG) and eukaryotic organisms (KOG). To simplify, in this article, we will use the term COG to refer to both COG and KOG.</p>

      <title>Statistical analysis and heatmap construction</title>
      <p>We developed an R script (R version 4.3.0) to parse the data obtained from the STRING database (version v12.0). PhyloString facilitates assessing the distribution of biological functions, metabolic processes, structural elements, or regulatory complexes across diverse phylogenetic clades. To achieve this, PhyloString carries out several bioinformatics processes, as shown in <xref rid="pone.0297010.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>.</p>

          <title>Schematic representation of the primary steps employed by PhyloString.</title>
          <p>A) Using a COG as a query seed that describes the biological functions, metabolic processes, structural elements, or regulatory complexes PhyloString selects the orthologous groups meeting the user-defined STRING cutoff value, forming a network of protein-protein functional interactions. B) PhyloString assesses the frequency of each COG presence within the functional interaction network across genomes in various phylogenetic clades. This information is used to construct a binary matrix indicating presence (1) or absence (0). A value of 0 is assigned if the number of organisms with a particular orthologous group in a phylogenetic clade is less than 50%, and 1 otherwise. C) Each cell in the binary presence/absence matrix is multiplied by the STRING index representing the functional association between the seed COG and the COG of that cell. D) PhyloString generates a heatmap using these values and applies hierarchical clustering to both rows (representing different phylogenetic clades) and columns (representing distinct COG orthologous groups). The clustering process results in the heatmap being divided into specific areas or modules, indicating cohesive units of highly functionally related proteins. In the article, these modules are denoted in parentheses by two numbers separated by a comma, representing the horizontal and vertical positions, respectively. The horizontal position corresponds to the COGs cluster number, and the vertical to the phylogenetic cluster number.</p>

      </fig>
      <p>The analysis initiates by selecting a characteristic COG group as a seed query for the case study. Using this seed group, PhyloString identifies all functionally related COGs, surpassing a specified cut-off value according to the STRING index. This set of COGs thus selected are functionally related, either by participating in the same biological process, metabolic pathway, or structural complex, so they can be considered to form a network of functional protein-protein interactions (<xref rid="pone.0297010.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>). Subsequently, PhyloString evaluates the presence (1) or absence (0) of each COG defined as functionally related to the seed group within various phylogenetic clades. PhyloString assigns a value of 0 to a COG if the number of organisms with that COG in that phylogenetic clade is less than 50%, while a value of 1 is assigned if the frequency exceeds this threshold (<xref rid="pone.0297010.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>). These binary values are then multiplied by the corresponding STRING functional relationship index recorded for each COG pair (<xref rid="pone.0297010.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1C</xref>). The resulting values are employed to construct protein-protein interaction heatmaps (<xref rid="pone.0297010.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1D</xref>).</p>
      <p>To depict the functional proximity between the initial seed COG and each COG presented in the heatmap, a color code was employed. The colors ranged from lighter shades like yellow to darker hues such as cherry or black, representing weak to strong functional associations, respectively. The value scale diagram used in all heatmaps is illustrated in <xref rid="pone.0297010.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig</xref>.</p>
      <p>PhyloString enables users to conduct this analysis at two taxonomic levels: the phylum and class levels. To ensure rapid performance, PhyloString provides a collection of <italic toggle="yes">pre-processed analyses</italic> with readily selectable default values from the main web page. Nevertheless, PhyloString also offers flexibility for <italic toggle="yes">Advanced analysis</italic>, allowing users to customize parameter values to their preferences.</p>
      <p>Protein-protein interaction heatmaps are created using the <italic toggle="yes">pheatmap</italic> library in the RStudio software (Version 1.0.12). This library generates heatmaps with hierarchical clustering of the input data matrix applied to both rows, representing the different phylogenetic clades, and columns, representing the different orthologous groups (COGs).</p>
      <p>Among the various distance metrics accessible in <italic toggle="yes">pheatmap</italic>, the Euclidean distance is the default choice in our pre-compiled analyses. This preference is due to its simplicity and capability to generate biologically meaningful outcomes in most cases. Furthermore, the Euclidean distance stands as one of the most frequently employed distance metrics in various biological studies. However, within the <italic toggle="yes">Advanced analysis</italic> option of PhyloString, users have the flexibility to opt, in addition to the Euclidean distance, other metrics, including the Manhattan distance, the Minkowski distance, and the Maximum distance. In addition, the new version of PhyloString includes new options for the clustering procedure other than the Complete method, which is the default method. In the <italic toggle="yes">Advanced analysis</italic> option of PhyloString, users can use alternative clustering methods, including the Single, Average, Median, Ward.D, Ward.D2, and Centroid methods. Descriptions of the Clustering methods and Distance matrices employed in the clustering procedure are described in the <xref rid="pone.0297010.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0297010.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2</xref> Tables, respectively, and included in the new PhyloString Help webpage.</p>
      <p>The heatmaps are divided horizontally and vertically based on the user-selected number of COG and phylogenetic divisions, respectively. These selections are then used as the <italic toggle="yes">cluster_rows and cluster_columns</italic> parameters in the <italic toggle="yes">pheatmap</italic> library. To evaluate the enrichment of COG groups within the various modules, we used the hypergeometric distribution, which models the probability of achieving a precise count of successes when making a set number of draws without replacement from a finite population composed of known successes and failures. The analysis of the hypergeometric distribution was conducted using the <italic toggle="yes">phyper</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">dhyper</italic> functions of the RStudio software and involves four key parameters, which are as follows:</p>
      <list list-type="order">
        <list-item>
          <p>The Population Size (N), in our case, corresponds to the total number of cells in the heatmap, which is determined by multiplying the number of phylogenetic clades by the number of COGs in the heatmap.</p>
        </list-item>
        <list-item>
          <p>The number of Successes in the Population (H) represents instances where any COG within the heatmap is found in at least 50% of the organisms from a particular phylogenetic clade under study. In simpler terms, it counts all heatmap cells with values greater than 0 in this context.</p>
        </list-item>
        <list-item>
          <p>The Sample Size (n) refers to the count of cells present in a specific subset of the heatmap. This subset is determined by the combination of COG groups and phylogenetic classes identified during the clustering process. The total number of potential heatmap subsets corresponds to the product of the chosen COG groups and phylogenetic groups initially selected by the user for analysis.</p>
        </list-item>
        <list-item>
          <p>The number of Successes in the Sample (h) represents the count of cases in which any COG exists in at least 50% of the organisms within a particular phylogenetic clade present in the module of the heatmap under analysis.

      <title>Defining COG seeds from protein sequences</title>
      <p>As previously mentioned, every PhyloString analysis requires a COG seed as the central point around which functional neighbors are selected for heatmap display. In cases where there is no readily available COG seed or a keyword to facilitate seed identification, but a protein sequence is related to the study, PhyloString can determine its corresponding COG based on its sequence similarity to a reference database build with a non-redundant set of proteins of the STRING´s core organisms. To this end, the proteins of organisms classified as core were grouped in accordance with their COG assignation. The groups built in this way were processed to remove redundant proteins using the cd-hit program [<xref rid="pone.0297010.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] and a sequence identity using a threshold of 0.8.</p>

      <title>Webpage construction</title>
      <p>The PhyloString webpage comprises a four-layer structure: i) the database layer, where the data is processed by <italic toggle="yes">ad hoc</italic> scripts that read several input parameters and pre-process data from our set of 4,510 COG and 3,131 KOG groups; ii) the frontend layer comprises html5, JavaScript, and Cascading Style Sheets 3 (CSS3) codes. This second layer allows the users to manipulate the backend layer; iii) the pre-render layer is an intermediate layer where the server accesses its APIs, retrieves values from the database, and establishes the foundation for creating charts based on user-input data. This is the most complex layer, constructed using a combination of PHP, JavaScript, Perl, and C frameworks, as well as custom scripts over an implementation of the amCharts software; iv) the backend layer is the last. It takes user input selections, processes them using allocated values from the database, and generates human-readable graphics presented to the user inside the frontend layer. This backend layer was written in Hypertext Preprocessor (PHP) and Perl program languages.</p>

      <title>Web page construction</title>
      <p>We developed PhyloString, a web page designed to analyze protein-protein functional interaction networks based on data from the STRING database. These networks are represented as heatmaps, where each cell reflects the product of two factors: the binary classification of COG group frequencies in the studied phylogenetic lineages and the STRING score between pairs of COG groups. To perform a quick inspection, PhyloString has implemented a function that allows the user to obtain the information of each cell within the heatmap when the user hovers their mouse over it. This information includes the phylogenetic group, the COG ID with its description, the count of organisms considered in the specific cell, and its corresponding score.</p>
      <p>To assess the prevalence of specific subsets of COGs within protein-protein functional interaction networks, we performed a clustering analysis of the heatmap cells using their corresponding STRING values. Our approach involved dividing the list of COGs and organisms into user-defined divisions, COG centers (2 to 6), and Phylogenetic centers (3 to 5), as displayed on the PhyloString webpage. As a result, the heatmaps are segmented into distinct rectangular areas called "Modules." These modules represent cohesive sets of proteins that perform closely related functions within the entire functional network. Furthermore, PhyloString evaluates the statistical significance of COG enrichment within different modules of the heatmaps, presenting the enrichment analysis results as supplementary tables.</p>
      <p>To facilitate the functional networks analysis, PhyloString provides flexibility in setting cut-off values for STRING scores (specifically, 900, 850, 800, 750, and 700). Additionally, users can choose the desired level of taxonomic depth for analysis, whether by considering the <italic toggle="yes">Phylum</italic> or <italic toggle="yes">Class</italic> of the organisms. This customizable approach enables users to explore and interpret the data more effectively.</p>
      <p>PhyloString offers a help webpage and a tutorial webpage designed to offer users a comprehensive understanding of the web server. These pages aim to clarify the necessary input parameters for their studies, outline the different sections in the analysis output, and guide users through the essential steps of a standard study. Additionally, they provide valuable tips for maximizing the capabilities of PhyloString. The key steps utilized by PhyloString are depicted in <xref rid="pone.0297010.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>.</p>

      <title>Representative examples of the use of PhyloString</title>
      <p>To illustrate the diverse range of analysis achievable with PhyloString, we present a set of examples centered in essential cellular processes. The functional relationships between proteins in these processes are visualized as heatmaps, where cohesive and integrated modules are identified, representing tightly functionally related proteins. Throughout the text, the modules are denoted by their positions in the heatmaps, enclosed in round parentheses, representing their corresponding COG and phylogenetic groups, respectively.</p>

        <title>i) Ribosomal and other proteins that are involved in the translation process</title>
        <p>Ribosomes are essential cellular complexes composed of small proteins and RNA molecules. They play a crucial role across all three domains of life, Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya, in translating mRNA into proteins by catalyzing the assembly of amino acids into polypeptide chains. However, the complexity of ribosomes varies depending on the phylogenetic origin of the organism. Bacterial organisms show the lowest, followed by archaeal organisms, while eukaryotic organisms exhibit the highest level of complexity in their ribosomal composition [<xref rid="pone.0297010.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0297010.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p>
        <p>Despite the differences in composition, ribosomes of all three domains of life possess a common set of 34 proteins that are universally conserved and are the central core of their structure. This set of proteins is responsible for the ribosome´s main functions, such as peptide bond formation during protein synthesis [<xref rid="pone.0297010.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0297010.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In addition, there is a set of ribosomal proteins common to archaeal and eukaryotic organisms, while some others are exclusively found in bacterial and eukaryotic organisms.</p>
        <p>To investigate the phylogenetic distribution of proteins involved in the translation process, we utilized PhyloString to analyze the functional relationships within the COG0199, which clusters the S14 orthologous ribosomal proteins. The resulting analysis is presented in the heatmap shown in <xref rid="pone.0297010.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>. This figure reveals that COGs of modules (4,1), (4,2), and (4,3) (COG group 4, <xref rid="pone.0297010.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Table</xref>) form part of the core ribosomal proteins shared by Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya (phylogenetic groups 1–3, <xref rid="pone.0297010.s007" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4 Table</xref>). The statistical values for the COG enrichment within this group can be found in the supplementary material (<xref rid="pone.0297010.s008" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5 Table</xref>). Furthermore, we observed that COGs of modules (3,2) and (3,3) mainly correspond to proteins shared by Archaea and Eukarya, while COGs of modules (2,1) and (2,3) are primarily associated with proteins shared by Bacteria and Eukarya. Lastly, module (1,1) corresponds to proteins mainly present in Bacteria.</p>

        <title>ii) Amino acid biosynthesis. Tryptophan autotrophic and heterotrophic organisms identified by PhyloString</title>
        <p>L-tryptophan is one of the scarcest amino acids found in most proteins and the most costly to synthesize in terms of cell resources [<xref rid="pone.0297010.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In many bacterial organisms, the genes coding for the enzymes involved in the tryptophan biosynthesis are transcribed in the same polycistronic unit to facilitate their coordinated expression. To identify the overall distribution of L-tryptophan autotrophic and heterotrophic organisms, we used the COG0147 that clustered the anthranilate synthases component I enzymes, TrpE. The result of this analysis is shown in <xref rid="pone.0297010.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>.</p>

        <p>Module (2,1) of the heatmap of <xref rid="pone.0297010.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref> clusters all the autotrophic organisms having the enzymes involved in L-tryptophan biosynthesis, which are clustered COG group 2 (<xref rid="pone.0297010.s009" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6 Table</xref>), and include the following enzymes: Anthranilate synthase TrpE (COG0147), which forms a complex with TrpG (COG0512) to convert chorismate and glutamine into anthranilate [<xref rid="pone.0297010.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]; TrpD (COG0547), known as anthranilate phosphoribosyl transferase, which transfers the phosphoribosyl group from 5-phosphorylribose-1-pyrophosphate to anthranilate, resulting in phosphoribosyl anthranilate; TrpF (COG0135), or phosphoribosyl anthranilate isomerase, which converts the phosphoribosyl anthranilate into carboxyphenylamino-deoxyribulse-5-phosphate. Additionally, TrpC (COG0134), referred to as indol-3-glycerol phosphate synthase, removes the carbon dioxide from carboxyphenylamino-deoxyribulse-5-phosphate resulting in the formation of indole-3-glycerol phosphate. Finally, the tryptophan synthase TrpA alpha chain (COG0159) cleaves the indoleglycerol phosphate to generate glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate and indole. The indole molecule generated in the previous step is used with L-serine by TrpB (COG0133), the beta chain of tryptophan synthase, to synthesize L-tryptophan.</p>
        <p>Although the biosynthesis of L-tryptophan from chorismate commonly requires the presence of all the pathway’s enzymes, in exceptional cases, the absence of an enzyme could be complemented by enzymes with a related activity. Notably, this complementation has been documented in the case of Actinobacteria that have lost the phosphoribosyl anthranilate isomerase <italic toggle="yes">trpF</italic> gene (COG0135), which has been complemented by the enzyme PirA that provides the required isomerase activity [<xref rid="pone.0297010.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Using PyloString, we identified that analogous complementation could also have occurred in some organisms that are members of the Thaumarchaeota phylum (see module (2,1)). Furthermore, the absence of certain enzymes within the modules (2,1) could indicate that certain organisms are in the process of losing the L-Trp pathway, as could be the case of the organisms belonging to the Annelida phylum. This phenomenon has been observed in various pathogens, including certain species within the genera Haemophilus, Coxiella, and Propionibacterium [<xref rid="pone.0297010.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p>
        <p>Organisms of the phylogenetic phyla of the module (2,1) of <xref rid="pone.0297010.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref> are considered prototrophs and are predominantly bacteria (Phyla group 1, <xref rid="pone.0297010.s010" ref-type="supplementary-material">S7 Table</xref>). On the other hand, organisms of modules (2,2), and (2,3) comprise auxotrophic organisms that require external sources of tryptophan for their growth and survival. This group of organisms primarily includes eukaryotic organisms (groups 2 and 3, <xref rid="pone.0297010.s010" ref-type="supplementary-material">S7 Table</xref>).

        <p>To further investigate the phylogenetic distribution of L-tryptophan auxotroph organisms, we repeated a similar analysis by selecting the "Class" option in the Phylogenetic level panel of the PhyloString web page. The heatmap and corresponding Tables are presented as Supplementary Material (<xref rid="pone.0297010.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Fig</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0297010.s012" ref-type="supplementary-material">S9</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0297010.s014" ref-type="supplementary-material">S11</xref> Tables). Interestingly, the COG groups obtained using both the "Phylum" and the "Class" options are almost the same (<xref rid="pone.0297010.s009" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0297010.s012" ref-type="supplementary-material">S9</xref> Tables), indicating that the functional relationships of the proteins involved in L-tryptophan biosynthesis are well-conserved across different phylogenetic lineages. However, when dividing the Phyla into their corresponding phylogenetic classes, specific tendencies within smaller groups of organisms become apparent. For instance, the Tissierellia and Erysipelotrichia classes, despite belonging to the Firmicutes phylum, which commonly comprises prototrophic organisms, lack the main enzymes of the L-trp biosynthesis pathway. A similar scenario is observed in the Proteobacteria class of Oligoflexia (<xref rid="pone.0297010.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Fig</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0297010.s013" ref-type="supplementary-material">S10 Table</xref>).</p>

        <title>iii) Key proteins involved in the eukaryotic transcription initiation process</title>
        <p>Transcription is the process by which the RNA polymerases (RNAPs) copy the information contained in the DNA into molecules of RNA. Although RNAPs in all three domains of life share a common evolutionary origin, important differences have been documented in the molecular mechanisms and proteins related to the transcription initiation process. In the case of bacterial RNAPs, the recognition of specific promoter sequences in DNA is facilitated by sigma factors. However, in the case of archaeal and eukaryotic RNAPs, sigma factors are absent. Instead, their recognition of promoter elements relies on different generalized transcription factors (GTFs) [<xref rid="pone.0297010.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0297010.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Furthermore, in eukaryotes, multiple types of nuclear RNAPs are responsible for transcribing distinct types of RNA. These transcription processes involve additional elements such as enhancers, silencers, and chromatin modifications (review in [<xref rid="pone.0297010.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]).</p>
        <p>One of the key components of the eukaryotic transcription initiation complex is the TATA-binding protein (TBP). Its primary function is to initiate transcription by RNA polymerase II at the promoters of protein-coding genes. TBP binds to a specific DNA sequence known as the TATA box, typically found in the promoter region of genes. The binding of the TBP to DNA initiates the recruitment of other transcription factors and RNA polymerase II. TBP It is an integral part of a larger protein complex known as the TFIID complex, which includes various TBP-associated factors.</p>
        <p>To have a broad overview of the proteins related to the eukaryotic transcription initiation process, we used the PhyloString web server with KOG1932 as input. This KOG corresponds to a TATA-binding protein-associated factor. The heatmap resulting from this analysis is shown in <xref rid="pone.0297010.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4</xref>, while the corresponding lists of COG groups and phylogeny groups, along with the statistical values indicating COG enrichment within this group, are provided in <xref rid="pone.0297010.s015" ref-type="supplementary-material">S12</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0297010.s017" ref-type="supplementary-material">S14</xref> Tables, respectively.</p>

            <p>The KOG1932 corresponds to a TATA-binding protein-associated factor. The parameters used in the analysis were: Phylogenetic level: Phylum, STRING cut-off: 800, COG centers: 2, Phylogenetic centers: 5. The first COG group includes proteins crucial to the process of transcription initiation in eukaryotic organisms. As anticipated, these proteins are absent in the fourth phylogenetic group, primarily composed of Bacteria and Archaea. This block also encompasses the phyla Euglenozoa and Fornicata, known for being among the more ancient phyla within Eukarya.</p>

        <p>Modules (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), and (1,5) in the heatmap shown in <xref rid="pone.0297010.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4</xref> illustrate the presence of essential proteins involved in the RNA polymerase II transcription initiation. In contrast, modules (2,1), (2,2), and (2,3) cluster proteins with less significant relationships. These proteins are linked to various functions, including interactions with vitamin receptors, histone acetyltransferases, and proteins with annotations as “uncharacterized conserved protein”.</p>
        <p>Remarkably, our PhyloString analysis, using KOG1932 as a seed, uncovered that some clades of eukaryotic organisms lack most of the proteins associated with the canonical eukaryotic transcription initiation process. These organisms are positioned near the root of the phylogenetic tree that divides Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya. The most striking instances are the Fornicata and Euglenozoa phyla, which represent the closest lineages to the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA, <xref rid="pone.0297010.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Fig</xref>).

Additional examples of primitive eukaryotic phyla that lack important KOGs associated with transcription initiation, as identified by PhyloString, include Apicomplexa, Ciliophora, Bacillariophyta, and Parabasalia. These phyla are clustered in the phylogenetic group 5 (<xref rid="pone.0297010.s014" ref-type="supplementary-material">S11 Table</xref>) and the module (1,5) of the <xref rid="pone.0297010.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4</xref>.</p>
        <p>Examples of lesser striking instances where KOGs involved in transcription initiation are absent can be observed in the Microsporidia, Haptista, Heterolobosea, and Rhodophyta phyla, which lack certain subunits of the transcription initiation factors.

        <p>Photosynthesis is a vital biological process that many organisms employ to convert light energy into chemical energy and store it in organic compounds that can later be metabolized through cellular respiration to provide the energy required to perform different biological activities.</p>
        <p>To have an overview of the functional network of proteins involved in this process, we used the COG5701, designated as Photosystem I reaction center subunit A1, PsaA, as input of our PhyloString web server.

The parameters used in the analysis were: Phylogenetic level: Phylum, STRING cut-off: 700, COG centers: 2, Phylogenetic centers: 3. Cyanobacteria, found in phylogenetic group 1, and specific eukaryotic phyla commonly recognized as green plants, possess the capability to carry out photosynthesis. This shared ability is reflected in the heatmap by the presence of essential orthologous proteins, represented as dark red cells.</p>

        <p>Remarkably, phylogenetic group 1 of the heatmap of <xref rid="pone.0297010.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref> exclusively comprises the Cyanobacteria phylum. These are photosynthetic bacteria that utilize chlorophyll and various pigments for photosynthesis. Unlike eukaryotic algae, they lack chloroplasts and instead perform photosynthesis within specialized cellular membrane structures. Furthermore, many cyanobacteria have the remarkable ability to capture atmospheric nitrogen. Their distinct blue-green color results from the presence of pigments like phycocyanin and chlorophyll, which overshadow the green tint of chlorophyll, providing cyanobacteria with their distinctive appearance [<xref rid="pone.0297010.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0297010.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p>
        <p>Phylogenetic group 2 of the heatmap of <xref rid="pone.0297010.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref> includes various phyla within the monophyletic group known as Viridiplantae, commonly referred to as green plants. These organisms get their green color from pigments like chlorophyll. Viridiplantae is characterized by its members being photosynthetic and having chloroplasts, the cellular organelles responsible for photosynthesis. Viridiplantae is a highly diverse group, including green algae, land plants (Embryophyta), and their closest algal relatives (Charophyta). This diversity spans from unicellular green algae to complex, multicellular land plants, such as mosses, ferns, conifers, and flowering plants. Viridiplantae can be found in various habitats, including freshwater and marine environments, moist soil, and terrestrial ecosystems. Green algae in this group are typically aquatic, while land plants have adapted to life on land [<xref rid="pone.0297010.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p>
        <p>Interestingly, most of the COGs in the heatmap of <xref rid="pone.0297010.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref> are clustered in the second COGs group and are related to the different Photosystem reaction center proteins I and II, and cytochrome b6f complex subunit (<xref rid="pone.0297010.s018" ref-type="supplementary-material">S15 Table</xref>). The Photosystem II reaction center is a crucial component of the photosynthetic process in plants, algae, and cyanobacteria. Its role is to initiate the light-dependent reactions of photosynthesis. The heatmap of <xref rid="pone.0297010.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref> shows that a core of this set of enzymes is almost exclusively found in organisms of the Cyanobacteria phylum, which forms the first phylogenetic group. This core is also found in members of the second phylogenetic group, which includes various phyla of Viridiplantae, such as Chlorophyta, Streptophyta, Haptista, Bacillariophyta, and Rhodophyta (<xref rid="pone.0297010.s019" ref-type="supplementary-material">S16 Table</xref>).

        <title>v) Endocytosis and intracellular vesicle trafficking</title>
        <p>Conventional clathrin-mediated endocytosis and intracellular vesicle trafficking are essential and highly conserved cellular mechanisms in eukaryotes. They are responsible for transporting proteins and lipids either from the plasma membrane or their site of biosynthesis to their respective functional locations within the cell. Through endocytosis, the cell takes solutes (cargo) and fluids from the external environment. It also plays a key role in regulating the signaling cascade mediated by plasma membrane receptors; it is the route of entry for some pathogens, among other functions [<xref rid="pone.0297010.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0297010.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. On the other hand, intracellular vesicle trafficking is responsible for the molecular transport between endomembrane-based organelles, such as endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi complex, endosome, and vacuole/lysosome. Additionally, it is involved in exocytosis and the recycling of endosomes back to the plasma membrane. These processes are vital for maintaining cellular organization and functionality [<xref rid="pone.0297010.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0297010.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p>
        <p>Vesicles are formed by the cytosolic-oriented bending of the donor plasma membrane, which is accompanied by the assembly of a cage-like structure on the cytosolic side of the nascent vesicle. This cage-like structure can be composed of either clathrin light and heavy chains in clathrin-coated vesicles (CCVs) or the coatmer protein complex I and II in COPI and COPII vesicles, respectively [<xref rid="pone.0297010.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0297010.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].</p>
        <p>In addition to cargo molecules, the membrane bending site recruits various accessory proteins, including Adaptor proteins (AP), cargo-receptors, ADP-ribosylation factor (Arf) small GTPases, RabGTPases, their specific guanine-exchange factors (GEFs), and activators (GAPs), as well as VAMP (vesicle-associated membrane proteins), SNARE proteins, among others [<xref rid="pone.0297010.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0297010.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Following the vesicle scission from the donor membrane, the cage-like structure disassembles. Afterwards, vesicle membrane fuses to the acceptor membrane. The membrane fusion process is facilitated by accessory proteins, including tethering proteins and SNAREs [<xref rid="pone.0297010.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0297010.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>].</p>
        <p>According to Thattai M. [<xref rid="pone.0297010.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], there are "budding specificity " and "fusion specificity" modules comprising coat proteins and the corresponding paralogous variants of accessory proteins acting at different locations, respectively. Recent genetic findings on the First and Last eukaryotic common ancestor (FECA and LECA) provide information on the origin and evolution of organelles and the molecular and cellular mechanisms involved in intracellular vesicle trafficking (reviewed by [<xref rid="pone.0297010.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0297010.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]).</p>
        <p>We employed the PhyloString web server to explore clathrin-mediated endocytosis and vesicular trafficking among different phylogenetic groups. In this case, we employed KOG0985 (Vesicle coat protein clathrin, heavy chain) as the query seed KOG.

        <p>As anticipated, structural, and accessory proteins related to clathrin-coated vesicles are exclusively grouped within the Eukarya phyla. These proteins include KOG0985 and KOG4031 (corresponding to vesicle coat protein clathrin’s heavy and light chains, respectively), KOG0934, KOG0935, and KOG0936 (AP/clathrin adaptor complex, small subunits), along with other components linked to the clathrin-mediated endocytosis machinery (see <xref rid="pone.0297010.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0297010.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Remarkably, the first phylogenetic group in the heatmap of <xref rid="pone.0297010.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6</xref> reveals that the eukaryotic phyla Fornicata and Microsporidia are grouped with bacterial and archaeal phyla that lack clathrin-mediated endocytosis and intracellular vesicle trafficking. Consequently, related KOGs are absent in this grouping. Fornicata and Microsporidia phyla exhibit a limited number of KOGs, including KOG0985 (Vesicle coat protein clathrin), KOG0934 (Clathrin adaptor complex), KOG0935 (Clathrin adaptor complex), as well as additional adaptor proteins such as those of KOG1061 (Vesicle coat complex AP-1/AP-2/AP-4, beta subunit), KOG0937 and KOG0938 (members of the Adaptor complexes medium subunit family). Surprisingly, KOG4031 (vesicle coat protein clathrin, light chain) is absent in the Fornicata and Microsporidia phyla, as observed in the Parabasalia and Euglena phyla of the third phylogenetic group. The clathrin light chain is crucial for clathrin-coated vesicle (CCVs) formation, playing a key role in polymerization and serving as a connecting link with the actin cytoskeleton [<xref rid="pone.0297010.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0297010.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. The absence of KOG4031 may suggest the formation of CCVs with different properties or efficiencies. The second phylogenetic group in the heatmap of <xref rid="pone.0297010.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6</xref> outlines KOGs present in metazoan, fungi, and amebozoan. It includes clathrin-mediated endocytosis and intracellular vesicle trafficking, as well as components somewhat associated with specific functional or cellular processes related to endocytosis (<xref rid="pone.0297010.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0297010.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Conversely, the third phylogenetic group mainly consists of unicellular and pluricellular algae, microalgae, land plants, and protozoa. This group clusters a reduced set of KOGs related to structural components of CCVs and intracellular vesicles.</p>
        <p>As KOGs related to COPI (KOG0292, Vesicle coat complex COPI, alpha subunit) and COPII (KOG1986, Vesicle coat complex COPII, subunit SEC23, and KOG0307, Vesicle coat complex COPII, subunit SEC31) vesicles were also observed in the heatmap of <xref rid="pone.0297010.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6</xref>, we conducted a new PhyloString analysis, utilizing KOG1078 (Vesicle coat complex COPI, gamma subunit) as query seed to find the phylogenetic distribution of other KOGs of proteins that are part of the Vesicle coat complex. The outcome of this analysis is illustrated in the heatmap of <xref rid="pone.0297010.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7</xref>, while the corresponding lists of COG groups and phylogeny groups, along with the statistical values indicating COG enrichment within this group, are provided in <xref rid="pone.0297010.s024" ref-type="supplementary-material">S21</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0297010.s026" ref-type="supplementary-material">S23</xref> Tables, respectively.</p>

            <p>The KOG1078 corresponds to the “Vesicle coat complex COPI, gamma subunit”. The parameters used in the analysis were: Phylogenetic level: Phylum, STRING cut-off: 850, COG centers: 2, Phylogenetic centers: 3. The first phylogenetic group is composed of Bacterial and Archaea phyla, which lack COPI intracellular vesicles. The second phylogenetic group includes Eukarya phyla. The phyla of this group is composed of organisms that possesses the structural components of COPI- and COPII-coated vesicles, as well as components somewhat associated to specific functional or cellular processes related to intracellular trafficking mediated by these vesicles. The third phylogenetic group is formed by the Fornicata and Microsporida phyla. Organisms of these phyla have all the structural components of COPI- and COPII-coated vesicles, except for the epsilon, gamma and zeta subunits of the COPI complex (KOG3081, KOG1078 and KOG3343, respectively).</p>

        <p><xref rid="pone.0297010.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7</xref> reveals a set of KOGs involved in vesicle trafficking, including subunits of the Vesicle coat complex COPI (one alpha—KOG0292, two beta—KOG1058 and KOG0276, one epsilon—KOG3081, one gamma—KOG1078, and one zeta—KOG3343). These groups of orthologous proteins are consistently present across all Eukarya phyla. However, it is noteworthy that KOG1078 and KOG3343 are absent in the Fornicata phylum, as indicated in <xref rid="pone.0297010.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0297010.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>.</p>
        <p>Apart from the Vesicle coat complex COPI subunits highlighted in the <xref rid="pone.0297010.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7</xref> heatmap, we have also identified the four structural subunits of the Vesicle coat complex COPII: Sec23 (KOG1986), Sec24 (KOG1985), Sec13 (KOG1332), and Sec31 (KOG0307), alongside the COPII-specific GTPase subunit SAR1 (KOG0077). The presence of these components spans across all Eukarya phyla, as depicted in the <xref rid="pone.0297010.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7</xref> heatmap and succinctly outlined in <xref rid="pone.0297010.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>.</p>
        <p>In summary, the heatmaps of Figs <xref rid="pone.0297010.g006" ref-type="fig">6</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0297010.g007" ref-type="fig">7</xref> disclosed fascinating information concerning organisms of the primitive eukaryotic group Fornicata, as exemplified by the diarrheal pathogen <italic toggle="yes">Giardia intestinalis</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0297010.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. These findings suggest that these organisms might possess relatively rudimentary clathrin-coated vesicle (CCV) and COPI-like vesicle systems. While this hypothesis requires experimental validation, it is consistent with the observed reduced subcellular organization observed in <italic toggle="yes">Giardia trophozoites</italic>.</p>
        <p>Giardia trophozoites exhibit a distinct endoplasmic reticulum network (ER) characterized by the presence of a unique vesicle system, known as peripheral vacuoles (PVs), positioned beneath the plasma membrane. This configuration may signify an evolutionary adaptation of the endocytic-exocytic pathways, potentially dependent on CCV- and COPI-like structures but lacking the clathrin light chain, as well as the COPI gamma and zeta subunits. Notably, PVs are contiguous with the ER but lack Golgi stacks [<xref rid="pone.0297010.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0297010.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>].</p>

        <p>Typically, COPI vesicles play a crucial role in transporting cargo molecules between the Golgi apparatus and the ER, as well as within Golgi stacks [<xref rid="pone.0297010.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The lack of certain components of the CCV and COPI machineries in other primitive Eukarya phyla, such as Parabasalia, Apicomplexa and Euglenozoa (<xref rid="pone.0297010.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) seem to be an indicative of the evolutionary events that contributed to the origin of multicellular organisms with a more complex cell biology, an avenue that would be interesting to explore.</p>

    <title>Conclusion</title>
    <p>We have developed PhyloString, a valuable website that enhances the comprehension of functional relationships among protein sets and their phylogenetic prevalence across the three kingdoms of life. Through heatmap-based graphical representations of functional networks and statistical analysis, we could identify modules of proteins whose functions are tightly related. Our research presented a wide range of diverse and representative examples of various cellular processes that can be analyzed from both metabolic and evolutionary perspectives using our web server PhyloString.</p>

    <p>The <ext-link xlink:href="http://www.plosone.org/static/policies.action#sharing" ext-link-type="uri">PLOS Data policy</ext-link> requires authors to make all data underlying the findings described in their manuscript fully available without restriction, with rare exception (please refer to the Data Availability Statement in the manuscript PDF file). The data should be provided as part of the manuscript or its supporting information, or deposited to a public repository. For example, in addition to summary statistics, the data points behind means, medians and variance measures should be available. If there are restrictions on publicly sharing data—e.g. participant privacy or use of data from a third party—those must be specified.<!-- </font> --></p>

You may also include additional comments for the author, including concerns about dual publication, research ethics, or publication ethics. (Please upload your review as an attachment if it exceeds 20,000 characters)<!-- </font> --></p>
    <p>Reviewer #1: PhyloString is one of the most useful web application. While the content is ok but the website part needs a revision.</p>
    <p>1. There is no help page.</p>
    <p>2. One tutorial page that will walk through with an example run is missing in the design.</p>
    <p>3. The example_seq looks like a nucleic acid sequence rather than a protein sequence. Although, I understand A, C, T, G codes for amino acids. Better change it to some protein sequence.</p>
    <p>4. Contact information is missing in the website. In case of difficulty, how the users will contact the authors/developers?</p>
    <p>5. You need to provide some example input and output.</p>
    <p>Reviewer #2: The manuscript entitled « PhyloString: a web server designed to identify, visualize, and evaluate functional relationships between orthologous protein groups across different phylogenetic lineages. «  by Dorantes-Torres et al. reports on a web server for assessing and visualising potential functional networks across organisms from different phylogenetic lineages. They rely on public databases, mostly STRING and COG, and on existing methodologies to build heat maps and perform statistical enrichment analysis. The tool can be of interest for the community and the authors successfully showcase some meaningful examples. However, both the manuscript and the webserver could be largely improved.</p>
    <p>Major concerns:</p>
    <p>1/ The methods are not sufficiently described. Please provide some hints as to what the R functions used are actually doing. Which statistical test, clustering method, etc?</p>
    <p>2/ The main result of the webserver is not clearly described. Could the authors explicitly write down the score that correspond to each cell in the heat map? In particular, it is not clear at all from the text that each cell correspond to some relationship between the protein in x-axis from the phyla in y-axis with the corresponding protein from the query COG. Moreover, do the author consider the presence/absence for the query only or for both proteins in the pair? In case a phylum contain several species, how is that dealt with to compute the score? How many species are there behind each heatmap?</p>
    <p>3/ What is the pertinence of using a continuous color scale when the null values have a special meaning: absence of the protein (and not only of the interaction)?</p>
    <p>4/ A lot of thresholds are used without justification. What would happen if we would vary the a bit? What would change if I change the query COG but I stay in the same functional set of proteins? How are the proteins in x-axis identified? Does the STRING index cutoff play a role in this selection? What would happen if I have 2 cells next to each other, one yellow and one red, and behind the yellow one the support for presence is 0.45 in the phylum, while it is 0.55 in the other cell? Is it really pertinent to put 0 and 1 which such similar proportions?</p>
    <p>5/ The webserver lacks documentation. It is easy to use but it is not so easy to understand the output without any tutorial or description.</p>
    <p>Minor points:</p>
    <p>- the figure legends should be more detailed.</p>
    <p>Reviewer #3: Dorantes-Torres et al. present a Web server, PhyloString, that analyses data, ingested from the STRING database and decomposes the associations in two-dimensional clustering, along the COG composition and the phylogenetic axes. The clustering is accompanied by a statistical enrichment/depletion estimate, based on an extremely naïve random independent combinatorial model.</p>
    <p>The server exists and serves the information claimed by the authors; this, technically, gives the whole enterprise a passing score for publication. The utility of the analysis is doubtful, given the primitive statistics and numerous ad hoc decisions, implemented in the pipeline (e.g. the binary presence/absence scoring at 50% of occurrence among the genomes in a phylogroup). Using a hopelessly outdated COG annotation doesn't help either (e.g. CRISPR-Cas9 is annotated as "Uncharacterized protein conserved in bacteria", as it was in 2003 version). The authors make no attempt to find the data-driven granularity for clustering, leaving the user to experiment with the settings.</p>
    <p>There is one problem that must be addressed in the revision: in the Methods section the authors mention using the R functions for hypergeometric distribution, but give no further details for the analysis they perform. Likewise, they use clustering facilities of the heatmap library without any reference to how the rows and columns are clustered. A detailed description of the analysis from the subject matter perspective (what is being computed and why, as opposed to details on how R functions are invoked), including the underlying assumptions and an assessment of their applicability to the real data, is necessary.</p>

    <p>Response to Reviewer #1: </p>
    <p>Reviewer #1: PhyloString is one of the most useful web application. While the content is ok but the website part needs a revision.</p>
    <p>1. There is no help page with clear instructions.</p>
    <p>We have introduced a Help web page that provides an overview of the PhyloString web server, explains the input parameters for the study, and outlines the various sections of the analysis output. Specifically, lines 258 to 264 in the revised version of our article highlight the availability of PhyloString's Help and Tutorial pages, serving as guides for users in navigating the main steps of their study.</p>
    <p>2. One tutorial page that will walk through with an example run is missing in the design.</p>
    <p>In addition to the Help page, our PhyloString web server now includes a Tutorial web page designed to guide users through the key steps of a standard study, along with valuable tips for maximizing the capabilities of PhyloString and effectively interpreting the diverse potential outcomes. Furthermore, the PhyloString Tutorial web page features illustrative examples, some of which are also presented in the article. As mentioned in the previous response, lines 258 to 264 in the revised version of our article emphasize the accessibility of PhyloString's Help and Tutorial pages.</p>
    <p>3. The example_seq looks like a nucleic acid sequence rather than a protein sequence. Although, I understand A, C, T, G codes for amino acids. Better change it to some protein sequence.</p>
    <p>Our updated version of PhyloString replaced the example sequence with an actual protein sequence. Furthermore, we have introduced a new feature in PhyloString that enables users to choose a COG/KOG using keywords that describe the functions associated with those orthologous groups.</p>
    <p>4. Contact information is missing in the website. In case of difficulty, how the users will contact the authors/developers?</p>
    <p>The contact information has been included at the bottom of the new version of our PhyloString web server.</p>
    <p>5. You need to provide some example input and output.</p>
    <p>As commented earlier, the Tutorial web page of the new version of our PhyloString website includes a set of practical examples, some of which are also showcased in the article. </p>
    <p>Response to Reviewer #2:</p>
    <p>Reviewer #2: The manuscript entitled « PhyloString: a web server designed to identify, visualize, and evaluate functional relationships between orthologous protein groups across different phylogenetic lineages. « by Dorantes-Torres et al. reports on a web server for assessing and visualising potential functional networks across organisms from different phylogenetic lineages. They rely on public databases, mostly STRING and COG, and on existing methodologies to build heat maps and perform statistical enrichment analysis. The tool can be of interest for the community and the authors successfully showcase some meaningful examples. However, both the manuscript and the webserver could be largely improved.</p>
    <p>Major concerns:</p>
    <p>1/ The methods are not sufficiently described. Please provide some hints as to what the R functions used are actually doing. Which statistical test, clustering method, etc?</p>
    <p>In the updated version of our article, lines 124 to 224, we have provided a more comprehensive explanation of R functions and the main variables used in the analysis. In addition, as indicated in lines 173 to 176, the new version of our PhyloString web server includes new options for the Clustering methods and Distance matrices that could be employed in the clustering procedure. The descriptions of these methods and distance metrics are presented in the new PhyloString Help webpage, as indicated in lines 187 to 196.</p>
    <p>2/ The main result of the webserver is not clearly described. Could the authors explicitly write down the score that correspond to each cell in the heat map? In particular, it is not clear at all from the text that each cell correspond to some relationship between the protein in x-axis from the phyla in y-axis with the corresponding protein from the query COG. Moreover, do the author consider the presence/absence for the query only or for both proteins in the pair? In case a phylum contain several species, how is that dealt with to compute the score? How many species are there behind each heatmap?</p>
    <p> In response to the reviewer's feedback and to better describe “The main result of the web server,” we have included a new figure (Fig 1) to represent the primary steps employed by PhyloString schematically. In addition, we have improved the description of the main steps of the PhyloString analysis and how the heatmap is generated and could be interpreted. In addition, as indicated in lines 153 to 224. </p>
    <p>Furthermore, we have also implemented a novel approach for presenting the specific information for each cell within a heatmap. In contrast to the previous display of a basic HTML file, the enhanced version of PhyloString now offers an interactive feature that provides valuable information for each cell when the user hovers their mouse cursor over it. This information includes the phylogenetic group, the COG or KOG ID and its description, the number of organisms considered in the count for the specific cell, and its corresponding score. Details regarding implementing this functionality can be found in the revised article, lines 243 to 257.</p>
    <p>3/ What is the pertinence of using a continuous color scale when the null values have a special meaning: absence of the protein (and not only of the interaction)?</p>
    <p>The gradient color scale employed by PhyloString holds significant importance in understanding the potential impact of the absence of a protein or a set of related proteins (modules) within the studied functional interaction network. This significance is exemplified in the second instance discussed in our article, focusing on the biosynthesis of the amino acid tryptophan (Fig 3).</p>
    <p>In this context, the absence of the enzyme phosphoribosyl anthranilate isomerase TrpF (COG0135) in the phylum Actinobacteria is readily interpretable due to the corresponding color approaching the highest possible value (1,000), indicating its considerable relevance in the biosynthetic process. Conversely, the yellow-like colors assigned to COG1535 (Isochorismate hydrolase), and COG3208 (Surfactin synthase thioesterase subunit) in Actinobacteria suggest that these COGs are less crucial to tryptophan biosynthesis. As elaborated in lines 330 to 335 of our article's updated version, the absence of the enzyme phosphoribosyl anthranilate isomerase TrpF (COG0135) has been compensated by the enzyme PirA, which provides the necessary isomerase activity.</p>
    <p>The significance of the gradient color scale is also highlighted in the third example discussed in our article, focusing on key proteins i</p>
    <p>nvolved in the eukaryotic transcription initiation process. As illustrated in Fig 4, cells representing COGs belonging to the first COG groups in all eukaryotic phyla are depicted in dark brown, indicating the presence of proteins crucial to this process. In contrast, cells corresponding to COGs less relevant to the eukaryotic transcription initiation process are depicted in yellow-like colors. Notably, these COGs are predominantly absent in ancient phyla, positioned close to the root of the phylogenetic tree that divides Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya (Fig 4). This suggests that only the more relevant proteins in the process are consistently shared among all eukaryotic phyla.</p>
    <p> In the updated version of the PhyloString web server, we have adjusted the color palette's scaling to enhance the visibility of distinctions among these values. Additionally, we have incorporated a practical example within the Tutorial web page to demonstrate how this color-coded information can aid in interpreting the analysis.</p>
    <p>4/ A lot of thresholds are used without justification. What would happen if we would vary the a bit?</p>
    <p>In response to the reviewer's comment, we have introduced a new feature on our PhyloString web server page, enabling users to vary and customize the parameter values according to their preferences. This new feature can be found selecting the Advance analysis option of PhyloString web page, as indicated in lines 175 to 176 of our revised version of the article. The pre-compiled analysis for predefined default values, which we have used as reference points, allows for quick output display and a rapid overview of various results. Subsequently, if users wish to fine-tune their analysis using values different from our predefined settings, the heatmaps and enrichment statistics will be generated dynamically in real time.</p>
    <p>What would change if I change the query COG but I stay in the same functional set of proteins? How are the proteins in x-axis identified? Does the STRING index cutoff play a role in this selection? </p>
    <p>The inquiry about the potential outcomes when substituting the COG seed with another COG in the same functional category and whether the String index cutoff value may impact these outcomes is an insightful question. To provide a comprehensive answer, we have integrated it into the PhyloString Tutorial web page, accompanied by illustrative examples that highlight these scenarios. Tip 3 of this Tutorial web page demonstrates the difference observed when using KOG1932 (TATA-binding protein-associated factor) and KOG3219 (Transcription initiation factor TFIID, subunit TAF11) as query seed KOGs. This showcases that, while the results are generally comparable, they are significantly influenced by the coherence of the functional relationships within the study process and the centrality of the chosen COG as a query seed.</p>
    <p> Regarding the identification of proteins and phylogeny classes within the heatmap cells, as mentioned in our second response, we have transitioned from our previous static HTML heatmaps to a dynamic interactive output where relevant information about each cell is displayed when users hover their mouse cursor over each cell. This information includes the phylogenetic group, the COG or KOG ID with its description, the count of organisms considered in the specific cell, and its corresponding score, as described in the updated article, lines 273 to 277.</p>
    <p>What would happen if I have 2 cells next to each other, one yellow and one red, and behind the yellow one the support for presence is 0.45 in the phylum, while it is 0.55 in the other cell? Is it really pertinent to put 0 and 1 which such similar proportions?</p>
    <p>We acknowledge the reviewer's concerns regarding using a single cutoff value of 50% to determine the presence or absence of a family of orthologous genes (COG/KOG) within a phylogenetic group in the heatmaps generated by PhyloString. We agree that this approach can lead to contiguous cells exhibiting slight variations in their relative COG frequencies, resulting in different presence and absence assignments. However, we would like to emphasize that while this criterion may have limitations in representing relative frequencies close to 50%, it generally serves as a useful descriptor. Initially, we also considered assigning cells within the heatmap to represent the relative frequency of organisms with the presence of the COG within each phylogenetic group. Although this approach might seem more precise in theory, it often resulted in noisy and biologically challenging interpretations. However, given the large number of cells in the heatmap generated by PhyloString, the simplification of considering cells with relative frequencies greater than 50% as present proved to be the most practical and interpretable choice in most cases. We believe that the examples presented in the article and the new help and tutorial web pages support our decision and help users understand the rationale behind it.</p>
    <p>5/ The webserver lacks documentation. It is easy to use but it is not so easy to understand the output without any tutorial or description.</p>
    <p>As previously addressed in our responses to reviewer #1's second and third questions, the updated version of PhyloString incorporates several enhancements. We have introduced a Help page to provide users with an overview of the PhyloString web server, elucidate the input parameters required for their studies, delineate the various sections in the analysis output, and offer guidance on effectively interpreting the results.</p>
    <p>In addition to the Help page, our PhyloString web server now includes a Tutorial web page strategically designed to lead users through the essential steps of a standard study. This tutorial also includes invaluable tips for harnessing PhyloString capabilities to their fullest and making sense of the diverse range of potential outcomes.</p>
    <p>Finally, in the updated version of the article, we have included a new figure (Fig 1) with a schematic representation of the primary steps employed by PhyloString</p>
    <p>Minor points:</p>
    <p>- the figure legends should be more detailed.</p>
    <p>Considering the reviewer's comment, the revised version of the article now provides more comprehensive and detailed legends for the figures, offering additional elements to facilitate their interpretation.</p>
    <p>Response to Reviewer #3:</p>
    <p>Reviewer #3: Dorantes-Torres et al. present a Web server, PhyloString, that analyses data, ingested from the STRING database and decomposes the associations in two-dimensional clustering, along the COG composition and the phylogenetic axes. The clustering is accompanied by a statistical enrichment/depletion estimate, based on an extremely naïve random independent combinatorial model. The server exists and serves the information claimed by the authors; this, technically, gives the whole enterprise a passing score for publication.</p>
    <p> The utility of the analysis is doubtful, given the primitive statistics and numerous ad hoc decisions, implemented in the pipeline (e.g. the binary presence/absence scoring at 50% of occurrence among the genomes in a phylogroup).</p>
    <p>As previously discussed in our responses to reviewer #2's fourth question, although the binary scoring at the 50% occurrence threshold among genomes within a phylogenetic group may have limitations in representing the presence/absence tendencies of some COGs, it generally serves as a valuable descriptor. Initially, we explored the option of assigning cells within the heatmap to represent the relative frequency of each phylogenetic group to have organisms coding the corresponding COGs. However, this approach, although theoretically more precise, often led to noisy and biologically complex interpretations.</p>
    <p>Given the substantial number of cells in the heatmap generated by PhyloString, we found that simplifying the representation by considering cells with relative frequencies greater than 50% as "present" was the most pragmatic and interpretable choice in most instances. We believe that the examples provided in the article and the new help and tutorial web pages offer ample support for our decision and help users grasp the reasoning behind it.</p>
    <p>Using a hopelessly outdated COG annotation doesn't help either (e.g. CRISPR-Cas9 is annotated as "Uncharacterized protein conserved in bacteria", as it was in 2003 version). </p>
    <p>In response to the referee's feedback, we have implemented significant updates to our PhyloString server. The server now operates using the latest version, 12.0, of the STRING database. Furthermore, we have generated revised versions of each analysis presented in our article, demonstrating the application of PhyloString in exploring biological processes and metabolic pathways considering the updated STRING 12.0 score values. </p>
    <p>The authors make no attempt to find the data-driven granularity for clustering, leaving the user to experiment with the settings.</p>
    <p>As we mentioned in our response to the fourth question raised by reviewer #2 and in consideration of the referee's comment, we have implemented a new feature on our PhyloString web server page. This feature empowers users to customize parameter values based on their preferences, allowing data-driven granularity for clustering, and facilitating the user to experiment with different settings. This new feature can be found selecting the Advanced analysis option of PhyloString web page, as indicated in lines 175 to 176 of our revised version of the article.</p>
    <p>The pre-compiled analysis with predefined default values, which we have established as reference points, enables rapid output display and a quick overview of various results. Subsequently, should users want to fine-tune their analysis using values different from our predefined settings, the heatmaps and enrichment statistics will be dynamically generated in real-time. Our newly added Help and Tutorial pages provide examples demonstrating how to leverage data-driven granularity for clustering.</p>
    <p>There is one problem that must be addressed in the revision: in the Methods section the authors mention using the R functions for hypergeometric distribution, but give no further details for the analysis they perform. Likewise, they use clustering facilities of the heatmap library without any reference to how the rows and columns are clustered. A detailed description of the analysis from the subject matter perspective (what is being computed and why, as opposed to details on how R functions are invoked), including the underlying assumptions and an assessment of their applicability to the real data, is necessary.</p>
    <p>In response to the reviewer's request, we have included a detailed description of the statistical principles underpinning our analysis in the Materials and Methods Section, lines 124 to 224. This description includes the new options we recently implemented to allow the users to select different Clustering methods and Distance matrices employed in the clustering procedure. These Methods and Distance matrices are now described in the supplementary Tables S1 and S2 of the updated version of the article and in the new PhyloString Help web page.</p>

    <abstract>
      <p>Proteins are biological units whose essence is defined by their functional relationships with other proteins or biomolecules such as RNA, DNA, lipids, or carbohydrates. These functions encompass enzymatic, structural, regulatory, or physical interaction roles. The STRING database (Nucleic Acids Research, 8 Jan 2021;49(D1): D605-12) provides an index that defines the functional interaction networks between proteins in model organisms. To facilitate the identification, visualization, and evaluation of potential functional networks across organisms from different phylogenetic lineages, we have developed PhyloString (<ext-link xlink:href="https://biocomputo.ibt.unam.mx/phylostring" ext-link-type="uri">https://biocomputo.ibt.unam.mx/phylostring/</ext-link>), a web server that utilizes the indices of the STRING database. PhyloString decomposes these functional networks into modules, representing cohesive units of proteins grouped based on their similarity of STRING values and the phylogenetic origins of their respective organisms.

    <title>Introduction</title>
    <p>Proteins are fundamental units of cells, playing crucial roles in growth, development, maintenance, and functionality by contributing to the structure, metabolism, regulation, and communication within cellular systems. Their essence, as cellular entities, is defined by their physical and functional interactions with other proteins and various types of biomolecules, including DNA or RNA molecules, lipids, carbohydrates, and cofactors. Numerous databases have been established to comprehensively compile and analyze the vast results generated from protein interaction studies. The creation and maintenance of these databases involve methodological and conceptual challenges such as utilizing standardized vocabularies and formats for protein and interaction descriptions, meticulous curation of information from scientific publications, and establishing a consistent approach for identifying the same protein across different databases. These challenges and a review of the most significant protein-protein interaction databases have been extensively discussed in [<xref rid="pone.0297010.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0297010.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p>
    <p>Among the various databases of protein-protein interactions, the STRING database deserves special mention due to its inclusion of physical and functional interactions between sets of two or more proteins [<xref rid="pone.0297010.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. This functional interaction of proteins can arise through various instances, such as sharing the same substrate in a metabolic pathway or being components of the same protein complex [<xref rid="pone.0297010.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p>
    <p>STRING is a comprehensive database that integrates experimentally validated and computationally predicted protein-protein interactions. Its initial version was developed as a web application primarily used to identify functionally related genes in prokaryotic organisms by analyzing the conservation of the same genomic neighborhood across different genomes [<xref rid="pone.0297010.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Over time, STRING has expanded to include additional sources of information, such as (i) genomic context analysis, which involves examining gene fusion events, conservation of genomic neighborhood, and phylogenetic co-occurrence profiles of orthologous gene pairs across different genomes; (ii) primary evidence obtained from experimental protein-protein interactions and gene co-expression experiments, meticulously curated from the scientific literature; (iii) manually curated pathway databases; and (iv) utilization of automatic literature mining techniques to identify genes that are co-mentioned within the abstracts of scientific publications. Afterward, this information is weighted by STRING based on the probabilities of proteins being present in the same metabolic pathway, as defined by the metabolic maps from the KEGG database (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) [<xref rid="pone.0297010.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. These weighted values are then integrated into a meaningful confidence score ranging from zero to 1,000, representing the strength of the physical or functional relationships for all protein interactions.</p>
    <p>A fundamental characteristic of STRING is that the information collected for one organism is transferred to other organisms within its database [<xref rid="pone.0297010.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0297010.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. To achieve this, functional equivalence is assigned to orthologous genes based on the orthologous groups defined by the COG database [<xref rid="pone.0297010.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Consequently, STRING provides a user-friendly web page that presents information on protein-protein interactions as a network. In this network, proteins (or their corresponding orthologous COG groups) serve as nodes (or vertices), while the edges represent the different types of evidence supporting the physical or functional protein-protein interactions.</p>
    <p>From a System Biology perspective, considering the entire network of physical or functional interactions within a cell is crucial to comprehensively define a protein’s function in a specific organism. This implies that while orthologous proteins may share similar physicochemical or enzymatic properties, their functions can vary depending on the presence or absence of their respective interaction partners, which contribute to their functional networks.</p>
    <p>In this study, we have developed PhyloString (<ext-link xlink:href="https://biocomputo.ibt.unam.mx/phylostring/" ext-link-type="uri">https://biocomputo.ibt.unam.mx/phylostring/</ext-link>), a web server that enables the analysis of protein functional modularity across different phylogenetic lineages in biological processes. PhyloString utilizes the functional relationships between proteins as defined in the STRING database [<xref rid="pone.0297010.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. By clustering proteins into modules based on their STRING scores and phylogenetic origins, PhyloString visually represents these modules using a heatmap. Additionally, PhyloString evaluates the statistical significance of protein enrichment within the modules.</p>
    <p>This article presents representative examples of differential protein-protein functional relationship modules identified among phylogenetic lineages using PhyloString. These examples are thoroughly discussed, highlighting the importance of understanding protein functional modularity across different evolutionary lineages.</p>

      <title>Data sources</title>
      <p>The STRING database v12.0 compiles information from 12,535 organisms, out of which 2,426 are categorized as core or reference organisms. Details about these organisms are structured into flat files, which were downloaded from its website at <ext-link xlink:href="https://string-db.org/" ext-link-type="uri">https://string-db.org/</ext-link>. These files included, among others: a) the orthologous groups and their proteins (COG.mappings.v12.0.txt); b) the name of the organisms and their taxonomic IDs (species.v12.0.txt); c) association scores between orthologous groups (COG.links.v12.0.txt); d) the full name of the organism´s lineage (fullnamelineage.dmp).</p>
      <p>This version of STRING includes functional relationships for protein orthology groups found mainly in bacterial organisms (COG) and eukaryotic organisms (KOG). To simplify, in this article, we will use the term COG to refer to both COG and KOG.</p>

      <title>Statistical analysis and heatmap construction</title>
      <p>We developed an R script (R version 4.3.0) to parse the data obtained from the STRING database (version v12.0). PhyloString facilitates assessing the distribution of biological functions, metabolic processes, structural elements, or regulatory complexes across diverse phylogenetic clades. To achieve this, PhyloString carries out several bioinformatics processes, as shown in <xref rid="pone.0297010.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>.</p>

          <title>Schematic representation of the primary steps employed by PhyloString.</title>
          <p>A) Using a COG as a query seed that describes the biological functions, metabolic processes, structural elements, or regulatory complexes PhyloString selects the orthologous groups meeting the user-defined STRING cutoff value, forming a network of protein-protein functional interactions. B) PhyloString assesses the frequency of each COG presence within the functional interaction network across genomes in various phylogenetic clades. This information is used to construct a binary matrix indicating presence (1) or absence (0). A value of 0 is assigned if the number of organisms with a particular orthologous group in a phylogenetic clade is less than 50%, and 1 otherwise. C) Each cell in the binary presence/absence matrix is multiplied by the STRING index representing the functional association between the seed COG and the COG of that cell. D) PhyloString generates a heatmap using these values and applies hierarchical clustering to both rows (representing different phylogenetic clades) and columns (representing distinct COG orthologous groups). The clustering process results in the heatmap being divided into specific areas or modules, indicating cohesive units of highly functionally related proteins. In the article, these modules are denoted in parentheses by two numbers separated by a comma, representing the horizontal and vertical positions, respectively. The horizontal position corresponds to the COGs cluster number, and the vertical to the phylogenetic cluster number.</p>

      </fig>
      <p>The analysis initiates by selecting a characteristic COG group as a seed query for the case study. Using this seed group, PhyloString identifies all functionally related COGs, surpassing a specified cut-off value according to the STRING index. This set of COGs thus selected are functionally related, either by participating in the same biological process, metabolic pathway, or structural complex, so they can be considered to form a network of functional protein-protein interactions (<xref rid="pone.0297010.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>). Subsequently, PhyloString evaluates the presence (1) or absence (0) of each COG defined as functionally related to the seed group within various phylogenetic clades. PhyloString assigns a value of 0 to a COG if the number of organisms with that COG in that phylogenetic clade is less than 50%, while a value of 1 is assigned if the frequency exceeds this threshold (<xref rid="pone.0297010.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>). These binary values are then multiplied by the corresponding STRING functional relationship index recorded for each COG pair (<xref rid="pone.0297010.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1C</xref>). The resulting values are employed to construct protein-protein interaction heatmaps (<xref rid="pone.0297010.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1D</xref>).</p>
      <p>To depict the functional proximity between the initial seed COG and each COG presented in the heatmap, a color code was employed. The colors ranged from lighter shades like yellow to darker hues such as cherry or black, representing weak to strong functional associations, respectively. The value scale diagram used in all heatmaps is illustrated in <xref rid="pone.0297010.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig</xref>.</p>
      <p>PhyloString enables users to conduct this analysis at two taxonomic levels: the phylum and class levels. To ensure rapid performance, PhyloString provides a collection of <italic toggle="yes">pre-processed analyses</italic> with readily selectable default values from the main web page. Nevertheless, PhyloString also offers flexibility for <italic toggle="yes">Advanced analysis</italic>, allowing users to customize parameter values to their preferences.</p>
      <p>Protein-protein interaction heatmaps are created using the <italic toggle="yes">pheatmap</italic> library in the RStudio software (Version 1.0.12). This library generates heatmaps with hierarchical clustering of the input data matrix applied to both rows, representing the different phylogenetic clades, and columns, representing the different orthologous groups (COGs).</p>
      <p>Among the various distance metrics accessible in <italic toggle="yes">pheatmap</italic>, the Euclidean distance is the default choice in our pre-compiled analyses. This preference is due to its simplicity and capability to generate biologically meaningful outcomes in most cases. Furthermore, the Euclidean distance stands as one of the most frequently employed distance metrics in various biological studies. However, within the <italic toggle="yes">Advanced analysis</italic> option of PhyloString, users have the flexibility to opt, in addition to the Euclidean distance, other metrics, including the Manhattan distance, the Minkowski distance, and the Maximum distance. In addition, the new version of PhyloString includes new options for the clustering procedure other than the Complete method, which is the default method. In the <italic toggle="yes">Advanced analysis</italic> option of PhyloString, users can use alternative clustering methods, including the Single, Average, Median, Ward.D, Ward.D2, and Centroid methods. Descriptions of the Clustering methods and Distance matrices employed in the clustering procedure are described in the <xref rid="pone.0297010.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0297010.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2</xref> Tables, respectively, and included in the new PhyloString Help webpage.</p>
      <p>The heatmaps are divided horizontally and vertically based on the user-selected number of COG and phylogenetic divisions, respectively. These selections are then used as the <italic toggle="yes">cluster_rows and cluster_columns</italic> parameters in the <italic toggle="yes">pheatmap</italic> library. To evaluate the enrichment of COG groups within the various modules, we used the hypergeometric distribution, which models the probability of achieving a precise count of successes when making a set number of draws without replacement from a finite population composed of known successes and failures. The analysis of the hypergeometric distribution was conducted using the <italic toggle="yes">phyper</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">dhyper</italic> functions of the RStudio software and involves four key parameters, which are as follows:</p>
      <list list-type="order">
        <list-item>
          <p>The Population Size (N), in our case, corresponds to the total number of cells in the heatmap, which is determined by multiplying the number of phylogenetic clades by the number of COGs in the heatmap.</p>
        </list-item>
        <list-item>
          <p>The number of Successes in the Population (H) represents instances where any COG within the heatmap is found in at least 50% of the organisms from a particular phylogenetic clade under study. In simpler terms, it counts all heatmap cells with values greater than 0 in this context.</p>
        </list-item>
        <list-item>
          <p>The Sample Size (n) refers to the count of cells present in a specific subset of the heatmap. This subset is determined by the combination of COG groups and phylogenetic classes identified during the clustering process. The total number of potential heatmap subsets corresponds to the product of the chosen COG groups and phylogenetic groups initially selected by the user for analysis.</p>

      <title>Defining COG seeds from protein sequences</title>
      <p>As previously mentioned, every PhyloString analysis requires a COG seed as the central point around which functional neighbors are selected for heatmap display. In cases where there is no readily available COG seed or a keyword to facilitate seed identification, but a protein sequence is related to the study, PhyloString can determine its corresponding COG based on its sequence similarity to a reference database build with a non-redundant set of proteins of the STRING´s core organisms. To this end, the proteins of organisms classified as core were grouped in accordance with their COG assignation. The groups built in this way were processed to remove redundant proteins using the cd-hit program [<xref rid="pone.0297010.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] and a sequence identity using a threshold of 0.8.</p>

      <title>Webpage construction</title>
      <p>The PhyloString webpage comprises a four-layer structure: i) the database layer, where the data is processed by <italic toggle="yes">ad hoc</italic> scripts that read several input parameters and pre-process data from our set of 4,510 COG and 3,131 KOG groups; ii) the frontend layer comprises html5, JavaScript, and Cascading Style Sheets 3 (CSS3) codes. This second layer allows the users to manipulate the backend layer; iii) the pre-render layer is an intermediate layer where the server accesses its APIs, retrieves values from the database, and establishes the foundation for creating charts based on user-input data. This is the most complex layer, constructed using a combination of PHP, JavaScript, Perl, and C frameworks, as well as custom scripts over an implementation of the amCharts software; iv) the backend layer is the last. It takes user input selections, processes them using allocated values from the database, and generates human-readable graphics presented to the user inside the frontend layer. This backend layer was written in Hypertext Preprocessor (PHP) and Perl program languages.</p>

      <title>Web page construction</title>
      <p>We developed PhyloString, a web page designed to analyze protein-protein functional interaction networks based on data from the STRING database. These networks are represented as heatmaps, where each cell reflects the product of two factors: the binary classification of COG group frequencies in the studied phylogenetic lineages and the STRING score between pairs of COG groups. To perform a quick inspection, PhyloString has implemented a function that allows the user to obtain the information of each cell within the heatmap when the user hovers their mouse over it. This information includes the phylogenetic group, the COG ID with its description, the count of organisms considered in the specific cell, and its corresponding score.</p>
      <p>To assess the prevalence of specific subsets of COGs within protein-protein functional interaction networks, we performed a clustering analysis of the heatmap cells using their corresponding STRING values. Our approach involved dividing the list of COGs and organisms into user-defined divisions, COG centers (2 to 6), and Phylogenetic centers (3 to 5), as displayed on the PhyloString webpage. As a result, the heatmaps are segmented into distinct rectangular areas called "Modules." These modules represent cohesive sets of proteins that perform closely related functions within the entire functional network. Furthermore, PhyloString evaluates the statistical significance of COG enrichment within different modules of the heatmaps, presenting the enrichment analysis results as supplementary tables.</p>
      <p>To facilitate the functional networks analysis, PhyloString provides flexibility in setting cut-off values for STRING scores (specifically, 900, 850, 800, 750, and 700). Additionally, users can choose the desired level of taxonomic depth for analysis, whether by considering the <italic toggle="yes">Phylum</italic> or <italic toggle="yes">Class</italic> of the organisms. This customizable approach enables users to explore and interpret the data more effectively.</p>
      <p>PhyloString offers a help webpage and a tutorial webpage designed to offer users a comprehensive understanding of the web server. These pages aim to clarify the necessary input parameters for their studies, outline the different sections in the analysis output, and guide users through the essential steps of a standard study. Additionally, they provide valuable tips for maximizing the capabilities of PhyloString. The key steps utilized by PhyloString are depicted in <xref rid="pone.0297010.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>.</p>

      <title>Representative examples of the use of PhyloString</title>
      <p>To illustrate the diverse range of analysis achievable with PhyloString, we present a set of examples centered in essential cellular processes. The functional relationships between proteins in these processes are visualized as heatmaps, where cohesive and integrated modules are identified, representing tightly functionally related proteins. Throughout the text, the modules are denoted by their positions in the heatmaps, enclosed in round parentheses, representing their corresponding COG and phylogenetic groups, respectively.</p>

        <title>i) Ribosomal and other proteins that are involved in the translation process</title>
        <p>Ribosomes are essential cellular complexes composed of small proteins and RNA molecules. They play a crucial role across all three domains of life, Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya, in translating mRNA into proteins by catalyzing the assembly of amino acids into polypeptide chains. However, the complexity of ribosomes varies depending on the phylogenetic origin of the organism. Bacterial organisms show the lowest, followed by archaeal organisms, while eukaryotic organisms exhibit the highest level of complexity in their ribosomal composition [<xref rid="pone.0297010.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0297010.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p>
        <p>Despite the differences in composition, ribosomes of all three domains of life possess a common set of 34 proteins that are universally conserved and are the central core of their structure. This set of proteins is responsible for the ribosome´s main functions, such as peptide bond formation during protein synthesis [<xref rid="pone.0297010.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0297010.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In addition, there is a set of ribosomal proteins common to archaeal and eukaryotic organisms, while some others are exclusively found in bacterial and eukaryotic organisms.</p>
        <p>To investigate the phylogenetic distribution of proteins involved in the translation process, we utilized PhyloString to analyze the functional relationships within the COG0199, which clusters the S14 orthologous ribosomal proteins. The resulting analysis is presented in the heatmap shown in <xref rid="pone.0297010.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>. This figure reveals that COGs of modules (4,1), (4,2), and (4,3) (COG group 4, <xref rid="pone.0297010.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Table</xref>) form part of the core ribosomal proteins shared by Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya (phylogenetic groups 1–3, <xref rid="pone.0297010.s007" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4 Table</xref>). The statistical values for the COG enrichment within this group can be found in the supplementary material (<xref rid="pone.0297010.s008" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5 Table</xref>). Furthermore, we observed that COGs of modules (3,2) and (3,3) mainly correspond to proteins shared by Archaea and Eukarya, while COGs of modules (2,1) and (2,3) are primarily associated with proteins shared by Bacteria and Eukarya. Lastly, module (1,1) corresponds to proteins mainly present in Bacteria.</p>

        <title>ii) Amino acid biosynthesis. Tryptophan autotrophic and heterotrophic organisms identified by PhyloString</title>
        <p>L-tryptophan is one of the scarcest amino acids found in most proteins and the most costly to synthesize in terms of cell resources [<xref rid="pone.0297010.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In many bacterial organisms, the genes coding for the enzymes involved in the tryptophan biosynthesis are transcribed in the same polycistronic unit to facilitate their coordinated expression. To identify the overall distribution of L-tryptophan autotrophic and heterotrophic organisms, we used the COG0147 that clustered the anthranilate synthases component I enzymes, TrpE.

Additionally, TrpC (COG0134), referred to as indol-3-glycerol phosphate synthase, removes the carbon dioxide from carboxyphenylamino-deoxyribulse-5-phosphate resulting in the formation of indole-3-glycerol phosphate. Finally, the tryptophan synthase TrpA alpha chain (COG0159) cleaves the indoleglycerol phosphate to generate glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate and indole. The indole molecule generated in the previous step is used with L-serine by TrpB (COG0133), the beta chain of tryptophan synthase, to synthesize L-tryptophan.</p>
        <p>Although the biosynthesis of L-tryptophan from chorismate commonly requires the presence of all the pathway’s enzymes, in exceptional cases, the absence of an enzyme could be complemented by enzymes with a related activity. Notably, this complementation has been documented in the case of Actinobacteria that have lost the phosphoribosyl anthranilate isomerase <italic toggle="yes">trpF</italic> gene (COG0135), which has been complemented by the enzyme PirA that provides the required isomerase activity [<xref rid="pone.0297010.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Using PyloString, we identified that analogous complementation could also have occurred in some organisms that are members of the Thaumarchaeota phylum (see module (2,1)). Furthermore, the absence of certain enzymes within the modules (2,1) could indicate that certain organisms are in the process of losing the L-Trp pathway, as could be the case of the organisms belonging to the Annelida phylum. This phenomenon has been observed in various pathogens, including certain species within the genera Haemophilus, Coxiella, and Propionibacterium [<xref rid="pone.0297010.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p>
        <p>Organisms of the phylogenetic phyla of the module (2,1) of <xref rid="pone.0297010.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref> are considered prototrophs and are predominantly bacteria (Phyla group 1, <xref rid="pone.0297010.s010" ref-type="supplementary-material">S7 Table</xref>). On the other hand, organisms of modules (2,2), and (2,3) comprise auxotrophic organisms that require external sources of tryptophan for their growth and survival. This group of organisms primarily includes eukaryotic organisms (groups 2 and 3, <xref rid="pone.0297010.s010" ref-type="supplementary-material">S7 Table</xref>). The under or over-representation of the COGs within the different modules for the heatmap of COG0147 is presented in the <xref rid="pone.0297010.s011" ref-type="supplementary-material">S8 Table</xref>.</p>
        <p>To further investigate the phylogenetic distribution of L-tryptophan auxotroph organisms, we repeated a similar analysis by selecting the "Class" option in the Phylogenetic level panel of the PhyloString web page. The heatmap and corresponding Tables are presented as Supplementary Material (<xref rid="pone.0297010.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Fig</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0297010.s012" ref-type="supplementary-material">S9</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0297010.s014" ref-type="supplementary-material">S11</xref> Tables). Interestingly, the COG groups obtained using both the "Phylum" and the "Class" options are almost the same (<xref rid="pone.0297010.s009" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0297010.s012" ref-type="supplementary-material">S9</xref> Tables), indicating that the functional relationships of the proteins involved in L-tryptophan biosynthesis are well-conserved across different phylogenetic lineages. However, when dividing the Phyla into their corresponding phylogenetic classes, specific tendencies within smaller groups of organisms become apparent. For instance, the Tissierellia and Erysipelotrichia classes, despite belonging to the Firmicutes phylum, which commonly comprises prototrophic organisms, lack the main enzymes of the L-trp biosynthesis pathway. A similar scenario is observed in the Proteobacteria class of Oligoflexia (<xref rid="pone.0297010.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Fig</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0297010.s013" ref-type="supplementary-material">S10 Table</xref>).</p>

        <title>iii) Key proteins involved in the eukaryotic transcription initiation process</title>
        <p>Transcription is the process by which the RNA polymerases (RNAPs) copy the information contained in the DNA into molecules of RNA. Although RNAPs in all three domains of life share a common evolutionary origin, important differences have been documented in the molecular mechanisms and proteins related to the transcription initiation process. In the case of bacterial RNAPs, the recognition of specific promoter sequences in DNA is facilitated by sigma factors. However, in the case of archaeal and eukaryotic RNAPs, sigma factors are absent. Instead, their recognition of promoter elements relies on different generalized transcription factors (GTFs) [<xref rid="pone.0297010.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0297010.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Furthermore, in eukaryotes, multiple types of nuclear RNAPs are responsible for transcribing distinct types of RNA. These transcription processes involve additional elements such as enhancers, silencers, and chromatin modifications (review in [<xref rid="pone.0297010.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]).</p>
        <p>One of the key components of the eukaryotic transcription initiation complex is the TATA-binding protein (TBP). Its primary function is to initiate transcription by RNA polymerase II at the promoters of protein-coding genes. TBP binds to a specific DNA sequence known as the TATA box, typically found in the promoter region of genes. The binding of the TBP to DNA initiates the recruitment of other transcription factors and RNA polymerase II. TBP It is an integral part of a larger protein complex known as the TFIID complex, which includes various TBP-associated factors.</p>
        <p>To have a broad overview of the proteins related to the eukaryotic transcription initiation process, we used the PhyloString web server with KOG1932 as input. This KOG corresponds to a TATA-binding protein-associated factor. The heatmap resulting from this analysis is shown in <xref rid="pone.0297010.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4</xref>, while the corresponding lists of COG groups and phylogeny groups, along with the statistical values indicating COG enrichment within this group, are provided in <xref rid="pone.0297010.s015" ref-type="supplementary-material">S12</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0297010.s017" ref-type="supplementary-material">S14</xref> Tables, respectively.</p>

            <p>The KOG1932 corresponds to a TATA-binding protein-associated factor. The parameters used in the analysis were: Phylogenetic level: Phylum, STRING cut-off: 800, COG centers: 2, Phylogenetic centers: 5. The first COG group includes proteins crucial to the process of transcription initiation in eukaryotic organisms. As anticipated, these proteins are absent in the fourth phylogenetic group, primarily composed of Bacteria and Archaea. This block also encompasses the phyla Euglenozoa and Fornicata, known for being among the more ancient phyla within Eukarya.</p>

        <p>Modules (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), and (1,5) in the heatmap shown in <xref rid="pone.0297010.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4</xref> illustrate the presence of essential proteins involved in the RNA polymerase II transcription initiation. In contrast, modules (2,1), (2,2), and (2,3) cluster proteins with less significant relationships. These proteins are linked to various functions, including interactions with vitamin receptors, histone acetyltransferases, and proteins with annotations as “uncharacterized conserved protein”.</p>
        <p>Remarkably, our PhyloString analysis, using KOG1932 as a seed, uncovered that some clades of eukaryotic organisms lack most of the proteins associated with the canonical eukaryotic transcription initiation process. These organisms are positioned near the root of the phylogenetic tree that divides Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya. The most striking instances are the Fornicata and Euglenozoa phyla, which represent the closest lineages to the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA, <xref rid="pone.0297010.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Fig</xref>).

Additional examples of primitive eukaryotic phyla that lack important KOGs associated with transcription initiation, as identified by PhyloString, include Apicomplexa, Ciliophora, Bacillariophyta, and Parabasalia. These phyla are clustered in the phylogenetic group 5 (<xref rid="pone.0297010.s014" ref-type="supplementary-material">S11 Table</xref>) and the module (1,5) of the <xref rid="pone.0297010.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4</xref>.</p>
        <p>Examples of lesser striking instances where KOGs involved in transcription initiation are absent can be observed in the Microsporidia, Haptista, Heterolobosea, and Rhodophyta phyla, which lack certain subunits of the transcription initiation factors.

        <p>Photosynthesis is a vital biological process that many organisms employ to convert light energy into chemical energy and store it in organic compounds that can later be metabolized through cellular respiration to provide the energy required to perform different biological activities.</p>
        <p>To have an overview of the functional network of proteins involved in this process, we used the COG5701, designated as Photosystem I reaction center subunit A1, PsaA, as input of our PhyloString web server.

The parameters used in the analysis were: Phylogenetic level: Phylum, STRING cut-off: 700, COG centers: 2, Phylogenetic centers: 3. Cyanobacteria, found in phylogenetic group 1, and specific eukaryotic phyla commonly recognized as green plants, possess the capability to carry out photosynthesis. This shared ability is reflected in the heatmap by the presence of essential orthologous proteins, represented as dark red cells.</p>

        <p>Remarkably, phylogenetic group 1 of the heatmap of <xref rid="pone.0297010.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref> exclusively comprises the Cyanobacteria phylum. These are photosynthetic bacteria that utilize chlorophyll and various pigments for photosynthesis. Unlike eukaryotic algae, they lack chloroplasts and instead perform photosynthesis within specialized cellular membrane structures. Furthermore, many cyanobacteria have the remarkable ability to capture atmospheric nitrogen. Their distinct blue-green color results from the presence of pigments like phycocyanin and chlorophyll, which overshadow the green tint of chlorophyll, providing cyanobacteria with their distinctive appearance [<xref rid="pone.0297010.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0297010.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p>
        <p>Phylogenetic group 2 of the heatmap of <xref rid="pone.0297010.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref> includes various phyla within the monophyletic group known as Viridiplantae, commonly referred to as green plants. These organisms get their green color from pigments like chlorophyll. Viridiplantae is characterized by its members being photosynthetic and having chloroplasts, the cellular organelles responsible for photosynthesis. Viridiplantae is a highly diverse group, including green algae, land plants (Embryophyta), and their closest algal relatives (Charophyta). This diversity spans from unicellular green algae to complex, multicellular land plants, such as mosses, ferns, conifers, and flowering plants. Viridiplantae can be found in various habitats, including freshwater and marine environments, moist soil, and terrestrial ecosystems. Green algae in this group are typically aquatic, while land plants have adapted to life on land [<xref rid="pone.0297010.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p>
        <p>Interestingly, most of the COGs in the heatmap of <xref rid="pone.0297010.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref> are clustered in the second COGs group and are related to the different Photosystem reaction center proteins I and II, and cytochrome b6f complex subunit (<xref rid="pone.0297010.s018" ref-type="supplementary-material">S15 Table</xref>). The Photosystem II reaction center is a crucial component of the photosynthetic process in plants, algae, and cyanobacteria. Its role is to initiate the light-dependent reactions of photosynthesis. The heatmap of <xref rid="pone.0297010.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref> shows that a core of this set of enzymes is almost exclusively found in organisms of the Cyanobacteria phylum, which forms the first phylogenetic group.

        <title>v) Endocytosis and intracellular vesicle trafficking</title>
        <p>Conventional clathrin-mediated endocytosis and intracellular vesicle trafficking are essential and highly conserved cellular mechanisms in eukaryotes. They are responsible for transporting proteins and lipids either from the plasma membrane or their site of biosynthesis to their respective functional locations within the cell. Through endocytosis, the cell takes solutes (cargo) and fluids from the external environment. It also plays a key role in regulating the signaling cascade mediated by plasma membrane receptors; it is the route of entry for some pathogens, among other functions [<xref rid="pone.0297010.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0297010.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. On the other hand, intracellular vesicle trafficking is responsible for the molecular transport between endomembrane-based organelles, such as endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi complex, endosome, and vacuole/lysosome. Additionally, it is involved in exocytosis and the recycling of endosomes back to the plasma membrane. These processes are vital for maintaining cellular organization and functionality [<xref rid="pone.0297010.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0297010.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p>
        <p>Vesicles are formed by the cytosolic-oriented bending of the donor plasma membrane, which is accompanied by the assembly of a cage-like structure on the cytosolic side of the nascent vesicle. This cage-like structure can be composed of either clathrin light and heavy chains in clathrin-coated vesicles (CCVs) or the coatmer protein complex I and II in COPI and COPII vesicles, respectively [<xref rid="pone.0297010.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0297010.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].</p>
        <p>In addition to cargo molecules, the membrane bending site recruits various accessory proteins, including Adaptor proteins (AP), cargo-receptors, ADP-ribosylation factor (Arf) small GTPases, RabGTPases, their specific guanine-exchange factors (GEFs), and activators (GAPs), as well as VAMP (vesicle-associated membrane proteins), SNARE proteins, among others [<xref rid="pone.0297010.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0297010.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Following the vesicle scission from the donor membrane, the cage-like structure disassembles. Afterwards, vesicle membrane fuses to the acceptor membrane. The membrane fusion process is facilitated by accessory proteins, including tethering proteins and SNAREs [<xref rid="pone.0297010.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0297010.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>].</p>
        <p>According to Thattai M. [<xref rid="pone.0297010.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], there are "budding specificity " and "fusion specificity" modules comprising coat proteins and the corresponding paralogous variants of accessory proteins acting at different locations, respectively. Recent genetic findings on the First and Last eukaryotic common ancestor (FECA and LECA) provide information on the origin and evolution of organelles and the molecular and cellular mechanisms involved in intracellular vesicle trafficking (reviewed by [<xref rid="pone.0297010.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0297010.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]).</p>
        <p>We employed the PhyloString web server to explore clathrin-mediated endocytosis and vesicular trafficking among different phylogenetic groups. In this case, we employed KOG0985 (Vesicle coat protein clathrin, heavy chain) as the query seed KOG.

        <p>As anticipated, structural, and accessory proteins related to clathrin-coated vesicles are exclusively grouped within the Eukarya phyla. These proteins include KOG0985 and KOG4031 (corresponding to vesicle coat protein clathrin’s heavy and light chains, respectively), KOG0934, KOG0935, and KOG0936 (AP/clathrin adaptor complex, small subunits), along with other components linked to the clathrin-mediated endocytosis machinery (see <xref rid="pone.0297010.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0297010.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Remarkably, the first phylogenetic group in the heatmap of <xref rid="pone.0297010.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6</xref> reveals that the eukaryotic phyla Fornicata and Microsporidia are grouped with bacterial and archaeal phyla that lack clathrin-mediated endocytosis and intracellular vesicle trafficking. Consequently, related KOGs are absent in this grouping. Fornicata and Microsporidia phyla exhibit a limited number of KOGs, including KOG0985 (Vesicle coat protein clathrin), KOG0934 (Clathrin adaptor complex), KOG0935 (Clathrin adaptor complex), as well as additional adaptor proteins such as those of KOG1061 (Vesicle coat complex AP-1/AP-2/AP-4, beta subunit), KOG0937 and KOG0938 (members of the Adaptor complexes medium subunit family). Surprisingly, KOG4031 (vesicle coat protein clathrin, light chain) is absent in the Fornicata and Microsporidia phyla, as observed in the Parabasalia and Euglena phyla of the third phylogenetic group. The clathrin light chain is crucial for clathrin-coated vesicle (CCVs) formation, playing a key role in polymerization and serving as a connecting link with the actin cytoskeleton [<xref rid="pone.0297010.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0297010.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. The absence of KOG4031 may suggest the formation of CCVs with different properties or efficiencies. The second phylogenetic group in the heatmap of <xref rid="pone.0297010.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6</xref> outlines KOGs present in metazoan, fungi, and amebozoan. It includes clathrin-mediated endocytosis and intracellular vesicle trafficking, as well as components somewhat associated with specific functional or cellular processes related to endocytosis (<xref rid="pone.0297010.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0297010.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Conversely, the third phylogenetic group mainly consists of unicellular and pluricellular algae, microalgae, land plants, and protozoa. This group clusters a reduced set of KOGs related to structural components of CCVs and intracellular vesicles.</p>
        <p>As KOGs related to COPI (KOG0292, Vesicle coat complex COPI, alpha subunit) and COPII (KOG1986, Vesicle coat complex COPII, subunit SEC23, and KOG0307, Vesicle coat complex COPII, subunit SEC31) vesicles were also observed in the heatmap of <xref rid="pone.0297010.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6</xref>, we conducted a new PhyloString analysis, utilizing KOG1078 (Vesicle coat complex COPI, gamma subunit) as query seed to find the phylogenetic distribution of other KOGs of proteins that are part of the Vesicle coat complex. The outcome of this analysis is illustrated in the heatmap of <xref rid="pone.0297010.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7</xref>, while the corresponding lists of COG groups and phylogeny groups, along with the statistical values indicating COG enrichment within this group, are provided in <xref rid="pone.0297010.s024" ref-type="supplementary-material">S21</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0297010.s026" ref-type="supplementary-material">S23</xref> Tables, respectively.</p>

            <p>The KOG1078 corresponds to the “Vesicle coat complex COPI, gamma subunit”. The parameters used in the analysis were: Phylogenetic level: Phylum, STRING cut-off: 850, COG centers: 2, Phylogenetic centers: 3. The first phylogenetic group is composed of Bacterial and Archaea phyla, which lack COPI intracellular vesicles. The second phylogenetic group includes Eukarya phyla. The phyla of this group is composed of organisms that possesses the structural components of COPI- and COPII-coated vesicles, as well as components somewhat associated to specific functional or cellular processes related to intracellular trafficking mediated by these vesicles. The third phylogenetic group is formed by the Fornicata and Microsporida phyla. Organisms of these phyla have all the structural components of COPI- and COPII-coated vesicles, except for the epsilon, gamma and zeta subunits of the COPI complex (KOG3081, KOG1078 and KOG3343, respectively).</p>

        <p><xref rid="pone.0297010.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7</xref> reveals a set of KOGs involved in vesicle trafficking, including subunits of the Vesicle coat complex COPI (one alpha—KOG0292, two beta—KOG1058 and KOG0276, one epsilon—KOG3081, one gamma—KOG1078, and one zeta—KOG3343). These groups of orthologous proteins are consistently present across all Eukarya phyla. However, it is noteworthy that KOG1078 and KOG3343 are absent in the Fornicata phylum, as indicated in <xref rid="pone.0297010.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0297010.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>.</p>
        <p>Apart from the Vesicle coat complex COPI subunits highlighted in the <xref rid="pone.0297010.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7</xref> heatmap, we have also identified the four structural subunits of the Vesicle coat complex COPII: Sec23 (KOG1986), Sec24 (KOG1985), Sec13 (KOG1332), and Sec31 (KOG0307), alongside the COPII-specific GTPase subunit SAR1 (KOG0077). The presence of these components spans across all Eukarya phyla, as depicted in the <xref rid="pone.0297010.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7</xref> heatmap and succinctly outlined in <xref rid="pone.0297010.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>.</p>
        <p>In summary, the heatmaps of Figs <xref rid="pone.0297010.g006" ref-type="fig">6</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0297010.g007" ref-type="fig">7</xref> disclosed fascinating information concerning organisms of the primitive eukaryotic group Fornicata, as exemplified by the diarrheal pathogen <italic toggle="yes">Giardia intestinalis</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0297010.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. These findings suggest that these organisms might possess relatively rudimentary clathrin-coated vesicle (CCV) and COPI-like vesicle systems. While this hypothesis requires experimental validation, it is consistent with the observed reduced subcellular organization observed in <italic toggle="yes">Giardia trophozoites</italic>.</p>
        <p>Giardia trophozoites exhibit a distinct endoplasmic reticulum network (ER) characterized by the presence of a unique vesicle system, known as peripheral vacuoles (PVs), positioned beneath the plasma membrane. This configuration may signify an evolutionary adaptation of the endocytic-exocytic pathways, potentially dependent on CCV- and COPI-like structures but lacking the clathrin light chain, as well as the COPI gamma and zeta subunits. Notably, PVs are contiguous with the ER but lack Golgi stacks [<xref rid="pone.0297010.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0297010.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>].</p>

        <p>Typically, COPI vesicles play a crucial role in transporting cargo molecules between the Golgi apparatus and the ER, as well as within Golgi stacks [<xref rid="pone.0297010.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The lack of certain components of the CCV and COPI machineries in other primitive Eukarya phyla, such as Parabasalia, Apicomplexa and Euglenozoa (<xref rid="pone.0297010.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) seem to be an indicative of the evolutionary events that contributed to the origin of multicellular organisms with a more complex cell biology, an avenue that would be interesting to explore.</p>

    <title>Conclusion</title>
    <p>We have developed PhyloString, a valuable website that enhances the comprehension of functional relationships among protein sets and their phylogenetic prevalence across the three kingdoms of life. Through heatmap-based graphical representations of functional networks and statistical analysis, we could identify modules of proteins whose functions are tightly related. Our research presented a wide range of diverse and representative examples of various cellular processes that can be analyzed from both metabolic and evolutionary perspectives using our web server PhyloString.</p>

    <p>Reviewer #1: PhyloString is one of the most useful web application. While the content is ok but the website part needs a revision.</p>
    <p>1. There is no help page.</p>
    <p>2. One tutorial page that will walk through with an example run is missing in the design.</p>
    <p>3. The example_seq looks like a nucleic acid sequence rather than a protein sequence. Although, I understand A, C, T, G codes for amino acids. Better change it to some protein sequence.</p>
    <p>4. Contact information is missing in the website. In case of difficulty, how the users will contact the authors/developers?</p>
    <p>5. You need to provide some example input and output.</p>
    <p>Reviewer #2: The manuscript entitled « PhyloString: a web server designed to identify, visualize, and evaluate functional relationships between orthologous protein groups across different phylogenetic lineages. «  by Dorantes-Torres et al. reports on a web server for assessing and visualising potential functional networks across organisms from different phylogenetic lineages. They rely on public databases, mostly STRING and COG, and on existing methodologies to build heat maps and perform statistical enrichment analysis. The tool can be of interest for the community and the authors successfully showcase some meaningful examples. However, both the manuscript and the webserver could be largely improved.</p>
    <p>Major concerns:</p>
    <p>1/ The methods are not sufficiently described. Please provide some hints as to what the R functions used are actually doing. Which statistical test, clustering method, etc?</p>
    <p>2/ The main result of the webserver is not clearly described. Could the authors explicitly write down the score that correspond to each cell in the heat map? In particular, it is not clear at all from the text that each cell correspond to some relationship between the protein in x-axis from the phyla in y-axis with the corresponding protein from the query COG. Moreover, do the author consider the presence/absence for the query only or for both proteins in the pair? In case a phylum contain several species, how is that dealt with to compute the score? How many species are there behind each heatmap?</p>
    <p>3/ What is the pertinence of using a continuous color scale when the null values have a special meaning: absence of the protein (and not only of the interaction)?</p>
    <p>4/ A lot of thresholds are used without justification. What would happen if we would vary the a bit? What would change if I change the query COG but I stay in the same functional set of proteins? How are the proteins in x-axis identified? Does the STRING index cutoff play a role in this selection? What would happen if I have 2 cells next to each other, one yellow and one red, and behind the yellow one the support for presence is 0.45 in the phylum, while it is 0.55 in the other cell? Is it really pertinent to put 0 and 1 which such similar proportions?</p>
    <p>5/ The webserver lacks documentation. It is easy to use but it is not so easy to understand the output without any tutorial or description.</p>
    <p>Minor points:</p>
    <p>- the figure legends should be more detailed.</p>
    <p>Reviewer #3: Dorantes-Torres et al. present a Web server, PhyloString, that analyses data, ingested from the STRING database and decomposes the associations in two-dimensional clustering, along the COG composition and the phylogenetic axes. The clustering is accompanied by a statistical enrichment/depletion estimate, based on an extremely naïve random independent combinatorial model.</p>
    <p>The server exists and serves the information claimed by the authors; this, technically, gives the whole enterprise a passing score for publication. The utility of the analysis is doubtful, given the primitive statistics and numerous ad hoc decisions, implemented in the pipeline (e.g. the binary presence/absence scoring at 50% of occurrence among the genomes in a phylogroup). Using a hopelessly outdated COG annotation doesn't help either (e.g. CRISPR-Cas9 is annotated as "Uncharacterized protein conserved in bacteria", as it was in 2003 version). The authors make no attempt to find the data-driven granularity for clustering, leaving the user to experiment with the settings.</p>
    <p>There is one problem that must be addressed in the revision: in the Methods section the authors mention using the R functions for hypergeometric distribution, but give no further details for the analysis they perform. Likewise, they use clustering facilities of the heatmap library without any reference to how the rows and columns are clustered. A detailed description of the analysis from the subject matter perspective (what is being computed and why, as opposed to details on how R functions are invoked), including the underlying assumptions and an assessment of their applicability to the real data, is necessary.</p>

    <p>Response to Reviewer #1: </p>
    <p>Reviewer #1: PhyloString is one of the most useful web application. While the content is ok but the website part needs a revision.</p>
    <p>1. There is no help page with clear instructions.</p>
    <p>We have introduced a Help web page that provides an overview of the PhyloString web server, explains the input parameters for the study, and outlines the various sections of the analysis output. Specifically, lines 258 to 264 in the revised version of our article highlight the availability of PhyloString's Help and Tutorial pages, serving as guides for users in navigating the main steps of their study.</p>
    <p>2. One tutorial page that will walk through with an example run is missing in the design.</p>
    <p>In addition to the Help page, our PhyloString web server now includes a Tutorial web page designed to guide users through the key steps of a standard study, along with valuable tips for maximizing the capabilities of PhyloString and effectively interpreting the diverse potential outcomes. Furthermore, the PhyloString Tutorial web page features illustrative examples, some of which are also presented in the article. As mentioned in the previous response, lines 258 to 264 in the revised version of our article emphasize the accessibility of PhyloString's Help and Tutorial pages.</p>
    <p>3. The example_seq looks like a nucleic acid sequence rather than a protein sequence. Although, I understand A, C, T, G codes for amino acids. Better change it to some protein sequence.</p>
    <p>Our updated version of PhyloString replaced the example sequence with an actual protein sequence. Furthermore, we have introduced a new feature in PhyloString that enables users to choose a COG/KOG using keywords that describe the functions associated with those orthologous groups.</p>
    <p>4. Contact information is missing in the website. In case of difficulty, how the users will contact the authors/developers?</p>
    <p>The contact information has been included at the bottom of the new version of our PhyloString web server.</p>
    <p>5. You need to provide some example input and output.</p>
    <p>As commented earlier, the Tutorial web page of the new version of our PhyloString website includes a set of practical examples, some of which are also showcased in the article. </p>
    <p>Response to Reviewer #2:</p>
    <p>Reviewer #2: The manuscript entitled « PhyloString: a web server designed to identify, visualize, and evaluate functional relationships between orthologous protein groups across different phylogenetic lineages. « by Dorantes-Torres et al. reports on a web server for assessing and visualising potential functional networks across organisms from different phylogenetic lineages. They rely on public databases, mostly STRING and COG, and on existing methodologies to build heat maps and perform statistical enrichment analysis. The tool can be of interest for the community and the authors successfully showcase some meaningful examples. However, both the manuscript and the webserver could be largely improved.</p>
    <p>Major concerns:</p>
    <p>1/ The methods are not sufficiently described. Please provide some hints as to what the R functions used are actually doing. Which statistical test, clustering method, etc?</p>
    <p>In the updated version of our article, lines 124 to 224, we have provided a more comprehensive explanation of R functions and the main variables used in the analysis. In addition, as indicated in lines 173 to 176, the new version of our PhyloString web server includes new options for the Clustering methods and Distance matrices that could be employed in the clustering procedure. The descriptions of these methods and distance metrics are presented in the new PhyloString Help webpage, as indicated in lines 187 to 196.</p>
    <p>2/ The main result of the webserver is not clearly described. Could the authors explicitly write down the score that correspond to each cell in the heat map? In particular, it is not clear at all from the text that each cell correspond to some relationship between the protein in x-axis from the phyla in y-axis with the corresponding protein from the query COG. Moreover, do the author consider the presence/absence for the query only or for both proteins in the pair? In case a phylum contain several species, how is that dealt with to compute the score? How many species are there behind each heatmap?</p>
    <p> In response to the reviewer's feedback and to better describe “The main result of the web server,” we have included a new figure (Fig 1) to represent the primary steps employed by PhyloString schematically. In addition, we have improved the description of the main steps of the PhyloString analysis and how the heatmap is generated and could be interpreted. In addition, as indicated in lines 153 to 224. </p>
    <p>Furthermore, we have also implemented a novel approach for presenting the specific information for each cell within a heatmap. In contrast to the previous display of a basic HTML file, the enhanced version of PhyloString now offers an interactive feature that provides valuable information for each cell when the user hovers their mouse cursor over it. This information includes the phylogenetic group, the COG or KOG ID and its description, the number of organisms considered in the count for the specific cell, and its corresponding score. Details regarding implementing this functionality can be found in the revised article, lines 243 to 257.</p>
    <p>3/ What is the pertinence of using a continuous color scale when the null values have a special meaning: absence of the protein (and not only of the interaction)?</p>
    <p>The gradient color scale employed by PhyloString holds significant importance in understanding the potential impact of the absence of a protein or a set of related proteins (modules) within the studied functional interaction network. This significance is exemplified in the second instance discussed in our article, focusing on the biosynthesis of the amino acid tryptophan (Fig 3).</p>
    <p>In this context, the absence of the enzyme phosphoribosyl anthranilate isomerase TrpF (COG0135) in the phylum Actinobacteria is readily interpretable due to the corresponding color approaching the highest possible value (1,000), indicating its considerable relevance in the biosynthetic process. Conversely, the yellow-like colors assigned to COG1535 (Isochorismate hydrolase), and COG3208 (Surfactin synthase thioesterase subunit) in Actinobacteria suggest that these COGs are less crucial to tryptophan biosynthesis. As elaborated in lines 330 to 335 of our article's updated version, the absence of the enzyme phosphoribosyl anthranilate isomerase TrpF (COG0135) has been compensated by the enzyme PirA, which provides the necessary isomerase activity.</p>
    <p>The significance of the gradient color scale is also highlighted in the third example discussed in our article, focusing on key proteins i</p>
    <p>nvolved in the eukaryotic transcription initiation process. As illustrated in Fig 4, cells representing COGs belonging to the first COG groups in all eukaryotic phyla are depicted in dark brown, indicating the presence of proteins crucial to this process. In contrast, cells corresponding to COGs less relevant to the eukaryotic transcription initiation process are depicted in yellow-like colors. Notably, these COGs are predominantly absent in ancient phyla, positioned close to the root of the phylogenetic tree that divides Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya (Fig 4). This suggests that only the more relevant proteins in the process are consistently shared among all eukaryotic phyla.</p>
    <p> In the updated version of the PhyloString web server, we have adjusted the color palette's scaling to enhance the visibility of distinctions among these values. Additionally, we have incorporated a practical example within the Tutorial web page to demonstrate how this color-coded information can aid in interpreting the analysis.</p>
    <p>4/ A lot of thresholds are used without justification. What would happen if we would vary the a bit?</p>
    <p>In response to the reviewer's comment, we have introduced a new feature on our PhyloString web server page, enabling users to vary and customize the parameter values according to their preferences. This new feature can be found selecting the Advance analysis option of PhyloString web page, as indicated in lines 175 to 176 of our revised version of the article. The pre-compiled analysis for predefined default values, which we have used as reference points, allows for quick output display and a rapid overview of various results. Subsequently, if users wish to fine-tune their analysis using values different from our predefined settings, the heatmaps and enrichment statistics will be generated dynamically in real time.</p>
    <p>What would change if I change the query COG but I stay in the same functional set of proteins? How are the proteins in x-axis identified? Does the STRING index cutoff play a role in this selection? </p>
    <p>The inquiry about the potential outcomes when substituting the COG seed with another COG in the same functional category and whether the String index cutoff value may impact these outcomes is an insightful question. To provide a comprehensive answer, we have integrated it into the PhyloString Tutorial web page, accompanied by illustrative examples that highlight these scenarios. Tip 3 of this Tutorial web page demonstrates the difference observed when using KOG1932 (TATA-binding protein-associated factor) and KOG3219 (Transcription initiation factor TFIID, subunit TAF11) as query seed KOGs. This showcases that, while the results are generally comparable, they are significantly influenced by the coherence of the functional relationships within the study process and the centrality of the chosen COG as a query seed.</p>
    <p> Regarding the identification of proteins and phylogeny classes within the heatmap cells, as mentioned in our second response, we have transitioned from our previous static HTML heatmaps to a dynamic interactive output where relevant information about each cell is displayed when users hover their mouse cursor over each cell. This information includes the phylogenetic group, the COG or KOG ID with its description, the count of organisms considered in the specific cell, and its corresponding score, as described in the updated article, lines 273 to 277.</p>
    <p>What would happen if I have 2 cells next to each other, one yellow and one red, and behind the yellow one the support for presence is 0.45 in the phylum, while it is 0.55 in the other cell? Is it really pertinent to put 0 and 1 which such similar proportions?</p>
    <p>We acknowledge the reviewer's concerns regarding using a single cutoff value of 50% to determine the presence or absence of a family of orthologous genes (COG/KOG) within a phylogenetic group in the heatmaps generated by PhyloString. We agree that this approach can lead to contiguous cells exhibiting slight variations in their relative COG frequencies, resulting in different presence and absence assignments. However, we would like to emphasize that while this criterion may have limitations in representing relative frequencies close to 50%, it generally serves as a useful descriptor. Initially, we also considered assigning cells within the heatmap to represent the relative frequency of organisms with the presence of the COG within each phylogenetic group. Although this approach might seem more precise in theory, it often resulted in noisy and biologically challenging interpretations. However, given the large number of cells in the heatmap generated by PhyloString, the simplification of considering cells with relative frequencies greater than 50% as present proved to be the most practical and interpretable choice in most cases. We believe that the examples presented in the article and the new help and tutorial web pages support our decision and help users understand the rationale behind it.</p>
    <p>5/ The webserver lacks documentation. It is easy to use but it is not so easy to understand the output without any tutorial or description.</p>
    <p>As previously addressed in our responses to reviewer #1's second and third questions, the updated version of PhyloString incorporates several enhancements. We have introduced a Help page to provide users with an overview of the PhyloString web server, elucidate the input parameters required for their studies, delineate the various sections in the analysis output, and offer guidance on effectively interpreting the results.</p>
    <p>In addition to the Help page, our PhyloString web server now includes a Tutorial web page strategically designed to lead users through the essential steps of a standard study. This tutorial also includes invaluable tips for harnessing PhyloString capabilities to their fullest and making sense of the diverse range of potential outcomes.</p>
    <p>Finally, in the updated version of the article, we have included a new figure (Fig 1) with a schematic representation of the primary steps employed by PhyloString</p>
    <p>Minor points:</p>
    <p>- the figure legends should be more detailed.</p>
    <p>Considering the reviewer's comment, the revised version of the article now provides more comprehensive and detailed legends for the figures, offering additional elements to facilitate their interpretation.</p>
    <p>Response to Reviewer #3:</p>
    <p>Reviewer #3: Dorantes-Torres et al. present a Web server, PhyloString, that analyses data, ingested from the STRING database and decomposes the associations in two-dimensional clustering, along the COG composition and the phylogenetic axes. The clustering is accompanied by a statistical enrichment/depletion estimate, based on an extremely naïve random independent combinatorial model. The server exists and serves the information claimed by the authors; this, technically, gives the whole enterprise a passing score for publication.</p>
    <p> The utility of the analysis is doubtful, given the primitive statistics and numerous ad hoc decisions, implemented in the pipeline (e.g. the binary presence/absence scoring at 50% of occurrence among the genomes in a phylogroup).</p>
    <p>As previously discussed in our responses to reviewer #2's fourth question, although the binary scoring at the 50% occurrence threshold among genomes within a phylogenetic group may have limitations in representing the presence/absence tendencies of some COGs, it generally serves as a valuable descriptor. Initially, we explored the option of assigning cells within the heatmap to represent the relative frequency of each phylogenetic group to have organisms coding the corresponding COGs. However, this approach, although theoretically more precise, often led to noisy and biologically complex interpretations.</p>
    <p>Given the substantial number of cells in the heatmap generated by PhyloString, we found that simplifying the representation by considering cells with relative frequencies greater than 50% as "present" was the most pragmatic and interpretable choice in most instances. We believe that the examples provided in the article and the new help and tutorial web pages offer ample support for our decision and help users grasp the reasoning behind it.</p>
    <p>Using a hopelessly outdated COG annotation doesn't help either (e.g. CRISPR-Cas9 is annotated as "Uncharacterized protein conserved in bacteria", as it was in 2003 version). </p>
    <p>In response to the referee's feedback, we have implemented significant updates to our PhyloString server. The server now operates using the latest version, 12.0, of the STRING database. Furthermore, we have generated revised versions of each analysis presented in our article, demonstrating the application of PhyloString in exploring biological processes and metabolic pathways considering the updated STRING 12.0 score values. </p>
    <p>The authors make no attempt to find the data-driven granularity for clustering, leaving the user to experiment with the settings.</p>
    <p>As we mentioned in our response to the fourth question raised by reviewer #2 and in consideration of the referee's comment, we have implemented a new feature on our PhyloString web server page. This feature empowers users to customize parameter values based on their preferences, allowing data-driven granularity for clustering, and facilitating the user to experiment with different settings. This new feature can be found selecting the Advanced analysis option of PhyloString web page, as indicated in lines 175 to 176 of our revised version of the article.</p>
    <p>The pre-compiled analysis with predefined default values, which we have established as reference points, enables rapid output display and a quick overview of various results. Subsequently, should users want to fine-tune their analysis using values different from our predefined settings, the heatmaps and enrichment statistics will be dynamically generated in real-time. Our newly added Help and Tutorial pages provide examples demonstrating how to leverage data-driven granularity for clustering.</p>
    <p>There is one problem that must be addressed in the revision: in the Methods section the authors mention using the R functions for hypergeometric distribution, but give no further details for the analysis they perform. Likewise, they use clustering facilities of the heatmap library without any reference to how the rows and columns are clustered. A detailed description of the analysis from the subject matter perspective (what is being computed and why, as opposed to details on how R functions are invoked), including the underlying assumptions and an assessment of their applicability to the real data, is necessary.</p>
    <p>In response to the reviewer's request, we have included a detailed description of the statistical principles underpinning our analysis in the Materials and Methods Section, lines 124 to 224. This description includes the new options we recently implemented to allow the users to select different Clustering methods and Distance matrices employed in the clustering procedure. These Methods and Distance matrices are now described in the supplementary Tables S1 and S2 of the updated version of the article and in the new PhyloString Help web page.</p>

    <p>Reviewer #3: The authors updated the COG annotations and provided better explanations to the algorithm details. The authors did not change the arbitrary binarization of the phyletic pattern and have not attempted to find the natural clustering thresholds (giving the users more clustering options is the opposite of the finding the data-driven granularity, as it shifts the burden on the user to explore and judge).</p>

      <p>Proteins are biological units whose essence is defined by their functional relationships with other proteins or biomolecules such as RNA, DNA, lipids, or carbohydrates. These functions encompass enzymatic, structural, regulatory, or physical interaction roles. The STRING database (Nucleic Acids Research, 8 Jan 2021;49(D1): D605-12) provides an index that defines the functional interaction networks between proteins in model organisms. To facilitate the identification, visualization, and evaluation of potential functional networks across organisms from different phylogenetic lineages, we have developed PhyloString (<ext-link xlink:href="https://biocomputo.ibt.unam.mx/phylostring" ext-link-type="uri">https://biocomputo.ibt.unam.mx/phylostring/</ext-link>), a web server that utilizes the indices of the STRING database. PhyloString decomposes these functional networks into modules, representing cohesive units of proteins grouped based on their similarity of STRING values and the phylogenetic origins of their respective organisms. This study presents and thoroughly discusses examples of such functional networks and their modules identified using PhyloString.</p>

    <title>Introduction</title>
    <p>Proteins are fundamental units of cells, playing crucial roles in growth, development, maintenance, and functionality by contributing to the structure, metabolism, regulation, and communication within cellular systems. Their essence, as cellular entities, is defined by their physical and functional interactions with other proteins and various types of biomolecules, including DNA or RNA molecules, lipids, carbohydrates, and cofactors. Numerous databases have been established to comprehensively compile and analyze the vast results generated from protein interaction studies. The creation and maintenance of these databases involve methodological and conceptual challenges such as utilizing standardized vocabularies and formats for protein and interaction descriptions, meticulous curation of information from scientific publications, and establishing a consistent approach for identifying the same protein across different databases. These challenges and a review of the most significant protein-protein interaction databases have been extensively discussed in [<xref rid="pone.0297010.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0297010.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p>
    <p>Among the various databases of protein-protein interactions, the STRING database deserves special mention due to its inclusion of physical and functional interactions between sets of two or more proteins [<xref rid="pone.0297010.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. This functional interaction of proteins can arise through various instances, such as sharing the same substrate in a metabolic pathway or being components of the same protein complex [<xref rid="pone.0297010.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p>
    <p>STRING is a comprehensive database that integrates experimentally validated and computationally predicted protein-protein interactions. Its initial version was developed as a web application primarily used to identify functionally related genes in prokaryotic organisms by analyzing the conservation of the same genomic neighborhood across different genomes [<xref rid="pone.0297010.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Over time, STRING has expanded to include additional sources of information, such as (i) genomic context analysis, which involves examining gene fusion events, conservation of genomic neighborhood, and phylogenetic co-occurrence profiles of orthologous gene pairs across different genomes; (ii) primary evidence obtained from experimental protein-protein interactions and gene co-expression experiments, meticulously curated from the scientific literature; (iii) manually curated pathway databases; and (iv) utilization of automatic literature mining techniques to identify genes that are co-mentioned within the abstracts of scientific publications. Afterward, this information is weighted by STRING based on the probabilities of proteins being present in the same metabolic pathway, as defined by the metabolic maps from the KEGG database (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) [<xref rid="pone.0297010.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. These weighted values are then integrated into a meaningful confidence score ranging from zero to 1,000, representing the strength of the physical or functional relationships for all protein interactions.</p>
    <p>A fundamental characteristic of STRING is that the information collected for one organism is transferred to other organisms within its database [<xref rid="pone.0297010.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0297010.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. To achieve this, functional equivalence is assigned to orthologous genes based on the orthologous groups defined by the COG database [<xref rid="pone.0297010.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Consequently, STRING provides a user-friendly web page that presents information on protein-protein interactions as a network. In this network, proteins (or their corresponding orthologous COG groups) serve as nodes (or vertices), while the edges represent the different types of evidence supporting the physical or functional protein-protein interactions.</p>
    <p>From a System Biology perspective, considering the entire network of physical or functional interactions within a cell is crucial to comprehensively define a protein’s function in a specific organism. This implies that while orthologous proteins may share similar physicochemical or enzymatic properties, their functions can vary depending on the presence or absence of their respective interaction partners, which contribute to their functional networks.</p>
    <p>In this study, we have developed PhyloString (<ext-link xlink:href="https://biocomputo.ibt.unam.mx/phylostring/" ext-link-type="uri">https://biocomputo.ibt.unam.mx/phylostring/</ext-link>), a web server that enables the analysis of protein functional modularity across different phylogenetic lineages in biological processes. PhyloString utilizes the functional relationships between proteins as defined in the STRING database [<xref rid="pone.0297010.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. By clustering proteins into modules based on their STRING scores and phylogenetic origins, PhyloString visually represents these modules using a heatmap. Additionally, PhyloString evaluates the statistical significance of protein enrichment within the modules.</p>
    <p>This article presents representative examples of differential protein-protein functional relationship modules identified among phylogenetic lineages using PhyloString. These examples are thoroughly discussed, highlighting the importance of understanding protein functional modularity across different evolutionary lineages.</p>

      <title>Data sources</title>
      <p>The STRING database v12.0 compiles information from 12,535 organisms, out of which 2,426 are categorized as core or reference organisms. Details about these organisms are structured into flat files, which were downloaded from its website at <ext-link xlink:href="https://string-db.org/" ext-link-type="uri">https://string-db.org/</ext-link>. These files included, among others: a) the orthologous groups and their proteins (COG.mappings.v12.0.txt); b) the name of the organisms and their taxonomic IDs (species.v12.0.txt); c) association scores between orthologous groups (COG.links.v12.0.txt); d) the full name of the organism´s lineage (fullnamelineage.dmp).</p>
      <p>This version of STRING includes functional relationships for protein orthology groups found mainly in bacterial organisms (COG) and eukaryotic organisms (KOG). To simplify, in this article, we will use the term COG to refer to both COG and KOG.</p>

      <title>Statistical analysis and heatmap construction</title>
      <p>We developed an R script (R version 4.3.0) to parse the data obtained from the STRING database (version v12.0). PhyloString facilitates assessing the distribution of biological functions, metabolic processes, structural elements, or regulatory complexes across diverse phylogenetic clades. To achieve this, PhyloString carries out several bioinformatics processes, as shown in <xref rid="pone.0297010.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>.</p>

          <title>Schematic representation of the primary steps employed by PhyloString.</title>
          <p>A) Using a COG as a query seed that describes the biological functions, metabolic processes, structural elements, or regulatory complexes PhyloString selects the orthologous groups meeting the user-defined STRING cutoff value, forming a network of protein-protein functional interactions. B) PhyloString assesses the frequency of each COG presence within the functional interaction network across genomes in various phylogenetic clades. This information is used to construct a binary matrix indicating presence (1) or absence (0). A value of 0 is assigned if the number of organisms with a particular orthologous group in a phylogenetic clade is less than 50%, and 1 otherwise. C) Each cell in the binary presence/absence matrix is multiplied by the STRING index representing the functional association between the seed COG and the COG of that cell. D) PhyloString generates a heatmap using these values and applies hierarchical clustering to both rows (representing different phylogenetic clades) and columns (representing distinct COG orthologous groups). The clustering process results in the heatmap being divided into specific areas or modules, indicating cohesive units of highly functionally related proteins. In the article, these modules are denoted in parentheses by two numbers separated by a comma, representing the horizontal and vertical positions, respectively. The horizontal position corresponds to the COGs cluster number, and the vertical to the phylogenetic cluster number.</p>

      </fig>
      <p>The analysis initiates by selecting a characteristic COG group as a seed query for the case study. Using this seed group, PhyloString identifies all functionally related COGs, surpassing a specified cut-off value according to the STRING index. This set of COGs thus selected are functionally related, either by participating in the same biological process, metabolic pathway, or structural complex, so they can be considered to form a network of functional protein-protein interactions (<xref rid="pone.0297010.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>). Subsequently, PhyloString evaluates the presence (1) or absence (0) of each COG defined as functionally related to the seed group within various phylogenetic clades. PhyloString assigns a value of 0 to a COG if the number of organisms with that COG in that phylogenetic clade is less than 50%, while a value of 1 is assigned if the frequency exceeds this threshold (<xref rid="pone.0297010.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>). These binary values are then multiplied by the corresponding STRING functional relationship index recorded for each COG pair (<xref rid="pone.0297010.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1C</xref>). The resulting values are employed to construct protein-protein interaction heatmaps (<xref rid="pone.0297010.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1D</xref>).</p>
      <p>To depict the functional proximity between the initial seed COG and each COG presented in the heatmap, a color code was employed. The colors ranged from lighter shades like yellow to darker hues such as cherry or black, representing weak to strong functional associations, respectively. The value scale diagram used in all heatmaps is illustrated in <xref rid="pone.0297010.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig</xref>.</p>
      <p>PhyloString enables users to conduct this analysis at two taxonomic levels: the phylum and class levels. To ensure rapid performance, PhyloString provides a collection of <italic toggle="yes">pre-processed analyses</italic> with readily selectable default values from the main web page. Nevertheless, PhyloString also offers flexibility for <italic toggle="yes">Advanced analysis</italic>, allowing users to customize parameter values to their preferences.</p>
      <p>Protein-protein interaction heatmaps are created using the <italic toggle="yes">pheatmap</italic> library in the RStudio software (Version 1.0.12). This library generates heatmaps with hierarchical clustering of the input data matrix applied to both rows, representing the different phylogenetic clades, and columns, representing the different orthologous groups (COGs).</p>
      <p>Among the various distance metrics accessible in <italic toggle="yes">pheatmap</italic>, the Euclidean distance is the default choice in our pre-compiled analyses. This preference is due to its simplicity and capability to generate biologically meaningful outcomes in most cases. Furthermore, the Euclidean distance stands as one of the most frequently employed distance metrics in various biological studies. However, within the <italic toggle="yes">Advanced analysis</italic> option of PhyloString, users have the flexibility to opt, in addition to the Euclidean distance, other metrics, including the Manhattan distance, the Minkowski distance, and the Maximum distance. In addition, the new version of PhyloString includes new options for the clustering procedure other than the Complete method, which is the default method. In the <italic toggle="yes">Advanced analysis</italic> option of PhyloString, users can use alternative clustering methods, including the Single, Average, Median, Ward.D, Ward.D2, and Centroid methods. Descriptions of the Clustering methods and Distance matrices employed in the clustering procedure are described in the <xref rid="pone.0297010.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0297010.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2</xref> Tables, respectively, and included in the new PhyloString Help webpage.</p>
      <p>The heatmaps are divided horizontally and vertically based on the user-selected number of COG and phylogenetic divisions, respectively. These selections are then used as the <italic toggle="yes">cluster_rows and cluster_columns</italic> parameters in the <italic toggle="yes">pheatmap</italic> library. To evaluate the enrichment of COG groups within the various modules, we used the hypergeometric distribution, which models the probability of achieving a precise count of successes when making a set number of draws without replacement from a finite population composed of known successes and failures. The analysis of the hypergeometric distribution was conducted using the <italic toggle="yes">phyper</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">dhyper</italic> functions of the RStudio software and involves four key parameters, which are as follows:</p>
      <list list-type="order">
        <list-item>
          <p>The Population Size (N), in our case, corresponds to the total number of cells in the heatmap, which is determined by multiplying the number of phylogenetic clades by the number of COGs in the heatmap.</p>
        </list-item>
        <list-item>
          <p>The number of Successes in the Population (H) represents instances where any COG within the heatmap is found in at least 50% of the organisms from a particular phylogenetic clade under study. In simpler terms, it counts all heatmap cells with values greater than 0 in this context.</p>
        </list-item>
        <list-item>
          <p>The Sample Size (n) refers to the count of cells present in a specific subset of the heatmap. This subset is determined by the combination of COG groups and phylogenetic classes identified during the clustering process. The total number of potential heatmap subsets corresponds to the product of the chosen COG groups and phylogenetic groups initially selected by the user for analysis.</p>

      <title>Defining COG seeds from protein sequences</title>
      <p>As previously mentioned, every PhyloString analysis requires a COG seed as the central point around which functional neighbors are selected for heatmap display. In cases where there is no readily available COG seed or a keyword to facilitate seed identification, but a protein sequence is related to the study, PhyloString can determine its corresponding COG based on its sequence similarity to a reference database build with a non-redundant set of proteins of the STRING´s core organisms. To this end, the proteins of organisms classified as core were grouped in accordance with their COG assignation. The groups built in this way were processed to remove redundant proteins using the cd-hit program [<xref rid="pone.0297010.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] and a sequence identity using a threshold of 0.8.</p>

      <title>Webpage construction</title>
      <p>The PhyloString webpage comprises a four-layer structure: i) the database layer, where the data is processed by <italic toggle="yes">ad hoc</italic> scripts that read several input parameters and pre-process data from our set of 4,510 COG and 3,131 KOG groups; ii) the frontend layer comprises html5, JavaScript, and Cascading Style Sheets 3 (CSS3) codes. This second layer allows the users to manipulate the backend layer; iii) the pre-render layer is an intermediate layer where the server accesses its APIs, retrieves values from the database, and establishes the foundation for creating charts based on user-input data. This is the most complex layer, constructed using a combination of PHP, JavaScript, Perl, and C frameworks, as well as custom scripts over an implementation of the amCharts software; iv) the backend layer is the last. It takes user input selections, processes them using allocated values from the database, and generates human-readable graphics presented to the user inside the frontend layer. This backend layer was written in Hypertext Preprocessor (PHP) and Perl program languages.</p>
      <p>In addition to the primary PhyloString page, users can refer to the "Help" and "Tutorial" pages for guidance on the key steps involved in the study.

      <title>Web page construction</title>
      <p>We developed PhyloString, a web page designed to analyze protein-protein functional interaction networks based on data from the STRING database. These networks are represented as heatmaps, where each cell reflects the product of two factors: the binary classification of COG group frequencies in the studied phylogenetic lineages and the STRING score between pairs of COG groups. To perform a quick inspection, PhyloString has implemented a function that allows the user to obtain the information of each cell within the heatmap when the user hovers their mouse over it. This information includes the phylogenetic group, the COG ID with its description, the count of organisms considered in the specific cell, and its corresponding score.</p>
      <p>To assess the prevalence of specific subsets of COGs within protein-protein functional interaction networks, we performed a clustering analysis of the heatmap cells using their corresponding STRING values. Our approach involved dividing the list of COGs and organisms into user-defined divisions, COG centers (2 to 6), and Phylogenetic centers (3 to 5), as displayed on the PhyloString webpage. As a result, the heatmaps are segmented into distinct rectangular areas called "Modules." These modules represent cohesive sets of proteins that perform closely related functions within the entire functional network. Furthermore, PhyloString evaluates the statistical significance of COG enrichment within different modules of the heatmaps, presenting the enrichment analysis results as supplementary tables.</p>
      <p>To facilitate the functional networks analysis, PhyloString provides flexibility in setting cut-off values for STRING scores (specifically, 900, 850, 800, 750, and 700). Additionally, users can choose the desired level of taxonomic depth for analysis, whether by considering the <italic toggle="yes">Phylum</italic> or <italic toggle="yes">Class</italic> of the organisms. This customizable approach enables users to explore and interpret the data more effectively.</p>
      <p>PhyloString offers a help webpage and a tutorial webpage designed to offer users a comprehensive understanding of the web server. These pages aim to clarify the necessary input parameters for their studies, outline the different sections in the analysis output, and guide users through the essential steps of a standard study. Additionally, they provide valuable tips for maximizing the capabilities of PhyloString. The key steps utilized by PhyloString are depicted in <xref rid="pone.0297010.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>.</p>

      <title>Representative examples of the use of PhyloString</title>
      <p>To illustrate the diverse range of analysis achievable with PhyloString, we present a set of examples centered in essential cellular processes. The functional relationships between proteins in these processes are visualized as heatmaps, where cohesive and integrated modules are identified, representing tightly functionally related proteins. Throughout the text, the modules are denoted by their positions in the heatmaps, enclosed in round parentheses, representing their corresponding COG and phylogenetic groups, respectively.</p>
      <sec id="sec011">
        <title>i) Ribosomal and other proteins that are involved in the translation process</title>
        <p>Ribosomes are essential cellular complexes composed of small proteins and RNA molecules. They play a crucial role across all three domains of life, Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya, in translating mRNA into proteins by catalyzing the assembly of amino acids into polypeptide chains. However, the complexity of ribosomes varies depending on the phylogenetic origin of the organism. Bacterial organisms show the lowest, followed by archaeal organisms, while eukaryotic organisms exhibit the highest level of complexity in their ribosomal composition [<xref rid="pone.0297010.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0297010.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p>
        <p>Despite the differences in composition, ribosomes of all three domains of life possess a common set of 34 proteins that are universally conserved and are the central core of their structure. This set of proteins is responsible for the ribosome´s main functions, such as peptide bond formation during protein synthesis [<xref rid="pone.0297010.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0297010.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In addition, there is a set of ribosomal proteins common to archaeal and eukaryotic organisms, while some others are exclusively found in bacterial and eukaryotic organisms.</p>
        <p>To investigate the phylogenetic distribution of proteins involved in the translation process, we utilized PhyloString to analyze the functional relationships within the COG0199, which clusters the S14 orthologous ribosomal proteins. The resulting analysis is presented in the heatmap shown in <xref rid="pone.0297010.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>. This figure reveals that COGs of modules (4,1), (4,2), and (4,3) (COG group 4, <xref rid="pone.0297010.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Table</xref>) form part of the core ribosomal proteins shared by Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya (phylogenetic groups 1–3, <xref rid="pone.0297010.s007" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4 Table</xref>). The statistical values for the COG enrichment within this group can be found in the supplementary material (<xref rid="pone.0297010.s008" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5 Table</xref>). Furthermore, we observed that COGs of modules (3,2) and (3,3) mainly correspond to proteins shared by Archaea and Eukarya, while COGs of modules (2,1) and (2,3) are primarily associated with proteins shared by Bacteria and Eukarya. Lastly, module (1,1) corresponds to proteins mainly present in Bacteria.</p>

        <title>ii) Amino acid biosynthesis. Tryptophan autotrophic and heterotrophic organisms identified by PhyloString</title>

        <p>Module (2,1) of the heatmap of <xref rid="pone.0297010.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref> clusters all the autotrophic organisms having the enzymes involved in L-tryptophan biosynthesis, which are clustered COG group 2 (<xref rid="pone.0297010.s009" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6 Table</xref>), and include the following enzymes: Anthranilate synthase TrpE (COG0147), which forms a complex with TrpG (COG0512) to convert chorismate and glutamine into anthranilate [<xref rid="pone.0297010.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]; TrpD (COG0547), known as anthranilate phosphoribosyl transferase, which transfers the phosphoribosyl group from 5-phosphorylribose-1-pyrophosphate to anthranilate, resulting in phosphoribosyl anthranilate; TrpF (COG0135), or phosphoribosyl anthranilate isomerase, which converts the phosphoribosyl anthranilate into carboxyphenylamino-deoxyribulse-5-phosphate. Additionally, TrpC (COG0134), referred to as indol-3-glycerol phosphate synthase, removes the carbon dioxide from carboxyphenylamino-deoxyribulse-5-phosphate resulting in the formation of indole-3-glycerol phosphate. Finally, the tryptophan synthase TrpA alpha chain (COG0159) cleaves the indoleglycerol phosphate to generate glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate and indole. The indole molecule generated in the previous step is used with L-serine by TrpB (COG0133), the beta chain of tryptophan synthase, to synthesize L-tryptophan.</p>
        <p>Although the biosynthesis of L-tryptophan from chorismate commonly requires the presence of all the pathway’s enzymes, in exceptional cases, the absence of an enzyme could be complemented by enzymes with a related activity. Notably, this complementation has been documented in the case of Actinobacteria that have lost the phosphoribosyl anthranilate isomerase <italic toggle="yes">trpF</italic> gene (COG0135), which has been complemented by the enzyme PirA that provides the required isomerase activity [<xref rid="pone.0297010.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Using PyloString, we identified that analogous complementation could also have occurred in some organisms that are members of the Thaumarchaeota phylum (see module (2,1)). Furthermore, the absence of certain enzymes within the modules (2,1) could indicate that certain organisms are in the process of losing the L-Trp pathway, as could be the case of the organisms belonging to the Annelida phylum. This phenomenon has been observed in various pathogens, including certain species within the genera Haemophilus, Coxiella, and Propionibacterium [<xref rid="pone.0297010.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p>
        <p>Organisms of the phylogenetic phyla of the module (2,1) of <xref rid="pone.0297010.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref> are considered prototrophs and are predominantly bacteria (Phyla group 1, <xref rid="pone.0297010.s010" ref-type="supplementary-material">S7 Table</xref>). On the other hand, organisms of modules (2,2), and (2,3) comprise auxotrophic organisms that require external sources of tryptophan for their growth and survival. This group of organisms primarily includes eukaryotic organisms (groups 2 and 3, <xref rid="pone.0297010.s010" ref-type="supplementary-material">S7 Table</xref>). The under or over-representation of the COGs within the different modules for the heatmap of COG0147 is presented in the <xref rid="pone.0297010.s011" ref-type="supplementary-material">S8 Table</xref>.</p>
        <p>To further investigate the phylogenetic distribution of L-tryptophan auxotroph organisms, we repeated a similar analysis by selecting the "Class" option in the Phylogenetic level panel of the PhyloString web page. The heatmap and corresponding Tables are presented as Supplementary Material (<xref rid="pone.0297010.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Fig</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0297010.s012" ref-type="supplementary-material">S9</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0297010.s014" ref-type="supplementary-material">S11</xref> Tables). Interestingly, the COG groups obtained using both the "Phylum" and the "Class" options are almost the same (<xref rid="pone.0297010.s009" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0297010.s012" ref-type="supplementary-material">S9</xref> Tables), indicating that the functional relationships of the proteins involved in L-tryptophan biosynthesis are well-conserved across different phylogenetic lineages. However, when dividing the Phyla into their corresponding phylogenetic classes, specific tendencies within smaller groups of organisms become apparent. For instance, the Tissierellia and Erysipelotrichia classes, despite belonging to the Firmicutes phylum, which commonly comprises prototrophic organisms, lack the main enzymes of the L-trp biosynthesis pathway. A similar scenario is observed in the Proteobacteria class of Oligoflexia (<xref rid="pone.0297010.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Fig</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0297010.s013" ref-type="supplementary-material">S10 Table</xref>).</p>

        <title>iii) Key proteins involved in the eukaryotic transcription initiation process</title>
        <p>Transcription is the process by which the RNA polymerases (RNAPs) copy the information contained in the DNA into molecules of RNA. Although RNAPs in all three domains of life share a common evolutionary origin, important differences have been documented in the molecular mechanisms and proteins related to the transcription initiation process. In the case of bacterial RNAPs, the recognition of specific promoter sequences in DNA is facilitated by sigma factors. However, in the case of archaeal and eukaryotic RNAPs, sigma factors are absent. Instead, their recognition of promoter elements relies on different generalized transcription factors (GTFs) [<xref rid="pone.0297010.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0297010.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Furthermore, in eukaryotes, multiple types of nuclear RNAPs are responsible for transcribing distinct types of RNA. These transcription processes involve additional elements such as enhancers, silencers, and chromatin modifications (review in [<xref rid="pone.0297010.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]).</p>
        <p>One of the key components of the eukaryotic transcription initiation complex is the TATA-binding protein (TBP). Its primary function is to initiate transcription by RNA polymerase II at the promoters of protein-coding genes. TBP binds to a specific DNA sequence known as the TATA box, typically found in the promoter region of genes. The binding of the TBP to DNA initiates the recruitment of other transcription factors and RNA polymerase II. TBP It is an integral part of a larger protein complex known as the TFIID complex, which includes various TBP-associated factors.</p>
        <p>To have a broad overview of the proteins related to the eukaryotic transcription initiation process, we used the PhyloString web server with KOG1932 as input. This KOG corresponds to a TATA-binding protein-associated factor. The heatmap resulting from this analysis is shown in <xref rid="pone.0297010.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4</xref>, while the corresponding lists of COG groups and phylogeny groups, along with the statistical values indicating COG enrichment within this group, are provided in <xref rid="pone.0297010.s015" ref-type="supplementary-material">S12</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0297010.s017" ref-type="supplementary-material">S14</xref> Tables, respectively.</p>

            <p>The KOG1932 corresponds to a TATA-binding protein-associated factor. The parameters used in the analysis were: Phylogenetic level: Phylum, STRING cut-off: 800, COG centers: 2, Phylogenetic centers: 5. The first COG group includes proteins crucial to the process of transcription initiation in eukaryotic organisms. As anticipated, these proteins are absent in the fourth phylogenetic group, primarily composed of Bacteria and Archaea. This block also encompasses the phyla Euglenozoa and Fornicata, known for being among the more ancient phyla within Eukarya.</p>

        <p>Modules (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), and (1,5) in the heatmap shown in <xref rid="pone.0297010.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4</xref> illustrate the presence of essential proteins involved in the RNA polymerase II transcription initiation. In contrast, modules (2,1), (2,2), and (2,3) cluster proteins with less significant relationships. These proteins are linked to various functions, including interactions with vitamin receptors, histone acetyltransferases, and proteins with annotations as “uncharacterized conserved protein”.</p>
        <p>Remarkably, our PhyloString analysis, using KOG1932 as a seed, uncovered that some clades of eukaryotic organisms lack most of the proteins associated with the canonical eukaryotic transcription initiation process. These organisms are positioned near the root of the phylogenetic tree that divides Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya. The most striking instances are the Fornicata and Euglenozoa phyla, which represent the closest lineages to the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA, <xref rid="pone.0297010.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Fig</xref>). In the heatmap of <xref rid="pone.0297010.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4</xref>, module (1,4), Fornicata and Euglenozoa cluster with the bacterial phyla (<xref rid="pone.0297010.s014" ref-type="supplementary-material">S11 Table</xref>) since they lack most of the KOGs related to transcription initiation that are present in eukaryotic organisms. Additional examples of primitive eukaryotic phyla that lack important KOGs associated with transcription initiation, as identified by PhyloString, include Apicomplexa, Ciliophora, Bacillariophyta, and Parabasalia. These phyla are clustered in the phylogenetic group 5 (<xref rid="pone.0297010.s014" ref-type="supplementary-material">S11 Table</xref>) and the module (1,5) of the <xref rid="pone.0297010.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4</xref>.</p>
        <p>Examples of lesser striking instances where KOGs involved in transcription initiation are absent can be observed in the Microsporidia, Haptista, Heterolobosea, and Rhodophyta phyla, which lack certain subunits of the transcription initiation factors.

        <p>Photosynthesis is a vital biological process that many organisms employ to convert light energy into chemical energy and store it in organic compounds that can later be metabolized through cellular respiration to provide the energy required to perform different biological activities.</p>
        <p>To have an overview of the functional network of proteins involved in this process, we used the COG5701, designated as Photosystem I reaction center subunit A1, PsaA, as input of our PhyloString web server.

The parameters used in the analysis were: Phylogenetic level: Phylum, STRING cut-off: 700, COG centers: 2, Phylogenetic centers: 3. Cyanobacteria, found in phylogenetic group 1, and specific eukaryotic phyla commonly recognized as green plants, possess the capability to carry out photosynthesis. This shared ability is reflected in the heatmap by the presence of essential orthologous proteins, represented as dark red cells.</p>

        <p>Remarkably, phylogenetic group 1 of the heatmap of <xref rid="pone.0297010.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref> exclusively comprises the Cyanobacteria phylum. These are photosynthetic bacteria that utilize chlorophyll and various pigments for photosynthesis. Unlike eukaryotic algae, they lack chloroplasts and instead perform photosynthesis within specialized cellular membrane structures. Furthermore, many cyanobacteria have the remarkable ability to capture atmospheric nitrogen. Their distinct blue-green color results from the presence of pigments like phycocyanin and chlorophyll, which overshadow the green tint of chlorophyll, providing cyanobacteria with their distinctive appearance [<xref rid="pone.0297010.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0297010.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p>
        <p>Phylogenetic group 2 of the heatmap of <xref rid="pone.0297010.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref> includes various phyla within the monophyletic group known as Viridiplantae, commonly referred to as green plants. These organisms get their green color from pigments like chlorophyll. Viridiplantae is characterized by its members being photosynthetic and having chloroplasts, the cellular organelles responsible for photosynthesis. Viridiplantae is a highly diverse group, including green algae, land plants (Embryophyta), and their closest algal relatives (Charophyta). This diversity spans from unicellular green algae to complex, multicellular land plants, such as mosses, ferns, conifers, and flowering plants. Viridiplantae can be found in various habitats, including freshwater and marine environments, moist soil, and terrestrial ecosystems. Green algae in this group are typically aquatic, while land plants have adapted to life on land [<xref rid="pone.0297010.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p>
        <p>Interestingly, most of the COGs in the heatmap of <xref rid="pone.0297010.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref> are clustered in the second COGs group and are related to the different Photosystem reaction center proteins I and II, and cytochrome b6f complex subunit (<xref rid="pone.0297010.s018" ref-type="supplementary-material">S15 Table</xref>). The Photosystem II reaction center is a crucial component of the photosynthetic process in plants, algae, and cyanobacteria. Its role is to initiate the light-dependent reactions of photosynthesis. The heatmap of <xref rid="pone.0297010.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref> shows that a core of this set of enzymes is almost exclusively found in organisms of the Cyanobacteria phylum, which forms the first phylogenetic group. This core is also found in members of the second phylogenetic group, which includes various phyla of Viridiplantae, such as Chlorophyta, Streptophyta, Haptista, Bacillariophyta, and Rhodophyta (<xref rid="pone.0297010.s019" ref-type="supplementary-material">S16 Table</xref>).

        <title>v) Endocytosis and intracellular vesicle trafficking</title>
        <p>Conventional clathrin-mediated endocytosis and intracellular vesicle trafficking are essential and highly conserved cellular mechanisms in eukaryotes. They are responsible for transporting proteins and lipids either from the plasma membrane or their site of biosynthesis to their respective functional locations within the cell. Through endocytosis, the cell takes solutes (cargo) and fluids from the external environment. It also plays a key role in regulating the signaling cascade mediated by plasma membrane receptors; it is the route of entry for some pathogens, among other functions [<xref rid="pone.0297010.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0297010.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. On the other hand, intracellular vesicle trafficking is responsible for the molecular transport between endomembrane-based organelles, such as endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi complex, endosome, and vacuole/lysosome. Additionally, it is involved in exocytosis and the recycling of endosomes back to the plasma membrane. These processes are vital for maintaining cellular organization and functionality [<xref rid="pone.0297010.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0297010.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p>
        <p>Vesicles are formed by the cytosolic-oriented bending of the donor plasma membrane, which is accompanied by the assembly of a cage-like structure on the cytosolic side of the nascent vesicle. This cage-like structure can be composed of either clathrin light and heavy chains in clathrin-coated vesicles (CCVs) or the coatmer protein complex I and II in COPI and COPII vesicles, respectively [<xref rid="pone.0297010.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0297010.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].</p>
        <p>In addition to cargo molecules, the membrane bending site recruits various accessory proteins, including Adaptor proteins (AP), cargo-receptors, ADP-ribosylation factor (Arf) small GTPases, RabGTPases, their specific guanine-exchange factors (GEFs), and activators (GAPs), as well as VAMP (vesicle-associated membrane proteins), SNARE proteins, among others [<xref rid="pone.0297010.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0297010.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Following the vesicle scission from the donor membrane, the cage-like structure disassembles. Afterwards, vesicle membrane fuses to the acceptor membrane. The membrane fusion process is facilitated by accessory proteins, including tethering proteins and SNAREs [<xref rid="pone.0297010.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0297010.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>].</p>
        <p>According to Thattai M. [<xref rid="pone.0297010.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], there are "budding specificity " and "fusion specificity" modules comprising coat proteins and the corresponding paralogous variants of accessory proteins acting at different locations, respectively. Recent genetic findings on the First and Last eukaryotic common ancestor (FECA and LECA) provide information on the origin and evolution of organelles and the molecular and cellular mechanisms involved in intracellular vesicle trafficking (reviewed by [<xref rid="pone.0297010.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0297010.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]).</p>
        <p>We employed the PhyloString web server to explore clathrin-mediated endocytosis and vesicular trafficking among different phylogenetic groups. In this case, we employed KOG0985 (Vesicle coat protein clathrin, heavy chain) as the query seed KOG.

        <p>As anticipated, structural, and accessory proteins related to clathrin-coated vesicles are exclusively grouped within the Eukarya phyla. These proteins include KOG0985 and KOG4031 (corresponding to vesicle coat protein clathrin’s heavy and light chains, respectively), KOG0934, KOG0935, and KOG0936 (AP/clathrin adaptor complex, small subunits), along with other components linked to the clathrin-mediated endocytosis machinery (see <xref rid="pone.0297010.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0297010.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Remarkably, the first phylogenetic group in the heatmap of <xref rid="pone.0297010.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6</xref> reveals that the eukaryotic phyla Fornicata and Microsporidia are grouped with bacterial and archaeal phyla that lack clathrin-mediated endocytosis and intracellular vesicle trafficking. Consequently, related KOGs are absent in this grouping. Fornicata and Microsporidia phyla exhibit a limited number of KOGs, including KOG0985 (Vesicle coat protein clathrin), KOG0934 (Clathrin adaptor complex), KOG0935 (Clathrin adaptor complex), as well as additional adaptor proteins such as those of KOG1061 (Vesicle coat complex AP-1/AP-2/AP-4, beta subunit), KOG0937 and KOG0938 (members of the Adaptor complexes medium subunit family). Surprisingly, KOG4031 (vesicle coat protein clathrin, light chain) is absent in the Fornicata and Microsporidia phyla, as observed in the Parabasalia and Euglena phyla of the third phylogenetic group. The clathrin light chain is crucial for clathrin-coated vesicle (CCVs) formation, playing a key role in polymerization and serving as a connecting link with the actin cytoskeleton [<xref rid="pone.0297010.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0297010.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. The absence of KOG4031 may suggest the formation of CCVs with different properties or efficiencies. The second phylogenetic group in the heatmap of <xref rid="pone.0297010.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6</xref> outlines KOGs present in metazoan, fungi, and amebozoan. It includes clathrin-mediated endocytosis and intracellular vesicle trafficking, as well as components somewhat associated with specific functional or cellular processes related to endocytosis (<xref rid="pone.0297010.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0297010.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Conversely, the third phylogenetic group mainly consists of unicellular and pluricellular algae, microalgae, land plants, and protozoa. This group clusters a reduced set of KOGs related to structural components of CCVs and intracellular vesicles.</p>
        <p>As KOGs related to COPI (KOG0292, Vesicle coat complex COPI, alpha subunit) and COPII (KOG1986, Vesicle coat complex COPII, subunit SEC23, and KOG0307, Vesicle coat complex COPII, subunit SEC31) vesicles were also observed in the heatmap of <xref rid="pone.0297010.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6</xref>, we conducted a new PhyloString analysis, utilizing KOG1078 (Vesicle coat complex COPI, gamma subunit) as query seed to find the phylogenetic distribution of other KOGs of proteins that are part of the Vesicle coat complex. The outcome of this analysis is illustrated in the heatmap of <xref rid="pone.0297010.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7</xref>, while the corresponding lists of COG groups and phylogeny groups, along with the statistical values indicating COG enrichment within this group, are provided in <xref rid="pone.0297010.s024" ref-type="supplementary-material">S21</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0297010.s026" ref-type="supplementary-material">S23</xref> Tables, respectively.</p>

            <p>The KOG1078 corresponds to the “Vesicle coat complex COPI, gamma subunit”. The parameters used in the analysis were: Phylogenetic level: Phylum, STRING cut-off: 850, COG centers: 2, Phylogenetic centers: 3. The first phylogenetic group is composed of Bacterial and Archaea phyla, which lack COPI intracellular vesicles. The second phylogenetic group includes Eukarya phyla. The phyla of this group is composed of organisms that possesses the structural components of COPI- and COPII-coated vesicles, as well as components somewhat associated to specific functional or cellular processes related to intracellular trafficking mediated by these vesicles. The third phylogenetic group is formed by the Fornicata and Microsporida phyla. Organisms of these phyla have all the structural components of COPI- and COPII-coated vesicles, except for the epsilon, gamma and zeta subunits of the COPI complex (KOG3081, KOG1078 and KOG3343, respectively).</p>

        <p><xref rid="pone.0297010.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7</xref> reveals a set of KOGs involved in vesicle trafficking, including subunits of the Vesicle coat complex COPI (one alpha—KOG0292, two beta—KOG1058 and KOG0276, one epsilon—KOG3081, one gamma—KOG1078, and one zeta—KOG3343). These groups of orthologous proteins are consistently present across all Eukarya phyla. However, it is noteworthy that KOG1078 and KOG3343 are absent in the Fornicata phylum, as indicated in <xref rid="pone.0297010.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0297010.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>.</p>
        <p>Apart from the Vesicle coat complex COPI subunits highlighted in the <xref rid="pone.0297010.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7</xref> heatmap, we have also identified the four structural subunits of the Vesicle coat complex COPII: Sec23 (KOG1986), Sec24 (KOG1985), Sec13 (KOG1332), and Sec31 (KOG0307), alongside the COPII-specific GTPase subunit SAR1 (KOG0077). The presence of these components spans across all Eukarya phyla, as depicted in the <xref rid="pone.0297010.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7</xref> heatmap and succinctly outlined in <xref rid="pone.0297010.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>.</p>
        <p>In summary, the heatmaps of Figs <xref rid="pone.0297010.g006" ref-type="fig">6</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0297010.g007" ref-type="fig">7</xref> disclosed fascinating information concerning organisms of the primitive eukaryotic group Fornicata, as exemplified by the diarrheal pathogen <italic toggle="yes">Giardia intestinalis</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0297010.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. These findings suggest that these organisms might possess relatively rudimentary clathrin-coated vesicle (CCV) and COPI-like vesicle systems. While this hypothesis requires experimental validation, it is consistent with the observed reduced subcellular organization observed in <italic toggle="yes">Giardia trophozoites</italic>.</p>
        <p>Giardia trophozoites exhibit a distinct endoplasmic reticulum network (ER) characterized by the presence of a unique vesicle system, known as peripheral vacuoles (PVs), positioned beneath the plasma membrane. This configuration may signify an evolutionary adaptation of the endocytic-exocytic pathways, potentially dependent on CCV- and COPI-like structures but lacking the clathrin light chain, as well as the COPI gamma and zeta subunits. Notably, PVs are contiguous with the ER but lack Golgi stacks [<xref rid="pone.0297010.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0297010.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>].</p>

        <p>Typically, COPI vesicles play a crucial role in transporting cargo molecules between the Golgi apparatus and the ER, as well as within Golgi stacks [<xref rid="pone.0297010.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The lack of certain components of the CCV and COPI machineries in other primitive Eukarya phyla, such as Parabasalia, Apicomplexa and Euglenozoa (<xref rid="pone.0297010.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) seem to be an indicative of the evolutionary events that contributed to the origin of multicellular organisms with a more complex cell biology, an avenue that would be interesting to explore.</p>

    <title>Conclusion</title>
    <p>We have developed PhyloString, a valuable website that enhances the comprehension of functional relationships among protein sets and their phylogenetic prevalence across the three kingdoms of life. Through heatmap-based graphical representations of functional networks and statistical analysis, we could identify modules of proteins whose functions are tightly related. Our research presented a wide range of diverse and representative examples of various cellular processes that can be analyzed from both metabolic and evolutionary perspectives using our web server PhyloString.</p>

The heatmap reveals that certain phylogenetic classes, even though they are part of a phylum typically associated with prototrophic organisms, do not possess the primary enzymes of the L-trp biosynthesis pathway. Examples include the classes Tissierellia, Erysipelotrichia, and Oligoflexia.</p>

    <p>The <ext-link xlink:href="http://www.plosone.org/static/policies.action#sharing" ext-link-type="uri">PLOS Data policy</ext-link> requires authors to make all data underlying the findings described in their manuscript fully available without restriction, with rare exception (please refer to the Data Availability Statement in the manuscript PDF file). The data should be provided as part of the manuscript or its supporting information, or deposited to a public repository. For example, in addition to summary statistics, the data points behind means, medians and variance measures should be available. If there are restrictions on publicly sharing data—e.g. participant privacy or use of data from a third party—those must be specified.<!-- </font> --></p>

    <p>Reviewer #1: PhyloString is one of the most useful web application. While the content is ok but the website part needs a revision.</p>
    <p>1. There is no help page.</p>
    <p>2. One tutorial page that will walk through with an example run is missing in the design.</p>
    <p>3. The example_seq looks like a nucleic acid sequence rather than a protein sequence. Although, I understand A, C, T, G codes for amino acids. Better change it to some protein sequence.</p>
    <p>4. Contact information is missing in the website. In case of difficulty, how the users will contact the authors/developers?</p>
    <p>5. You need to provide some example input and output.</p>
    <p>Reviewer #2: The manuscript entitled « PhyloString: a web server designed to identify, visualize, and evaluate functional relationships between orthologous protein groups across different phylogenetic lineages. «  by Dorantes-Torres et al. reports on a web server for assessing and visualising potential functional networks across organisms from different phylogenetic lineages. They rely on public databases, mostly STRING and COG, and on existing methodologies to build heat maps and perform statistical enrichment analysis. The tool can be of interest for the community and the authors successfully showcase some meaningful examples. However, both the manuscript and the webserver could be largely improved.</p>
    <p>Major concerns:</p>
    <p>1/ The methods are not sufficiently described. Please provide some hints as to what the R functions used are actually doing. Which statistical test, clustering method, etc?</p>
    <p>2/ The main result of the webserver is not clearly described. Could the authors explicitly write down the score that correspond to each cell in the heat map? In particular, it is not clear at all from the text that each cell correspond to some relationship between the protein in x-axis from the phyla in y-axis with the corresponding protein from the query COG. Moreover, do the author consider the presence/absence for the query only or for both proteins in the pair? In case a phylum contain several species, how is that dealt with to compute the score? How many species are there behind each heatmap?</p>
    <p>3/ What is the pertinence of using a continuous color scale when the null values have a special meaning: absence of the protein (and not only of the interaction)?</p>
    <p>4/ A lot of thresholds are used without justification. What would happen if we would vary the a bit? What would change if I change the query COG but I stay in the same functional set of proteins? How are the proteins in x-axis identified? Does the STRING index cutoff play a role in this selection? What would happen if I have 2 cells next to each other, one yellow and one red, and behind the yellow one the support for presence is 0.45 in the phylum, while it is 0.55 in the other cell? Is it really pertinent to put 0 and 1 which such similar proportions?</p>
    <p>5/ The webserver lacks documentation. It is easy to use but it is not so easy to understand the output without any tutorial or description.</p>
    <p>Minor points:</p>
    <p>- the figure legends should be more detailed.</p>
    <p>Reviewer #3: Dorantes-Torres et al. present a Web server, PhyloString, that analyses data, ingested from the STRING database and decomposes the associations in two-dimensional clustering, along the COG composition and the phylogenetic axes. The clustering is accompanied by a statistical enrichment/depletion estimate, based on an extremely naïve random independent combinatorial model.</p>
    <p>The server exists and serves the information claimed by the authors; this, technically, gives the whole enterprise a passing score for publication. The utility of the analysis is doubtful, given the primitive statistics and numerous ad hoc decisions, implemented in the pipeline (e.g. the binary presence/absence scoring at 50% of occurrence among the genomes in a phylogroup). Using a hopelessly outdated COG annotation doesn't help either (e.g. CRISPR-Cas9 is annotated as "Uncharacterized protein conserved in bacteria", as it was in 2003 version). The authors make no attempt to find the data-driven granularity for clustering, leaving the user to experiment with the settings.</p>
    <p>There is one problem that must be addressed in the revision: in the Methods section the authors mention using the R functions for hypergeometric distribution, but give no further details for the analysis they perform. Likewise, they use clustering facilities of the heatmap library without any reference to how the rows and columns are clustered. A detailed description of the analysis from the subject matter perspective (what is being computed and why, as opposed to details on how R functions are invoked), including the underlying assumptions and an assessment of their applicability to the real data, is necessary.</p>

    <p>Response to Reviewer #1: </p>
    <p>Reviewer #1: PhyloString is one of the most useful web application. While the content is ok but the website part needs a revision.</p>
    <p>1. There is no help page with clear instructions.</p>
    <p>We have introduced a Help web page that provides an overview of the PhyloString web server, explains the input parameters for the study, and outlines the various sections of the analysis output. Specifically, lines 258 to 264 in the revised version of our article highlight the availability of PhyloString's Help and Tutorial pages, serving as guides for users in navigating the main steps of their study.</p>
    <p>2. One tutorial page that will walk through with an example run is missing in the design.</p>
    <p>In addition to the Help page, our PhyloString web server now includes a Tutorial web page designed to guide users through the key steps of a standard study, along with valuable tips for maximizing the capabilities of PhyloString and effectively interpreting the diverse potential outcomes. Furthermore, the PhyloString Tutorial web page features illustrative examples, some of which are also presented in the article. As mentioned in the previous response, lines 258 to 264 in the revised version of our article emphasize the accessibility of PhyloString's Help and Tutorial pages.</p>
    <p>3. The example_seq looks like a nucleic acid sequence rather than a protein sequence. Although, I understand A, C, T, G codes for amino acids. Better change it to some protein sequence.</p>
    <p>Our updated version of PhyloString replaced the example sequence with an actual protein sequence. Furthermore, we have introduced a new feature in PhyloString that enables users to choose a COG/KOG using keywords that describe the functions associated with those orthologous groups.</p>
    <p>4. Contact information is missing in the website. In case of difficulty, how the users will contact the authors/developers?</p>
    <p>The contact information has been included at the bottom of the new version of our PhyloString web server.</p>
    <p>5. You need to provide some example input and output.</p>
    <p>As commented earlier, the Tutorial web page of the new version of our PhyloString website includes a set of practical examples, some of which are also showcased in the article. </p>
    <p>Response to Reviewer #2:</p>
    <p>Reviewer #2: The manuscript entitled « PhyloString: a web server designed to identify, visualize, and evaluate functional relationships between orthologous protein groups across different phylogenetic lineages. « by Dorantes-Torres et al. reports on a web server for assessing and visualising potential functional networks across organisms from different phylogenetic lineages. They rely on public databases, mostly STRING and COG, and on existing methodologies to build heat maps and perform statistical enrichment analysis. The tool can be of interest for the community and the authors successfully showcase some meaningful examples. However, both the manuscript and the webserver could be largely improved.</p>
    <p>Major concerns:</p>
    <p>1/ The methods are not sufficiently described. Please provide some hints as to what the R functions used are actually doing. Which statistical test, clustering method, etc?</p>
    <p>In the updated version of our article, lines 124 to 224, we have provided a more comprehensive explanation of R functions and the main variables used in the analysis. In addition, as indicated in lines 173 to 176, the new version of our PhyloString web server includes new options for the Clustering methods and Distance matrices that could be employed in the clustering procedure. The descriptions of these methods and distance metrics are presented in the new PhyloString Help webpage, as indicated in lines 187 to 196.</p>
    <p>2/ The main result of the webserver is not clearly described. Could the authors explicitly write down the score that correspond to each cell in the heat map? In particular, it is not clear at all from the text that each cell correspond to some relationship between the protein in x-axis from the phyla in y-axis with the corresponding protein from the query COG. Moreover, do the author consider the presence/absence for the query only or for both proteins in the pair? In case a phylum contain several species, how is that dealt with to compute the score? How many species are there behind each heatmap?</p>
    <p> In response to the reviewer's feedback and to better describe “The main result of the web server,” we have included a new figure (Fig 1) to represent the primary steps employed by PhyloString schematically. In addition, we have improved the description of the main steps of the PhyloString analysis and how the heatmap is generated and could be interpreted. In addition, as indicated in lines 153 to 224. </p>
    <p>Furthermore, we have also implemented a novel approach for presenting the specific information for each cell within a heatmap. In contrast to the previous display of a basic HTML file, the enhanced version of PhyloString now offers an interactive feature that provides valuable information for each cell when the user hovers their mouse cursor over it. This information includes the phylogenetic group, the COG or KOG ID and its description, the number of organisms considered in the count for the specific cell, and its corresponding score. Details regarding implementing this functionality can be found in the revised article, lines 243 to 257.</p>
    <p>3/ What is the pertinence of using a continuous color scale when the null values have a special meaning: absence of the protein (and not only of the interaction)?</p>
    <p>The gradient color scale employed by PhyloString holds significant importance in understanding the potential impact of the absence of a protein or a set of related proteins (modules) within the studied functional interaction network. This significance is exemplified in the second instance discussed in our article, focusing on the biosynthesis of the amino acid tryptophan (Fig 3).</p>
    <p>In this context, the absence of the enzyme phosphoribosyl anthranilate isomerase TrpF (COG0135) in the phylum Actinobacteria is readily interpretable due to the corresponding color approaching the highest possible value (1,000), indicating its considerable relevance in the biosynthetic process. Conversely, the yellow-like colors assigned to COG1535 (Isochorismate hydrolase), and COG3208 (Surfactin synthase thioesterase subunit) in Actinobacteria suggest that these COGs are less crucial to tryptophan biosynthesis. As elaborated in lines 330 to 335 of our article's updated version, the absence of the enzyme phosphoribosyl anthranilate isomerase TrpF (COG0135) has been compensated by the enzyme PirA, which provides the necessary isomerase activity.</p>
    <p>The significance of the gradient color scale is also highlighted in the third example discussed in our article, focusing on key proteins i</p>
    <p>nvolved in the eukaryotic transcription initiation process. As illustrated in Fig 4, cells representing COGs belonging to the first COG groups in all eukaryotic phyla are depicted in dark brown, indicating the presence of proteins crucial to this process. In contrast, cells corresponding to COGs less relevant to the eukaryotic transcription initiation process are depicted in yellow-like colors. Notably, these COGs are predominantly absent in ancient phyla, positioned close to the root of the phylogenetic tree that divides Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya (Fig 4). This suggests that only the more relevant proteins in the process are consistently shared among all eukaryotic phyla.</p>
    <p> In the updated version of the PhyloString web server, we have adjusted the color palette's scaling to enhance the visibility of distinctions among these values. Additionally, we have incorporated a practical example within the Tutorial web page to demonstrate how this color-coded information can aid in interpreting the analysis.</p>
    <p>4/ A lot of thresholds are used without justification. What would happen if we would vary the a bit?</p>
    <p>In response to the reviewer's comment, we have introduced a new feature on our PhyloString web server page, enabling users to vary and customize the parameter values according to their preferences. This new feature can be found selecting the Advance analysis option of PhyloString web page, as indicated in lines 175 to 176 of our revised version of the article. The pre-compiled analysis for predefined default values, which we have used as reference points, allows for quick output display and a rapid overview of various results. Subsequently, if users wish to fine-tune their analysis using values different from our predefined settings, the heatmaps and enrichment statistics will be generated dynamically in real time.</p>
    <p>What would change if I change the query COG but I stay in the same functional set of proteins? How are the proteins in x-axis identified? Does the STRING index cutoff play a role in this selection? </p>
    <p>The inquiry about the potential outcomes when substituting the COG seed with another COG in the same functional category and whether the String index cutoff value may impact these outcomes is an insightful question. To provide a comprehensive answer, we have integrated it into the PhyloString Tutorial web page, accompanied by illustrative examples that highlight these scenarios. Tip 3 of this Tutorial web page demonstrates the difference observed when using KOG1932 (TATA-binding protein-associated factor) and KOG3219 (Transcription initiation factor TFIID, subunit TAF11) as query seed KOGs. This showcases that, while the results are generally comparable, they are significantly influenced by the coherence of the functional relationships within the study process and the centrality of the chosen COG as a query seed.</p>
    <p> Regarding the identification of proteins and phylogeny classes within the heatmap cells, as mentioned in our second response, we have transitioned from our previous static HTML heatmaps to a dynamic interactive output where relevant information about each cell is displayed when users hover their mouse cursor over each cell. This information includes the phylogenetic group, the COG or KOG ID with its description, the count of organisms considered in the specific cell, and its corresponding score, as described in the updated article, lines 273 to 277.</p>
    <p>What would happen if I have 2 cells next to each other, one yellow and one red, and behind the yellow one the support for presence is 0.45 in the phylum, while it is 0.55 in the other cell? Is it really pertinent to put 0 and 1 which such similar proportions?</p>
    <p>We acknowledge the reviewer's concerns regarding using a single cutoff value of 50% to determine the presence or absence of a family of orthologous genes (COG/KOG) within a phylogenetic group in the heatmaps generated by PhyloString. We agree that this approach can lead to contiguous cells exhibiting slight variations in their relative COG frequencies, resulting in different presence and absence assignments. However, we would like to emphasize that while this criterion may have limitations in representing relative frequencies close to 50%, it generally serves as a useful descriptor. Initially, we also considered assigning cells within the heatmap to represent the relative frequency of organisms with the presence of the COG within each phylogenetic group. Although this approach might seem more precise in theory, it often resulted in noisy and biologically challenging interpretations. However, given the large number of cells in the heatmap generated by PhyloString, the simplification of considering cells with relative frequencies greater than 50% as present proved to be the most practical and interpretable choice in most cases. We believe that the examples presented in the article and the new help and tutorial web pages support our decision and help users understand the rationale behind it.</p>
    <p>5/ The webserver lacks documentation. It is easy to use but it is not so easy to understand the output without any tutorial or description.</p>
    <p>As previously addressed in our responses to reviewer #1's second and third questions, the updated version of PhyloString incorporates several enhancements. We have introduced a Help page to provide users with an overview of the PhyloString web server, elucidate the input parameters required for their studies, delineate the various sections in the analysis output, and offer guidance on effectively interpreting the results.</p>
    <p>In addition to the Help page, our PhyloString web server now includes a Tutorial web page strategically designed to lead users through the essential steps of a standard study. This tutorial also includes invaluable tips for harnessing PhyloString capabilities to their fullest and making sense of the diverse range of potential outcomes.</p>
    <p>Finally, in the updated version of the article, we have included a new figure (Fig 1) with a schematic representation of the primary steps employed by PhyloString</p>
    <p>Minor points:</p>
    <p>- the figure legends should be more detailed.</p>
    <p>Considering the reviewer's comment, the revised version of the article now provides more comprehensive and detailed legends for the figures, offering additional elements to facilitate their interpretation.</p>
    <p>Response to Reviewer #3:</p>
    <p>Reviewer #3: Dorantes-Torres et al. present a Web server, PhyloString, that analyses data, ingested from the STRING database and decomposes the associations in two-dimensional clustering, along the COG composition and the phylogenetic axes. The clustering is accompanied by a statistical enrichment/depletion estimate, based on an extremely naïve random independent combinatorial model. The server exists and serves the information claimed by the authors; this, technically, gives the whole enterprise a passing score for publication.</p>
    <p> The utility of the analysis is doubtful, given the primitive statistics and numerous ad hoc decisions, implemented in the pipeline (e.g. the binary presence/absence scoring at 50% of occurrence among the genomes in a phylogroup).</p>
    <p>As previously discussed in our responses to reviewer #2's fourth question, although the binary scoring at the 50% occurrence threshold among genomes within a phylogenetic group may have limitations in representing the presence/absence tendencies of some COGs, it generally serves as a valuable descriptor. Initially, we explored the option of assigning cells within the heatmap to represent the relative frequency of each phylogenetic group to have organisms coding the corresponding COGs. However, this approach, although theoretically more precise, often led to noisy and biologically complex interpretations.</p>
    <p>Given the substantial number of cells in the heatmap generated by PhyloString, we found that simplifying the representation by considering cells with relative frequencies greater than 50% as "present" was the most pragmatic and interpretable choice in most instances. We believe that the examples provided in the article and the new help and tutorial web pages offer ample support for our decision and help users grasp the reasoning behind it.</p>
    <p>Using a hopelessly outdated COG annotation doesn't help either (e.g. CRISPR-Cas9 is annotated as "Uncharacterized protein conserved in bacteria", as it was in 2003 version). </p>
    <p>In response to the referee's feedback, we have implemented significant updates to our PhyloString server. The server now operates using the latest version, 12.0, of the STRING database. Furthermore, we have generated revised versions of each analysis presented in our article, demonstrating the application of PhyloString in exploring biological processes and metabolic pathways considering the updated STRING 12.0 score values. </p>
    <p>The authors make no attempt to find the data-driven granularity for clustering, leaving the user to experiment with the settings.</p>
    <p>As we mentioned in our response to the fourth question raised by reviewer #2 and in consideration of the referee's comment, we have implemented a new feature on our PhyloString web server page. This feature empowers users to customize parameter values based on their preferences, allowing data-driven granularity for clustering, and facilitating the user to experiment with different settings. This new feature can be found selecting the Advanced analysis option of PhyloString web page, as indicated in lines 175 to 176 of our revised version of the article.</p>
    <p>The pre-compiled analysis with predefined default values, which we have established as reference points, enables rapid output display and a quick overview of various results. Subsequently, should users want to fine-tune their analysis using values different from our predefined settings, the heatmaps and enrichment statistics will be dynamically generated in real-time. Our newly added Help and Tutorial pages provide examples demonstrating how to leverage data-driven granularity for clustering.</p>
    <p>There is one problem that must be addressed in the revision: in the Methods section the authors mention using the R functions for hypergeometric distribution, but give no further details for the analysis they perform. Likewise, they use clustering facilities of the heatmap library without any reference to how the rows and columns are clustered. A detailed description of the analysis from the subject matter perspective (what is being computed and why, as opposed to details on how R functions are invoked), including the underlying assumptions and an assessment of their applicability to the real data, is necessary.</p>
    <p>In response to the reviewer's request, we have included a detailed description of the statistical principles underpinning our analysis in the Materials and Methods Section, lines 124 to 224. This description includes the new options we recently implemented to allow the users to select different Clustering methods and Distance matrices employed in the clustering procedure. These Methods and Distance matrices are now described in the supplementary Tables S1 and S2 of the updated version of the article and in the new PhyloString Help web page.</p>

    <p>Reviewer #2: The authors did a very good job at addressing my concerns. They clarified some methodological points and they showcased the web server usefulness on several practical case studies.</p>
    <p>Reviewer #3: The authors updated the COG annotations and provided better explanations to the algorithm details. The authors did not change the arbitrary binarization of the phyletic pattern and have not attempted to find the natural clustering thresholds (giving the users more clustering options is the opposite of the finding the data-driven granularity, as it shifts the burden on the user to explore and judge).</p>
