    <abstract>
      <p>Spatial organization of different epigenomic marks was used to infer functions of the epigenome. It remains unclear what can be learned from the temporal changes of the epigenome. Here, we developed a probabilistic model to cluster genomic sequences based on the similarity of temporal changes of multiple epigenomic marks during a cellular differentiation process. We differentiated mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells into mesendoderm cells. At three time points during this differentiation process, we used high-throughput sequencing to measure seven histone modifications and variants—H3K4me1/2/3, H3K27ac, H3K27me3, H3K36me3, and H2A.Z; two DNA modifications—5-mC and 5-hmC; and transcribed mRNAs and noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs). Genomic sequences were clustered based on the spatiotemporal epigenomic information. These clusters not only clearly distinguished gene bodies, promoters, and enhancers, but also were predictive of bidirectional promoters, miRNA promoters, and piRNAs. This suggests specific epigenomic patterns exist on piRNA genes much earlier than germ cell development. Temporal changes of H3K4me2, unmethylated CpG, and H2A.Z were predictive of 5-hmC changes, suggesting unmethylated CpG and H3K4me2 as potential upstream signals guiding TETs to specific sequences. Several rules on combinatorial epigenomic changes and their effects on mRNA expression and ncRNA expression were derived, including a simple rule governing the relationship between 5-hmC and gene expression levels. A <italic>Sox17</italic> enhancer containing a FOXA2 binding site and a <italic>Foxa2</italic> enhancer containing a SOX17 binding site were identified, suggesting a positive feedback loop between the two mesendoderm transcription factors. These data illustrate the power of using epigenome dynamics to investigate regulatory functions.</p>

<body>
  <p>An epigenome consists of chemical modifications and protein variations to the DNA and histones, and some of these modifications and variations can be passed down to an organism's offspring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">Bernstein et al. 2007</xref>). Epigenomes are dynamic, and epigenetic modifications are associated with changes in gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">Creyghton et al. 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">Hawkins et al. 2011</xref>). Thus, the epigenome adds an extra layer of information onto the genomic sequence and enables a genome to dynamically orchestrate gene expression in different cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">Karlic et al. 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">Maunakea et al. 2010</xref>). It is argued that organismal development can be viewed as a progression of epigenomic states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">Bernstein et al. 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">Hawkins et al. 2010</xref>). To gain mechanistic support for this view, a number of challenges have to be addressed. First, when presented with genome-wide distributions of epigenetic modifications at multiple time points during a developmental or differentiation process, how can we find the genomic (<italic>cis</italic>-) regulatory sequences that regulate gene expression? What are the combinatorial functions of epigenetic modifications and regulatory sequences? Here, we present experimental data and a probabilistic model that utilizes the temporal changes of the epigenome to annotate the regulatory sequences. This approach classifies regulatory sequences by their temporal epigenomic patterns, and thus it can identify subclasses of <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory sequences with different regulatory functions.</p>
  <p>Two types of associations were observed between the epigenome and gene expression. First, in a given cell type, the transcription levels of different genes are associated with the epigenomic modifications in the genomic neighborhoods of these genes. In other words, without changing cell types, epigenomic modifications at different chromosomal locations are indicative of the relative abundance of RNAs transcribed from these locations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>, spatial correlation [S]; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">Karlic et al. 2010</xref>). Second, for a given gene, the temporal change in its expression during a developmental or differentiation process is associated with temporal epigenomic changes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>, temporal correlation [T]; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">Rada-Iglesias et al. 2011</xref>). The first type of association facilitated the use of invariant epigenomic signatures in a static cellular condition to annotate genomic features (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">Ernst and Kellis 2010</xref>). However, genes are dynamically regulated in nearly all biological processes. It is important to incorporate the dynamic aspect of gene regulation into the annotation of the regulatory sequences. Here, we jointly model the position effect and the temporal effect of the epigenome, thus achieving ab initio identification and functional annotation of regulatory sequences.</p>

  <p>The regulatory functions of a number of epigenetic modifications remain elusive. A case in point is DNA hydroxymethylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">Wyatt and Cohen 1952</xref>). Methylated cytosine (5-mC) can be converted to an oxidized form 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5-hmC) by a family of ten-eleven translocation (TET) proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">Tahiliani et al. 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">Ito et al. 2010</xref>). In embryonic stem (ES) cells, 5-hmC is enriched in gene bodies of actively transcribed genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">Wu et al. 2011a</xref>), promoters of inactive genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">Ficz et al. 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">Pastor et al. 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">Wu et al. 2011a</xref>), and active enhancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">Stroud et al. 2011</xref>). These seemingly conflicting data are thought-provoking for analyzing epigenetic modifications in a combinatorial manner, such that the function of each modification is investigated in the context of other modifications as well as the underlying genomic sequence. By modeling the co-appearance of different epigenetic modifications in each cell type, a pioneering method demonstrated the power in predicting different genomic features, including enhancers and genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">Ernst and Kellis 2010</xref>). However, epigenomic co-appearance in static cell types does not reveal all epigenetic mechanisms of gene regulation. Two major questions remain unsolved. First, what are the upstream signals that guide specific epigenomic modifications, such as 5-hmC, to appear in specific genomic regions? Second, the regulatory functions for several epigenomic marks, including 5-hmC and H2A.Z, remain elusive. New ideas for combinatorial epigenomic analyses beyond the co-appearance in static cell types are needed. A natural extension in this direction is to utilize a dynamic process in which both the epigenome and the transcriptome have changes. Ideally, we need some methods that can capture combinatorial patterns of temporal epigenomic changes and correlate them with gene expression changes.</p>
  <p>A major difficulty in analyzing epigenomic dynamics lies in the asynchronous nature of epigenomic changes in different genomic regions. Suppose a type of epigenomic change, for example, the induction of H3K4me1 and 5-hmC, is a recurring pattern shared by many genomic regions. Such a pattern can be difficult to find because different genomic regions can accumulate either modification at different times. Furthermore, the corresponding changes in gene expression are not synchronized, making it difficult to associate epigenomic dynamics with gene expression changes. To reveal the hidden rules of epigenomic dynamics and gene expression, we developed a spatiotemporal clustering model. This model clusters genomic regions by shared epigenomic changes but does not require the changes to be synchronized among a cluster of genomic regions. This was achieved by allowing each region to have its own time-specific <italic>epigenomic states</italic> and then integrating out the time of transition between the epigenomic states in the clustering model.</p>
  <p>To investigate the functions of epigenetic modifications in a dynamic process, we differentiated mouse ES cells into mesendoderm cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">Yasunaga et al. 2005</xref>), the common precursor of mesoderm and endoderm. At three time points during this differentiation process, we mapped the genomic distributions of nine epigenetic modifications, including DNA methylation (5-mC), hydroxymethylation (5-hmC), histone variant H2A.Z, and histone modifications H3K4me1, H3K4me3, H3K27ac, H3K27me3, and H3K36me3. At the same time points, we also assayed the expression of small noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) and total RNAs (Supplemental Fig. S1). Our model-based analysis of these temporal data revealed several fundamental properties of epigenome dynamics, characterizing regulatory roles for functionally elusive epigenomic modifications. As an analogy to the sequence “rules” of gene regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">Buchler et al. 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">Beer and Tavazoie 2004</xref>), these discoveries may provide epigenomic “rules” of gene regulation.</p>

      <title>A model for genome annotation using temporal epigenomic data</title>
      <p>We developed a probabilistic model to annotate the genome using temporal epigenomic data. Two main features of this model include explicit treatment of combinatorial epigenomic changes and detecting similar but asynchronous epigenomic changes in different genomic segments.</p>
      <p>As input data to the model, the genome is represented as consecutive genomic segments, with a typical segment size of 200 nucleotides (nt) (for the impact of segment sizes, see Supplemental Fig. S5). Each segment is associated with the time-specific intensities of a set of epigenetic modifications. The model clusters the genomic segments, such that each cluster shares a similar combination of epigenetic modifications as well as their temporal changes. We call the combination of epigenetic modifications shared by a cluster of genomic segments at a given time an <italic>epigenomic state</italic>. Each cluster represents a time-series of related epigenomic states. Essentially this model assigns epigenomic states based on time-series epigenomic data.</p>
      <p>We call this model genomic annotation using temporal epigenomic data (GATE). GATE is a hierarchical model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">Pearl 1985</xref>) with two layers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>). The top layer is a finite mixture model (FMM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">Equihua 1988</xref>), in which each <italic>component</italic> of the mixture represents a cluster of genomic segments that share temporal epigenomic patterns. Without considering the time factor, each component (cluster) degenerates into a set of genomic segments sharing an epigenomic state. The bottom layer models the epigenomic data in each cluster. Each cluster is modeled as a hidden Markov model (HMM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">Durbin et al. 1998</xref>) that represents the temporal changes of epigenetic modification intensities. The hidden states are binary activity states (inactive and active), which are allowed to change with respect to time. For example, if an enhancer changes from an active enhancer into an inactive enhancer during differentiation, the hidden states for this enhancer would change from 0 (inactive) to 1 (active). In a differentiation process, state 0 can be interpreted as the initial state before differentiation (undifferentiated [U]), whereas state 1 can be regarded as the other state in differentiated cells (differentiated [D]). The observed data are the epigenetic modification intensities for each genomic segment at every time point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>). The sequencing reads from chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq) experiments for each epigenetic modification on a genomic segment are modeled with a Poisson distribution, with the Poisson parameter reflecting the cluster and time-dependent epigenomic state. Thus, GATE has been completely specified as a generative probabilistic model (see Methods). In short, GATE is a finite mixture of HMMs. Distinguishing itself from a previous method that predicts chromatin states based on static epigenetic data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">Ernst and Kellis 2010</xref>), GATE models epigenomic data as a dynamic continuum and directly utilizes temporal information to annotate epigenomic states. This feature facilitates the discovery of <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory sequences and the annotation of their regulatory functions (Supplemental Fig. S6).</p>
      <p>We implemented an expectation–maximization (EM) method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">Dempster et al. 1977</xref>) to estimate model parameters from data (Supplemental Fig. S1; Supplemental Methods). At every maximization step, we embedded a Baum-Welch algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">Durbin et al. 1998</xref>) to estimate the HMM parameters. We provide GATE as a fully documented program at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://biocomp.bioen.uiuc.edu/GATE">http://biocomp.bioen.uiuc.edu/GATE</ext-link>. GATE was tested with simulated cell differentiation processes (Supplemental Data 1; Supplemental Tables S2–S4).</p>

      <title>Epigenomic landscape during the differentiation of ES cells to mesendoderm</title>
      <p>Mesendoderm is the diverging point of definitive endoderm and mesoderm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">Yasunaga et al. 2005</xref>), which represents an important cell lineage besides the neural lineage (ectoderm) during the early stages of ES cell differentiation. We differentiated mouse ES cells to mesendoderm using Activin and a previously described culture medium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">Yasunaga et al. 2005</xref>). On the sixth day of differentiation, almost all cells exhibited typical mesendoderm morphology and expressed mesendoderm protein Goosecoid (GSC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">Blum et al. 1992</xref>) and endoderm protein SOX17 (Supplemental Fig. S2A; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">Kanai-Azuma et al. 2002</xref>). Pluripotency genes <italic>Pou5f1</italic>(also known as <italic>Oct4</italic>), <italic>Sox2</italic>, and <italic>Nanog</italic> were down-regulated, whereas endoderm and mesoderm genes <italic>Gsc</italic>, <italic>Chordin</italic>, <italic>Foxa2</italic>, <italic>Sox17</italic>, <italic>Lim1</italic>, and <italic>Hnf4</italic> were up-regulated (Supplemental Fig. S2B).</p>
      <p>We measured a total of nine epigenomic marks at three time points (day 0, 4, and 6) during the differentiation process. These marks included seven histone modifications or variants (H3K4me1/2/3, H3K27ac, H3K27me3, H3K36me3, and H2A.Z), which were assayed by ChIP-seq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">Xiao et al. 2012</xref>). We supplemented the histone data with two types of DNA modifications, including 5-hmC by chemical labeling and pull-down followed by sequencing (5-hmC-seq) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">Song et al. 2011</xref>) and 5-mC by both methylated DNA immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (MeDIP-seq) and DNA digestion by methyl-sensitive restriction enzymes followed by sequencing (MRE-seq) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">Maunakea et al. 2010</xref>). The 5-hmC pull-down specifically used the chemical property of the hydroxyl-group and thus was efficient to distinguish 5-hmC from 5-mC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">Song et al. 2011</xref>). MeDIP-seq was representative of 5-mC, and MRE-seq was representative of unmethylated CpGs (<sup>u</sup>CpGs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">Maunakea et al. 2010</xref>).</p>
      <p>To analyze the transcriptome, we sequenced ncRNAs using the Illumina Small RNA Sample Preparation procedure followed by sequencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">Illumina 2010b</xref>) and mRNAs using RNA-seq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">Mortazavi et al. 2008</xref>) at the same three time points. Taken together, 36 sequencing data sets composed of 1.94 billion 75-nt or 100-nt uniquely alignable sequencing reads were generated.</p>
      <p>These data allowed us to estimate that 11.5% of the mouse genome is associated with at least one type of epigenetic modification in undifferentiated ES cells. Nearly half of these regions (5.60% of the genome) exhibited significant changes in at least one epigenetic modification during differentiation. About 1.92% of the genome was transcribed into mRNAs in ES cells, and 0.43% of the genome exhibited change of mRNA expression levels during differentiation.</p>

      <title>Spatiotemporal clustering of epigenomic states</title>
      <p>GATE clusters genomic segments based on both <italic>spatial</italic> distributions of epigenomic modifications and <italic>temporal</italic> changes of these modifications. Applying GATE to the “ES cell to mesendoderm” differentiation data set, we initially obtained 55 clusters, consistent with the previously estimated number of chromatin states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">Ernst and Kellis 2010</xref>). These clusters formed 14 larger groups (Supplemental Fig. S3). Twelve of the 14 groups showed epigenomic characteristics that are typical to gene bodies, promoters, and enhancers. For example, groups 2, 3, 6, and 9 shared enhancer characteristics, including low H3K36me3, high H3K4me1 in either undifferentiated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>, U) or differentiated states (D), and either high H3K27me3 or high H3K27ac (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>, vertical green bar). Groups 1b, 5, 8, and 12 shared promoter characteristics, including high H3K4me3 and low H3K36me3 (red bar). Groups 1a, 4, 10, and 11 shared high levels of H3K36me3, which was associated with gene bodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>, blue bar; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">Kolasinska-Zwierz et al. 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">Schwartz et al. 2009</xref>).</p>

      <p>By assigning clusters as promoter, enhancer, gene body, and repeat clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>, red, green, blue, and gray bars), we turned the unsupervised spatiotemporal epigenomic clusters into predictions of different genomic features. To check these predictions, we compared the locations of the genomic segments in every cluster to their nearest genes. Indeed, the relative locations of genomic segments in each cluster corroborated the unsupervised predictions (Supplemental Fig. S4). Chromosome 11 was randomly chosen for quantifying the prediction accuracies. The sensitivities for detecting promoters increased from 0% to 60% when the false-positive rate (1 − specificity) increased from 0% to 0.25% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>). Similar tradeoffs between sensitivity and specificity were found for gene body predictions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref>). These quantities reinforced the visual impression (Supplemental Fig. S4) that spatiotemporal clusters correlate with different genomic features. Changing the input size of genomic segments from 200 nt to 100 nt did not change any qualitative characteristics of the clustering results (Supplemental Fig. S5).</p>

      <title>Spatiotemporal epigenomic clusters are predictive of transposons, bidirectional promoters, microRNA promoters, and PIWI RNAs</title>
      <p>Not only did the spatiotemporal epigenomic clusters predict usual genomic features such as enhancers, promoters, and gene bodies, unexpectedly these clusters were also capable of predicting genomic features, including repeats, bidirectional promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">Lin et al. 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">Hakkinen et al. 2011</xref>), microRNA (miRNA) promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">Marson et al. 2008</xref>), and PIWI RNAs (piRNAs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">Thomson and Lin 2009</xref>).</p>
      <p>Two groups (groups 13 and 14) exhibited unfamiliar epigenomic characteristics, including high H3K36me3 in parallel with high H3K27me3. These clusters did not locate in gene bodies or promoters (Supplemental Fig. S4). They contained the highest proportions of repeats among all 55 clusters (<italic>P</italic> = 5.45 × 10<sup>−37</sup>, Fisher's exact test) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>, “repeats” column). ncRNA expression showed that groups 13 and 14 corresponded to transcribed and silenced repeat sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>, ncRNA). These data suggest a distinct spatiotemporal epigenomic signature for repeats and transposons.</p>
      <p>Bidirectional promoters were strongly enriched in group 8 (clusters 19, 12, 48; <italic>P</italic> = 3.9 × 10<sup>−290</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>). A simple but powerful classifier for identifying bidirectional promoters can be built based on the clusters. Based on whether a genomic segment belongs to cluster 19, one can reach 80% sensitivity with a specificity of 99.6% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D</xref>). Besides bidirectional promoters, miRNA promoters were also enriched in specific clusters, including cluster 28 (<italic>P</italic> = 6.96 × 10<sup>−28</sup>, Fisher's exact test) and cluster 52 (<italic>P</italic> = 1.51 × 10<sup>−11</sup>, Fisher's exact test) (Supplemental Fig. S7A). Thus, through unsupervised clustering, GATE revealed distinct spatiotemporal epigenomic patterns in several specific types of promoters.</p>
      <p>PiRNAs and PIWI proteins were discovered in germ cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">Thomson and Lin 2009</xref>) and were thought to be silenced in ES cells. Unexpectedly, piRNAs were specifically enriched in cluster 11 (<italic>P</italic> = 3.08 × 10<sup>−16</sup>, Fisher's exact test) and cluster 28 (<italic>P</italic> = 2.05 × 10<sup>−6</sup>, Fisher's exact test) (Supplemental Fig. S7B). As a control, in cluster 11 where piRNA was strongly enriched (9.53-fold more enriched than expected), miRNAs were depleted (0.89-fold less than expected). Thus piRNAs and miRNAs had different temporal epigenomic characteristics. These data suggest that even though piRNAs were produced and functional in germ cells, specific epigenomic patterns were formed on piRNA genes much earlier than germ cell development. PiRNA genes may be epigenetically prepared for activation in ES cells.</p>
      <p>The distinct epigenomic characteristics in ES cells opened the possibility that a subset of piRNAs is produced in ES cells. Indeed, a cluster of piRNA genes (piRNA cluster) on chromosome 5 was clearly expressed (Supplemental Fig. S7C). Moreover, the expression of this piRNA cluster was specifically induced in undifferentiated ES cells (Supplemental Fig. S7C, days 0, 4, 6). As a control, Sgsm1, the neighboring gene to this piRNA cluster, showed a slight increase in expression during differentiation (Supplemental Fig. S7C). Even more strikingly, <italic>Piwil2</italic> (also known as <italic>Mili</italic>), a mouse ortholog of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> PIWI gene, is expressed in ES cells, and its expression decreased below a detectable level 4 d after differentiation (Supplemental Fig. S7D). The consistent inductions of piRNAs and the <italic>Piwil2</italic> gene in undifferentiated ES cells further entertained the hypothesis that some piRNAs were produced not only in germ cells.</p>

      <title>Combinatorial temporal changes of epigenomic modifications</title>
      <p>There were large differences among the nine epigenomic modifications regarding their temporal changes. The most stable modification was H3K36me3, which showed little change in all groups. The other eight modifications showed cluster-specific temporal changes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>).</p>
      <p>Gene body groups showed three types of combinatorial changes. The first type was represented by coordinated decreases of H3K27ac, H3K4me1/2, H2A.Z, and 5-hmC and an increase in CpG methylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>, red circles in group 4). These coordinated epigenomic changes did not clearly influence mRNA expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>, mRNA) but were associated with strong up-regulation of ncRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>, ncRNA). The second combination was decreases of H3K27ac and H3K4me2/3 (red circles, group 11), which were associated with down-regulation of both mRNAs and ncRNAs (orange circles). The third combination was coordinated increases of H3K4me1/2 and 5-hmC, which corresponded to up-regulation of ncRNAs (groups 1a and 10).</p>
      <p>All promoter groups shared increases of H3K4me1/2, H2A.Z, 5-hmC, and 5-mC together with a decrease in CpG methylation. Interestingly, this recurrent combinatorial pattern itself was not sufficient to induce gene expression changes. However, when this pattern was further combined with a decrease in H3K4me3, it was associated with down-regulation of ncRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>, group 1b).</p>
      <p>Enhancer groups showed four types of combinatorial changes. The first type was an increase in CpG methylation, which correlated with down-regulation of ncRNAs (red and orange circles, group 6). The second combination was an increase in H3K27ac and decreases in H3K27me3 and 5-mC, which correlated with up-regulation of mRNAs and ncRNAs. The third type was coordinated decreases of H3K27ac, H3K4me1/2, H2A.Z, and 5-hmC together with an increase in 5-mC, which correlated with down-regulation of mRNAs and ncRNAs (group 9). The last type was coordinated decreases of H3K27ac and H3K4me3 together with a 5-mC increase, which correlated with down-regulation of mRNAs and ncRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>, group 7).</p>
      <p>Both transcribed and silenced repeats showed coordinated decreases in H3K27me3, 5-hmC, and 5-mC (especially non-CpG methylation [<sup>m</sup>CpH]), which correlated with up-regulation of transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>, ncRNA).</p>

      <title>Recurrent themes of epigenomic and transcriptome changes</title>
      <p>Recurrent themes appeared in the majority of the spatiotemporal clusters. These recurring patterns may represent basic properties of temporal gene regulation by the epigenome.</p>
      <p>First, combinatorial epigenomic changes are prevalent. In every case except one, we observed combinatorial changes of three to seven epigenomic modifications. Furthermore, different genomic features (promoters, enhancers, genes, and repeats) have different combinations of temporal changes.</p>
      <p>Second, combinatorial patterns of epigenomic changes are predictive of gene expression changes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>, temporal axis). While gene expression data were not used in clustering epigenomic data, the epigenomic clusters clearly distinguish gene groups with different temporal expression changes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>).</p>
      <p>Third, almost all combinatorial epigenomic changes correspond with changes in ncRNA expression levels. The direction of ncRNA expression changes was not associated with the changes in any single epigenomic modification but was strongly predictable by combinatorial changes (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>).</p>
      <p>Fourth, epigenomic changes in enhancers instead of promoters are indicative of mRNA expression changes. This reconciles previous observations that temporal epigenomic changes were poorly correlated with gene expression changes during cell differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">Wu et al. 2011b</xref>) by reproducing such results in promoter regions with more epigenomic modifications; but also it points out the importance of epigenomic changes in enhancers. Consistently, human ChIP-chip analysis showed enhancer associated modifications, including H3K27ac and H3K4me1, had greater dynamic changes than other modifications during ES cell differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">Hawkins et al. 2011</xref>).</p>
      <p>Fifth, all assayed modifications except H3K36me3 have robust temporal changes in multiple genomic features (promoters, enhancers, gene bodies, and repeats). The robust and recurrent temporal changes appeared not only in genomic regions where the epigenomic modifications were abundant, but also in genomic regions where the modification levels were low. Previously, H3K4me1 was associated with enhancers and H3K4me3 and H2A.Z were associated with promoters due to their abundance in these regions. However, H3K4me1 showed reliable changes not only in enhancers, but also in promoters and gene bodies where its modification level was low. Similarly, H3K4me3 (group 7) and H2A.Z (group 9) showed reliable changes in enhancers. These data may suggest regulatory functions of epigenomic modifications in previously ignored genomic regions.</p>

      <title>Temporal changes of H3K4me2, <sup>m</sup>CpH, and H2A.Z are predictive of DNA hydroxymethylation</title>
      <p>It remains unknown what guides TET enzymes to specific parts of the genome to convert 5-mC to 5-hmC. To explore the upstream signals that might specify where in the genome 5-mC should be converted to 5-hmC, we asked if there were any epigenomic modifications that correlate with 5-hmC in terms of temporal changes. Across all 55 epigenomic clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>), the temporal changes of 5-hmC were on average most correlated with H3K4me2, <sup>u</sup>CpG (measured by MRE-seq), H3K4me1, and H2A.Z (Supplemental Fig. S8). Next, we checked the temporal correlations between 5-hmC and every other assayed epigenomic mark on every genomic segment (200-nt window). On 78.1% of the genomic segments, the temporal correlations between 5-hmC and H3K4me2 were larger than 0.8 (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 10<sup>−300</sup>) (Supplemental Fig. S9B). Strong temporal correlations between 5-hmC and <sup>u</sup>CpG, 5-hmC and H4K4me1, and 5-hmC and H2A.Z were also observed (Supplemental Fig. S9E,9F). In contrast, H3K4me3 and H3K36me3 did not show large temporal correlations with 5-hmC. By categorizing genomic segments by their clusters, promoter segments showed the strongest temporal correlations between 5-hmC and H3K4me2, <sup>u</sup>CpG, and H2A.Z (Supplemental Fig. S9). These data indicate strong associations between the di- and monomethylation of H3K4 and hydroxylmethylation of nearby cytosines. The exchange of histone variants H2A and H2A.Z may also associate with 5-hmC synthesis.</p>
      <p>The temporal changes of <sup>u</sup>CpG and 5-hmC were strongly correlated (Supplemental Fig. S9K). Two scenarios can fit these data. First, the <sup>u</sup>CpG was generated by a cytosine demethylation preprocess that involves the conversion of 5-mC to 5-hmC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">Bhutani et al. 2011</xref>). In other words, the <italic>same</italic> cytosine is converted from 5-mC into 5-hmC and then into C (same cytosine hypothesis). Alternatively, <sup>u</sup>CpG signals TET enzymes to the genomic neighborhood to convert neighboring 5-mC into 5-hmC (neighbor hypothesis). If the same cytosine hypothesis is true, we would predict that 5-mC and 5-hmC are anti-correlated during ES cell differentiation. However, temporal changes of 5-mC did not anti-correlate with 5-hmC changes (Supplemental Fig. S9M). More genome segments had the same direction of 5-mC changes and 5-hmC changes than expected at random (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 10<sup>−200</sup>) (Supplemental Fig. S9M, dashed line). These data are inconsistent with the same cytosine hypothesis. Conversely, TET1 contains a Znf_CXXC domain that interacts with <sup>u</sup>CpG, which is in line with the neighbor hypothesis.</p>
      <p>We then explored the roles of <sup>m</sup>CpH. <sup>m</sup>CpH was reported in oocytes without known functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">Tomizawa et al. 2011</xref>). These <sup>m</sup>CpHs were presumably due to high levels of de novo methylation enzymes Dnmt3a/b in oocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">Lees-Murdock et al. 2005</xref>). The simultaneous increase of 5-mC and decrease of CpG methylation in the same promoters (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>; Supplemental Fig. S4) suggest de novo <sup>m</sup>CpH. This is consistent with the increased expression levels of DMNT3b during guided differentiation of ES cells toward mesendoderm cells (Supplemental Fig. S9N). Temporal changes of <sup>m</sup>CpH were strongly correlated with 5-hmC changes (Supplemental Fig. S9D), suggesting the genomic segments undergoing <sup>m</sup>CpH were also experiencing hydroxymethylation. Complementary to these data, 5-hmC level was most enriched in low CpG regions in ES cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">Yu et al. 2012</xref>). In summary, temporal changes of H3K4me1/2, <sup>m</sup>CpH, and H2A.Z are predictive of 5-hmC changes throughout the mouse genome. These temporal correlations do not provide any causal information, but they may help to prioritize some hypotheses for future biochemical analyses of 5-hmC pathways.</p>

      <title>H2A.Z is predictive of gene expression in a context-specific manner</title>
      <p>Epigenomic marks were thought to be predictive of gene expression levels in a context-independent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">Karlic et al. 2010</xref>). The main support for this idea was that the linear model using epigenomic marks to predict expression can be learned from CD4+ T cells and then applied to other types of T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">Karlic et al. 2010</xref>). To see if this theory holds during ES cell differentiation, we correlated the model-learned epigenomic modification levels to gene expression levels (Supplemental Fig. S10). Consistent with previous thoughts, some epigenomic marks were correlated with gene expression in a context-independent manner, in the sense that these correlations persist in different genomic locations (enhancers, promoters, etc.) and in different differentiation states. Such context-independent epigenomic marks included H3K36me3, H3K27ac, and 5-mC. However, several epigenomic marks showed context-specific influence on mRNA expression. Promoter H3K4me3 was correlated with mRNA expression, but enhancer H3K4me3 was not (Supplemental Fig. S10). Promoter H2A.Z was not correlated with mRNA expression in undifferentiated ES cells (Pearson correlation &lt; 0), but promoter H2A.Z was strongly correlated with mRNA expression after differentiation (Pearson correlation = 0.83) (Supplemental Fig. S10, panel H2A.Z). Thus, epigenomic marks, although associated with gene expression, can have different directions of association in different cellular contexts.</p>

      <title>A unified model for 5-hmC's effects on gene expression</title>
      <p>The effects of 5-hmC on gene expression remain unclear. The difficulty of clarifying 5-hmC's effects lies, at least in part, in the seemingly conflicting data. On the one hand, promoter 5-hmC levels were anti-correlated with gene expression levels in both undifferentiated and differentiated ES cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A,B</xref>; Supplemental Fig. S10, panel 5-hmC). This may suggest 5-hmC as a repressive mark. On the other hand, enhancer 5-hmC had a weak positive correlation with gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C,D</xref>; Supplemental Fig. S10, panel 5-hmC), which may indicate an activation role. Is there a simple model that can accommodate all these data and illustrate 5-hmC's effects on gene expression? We identified a model by looking at temporal changes of 5-hmC.</p>

      <p>5-hmC were concentrated on gene bodies in ES cells and were shifted to promoters after differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figs. 4B</xref>; Supplemental Fig. S11). These data are consistent with the recent discovery of lower 5-hmC in promoters than in intragenic regions in ES cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">Booth et al. 2012</xref>). However, the large increase of promoter 5-hmC and the decrease of intragenic 5-hmC during ES cell differentiation were not reported before. Enhancer concentration of 5-hmC was increased during differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4D</xref>). The enrichment of 5-hmC in enhancers and promoters in differentiated cells provides further support to the hypothesized regulatory role of 5-hmC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">Ficz et al. 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">Pastor et al. 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">Stroud et al. 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">Wu et al. 2011a</xref>).</p>
      <p>5-hmC showed either a substantial increase or a moderate increase but showed no decrease in any enhancer clusters or promoter clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B, D</xref>). In both promoters and enhancers, a substantial increase of 5-hmC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>, promoter groups 5 and 12, C, enhancer groups 2, 3, 6) inevitably resulted in induction of gene expression. When 5-hmC did not substantially increase, nearby genes would show decreasing expression. This was consistent with both promoters (group 8) and enhancers (group 9). Similar analyses on MeDIP-seq and MRE-seq data suggest that 5-mC did not confound the observed effect of 5-hmC on gene expression (Supplemental Fig. S12). Thus, a simple model can explain the relationships between 5-hmC and gene expression during ES cell differentiation. If 5-hmC increases above a critical value, gene expression increases; otherwise, gene expression decreases. This model states an association between 5-hmC and gene expression changes, and it does not rule out additional epigenomic marks as confounding factors.</p>

      <title>Epigenomic states correlate with transcription networks</title>
      <p>The GATE model infers epigenomic states of every genomic segment as undifferentiated (U) or differentiated (D), indicating when a genomic segment may change its regulatory functions. Thus, the GATE model provides a genome-wide view of the locations of regulatory sequences as well as their time of activation. Such information may help to clarify the transcription network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">Hawkins et al. 2011</xref>). To explore this potential, we did a case study for three mesendoderm genes: <italic>Fgf8</italic>, <italic>Sox17</italic>, and <italic>Foxa2</italic>. A set of group 3 enhancers were found in the introns and 3′ intergenic regions of <italic>Fgf8</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref>, yellow boxes). These enhancers were predicted to shift from inactive to active epigenomic states (U→D). Transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) of GSC and IRF-1 appeared in these enhancers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5B,C</xref>). Both GSC and IRF-1 are key regulators of mesendoderm differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">Blum et al. 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">Bruce et al. 2007</xref>). An isolated enhancer was identified ∼50,000 nt upstream of the <italic>Sox17</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5D</xref>; Supplemental Fig. S12). Another enhancer was found ∼7000 nt upstream of the <italic>Foxa2</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5E</xref>). By use of epigenomic data, GATE suggested that both the <italic>Sox17</italic> enhancer and the <italic>Foxa2</italic> enhancers shifted from inactive to active states (Supplemental Fig. S13), which was in line with the increased expression of these genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5D,E</xref>, FPKM). A strong FOXA2 TFBS appeared in the <italic>Sox17</italic> enhancer, and a strong SOX17 TFBS appeared in a <italic>Foxa2</italic> enhancer. These data suggest a positive feedback loop between <italic>Sox17</italic> and <italic>Foxa2</italic>. Coincidently, a peak in a FOXA2 ChIP-seq experiment in mouse liver (GEO accession no.

This is the strongest peak (<italic>P</italic>-value &lt; 10<sup>−6</sup>) in the 70,000-nt sequence neighborhood of the <italic>Sox17</italic> gene.

    <title>Discussion</title>
    <p>Previous computational methods for analyzing epigenomes relied primarily on spatial information of epigenomic marks. For example, an HMM model was developed to annotate genomic sequences by colocalization of multiple epigenomic marks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">Ernst and Kellis 2010</xref>). GATE connects with the Ernst-Kellis model in that with only one time point, GATE degenerates into a zero-order HMM. Unlike the Ernst-Kellis model, though, GATE did not rely on prior information about the arrangements of genomic features. The unsupervised nature of GATE makes it capable of predicting the genomic features that were not included in a training process. In the ES cell differentiation process, GATE predicted bidirectional promoters, miRNA promoters, and piRNA genes with high accuracies.</p>
    <p>Temporal information is as important as spatial information in studying epigenomic functions. A case in point is that although TET was known to interact with the trithorax homolog MLL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">Tahiliani et al. 2009</xref>), the MLL targets H3K4me1/2 were not pursued as a major clue for guiding TETs to specific genomic regions. This was probably due to the lack of a very strong spatial correlation between H3K4me1/2 and 5-hmC in any studied cell types. Indeed, 5-hmC was enriched not only in enhancers where H3K4me1/2 levels were high, but also in promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">Yu et al. 2012</xref>), CTCF binding sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">Yu et al. 2012</xref>), and gene bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">Booth et al. 2012</xref>) where H3K4me1/2 levels were not necessarily high. However, temporal correlations between H3K4me1/2 and 5-hmC were particularly strong, in that &gt;85% of the genomic sequences had the same direction of changes of H3K4me2 and 5-hmC (Supplemental Fig. S9B,E). This result prioritizes H3K4me1/2 and H3K4 methyltransferases as a candidate upstream signal for guiding TETs to specific parts of the genome.</p>
    <p>People questioned <sup>u</sup>CpG's capability to attract TET1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">Frauer et al. 2011</xref>), despite TET1 containing a zinc finger CXXC domain that can bind <sup>u</sup>CpG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">Tahiliani et al. 2009</xref>). Indeed, no genome-wide mapping has showed strong overlaps of 5-hmC and <sup>u</sup>CpG. Furthermore, the information content of CpG is small, making it hard to believe that such a weak sequence signal can confer specificity to guide TET1. In this study, we reported striking temporal correlations of 5-hmC and <sup>u</sup>CpG throughout the genome, highlighting the necessity of analyzing epigenome dynamics and providing genome-wide data to support the role of <sup>u</sup>CpG in guiding TET1. TET1's interacting partner MLL contains a zinc finger CXXC domain as well. Theoretically, the MLL–TET1–<sup>u</sup>CpGs three way interaction can be a lot more stable than a two-way interaction of a protein and its DNA recognition site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">He et al. 2009</xref>). This MLL–TET1–<sup>u</sup>CpGs interaction is reinforced by MLL's roles to methylate H3K4 and interact with methylated H3K4. These analyses provide a model that <sup>u</sup>CpGs guide TET1 to specific genomic locations by initiating self-reinforcing <sup>u</sup>CpGs–MLL–H3K4me1/2–TET1 interactions.</p>
    <p>It remains controversial whether 5-hmC predominantly exists in the CpG context. Stand bias analysis suggested presence of 5-hmC on CpH in ES cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">Ficz et al. 2011</xref>). However, this result was not supported by single-base resolution mapping of 5-hmC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">Yu et al. 2012</xref>). We observed positive temporal correlations of <sup>m</sup>CpH and 5-hmC in multiple genomic regions. Two scenarios fit this observation. First, 5-hmC existed on CpH; alternatively, the temporal changes of <sup>m</sup>CpH were associated with 5-hmC changes in nearby CpGs. In promoters, <sup>u</sup>CpG levels measured by MRE-seq often increased as 5-hmC levels increased, which suggests that at least a subset of the newly converted 5-hmC in promoters were on CpHs. These results suggest perhaps examining differentiated ES cells may resolve the controversy of the presence of 5-hmC on CpHs.</p>
    <p>Modeling and analyzing the temporal data facilitates the discovery of context-specific functions of epigenomic marks. In yeast, H2A.Z was associated with both active and inactive genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">Raisner et al. 2005</xref>). In this study, H2A.Z was clearly associated with active genes in mesendoderm cells but not in undifferentiated ES cells. This shows the importance of considering the cellular contexts when inferring the regulation functions of an epigenomic mark.</p>
    <p>Most of the epigenomic marks (all assayed except H3K36me3) showed robust temporal changes in multiple genomic features, including promoters, enhancers, gene bodies, and repeats. This recurring theme can have large implications for studying gene regulation. In the canonical view, certain modifications are indicative of certain genomic features; for example, H3K27ac and H3K4me1 are enhancer marks and H3K4me1 is a promoter mark. This canonical view was built on the observation that these modifications were a lot more abundant in certain genomic features than others. This view made it tempting to ignore the regulatory roles of modification in places where it is not abundant. However, the robust temporal changes of many modifications in their noncanonical (low-abundance) regions, such as H3K27ac in gene bodies, H3K4me1 in gene bodies and promoters, and H3K4me3 in gene bodies and enhancers, indicate that they can play regulatory roles in more genomic features than in the canonical view. Future experiments are needed to test this hypothesis. Consistent with this new view, the temporal epigenomic changes in low-abundance regions were sometimes correlated with mRNA or ncRNA expression changes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figs. 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>).</p>

    </fig>
    <p>Another dilemma in the epigenomic field is as follows. On the one hand, epigenomic changes are essential to organismal development, supported by the fact that different cell types exhibit clearly different epigenomic patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">Hawkins et al. 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">Ernst et al. 2011</xref>). Thus, the epigenome is expected to regulate gene expression during development and differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">Hawkins et al. 2011</xref>). However, on the other hand, temporal epigenomic changes during cell differentiation were reported to not correlate with gene expression changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">Wu et al. 2011b</xref>). Our method and data allow us to investigate this dilemma from a new perspective.</p>
    <p>From the methodological perspective, GATE provides two advantages. First, the unsupervised clustering summarizes the combinatorial changes of multiple epigenomic marks. Previously, one had to compare gene expression changes with every epigenomic mark one-by-one, resulting in inconclusive or even conflicting results. This was because the association between gene expression and an epigenomic mark may be confounded by other epigenomic marks. GATE enables us to correlate gene expression changes with the combinatorial changes of multiple epigenomic marks. Second, GATE makes unsynchronized changes in different parts of the genome comparable. This enables us to effectively pull information together from different genomic segments with similar but unsynchronized temporal changes.</p>
    <p>Consistent with the previous erythroid differentiation study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">Wu et al. 2011b</xref>), temporal epigenomic changes did not correlate with gene expression changes in several GATE clusters. These clusters were all in promoters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>, groups 5, 8, 12). However, temporal epigenomic changes in enhancer-associated clusters were clearly correlated with gene expression changes. In particular, changes in DNA methylation alone were associated with ncRNA expression change (group 6); changes that involve different combinations of DNA and histone modifications were associated with both mRNA and ncRNA changes in different directions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>, groups 3, 7, 9); and changes in modifications on repeats were predictive of repeat expression (groups 13, 14). Including nonuniquely mapped reads into the analysis may impact the results on repeat regions. These data suggest that the epigenome-mediated gene regulation during cell differentiation, although clear in enhancers, may not be discernible in promoters, thus helping to resolve the hitherto mentioned dilemma.</p>

      <title>The model</title>
      <p>The GATE model is a hierarchical model with two layers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>). The top layer is a FMM, in which each <italic>component</italic> of the mixture represents a cluster of genomic segments that share temporal epigenomic patterns. The bottom layer models the time-course epigenomic data in each cluster. Each cluster is modeled as a HMM with the hidden states representing the changes of regulatory activities during a differentiation process, which emit the observed epigenomic data at each time point. Overall, GATE is a finite mixture of HMMs.</p>
