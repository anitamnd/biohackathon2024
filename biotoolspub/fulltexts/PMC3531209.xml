      <p>Bookshelf (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/</ext-link>) is a full-text electronic literature
resource of books and documents in life sciences and health care at the National Center
for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). Created in 1999 with a single book as an
encyclopedic reference for resources such as PubMed and GenBank, it has grown to its
current size of &gt;1300 titles. Unlike other NCBI databases, such as GenBank and Gene,
which have a strict data structure, books come in all forms; they are diverse in
publication types, formats, sizes and authoring models. The Bookshelf data format is XML
tagged in the NCBI Book DTD (Document Type Definition), modeled after the National Library
of Medicine journal article DTDs. The book DTD has been used for systematically tagging
the diverse data formats of books, a move that has set the foundation for the growth of
this resource. Books at NCBI followed the route of journal articles in the PubMed Central
project, using the PubMed Central architectural framework, workflows and processes.
Through integration with other NCBI molecular databases, books at NCBI can be used to
provide reference information for biological data and facilitate its discovery. This
article describes Bookshelf at NCBI: its growth, data handling and retrieval and
integration with molecular databases.</p>

    <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
    <p>Bookshelf (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/</ext-link>) is an online service providing free access
to the full text of books and documents in life sciences and health care, built and
maintained by the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) within the National
Library of Medicine (NLM). Bookshelf complements the other biomedical literature resources
at NCBI: PubMed, the database of citations and abstracts, PubMed Central (PMC), which
provides free access to the full text of journal articles and author manuscripts in
biomedicine, and the NLM Catalog, which holds catalog information for books and journals as
well as other materials such as audiovisuals. This article discusses the Bookshelf
literature resource at NCBI, including factors that have contributed to its growth, how the
data are structured, processed, stored and retrieved and its significance in the context of
molecular information.</p>
    <p>The core objectives for Bookshelf are (i) to further advance science and improve health
care through the collection, exchange and dissemination of books and related documents in
life sciences and health care; (ii) to provide a permanent stable archive for the collection
and (iii) to provide free access to full text of this content. As a full-text literature hub
in a network of genomic and molecular genetics resources at NCBI, Bookshelf has an
additional goal to enable literature annotations for factual information found in the
genomic and molecular databases at NCBI and to facilitate the discoverability of this
information.</p>
    <p>Bookshelf titles are of varied publication types, topics and authoring models, and include
public domain works as well as works the copyright holders of which have granted NCBI
permission for distribution. Bookshelf includes textbooks, monographs, health reports,
documentation, website content and databases. Content spans the range of basic biology to
advanced molecular biology, health care evidence reports and clinical guidelines to health
care policy analysis and reports from high-throughput screening of small molecules for
identification of disease-combating drugs to guidance for drug development. Content is
selected for the collection based on the scope of the subject matter as defined by
NLM’s Collection Development Manual (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/tsd/acquisitions/cdm/">http://www.nlm.nih.gov/tsd/acquisitions/cdm/</ext-link>), as well as on scientific and
editorial quality criteria and the technical quality of the submitted files.</p>
    <p>Bookshelf serves as an educational resource. It is a knowledgebase of information for
undergraduate and graduate students, scientists, health care professionals, patients and
users seeking biomedical information. The free availability of Bookshelf content enables
global access to this knowledgebase by users who might otherwise not have access to this
data. The content is made freely available to readers by authors, editors and publishers who
agree to participate in the project. The collection also includes reports and documents from
US and international government agencies as well as organizations in the health sector.
Publishers and content providers also benefit by wide distribution of their content to the
general public, health care professionals and a population of students who will become the
next generation of biomedical researchers, clinicians and teachers. Where participatory
agreements permit, content from the collection is made available in the Open Access Subset
(<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/about/openaccess/">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/about/openaccess/</ext-link>), in which XML, image and
supplementary files are shared, allowing for redistribution and reuse of the content.
Information for authors and publishers on selection criteria and the application process can
be found at: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/about/publishers/">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/about/publishers/</ext-link></p>

    <title>GROWTH OF BOOKSHELF</title>
    <p>Bookshelf started in 1999 with the third edition of Molecular Biology of the Cell, Alberts
<italic>et al.</italic> (<xref rid="gks1279-B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Since then,
Bookshelf has grown to its current count of 1373 titles as of August 2012 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gks1279-F1">Figure 1</xref>). The Bookshelf collection is relatively
small compared with PubMed and PMC as determined either by the number of accession
identifiers (IDs; accessible units of content) or by the absolute size for the different
data types (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="gks1279-T1">Table 1</xref>). To organize the
diversity of publication types in Bookshelf, each title is assigned a Bookshelf resource
type and one or more subjects. The list of resource types is shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="gks1279-T2">Table 2</xref>. <fig id="gks1279-F1" position="float"><label>Figure
1.</label><caption><p>Growth of Bookshelf. The term ‘title’ represents a
book in the database. The spike in the book title count in 2010 was due to data
restructuring of the Health Services/Technology Assessment Texts (HSTAT; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK16710/">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK16710/</ext-link>) database content.

    <p>Three developments in Bookshelf have had a major impact on growth of the collection: (i)
the development of the NCBI Book DTD (Document Type Definition) based on the DTDs of the
Journal Article Tag Suite (JATS) and migration of XML data to this DTD (see
‘Data’, ‘Format and structure’ section), (ii) rendering books
searchable in PubMed and (iii) the redesign of Bookshelf and integration into the NCBI
portal application, which facilitates sharing of data across resources at NCBI (<xref rid="gks1279-B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="gks1279-B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>).</p>
  </sec>
  <sec>
    <title>DATA</title>
    <sec>
      <title>Format and structure</title>
      <p>The DTDs of the JATS were initially developed for tagging journal articles in the PMC
project. JATS DTDs aim to capture the semantics of the content independent of the form in
which it is delivered. Widely used in PMC and worldwide to tag journal articles, they are
now a National Information Standards Organization (NISO) standard, NISO z39.96-2012
[(<xref rid="gks1279-B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>) ANSI/NISO Z39.96-2012 JATS: Journal
Article Tag Suite: Project Overview. Available at: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.niso.org/apps/group_public/project/details.php?project_id=93">http://www.niso.org/apps/group_public/project/details.php?project_id=93</ext-link>.
Accessed 10 September 2012). Books and journal articles share many common features:
metadata such as title, contributors, publisher information and publication dates, textual
content with special characters and emphasis, images, tables, equations and reference
lists. Early in the project, Bookshelf used a DTD based on the ISO 12083 (International
Organization for Standardization) article DTD for tagging data. The tag set had to be
continually modified as the project expanded, adding challenges to data management and
rendering. To overcome these problems, the NCBI Book DTD (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dtd.nlm.nih.gov/book/">http://dtd.nlm.nih.gov/book/</ext-link>) was
developed specifically for the Bookshelf project for tagging book content, and Bookshelf
data was migrated into this DTD. It is modeled along the same design principles as the
JATS DTDs, and uses many of same modules. Bookshelf XML data are currently tagged in the
NCBI Book DTD, v2.3. The similarities between books and journal articles, and between
their shared tag sets, have permitted Bookshelf to leverage the robust PMC architectural
framework as well as existing PMC workflows and tools for handling the data. The NCBI Book
DTD in the context of JATS has been discussed in detail (<xref rid="gks1279-B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>).</p>
    </sec>
    <sec>
      <title>Submission, XML conversion and storage</title>
      <p>Tagging content semantically in XML is one of the most complex and costly operations for
Bookshelf. To enable continued maintenance of the corpus of book data, and continued
growth of Bookshelf, it has been necessary to balance the needs of the publisher with the
resources of the Bookshelf by streamlining the number of submission formats. To this end,
Bookshelf recently moved toward a requirement for data submission in semantically tagged
XML, which permits partial or complete automation of data processing. XML data are
submitted either in the NCBI Book DTD or in an alternate DTD (e.g. DocBook). When
submission uses an alternate DTD, Bookshelf uses XSLT converters to transform the XML to
the NCBI Book DTD format. For submission of data in NCBI Book DTD XML, tagging guidelines
(<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/pmcdoc/tagging-guidelines/book/style.html">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/pmcdoc/tagging-guidelines/book/style.html</ext-link>)
have been developed and are based on similar tagging guidelines for JATS DTDs. These
guidelines are intended to guide proper tagging practice through tagged samples, to reduce
the variability in tagging data elements and facilitate data exchange. A subset of
Bookshelf projects that require frequent updates are authored in a specialized Microsoft
Word template, which uses styles to semantically tag the document elements, such as the
title and author list. The documents are converted to XML using the in-house NCBI Word
Converter tool, which uses the eXtyles product (Inera, Inc.) for reference processing.
Documents are updated in Microsoft Word and reprocessed using the Word Converter. Legacy
projects involving print publications are submitted in PDF format and are converted by
third-party vendors to NCBI Book DTD XML. FTP is the main portal for data submission.</p>
      <p>XML, image, PDF and supplementary files are stored in the Bookshelf content management
system (CMS), built in-house for Bookshelf. In the CMS, book data are checked for
validation against the DTD, conformance to an in-house style checker (which runs
additional checks beyond XML validation to ensure data quality) and to ensure that all
files associated with the book are available (see Quality Checks mentioned later in the
text). The CMS is a destination hub for NCBI Book DTD XML data that is received through a
number of workflows and the staging area for ingest and subsequent processing of book
data. All XML content stored in the CMS is in the form of a single XML document with the
root element &lt;book&gt;.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec>
      <title>Processing</title>
      <p>The main steps of data processing are (i) ingest, (ii) ‘chop-it-up’ process,
(iii) text and image processing and (iv) PDF build (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gks1279-F2">Figure 2</xref>). Ingest begins with downloading XML, image and
supplementary files from the CMS onto the file system and then bundling them to create a
tar file. Chop-it-up and text processing involve XSLT transformation on XML data, creating
XML output. During the chop-it-up process, the single independently validating NCBI Book
DTD XML document with root element &lt;book&gt; is chopped up into independently
validating XML documents with root element &lt;book-part&gt;; i.e. the book is divided
into stand-alone book units such as front-matter sections, chapters, appendices or
reference lists. Book metadata is carried into every book part, and cross-references to
book parts are resolved in a way that the files can validate. The creation of article-like
&lt;book-part&gt; XML files from the &lt;book&gt; XML has provided the basis for using the
PMC workflows and tools for Bookshelf data processing. Text processing and image
conversion occur in parallel. For text conversion, the software resolves named entities,
handles special or custom characters and custom math, validates XML and runs the style
checker. For image conversion, the software that runs on open-source ImageMagick
(ImageMagick Studio) determines image dimensions and properties such as size, type and
resolution, resizes images per Bookshelf specifications and creates for each image a
thumbnail, a web-resolution JPEG file and a high-resolution JPEG file (if the source files
were of high resolution). PDFs are created for book chapters if not provided by the
content provider and if their creation and display in Bookshelf is permitted. The PDF
build software uses the XML output of text conversion and creates a formatting object
file, gathers image heuristics and resizes images so they are compatible with print
layout. The Antenna House formatter (Antenna House, Inc.) creates the PDF from the
formatting object file. <fig id="gks1279-F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>Data
processing workflow. XML stored in the Bookshelf CMS goes through several stages of
data processing before loading into the book database. Ingest, the first stage of
data conversion results in the creation of a tar file package, containing XML, PDF,
image and supplementary files. During the ‘chop-it-up’ process, the
single book XML document with root element &lt;book&gt; is chunked into multiple
article-like book-part XML documents with root element &lt;book-part&gt;. Text and
image conversion processing occurs concurrently. XML files loaded into the book
database are dynamically rendered to HTML for viewing in the book viewer application
and are indexed in Entrez for search and retrieval.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gks1279f2p"/></fig></p>
    </sec>
    <sec>
      <title>Loading to the database</title>
      <p>The loading software identifies the XML files for addition or replacement and loads them
to the database. It validates the data, performs checks for file types and associated
files and resolves loading of files associated with each XML file, such as images,
equations, multimedia and supplementary files. It parses the XML for key metadata
information, such as book-part identifiers for storage in the main database tables.
Citations that have PubMed identifiers are stored in the database. The loader creates a
unique accession ID, with the ‘NBK’ prefix for each book-part XML file.</p>
      <p>The book database is similar in design to the PMC article database. It is actually a
database cluster with a primary database for the main relational tables holding book and
book-part information, as well as their properties and attributes, and several secondary
blob databases for holding the XML and associated file blobs.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec>
      <title>Rendering</title>
      <p>Each XML book part is transformed by XSLT to HTML dynamically at run time and delivered
to the browser along with the associated files through the book viewer application. The
URL for accessing the book part includes the accession ID for that book part.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec>
      <title>Performing quality assurance</title>
      <p>Quality assurance checks aim to protect the fidelity of data through all stages of
processing and ensure accurate rendering and retrieval by the user. Bookshelf uses both
manual and automated procedures for performing quality assurance checks.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec>
      <title>Indexing in Entrez</title>
      <p>Bookshelf records are indexed in Entrez, a text-indexing and data retrieval and discovery
application used by major databases at NCBI, such as PubMed and GenBank (<xref rid="gks1279-B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). An indexing script extracts the book-part
XML files from the book database and creates an index for each file in an Entrez database.
A single book-part XML file may be composed of many units of retrieval (sections, figures,
tables) in the indexing database. Each unit is referred to as a DocSum (document summary)
having a unique identifier (UID) distinct from the NBK accession ID. Thus, a single
book-part accession ID may be represented by many UIDs on retrieval.</p>
      <p>There are three types of indexed fields. The first is the key field. Key fields include
the Bookshelf NBK accession ID and indexing DocSum UID identifiers, which enable
reciprocal linkages between book records and other NCBI databases to be built. References
in the book document records (e.g. PubChem identifier) to databases within NCBI are used
to build reciprocal links in Entrez between the book document record and the corresponding
NCBI database (in this example, PubChem). The reciprocity of linking facilitates
information discovery (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gks1279-F3">Figure 3</xref>). The
second type of indexed field is the display field. Display fields, e.g. title, display in
the document summary for the record during retrieval. Finally, search fields do not
display but enable a fielded full-text search. For example, a user can search using the
keyword field for all records indexed for a particular keyword or phrase [‘pandemic

    <title>SEARCHING, BROWSING AND READING</title>
    <p>Books can be searched in Bookshelf or from any NCBI resource page by selecting
‘Books’ or ‘All Databases’. The Entrez application offers a library
of search features: use of autocomplete and spell-check dictionaries for queries to improve
retrieval, multiple display formats for search results, sort features, query limits,
advanced search, clipboard function and log of recent activity. These features are shared
with other NCBI resources such as PubMed. Users can search across all books as well as
within a specific book (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gks1279-F4">Figure 4</xref>A and B).
The Bookshelf browse tool (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/browse/">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/browse/</ext-link>) is a specialized application, which
allows users to filter the list of books by terms or content category selection (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gks1279-F4">Figure 4</xref>C). Book content is delivered to the user
in the browser through the book viewer application (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gks1279-F4">Figure 4</xref>D), which features bibliographic and citation information,
permits navigation within the book and displays alternate layouts such as print view.
Bookshelf content is also accessible through referrals from major search engines. <fig id="gks1279-F4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p>Searching, browsing and reading books.

    <title>INTEGRATING BOOKSHELF LITERATURE WITH OTHER NCBI RESOURCES</title>
    <p>At NCBI, the literature databases are used to provide annotation for genomic, molecular
genetic and structural data resources (<xref rid="gks1279-B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>).
Book content is being integrated with other NCBI databases such as Gene, Genetic Testing
Registry and PubChem to aid in the annotation and discoverability of factual
information.</p>
    <p>Identifiers to records in other NCBI databases contained within the text of the book (e.g.
Gene and PubChem identifiers) when appropriately tagged in the XML data are used to build
reciprocal connections between books and the corresponding databases in Entrez (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gks1279-F3">Figure 3</xref>). Source data for books and documents can
be highly variable with regard to such tagged references to molecular information; some
books and documents contain these references, whereas others do not. The variability is
often dependent on the workflow for the particular project: XML-based authoring and
publishing workflows in which print and online publications are derived from the same source
XML enable rich tagging of references to molecular data, whereas documents that are
converted to XML after print publication are often devoid of them. Currently, Bookshelf does
not use automated text-mining approaches for capturing references to Gene, Online Mendelian
Inheritance in Man (OMIM), GenBank and other molecular databases. Tagging references to
molecular data in the XML is only performed by manual or semi-automated processes when there
is a high level of confidence that the references created are accurate, and where subsequent
quality assurance checks can be performed.</p>
    <p>Citation lists in the source XML data are parsed to build links to corresponding citations
in PubMed. During the ingest process, the software checks to see whether a PubMed ID has
been provided; if not, the software attempts to resolve the citation to a PubMed ID and
writes it back into the XML. Citations for select Bookshelf titles are now searchable in
PubMed, identifiable by the Books and Documents label in the PubMed results page. The
Related Citations in PubMed feature includes citations to book records. Computation of the
similarity relationship for book citations to other articles or books is based on the same
algorithm as is used to build similarity relationships between article citations in PubMed
(<xref rid="gks1279-B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>).</p>
    <p>Integration between books and other NCBI resources has also been developed on the basis of
curated relationships built between databases. Even a basic level of expert curation for a
book or document may allow for computation of a broader subset of related molecular data,
which can be integrated into books, allowing for a larger set of connections between
databases to be built. One example elucidating such integration is the GeneReviews
(<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK1116/">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK1116/</ext-link>) resource in Bookshelf. Led by
Roberta Pagon and her staff at University of Washington, GeneReviews is an expert-authored
peer-reviewed collection of reviews on the diagnosis, management and genetic counseling of
patients and families with inheritable genetic conditions (<xref rid="gks1279-B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). GeneReviews articles are structured in format and are updated
regularly. Relationships between diseases and the genes involved are curated separately in a
database designed for the purpose, and updated as that factual information changes, not
necessarily when any particular GeneReview is revised. Based on these curated relationships,
detailed molecular genetic information from NCBI databases is computationally built nightly
for each GeneReviews article. It is stored in the NLM Book DTD format separately until the
time of rendering to the browser, when it is integrated into the web page for the
GeneReviews article (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gks1279-F5">Figure 5</xref>). This
separation of the literature from the molecular genetic data allows the GeneReviews resource
to remain as up to date as possible. <fig id="gks1279-F5" position="float"><label>Figure
5.</label><caption><p>Integration of molecular genetic information in books. Data for
Table A and B in the Molecular Genetics section of a GeneReviews article are computed

    <title>NEAR FUTURE</title>
    <p>As the collection grows, Bookshelf will need to develop user-centric approaches to
information delivery. There will be an increased need to balance comprehensiveness of search
results with the usability and relevance of these results. The knowledgebase should also
continue to reflect current progress in biomedicine. Bookshelf will be investigating
automated text-mining approaches combined with curated and computational approaches with the
intent of building molecular data profiles for book records. Such profiles will enable
better integration between books and other NCBI databases.</p>

    <title>PUBMED CENTRAL INTERNATIONAL AND BOOKS</title>
    <p>The PubMed Central International (PMCI) project (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/about/pmci/">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/about/pmci/</ext-link>), a collaboration between NLM,
National Institutes of Health, publishers and international agencies that share NLM’s
goal for archiving the biomedical literature, will soon be broadened to include book
content. Currently, there are two PMCI repositories: EuropePMC [formerly UKPMC (<xref rid="gks1279-B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>)] and PMC Canada. The goals for this networked
cluster of repositories for archiving and exchanging data are to improve the stability of
the archive, facilitate submission of content to local repositories and permit specialized
locale-based handling of the biomedical literature, which can be tied to specific health
care needs.</p>
