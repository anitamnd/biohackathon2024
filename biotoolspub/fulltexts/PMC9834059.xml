      <p id="Par1">RNA polyadenylation plays a central role in RNA maturation, fate, and stability. In response to developmental cues, polyA tail lengths can vary, affecting the translation efficiency and stability of mRNAs. Here we develop Nanopore 3′ end-capture sequencing (Nano3P-seq), a method that relies on nanopore cDNA sequencing to simultaneously quantify RNA abundance, tail composition, and tail length dynamics at per-read resolution. By employing a template-switching-based sequencing protocol, Nano3P-seq can sequence RNA molecule from its 3′ end, regardless of its polyadenylation status, without the need for PCR amplification or ligation of RNA adapters. We demonstrate that Nano3P-seq provides quantitative estimates of RNA abundance and tail lengths, and captures a wide diversity of RNA biotypes. We find that, in addition to mRNA and long non-coding RNA, polyA tails can be identified in 16S mitochondrial ribosomal RNA in both mouse and zebrafish models. Moreover, we show that mRNA tail lengths are dynamically regulated during vertebrate embryogenesis at an isoform-specific level, correlating with mRNA decay. Finally, we demonstrate the ability of Nano3P-seq in capturing non-A bases within polyA tails of various lengths, and reveal their distribution during vertebrate embryogenesis. Overall, Nano3P-seq is a simple and robust method for accurately estimating transcript levels, tail lengths, and tail composition heterogeneity in individual reads, with minimal library preparation biases, both in the coding and non-coding transcriptome.</p>

    <p id="Par3">RNA molecules are subject to multiple co- and post-transcriptional modifications, shaping them to their final mature form<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Polyadenylation of RNA is one such modification, which is known to affect the stability and translation efficiency of the RNA molecule<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup> and to play an essential role in determining the fate of RNA molecules in a wide range of biological processes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>.</p>
    <p id="Par4">One context in which polyadenylation has been shown to play a major role in determining RNA fate and decay is vertebrate embryogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Indeed, in the first hours after fertilization, vertebrate embryos undergo major cellular reprogramming, a process known as the maternal-to-zygotic transition (MZT)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. During the MZT, maternally inherited RNA and proteins are responsible for activation of the zygotic genome and are later replaced by the zygotic program<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Because the MZT begins in a transcriptionally silent embryo, this transition relies heavily on post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>, including modulation of the polyadenylation status of the RNA molecules<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Therefore, characterizing the dynamics of RNA polyadenylation is key to understanding how these modifications regulate the fate and function of RNA molecules.</p>
    <p id="Par5">In the past few years, several transcriptome-wide methods have become available for studying the dynamics of polyadenylated tails (polyA tails) based on next-generation sequencing (NGS), such as PAL-seq or TAIL-seq<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. While these methods have been successfully employed to characterize the dynamics of polyA tail lengths in various contexts, they have several caveats: (i) they provide a limited perspective on isoform–tail relationships owing to the short-read-length nature of NGS-based technologies; (ii) they do not provide single-molecule resolution; (iii) they are severely affected by PCR amplification biases; and (iv) they can only measure tail lengths that are shorter than the read length.</p>
    <p id="Par6">To overcome these limitations, the direct RNA sequencing (dRNA-seq) platform offered by Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) has been proposed as a means to study both the transcriptome and polyA tail lengths simultaneously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. To sequence native RNAs using dRNA-seq, polyA-tailed RNA molecules are ligated to a 3′ adapter that contains an oligo(dT) overhang. Consequently, dRNA-seq libraries capture the full-length polyA tail; however, ligation occurs only on RNA molecules that anneal to the oligo(dT) overhang, thus exclusively capturing polyA transcripts with tail lengths greater than 10 nucleotides. A variation of this method consisting of in vitro poly(I)-tailing the transcriptome before library preparation has been proposed for studying nascent RNAs using dRNA-seq<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>, thus capturing both polyadenylated and non-polyadenylated mRNAs. However, major limitations to this variation include low sequencing yields compared with standard dRNA-seq (10–30%)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup> and a lack of tools to distinguish poly(I) and poly(A) signals; therefore, polyA tail length information is lost in these datasets<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. An alternative approach for studying the transcriptome using nanopore technologies is direct cDNA sequencing (dcDNA-seq), but this approach cannot sequence the polyA<sup>−</sup> transcriptome, nor can it capture polyA tail length information. Overall, both dRNA-seq and dcDNA-seq nanopore library preparation protocols are limited to the sequencing of polyadenylated transcripts and thus cannot provide a comprehensive view of both polyadenylated and deadenylated RNA molecules, in addition to being unable to capture RNA molecules with other types of RNA tails (for example, polyuridine).</p>
    <p id="Par7">Here we present a novel method that employs nanopore sequencing to simultaneously obtain per-isoform transcriptome abundance and tail lengths in full-length individual reads, with minimal library preparation steps, which we term Nanopore 3′-end-capture sequencing (Nano3P-seq). Notably, Nano3P-seq uses template switching to initiate reverse transcription and, therefore, does not require 3′ end adapter ligation steps, PCR amplification, or second-strand cDNA synthesis. We demonstrate that Nano3P-seq can capture any type of RNA molecule regardless of its 3′ sequence, including polyA-tailed and non-tailed RNA. Moreover, we show that Nano3P-seq can accurately quantify RNA abundances in both the coding and non-coding transcriptome, as well as quantify the polyA tail lengths and tail composition of individual RNA molecules in a highly reproducible manner.</p>

      <title>Nano3P-seq robustly captures both polyadenylated and non-polyadenylated RNA</title>
      <p id="Par8">Because nanopore sequencing is typically limited to the analysis of polyA<sup>+</sup> RNA molecules (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>), previous efforts have opted to perform in vitro polyadenylation reactions of the total RNA to capture non-polyadenylated RNA in the sequencing run<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. While this option can capture any given transcript present in the sample, it also leads to a loss of polyA tail length information. Therefore, we reasoned that by coupling template switching to cDNA nanopore sequencing, we would simultaneously capture the polyA<sup>+</sup> and polyA<sup>−</sup> transcriptome, while retaining polyA tail length information from each individual RNA molecule (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><title>Nano3P-seq captures polyadenylated and non-polyadenylated RNAs, while retaining polyA tail length information.</title><p><bold>a</bold>, Schematic overview comparing three different library preparation methods for studying the transcriptome using nanopore sequencing.

      <p id="Par9">To assess the ability of Nano3P-seq to sequence both polyA<sup>+</sup> and polyA<sup>−</sup> RNA, we first sequenced two synthetic RNAs, one lacking a polyA tail and one that had been in vitro polyadenylated (<xref rid="Sec13" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref>) (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">1a–c</xref>). Our results show that Nano3P-seq efficiently captures both polyadenylated and non-polyadenylated RNA molecules, as well as the diversity of polyA tail lengths in individual RNAs (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>). We then examined the performance of Nano3P-seq on in vivo samples, and sequenced total RNA samples from mouse brain, previously enriched in nuclear and mitochondrial content via subcellular fractionation to increase the content of non-coding RNAs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup> (<xref rid="Sec13" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref>). We confirmed that Nano3P-seq captured RNA biotypes that are typically polyadenylated (that is, mRNA, long intervening non-coding RNAs (lincRNA), and processed transcript) as well as non-polyadenylated (that is rRNA, miscellaneous RNA (miscRNA), small nuclear RNA (snRNA), small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA)), the majority of them being rRNA, mRNA, and snRNA (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref> and Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">1d</xref>). In addition, our results confirmed that polyA tail length information was retained in individual reads. Specifically, the majority of reads corresponding to mRNAs had polyA tails (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref> and Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">1e,f</xref>), whereas non-coding RNAs such as snoRNAs (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">1f</xref>) and snRNAs did not have polyA tails (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">1g</xref>), as expected.</p>

(Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref>). Analysis of individual miRNA gene expression patterns during the MZT revealed that the sharp increase observed at 4 h.p.f. was primarily caused by increased expression of genes belonging to the miR-430 family, which is known to be essential in mediating the decay of a group of maternal mRNAs during the MZT (mirR-430-dependent decay)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup> (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">2e</xref>).

      <title>Charting polyA tail length dynamics in vivo using Nano3P-seq</title>
      <p id="Par16">We explored whether Nano3P-seq could be used to investigate polyA tail length dynamics in vivo. To this end, we first examined the ability of Nano3P-seq to identify which RNA biotypes were polyadenylated in mouse brain total RNA samples that had been previously enriched in nuclear/mitochondrial content to increase the proportion of non-coding RNAs. We found that polyA tails were mainly predicted on mRNAs, but also in lincRNAs and processed transcripts, which are also known to be polyadenylated<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup> (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3e</xref>).</p>
      <p id="Par17">We next analyzed the polyA tail length dynamics across developmental stages of zebrafish mRNAs during the MZT (<italic>t</italic> = 2, 4, and 6 h.p.f.).

All mRNAs examined were found to be polyadenylated, with the exception of histone mRNAs, which had a median polyA tail length of zero (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">3h</xref>), in agreement with previous works reporting their non-polyadenylated status<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. These findings show that Nano3P-seq can capture RNA molecules with structured 3′ ends, such as those found in histones<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. Finally, we note that per-gene polyA tail length estimates obtained by Nano3P-seq during the MZT showed a good correlation with those obtained using orthogonal methods such as PAL-seq<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup> (Pearson’s <italic>R</italic> = 0.71–0.85) (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">3i,j</xref>).</p>
      <p id="Par18">Next, we examined the correlation between polyA tail length dynamics and mRNA decay. To this end, mRNA transcripts were binned depending on their decay mode (maternal decay, zygotic activation-dependent decay, miR-430-dependent decay, and no decay), as previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. We observed that the three groups of mRNAs that are known to decay (maternal, zygotic, and miR-430) showed a significant decrease in mRNA abundance (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3h</xref>), as expected. However, the patterns of polyA tail length dynamics strongly varied depending on the decay mode of the transcript (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3i</xref>). Specifically, we observed that transcripts that decayed in an miR-430-dependent manner showed a significant decrease in polyA tail length during the MZT, in agreement with previous studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. By contrast, for mRNAs with the zygotic genome activation-dependent decay mode, this shortening only occurred after 4 h.p.f., and maternal mRNAs did not present a decrease in polyA tail length, but instead showed a consistent increase in tail length throughout the MZT. These observations are consistent with the reanalysis of PAL-seq data (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">3k,l</xref>). Overall, these results show that not all decay modes are associated with a reduction in transcript polyA tail lengths and demonstrate the applicability of Nano3P-seq to identify polyadenylated RNA populations, study their RNA abundance, and estimate their polyA tail length dynamics, at both the global level and the level of individual transcripts, and thus provide mechanistic insights into different gene regulatory programs.</p>

Some modifications occur in base positions that are involved in Watson–Crick (WC) base pairing, causing a disruption during reverse transcription. Consequently, these modifications can be seen as increased ‘errors’ and drop-off rates in RNA-seq datasets<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. One example is the hypermodified base m<sup>1</sup>acp<sup>3</sup>Ψ, which is present in the eukaryotic small subunit (SSU) rRNA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup> crucial for the final processing steps of precursor rRNA (pre-rRNA) into mature SSU rRNA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>.</p>
      <p id="Par23">Therefore, we examined whether Nano3P-seq could capture RNA modification differences across precursor and mature rRNA molecules from distinct maturation stages. To this end, reads mapping to SSU rRNAs were assigned to either ‘precursor’ or ‘processed’ isoforms (on the basis of the location of the 3′ end of the read) and analyzed the sequencing error patterns in the two populations (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4d</xref>). We observed that the mismatch frequency (misincorporations from the reverse transcriptase) at the m<sup>1</sup>acp<sup>3</sup>Ψ-modified site was very high in mature rRNAs but not present in pre-rRNAs, suggesting that this modification is only present in mature rRNA populations. The presence of the hypermodification was also accompanied by a drop-off in sequencing coverage at the m<sup>1</sup>acp<sup>3</sup>Ψ-modified site, in agreement with its ability to disrupt the Watson–Crick base pairing. Analysis of the ‘error’ signatures along the SSU transcripts showed that this position was the only one position to change between precursor and processed rRNA molecules (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4d</xref>). These results were also orthogonally confirmed in dRNA-seq datasets, although the difference between pre-rRNA and mature rRNA error patterns were less evident than in Nano3P-seq datasets, likely owing to the presence of m<sup>1</sup>Ψ modification (precursor of m<sup>1</sup>acp<sup>3</sup>Ψ) at this site in the pre-rRNAs, which also causes increased ‘errors’ in dRNA-seq datasets, but not in Nano3P-seq datasets (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">4d</xref>).

Analysis of tail base abundance revealed that G was the most common non-A base in zebrafish mRNAs and that there was a significant decrease in non-A bases with progression of the MZT (Extended Data Figure <xref rid="Fig11" ref-type="fig">6a,b</xref>). As a control, we examined the composition of bases in synthetic molecules (‘sequins’), which are expected to contain an homogeneous polyA tail, and found that the frequency of non-A bases in biological sequences was significantly higher (6–15-fold) than in synthetic ‘sequins’ molecules (Extended Data Figure <xref rid="Fig11" ref-type="fig">6a</xref>), suggesting that the majority of non-A bases observed in Nano3P-seq biological datasets are not base-calling artifacts.</p>
      <p id="Par27">We then binned the tails on the basis of the composition of the last 30 nucleotides (All-A, contains only A; Int-G, contains internal Gs; Int-U, contains internal Us; Int-C, contains internal Cs; Term-G, contains terminal Gs; Term-U, contains terminal Us; Term-C, contains terminal Cs) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5d</xref> and Extended Data Figure <xref rid="Fig11" ref-type="fig">6c</xref>). Our analysis showed that non-A internal bases were more abundant than non-A terminal bases, with internal Gs (Int-G) being the most abundant type of non-A bases in polyA tails (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5d</xref>). Moreover, we found that the abundance of transcripts with non-A base tails (internal or terminal) typically decreased with progression of the MZT, except for transcripts with terminal Us, for which the observed decrease was not statistically significant.</p>
      <p id="Par28">Finally, we examined the relationship between tail length and the presence of non-A bases in the tails. Although the median tail length increases during the MZT (Figs <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5e</xref> and <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3g</xref>), we found that this increase did not occur for all transcripts, as it depended on tail composition. Specifically, terminally uridylated tails (Term-U) were short (median lengths of 43, 50, and 32 nucleotides at 2, 4, 6 h.p.f., respectively) regardless of the time point examined (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4e,f</xref>, see also Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>). An equivalent analysis in mouse Nano3P-seq datasets revealed that Term-U tails were also significantly shorter than the other tail types examined (Extended Data Figure <xref rid="Fig11" ref-type="fig">6d</xref> and Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>); by contrast, this trend was not observed in yeast Nano3P-seq datasets (Extended Data Figure <xref rid="Fig11" ref-type="fig">6e</xref>, and Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). Our results are in agreement with previous studies in mouse and human cell lines showing that G and U bases are common in polyA tails and that tails ending with U bases are more frequent in shorter polyA tails<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>.</p>

      <title>Assessment of tail length bias caused by polyA selection</title>
      <p id="Par29">Because the vast majority of cellular RNA is composed of rRNA, transcriptomic studies typically remove a significant portion of rRNA molecules to sequence a wider diversity of RNA biotypes. This removal can be achieved by (i) ribodepletion of the sample using biotinylated oligonucleotides that are complementary to rRNAs or (ii) selective enrichment of polyA<sup>+</sup> transcripts using oligo(dT) beads. Although these two approaches are often used interchangeably, their effects on the transcriptome composition are not equal. Nano3P-seq allows us to compare the effects of these two approaches on both the transcriptome composition and polyA tail length distribution. In terms of its effects on transcriptome composition, we found that ribodepletion captures a larger variety of RNA biotypes compared with polyA selection, including several non-polyA-tailed RNA biotypes, as expected (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2f</xref>). However, we did not observe a significant difference in the distribution of mRNA polyA tail lengths between the two methods (Extended Data Figure <xref rid="Fig12" ref-type="fig">7a–c</xref>), suggesting that, at least in zebrafish MZT transcriptomes, oligo(dT) enrichments do not significantly bias the polyA<sup>+</sup> mRNA populations by preferentially enriching for those with longer polyA tails.</p>

      <title>Comparison of Nano3P-seq to orthogonal methods</title>
      <p id="Par30">We then performed a comparative analysis of zebrafish polyA tail lengths, read lengths, and per-read quality in libraries sequenced using either Nano3P-seq or dRNA-seq. We found that Nano3P-seq captured RNA molecules regardless of their tail ends, resulting in the capture of diverse RNA biotypes (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref> and Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">1c–g</xref>) including deadenylated mRNA molecules (Extended Data Figs <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">3h</xref> and <xref rid="Fig12" ref-type="fig">7</xref>) and molecules terminating with non-A bases in their 3′ ends (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref> and Extended Data Figs <xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">5</xref> and <xref rid="Fig11" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). By contrast, dRNA-seq only captured longer polyadenylated transcripts, as this method relies on the presence of polyA tail lengths greater than 10 nucleotides. Indeed, when comparing the distribution of per-read polyA tail length estimations of mRNAs, we observed that Nano3P-seq captured some mRNAs with predicted tail lengths of zero, whereas dRNA-seq only captured reads with longer tails (Extended Data Figure <xref rid="Fig12" ref-type="fig">7d,e</xref>). Moreover, we found that Nano3P-seq produced reads with significantly longer lengths than dRNA-seq (Extended Data Figure <xref rid="Fig12" ref-type="fig">7f</xref>), whereas the per-read qualities and 3′ end biases were relatively similar between the two methods (Extended Data Figure <xref rid="Fig12" ref-type="fig">7g–i</xref>), in agreement with previous works<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. In terms of sequencing output, the yields of Nano3P-seq runs were similar—or slightly better—to those observed in dRNA-seq runs, producing ~100,000–200,000 reads in Flongle devices and ~500,000–2,000,000 in MinION devices, depending on the RNA input type and quality of the flowcell (Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref>).</p>
      <p id="Par31">In addition to comparing Nano3P-seq to dRNA-seq in matched zebrafish samples, we also compared Nano3P-seq polyA tail length estimates to publicly available datasets generated using orthogonal methods, including PAL-seq<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>, TAIL-seq<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup> PAT-seq<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>, and FLAM-seq<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup> (Extended Data Figs <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">3i</xref> and <xref rid="Fig13" ref-type="fig">8</xref>).

    <title>Discussion</title>
    <p id="Par32">In the past few years, a variety of NGS-based high-throughput methods have been developed to characterize the 3′ ends of RNA molecules at a transcriptome-wide scale, including methods to reveal polyA tail sites (for example, 3P-seq<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>, PAS-seq<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>, and PAT-seq<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>) and to estimate polyA tail lengths (for example, PAL-seq<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>, TAIL-seq<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>, and mTAIL-seq<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>). However, a major limitation of NGS-based methods is their inability to assign a given polyA tail length to a specific transcript isoform, which causes a loss of isoform-specific tail length information. In addition, NGS-based methods cannot measure tail lengths greater than the read length, thus biasing our view of polyA tail dynamics to those transcripts that display shorter tail lengths.</p>
    <p id="Par33">More recently, methods for estimating polyA tail lengths using PacBio long-read sequencing technologies have been developed, such as FLAM-seq<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup> and PAIso-seq<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>. In contrast to NGS, these methods can capture isoform–tail relationships; however, they are still affected by PCR amplification and ligation biases, in addition to producing relatively modest outputs in terms of the number of reads<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup>. In this regard, several works have concluded that nanopore sequencers do not suffer from GC-content biases, as these are mainly introduced during the PCR amplification step<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref></sup>.</p>
    <p id="Par34">Nanopore dRNA-seq has been proposed as an alternative long-read sequencing technology for studying polyA tail lengths<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>; however, the standard dRNA-seq approach cannot capture deadenylated RNAs, molecules with non-canonical tailings (for example, polyuridine), or molecules with polyA tails shorter than 10 nucleotides, thus biasing the view of the transcriptome toward polyadenylated molecules. Customized dRNA-seq methods involving in vitro poly(G/I)-tailing have been developed to overcome some of these limitations, but a lack of bioinformatic tools to distinguish polyI and polyA signals limits their applicability to study polyA tail length differences across transcripts in these datasets<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. In addition, dRNA-seq requires 500 ng RNA as input, whereas Nano3P-seq requires as little as 50 ng, thus decreasing the required input material by tenfold. Nano3P-seq addresses the current limitations by offering a simple and robust solution for studying the coding and non-coding transcriptome simultaneously regardless of the presence or absence of polyA tails or 3′ tail composition, without PCR or ligation biases, and with single-read and single-isoform resolution. Moreover, the use of thermostable group II intron reverse transcriptase (TGIRT) in the Nano3P-seq protocol not only maximizes the production of full-length cDNAs, but also ensures the inclusion of RNA molecules that are highly structured and/or modified, which would often not be captured (or their representation would be significantly biased) using standard viral reverse transcriptases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref></sup>.</p>
    <p id="Par35">Nano3P-seq also provides quantitative measurements of RNA abundances (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref>) and captures diverse RNA biotypes regardless of their tail end composition (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref>). We have shown that Nano3P-seq can be applied to diverse species with a wide range of polyA tail lengths (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3d,e</xref>) and can be used to study the dynamics of polyadenylation (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3f,g,i</xref>). Specifically, we have demonstrated that Nano3P-seq provides per-read-resolution transcriptome-wide maps of RNA abundance and polyadenylation dynamics during the zebrafish MZT.</p>
    <p id="Par36">Overall, our work demonstrates that Nano3P-seq can simultaneously capture both non-polyA-tailed and polyA-tailed transcriptomes, making it possible to accurately quantify the RNA abundances and polyA tail lengths at per-read and per-isoform levels, while minimizing the amount of biases introduced during library preparation. These features set Nano3P-seq as a simple, potent, and robust method that can provide mechanistic insights into the regulation of RNA molecules and improve our understanding of mRNA tailing processes and post-transcriptional control.</p>

RNAse Cocktail (Thermo Scientific, AM2286) was added to the mix to digest the RNA, and the mix was incubated at 37 °C for 10 min. The reaction was then cleaned up using 0.8× AMPure XP Beads (Agencourt, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/A63881">A63881</ext-link>). To be able to ligate the sequencing adapters to the first cDNA strand, 1 µl 10 µM CompA_DNA (5′ GAAGATAGAGCGACAGGCAAGTGATCGGAAGA 3′) was annealed to the 15 µl cDNA in a tube with 2.25 µl 0.1 M Tris pH 7.5, 2.25 µl 0.5 M NaCl and 2 µl nuclease-free water. The mix was incubated at 94 °C for 1 min and the temperature was ramped down to 25 °C (−0.1 °C s<sup>−1</sup>) to anneal the complementary to the first-strand cDNA. Then, 22.5 µl first-strand cDNA was mixed with 5 µl Adapter Mix (AMX), 22.5 µl Rnase-free water and 50 µl Blunt/TA Ligase Mix (NEB, M0367S) and incubated in room temperature for 10 min. The reaction was cleaned up using 0.8× AMPure XP beads, using WSB (Washing buffer) buffer for washing. The sample was then eluted in elution buffer and mixed with sequencing buffer and loading beads before loading onto a primed R9.4.1 flowcell. Libraries were run on either Flongle or MinION flow cells with MinKNOW acquisition software version v.3.5.5.

      <title>Annealing-based dcDNA-seq library preparation with TGIRT</title>
      <p id="Par48">Some adjustments were made to the original Direct cDNA-Sequencing ONT protocol (SQK-DCS109), to be able to use TGIRT (InGex) as reverse transcription enzyme for nanopore sequencing, as this enzyme does not produce CCC overhang, which is typically exploited by the dcDNA-seq library preparation protocol (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). In brief, 1 µl 100 µM reverse transcription primer VNP (5′ /5Phos/ACTTGCCTGTCGCTCTATCTTCTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTVN 3′) and 1 µl 100 µM of in-house designed complementary oligo (CompA: 5′ GAAGATAGAGCGACAGGCAAGTA 3′) were mixed with 1 µl 0.2 M Tris pH 7.5, 1 µl 1 M NaCl and 16 μl RNase-free water. The mix was incubated at 94 °C for 1 min and the temperature was ramped down to 25 °C (−0.1 °C s<sup>−1</sup>) to pre-anneal the oligonucleotides. Then, 50 ng polyA-tailed RNA was mixed with 1 µl pre-annealed VNP + CompA, 1 μl 100 mM dithiothreitol, 4 µl 5× TGIRT Buffer (2.25 M NaCl, 25 mM MgCl2, 100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5), 1 µl RNAse Inhibitor Murine (NEB, M0314S), 1 µl TGIRT and nuclease-free water up to 19 µl. The reverse transcription mix was initially incubated at room temperature for 30 min before adding 1 µl 10 mM dNTP mix. Then the mix was incubated at 60 °C for 60 min and inactivated by heating at 75 °C for 15 min before moving onto ice. Furthermore, RNAse Cocktail (Thermo Scientific, AM2286) was added to the mix to digest the RNA and the mix was incubated at 37 °C for 10 min.

For sequins, reads were base-called using stand-alone Guppy v.3.0.3 with default parameters and then the base-called reads were mapped to sequin sequences<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup> with minimap2 with ‘-ax splice -k14 -uf --MD’ parameters<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref></sup>.

      <p id="Par66">For the analysis of synthetic RNA constructs (curlcakes), base-called reads were mapped to Curlcake 1 and 2 sequences<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref></sup>, and mapped reads were then intersected with annotations of Curlcake 1 and 2 sequences to filter out the incomplete reads using bedtools v.2.29.1 intersect option.

For zebrafish RNA (polyA-selected and ribodepleted), we first mapped the base-called reads to ribosomal RNAs and then mapped the rest of the reads to the genome (GRCz11). Mapped read starts were then intersected with ENSEMBL version 103 annotation (Danio_rerio.GRCz11.103.2.gtf) exon ends, to filter the incomplete reads. For HeLa mRNA, we first mapped the base-called reads to human ribosomal RNAs (28S, 18S, 5S and 5.8S); then, the rest of the reads (unmapped) were mapped to the <italic>Homo sapiens</italic> genome (GRCh38). Mapped read starts were then intersected with ENSEMBL version 107 annotation (Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.107.gtf) exon ends, to filter out incomplete reads (please see Nano3p-seq GitHub repository for detailed steps and script used: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/novoalab/Nano3P_Seq">https://github.com/novoalab/Nano3P_Seq</ext-link>). For cDNA standards, base-called reads were mapped to cDNA sequence reference using minimap2, except for the cDNA_pA_standard_120, which was mapped using bwa short-read aligner<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref></sup> with the following parameters ‘mem -xont2d’. A different aligner was used for cDNA_pA_standard_120 because minimap2, which is a long-read mapping algorithm, did not yield any mapped reads for this standard owing to its short length<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref></sup> (30 nucleotides once the pA tail length has been soft-clipped). We should note that the use of a different aligner should not affect the polyA tail length estimations of the reads, as these are done at the level of current intensity (that is, before mapping and base-calling). We should note that fewer reads were base-called and mapped to cDNA_pA_standard_120, cDNA_pA_standard_90 and cDNA_pA_standard_60, in comparison to the other cDNA standards (Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>). This phenomenon is probably caused by the inefficiency of nanopore sequencing to capture shorter cDNA sequences (cDNA_pA_standard_120 will have a mappable region of 30 nucleotides, and cDNA_pA_standard_90 will have a mappable region of 60 nucleotides, once the polyA tail region has been soft-clipped).</p>

      <title>Estimation of polyA tail lengths</title>
      <p id="Par68">For dRNA-seq reads, polyA tail length estimation was performed using NanoTail, a module from Master of Pores<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref></sup>, a nextflow workflow for the analysis of direct RNA datasets, which uses internally Nanopolish v0.11.1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. In NanoTail, all reads stored in the fastq files are first indexed with ‘nanopolish index’ using default parameters, and the function ‘nanopolish polya’ is used to perform polyA tail length estimations. We should note that neither Nanopolish nor TailfindR estimate polyA tail lengths from the base-called sequence (owing to increased deletion frequencies observed in homopolymeric regions, which is an inherent problem of nanopore sequencing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref></sup>); rather, they estimate polyA tail lengths by comparing the relative duration of the current signal corresponding to the polyA tail region to the total duration of the sequenced read.</p>

      <title>Analysis of tail composition</title>
      <p id="Par70">Base-called reads mapped to the zebrafish genome and cDNA standards for tail composition quantification were first trimmed using the Porechop tool (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/rrwick/Porechop">https://github.com/rrwick/Porechop</ext-link>) with the following parameters ‘--extra_end_trim 0 --end_threshold 50’, to remove the adapter sequences. Because Porechop sometimes failed at removal of the adapter sequences, only reads containing more than 80% A bases in their tail composition were kept for downstream analyses, thus ensuring that untrimmed reads are not included in downstream analyses (Extended Data Figure <xref rid="Fig14" ref-type="fig">9</xref>). Finally, an in-house Python script was used to extract the tail FASTA sequences of the tail regions from trimmed reads, which has been made available in GitHub (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/novoalab/Nano3P_Seq/blob/master/python_scripts/soft_clipped_content.py">https://github.com/novoalab/Nano3P_Seq/blob/master/python_scripts/soft_clipped_content.py</ext-link>).</p>

    <p>O.B. performed the majority of wet laboratory experiments. O.B. analyzed the data, together with E.M.N. G.D. performed quantitative PCR experiments and G/I-based polyA tail length experiments to orthogonally validate Nano3P-seq predictions. H.L. contributed code for the analysis of polyA tail lengths and nucleotide content. A.D.-T. processed and analyzed the direct RNA sequencing zebrafish data. A.M.N. and E.V. adapted tailfindR code to accommodate the adapters that are used in Nano3P-seq libraries. C.K., A.J.G. and J.-D.B. provided the zebrafish total and polyA-selected RNA samples used in this study. E.M.N. conceived the project. E.M.N. supervised the work, with the assistance of J.S.M. O.B. and E.M.N. wrote the paper, with contributions from all authors.</p>
