      <p><italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> is a protozoan parasite that is transmitted to both humans and animals through zoonotic or anthroponotic means. When a host is infected with this parasite, it causes a gastrointestinal disease known as cryptosporidiosis. To understand the transmission dynamics of <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic>, the small subunit (SSU or 18S) rRNA and <italic>gp60</italic> genes are commonly studied through PCR analysis and conventional Sanger sequencing. However, analyzing sequence chromatograms manually is both time consuming and prone to human error, especially in the presence of poorly resolved, heterozygous peaks and the absence of a validated database. For this study, we developed a <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> genotyping tool, called CryptoGenotyper, which has the capability to read raw Sanger sequencing data for the two common <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> gene targets (SSU rRNA and <italic>gp60</italic>) and classify the sequence data into standard nomenclature. The CryptoGenotyper has the capacity to perform quality control and properly classify sequences using a high quality, manually curated reference database, saving users' time and removing bias during data analysis. The incorporated heterozygous base calling algorithms for the SSU rRNA gene target resolves double peaks, therefore recovering data previously classified as inconclusive. The CryptoGenotyper successfully genotyped 99.3% (428/431) and 95.1% (154/162) of SSU rRNA chromatograms containing single and mixed sequences, respectively, and correctly subtyped 95.6% (947/991) of <italic>gp60</italic> chromatograms without manual intervention. This new, user-friendly tool can provide both fast and reproducible analyses of Sanger sequencing data for the two most common <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> gene targets.</p>

    <title>Introduction</title>
    <p id="p0030">The protozoan parasite <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> is an emerging pathogen that causes gastrointestinal disease worldwide. Existing as an infectious, thick-walled oocyst in the environment, this enteric pathogen can infect a wide range of hosts, including wildlife, domestic livestock and humans (<xref rid="bb0105" ref-type="bibr">Morris et al., 2019</xref>). This apicomplexan is transmitted via the fecal-oral route either directly from infected people or animals, or through contaminated water or food (<xref rid="bb0150" ref-type="bibr">Vanathy et al., 2017</xref>). With the number of recognized <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> species increasing and their transmission dynamics still unclear, further molecular research is required as interactions between humans and animals are steadily increasing (<xref rid="bb0165" ref-type="bibr">Zahedi et al., 2015</xref>).</p>
    <p id="p0035">Two genetic loci are commonly used to characterize <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> positive samples: the small subunit ribosomal RNA (SSU rRNA) gene (also known as the 18S rRNA gene), and the 60-kDa glycoprotein (<italic>gp60</italic>) gene. The SSU rRNA gene contains variable regions interspersed amongst conserved regions, allowing for effective species and genotype identification (<xref rid="bb0105" ref-type="bibr">Morris et al., 2019</xref>). This region is AT-rich, ranging from 57 to 61% (<xref rid="bb0155" ref-type="bibr">Xiao et al., 1999</xref>). Each oocyst contains twenty copies of the gene, evenly split amongst its four haploid genomes (<xref rid="bb0105" ref-type="bibr">Morris et al., 2019</xref>). The highly polymorphic <italic>gp60</italic> gene, which encodes a protein responsible for attachment and invasion in the small intestine, can further determine genotypic families and subgenotypes (<xref rid="bb0025" ref-type="bibr">Alves et al., 2003</xref>). The 3′ conserved region defines the allelic family, whereas the 5′ hyper-variable microsatellite region defines the subtype (<xref rid="bb0055" ref-type="bibr">Chalmers et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
    <p id="p0040">Traditional methods to molecularly characterize these two regions include combining conventional PCR with Sanger sequencing. These methods are still commonly used (<xref rid="bb0075" ref-type="bibr">Firoozi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="bb0055" ref-type="bibr">Chalmers et al., 2009</xref>), despite the increasing availability of next-generation sequencing methods, due to their associated low costs, readily available equipment and standardized analysis tools. However, there are many challenges faced when analyzing the Sanger sequencing results from the SSU rRNA and <italic>gp60</italic> loci.</p>
    <p id="p0045">Analyzing Sanger sequencing chromatograms can be time consuming and is subject to human error<italic>.</italic> For instance, the presence of mixed infections or paralogs within a sequenced sample (<xref rid="bb0140" ref-type="bibr">Stensvold et al., 2015</xref>) result in heterozygous peaks throughout the sequenced region, causing difficulty in analyzing sequences. Once sequences are obtained, they are often misclassified due to inconsistent naming within public databases. Therefore, without a validated database alongside the difficulties in sequence assembly, data for transmission studies may be misinterpreted or left inconclusive.</p>
    <p id="p0050">To address these issues, we developed an automated tool specifically to analyze Sanger sequencing data of two <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> gene targets. This tool, named CryptoGenotyper, accepts raw Sanger sequencing data for the SSU rRNA or <italic>gp60</italic> loci and accurately classifies the data in a fast and reproducible way using a validated manually curated database. The CryptoGenotyper assesses data quality and resolves abnormal peaks appropriately, capturing all information within the raw Sanger sequencing data. This tool is available on the web-based platform Galaxy (<xref rid="bb0015" ref-type="bibr">Afgan et al., 2018</xref>) from the public ToolShed repository (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/" id="ir0015">https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/</ext-link>, tool id: cryptogenotyper, owner: nml) and from the public Galaxy server at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://usegalaxy.eu/" id="ir0020">https://usegalaxy.eu/</ext-link>, or as a standalone Bioconda package (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://anaconda.org/bioconda/cryptogenotyper" id="ir0025">https://anaconda.org/bioconda/cryptogenotyper</ext-link>). The CryptoGenotyper source code and documentation are available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/phac-nml/CryptoGenotyper" id="ir0030">https://github.com/phac-nml/CryptoGenotyper</ext-link>. We are currently in discussions with members of CryptoDB (<xref rid="bb0115" ref-type="bibr">Puiu et al., 2004</xref>) for potentially hosting the CryptoGenotyper on the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://CryptoDB.org" id="ir0035">CryptoDB.org</ext-link> Galaxy instance.</p>

      <title>CryptoGenotyper Development</title>
      <p id="p0055">We developed the CryptoGenotyper, a Python (v3.6) program, to perform a fast, accurate and reproducible analysis on raw Sanger sequencing data. Due to common heterozygous peaks in the SSU rRNA gene sequence, we included a heterogeneity detection algorithm into the portion of the tool that targets the SSU rRNA region. This algorithm was inspired by the Mixed Sequence Reader developed by <xref rid="bb0060" ref-type="bibr">Chang et al. (2012)</xref>, which utilizes heterozygous base-calling to distinguish mixed sequences within human papilloma virus (HPV) samples by using comparisons against reference sequences to identify indels (insertions-deletions), single nucleotide polymorphisms and sequence repeats. The program's workflow is shown in <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>.<fig id="f0005"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>CryptoGenotyper schematic workflow.</p><p>The program begins with the user inputting the gene target, sample chromatograms and database (optional). (a) If chromatograms correspond to the <italic>gp60</italic> gene target, the sequence is retrieved by analyzing the fluorescent channel intensities. A homology search is performed against the reference database and the repeat region is calculated. (b) If chromatograms correspond to the SSU rRNA gene, the sequence is computed based on the log ratio of intensity and converted to IUPAC based nucleotide code where double peaks appear. Afterwards, the sequence is decomposed with In<italic>d</italic>elligent (<xref rid="bb0070" ref-type="bibr">Dmitriev and Rakitov, 2008</xref>) and a homology search is performed using BLAST against the reference database. If mixed sequences are determined, they are classified by following the protocol outlined in <xref rid="bb0060" ref-type="bibr">Chang et al. (2012)</xref> for determining the most possible variances (MPVs) and optimal combinations. For both markers, the sequence and species and/or subtype information is outputted.</p></caption><alt-text id="al0005">Fig. 1</alt-text><graphic xlink:href="gr1"/></fig></p>
      <p id="p0060">The CryptoGenotyper is available on two interfaces: web-based (Galaxy) and command-line (GitHub and Bioconda). The tool's Galaxy interface can either be accessed at the Galaxy Europe server (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://usegalaxy.eu/" id="ir0040">https://usegalaxy.eu/</ext-link>) or can be installed through a user's own Galaxy instance admin interface. Workflows (available from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/phac-nml/CryptoGenotyper/tree/main/CryptoGenotyper/GalaxyWorkflows" id="ir0045">https://github.com/phac-nml/CryptoGenotyper/tree/main/CryptoGenotyper/GalaxyWorkflows</ext-link>) can then be imported to easily analyze multiple samples at once. Once setup, the user uploads their sequencing data to Galaxy using the Get Data feature. To analyze more than one sample, the user must create a dataset list (forward or reverse mode) or a list of dataset pairs (contig mode). From the CryptoGenotyper graphical user interface, the user can select the corresponding marker (SSU rRNA or <italic>gp60</italic>), reference database (custom or default), and samples (single, collection, paired collection) before executing the tool (<xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>A–E). The corresponding results then appear in the Galaxy History panel (<xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>F). The command-line version has the same functionality, except the user must define the directory that contains all samples to be analyzed or specify a path to a sample file. If the user wishes to perform a contig mode analysis on a directory with multiple files, the user will also need to define both forward and reverse primer names that are included in the chromatogram filenames so the tool can identify the forward and reverse sequence for each sample. Alternatively, if a directory contains sample files from the same sequencing primer pair (e.g. SSUF and SSUR) or forward or reverse analysis mode is set, the primer names can be omitted.<fig id="f0010"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Graphical user interface of Galaxy tool implementation.</p><p>The user must upload Sanger sequence reads (.ab1) using the Get Data feature under Galaxy Tools. The sequence names will appear in the history on the right. To build a contig, forward and reverse reads must be inputted as a dataset pair. For multiple samples to be processed at once, the reads must be inputted as a list. Then the following must be selected: (A) the gene marker (SSU rRNA or <italic>gp60</italic>), (B) reference database (default or custom) and (C) type of sequences (forward only, reverse only, or forward and reverse). Afterwards the appropriate sequencing files (D) must be selected. When all inputted information is entered, the execute button (E) will launch the analysis. Final typing results appear in the History (F) as two entries corresponding to extracted FASTA sequence(s) and tab-delimited text report file for easy reporting. Workflows have been created to concatenate results from multiple samples available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/phac-nml/CryptoGenotyper" id="ir0005">https://github.com/phac-nml/CryptoGenotyper</ext-link>.

          <p id="p0065">The CryptoGenotyper accepts raw Sanger sequencing chromatogram data file(s) in .ab1 file format as input. This data can correspond to three different sequencing read formats: forward, reverse, or contig. Both forward and reverse mode accept either forward (5′–3′) or reverse (3′–5′) reads, whereas the contig mode requires two files containing both forward and reverse reads. The gene target, either SSU rRNA or <italic>gp60,</italic> must then be selected.</p>

          <title>Reference Database</title>
          <p id="p0070">The CryptoGenotyper tool contains two validated reference databases: an SSU rRNA database and a <italic>gp60</italic> database. We manually curated these databases to ensure they contain representative <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> reference sequences for species (Table S1) or subtypes (Table S2) that have been described to date on NCBI. The current version of the SSU rRNA database (v1.0) contains unique reference genotypes that were selected based on the criteria set out by <xref rid="bb0130" ref-type="bibr">Ruecker et al. (2012)</xref>. To elaborate, each representative sequence contains the polymorphic region within the 613–810 base pair region of <italic>C. parvum</italic> (AF164102.1), measures at least 400 base pairs in length, contains no more than two ambiguities, has a definitive source, and does not contain any cloned PCR products. The <italic>gp60</italic> database contains a representative sequence of all accepted subtypes to date, collected through personal communication with Prof. Lihua Xiao in addition to those described by <xref rid="bb9034" ref-type="bibr">Xiao and Feng (2017)</xref>. These subtypes were chosen to be included in the database as they are complete sequences (the trinucleotide repeat region, repetitive sequence (if applicable), and conserved region are present), contain no ambiguities, and were previously used as a reference sequence in other studies.</p>
          <p id="p0075">If a user wishes to use their own database, a corresponding FASTA (.fa) file must be provided as input. The user can either download the existing CryptoGenotyper database available from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/phac-nml/CryptoGenotyper" id="ir0050">https://github.com/phac-nml/CryptoGenotyper</ext-link> and append any new sequences or create their own database entirely. The tool will build a BLAST database from the sequences in the imported FASTA file and perform any homologous searches against that database. If no database file is inputted, the tool will default to the most current version of the validated database.</p>

        <title>CryptoGenotyper Algorithm</title>
        <p id="p0080">Once all parameters are inputted into the program, the relevant sequencing information is extracted from each .ab1 file. Both the fluorescent channel intensities and Phred quality score for each base location are processed and recorded using the Biopython library functions (<xref rid="bb0065" ref-type="bibr">Cock et al., 2009</xref>). To remove the low-quality bases that inherently exist on the ends of Sanger sequences, both 5′ and 3′ regions are trimmed by scanning the read with a 5-base sliding window and cut when the average Phred quality drops below 20 (99% base call accuracy).</p>

          <p id="p0085">To reflect the heterozygous peaks in the sequence from the chromatogram, the log ratio of intensity (LRi) is calculated for each base location by taking the log base 2 of the quotient of the major fluorescence intensity to the minor fluorescence intensity as described by <xref rid="bb0060" ref-type="bibr">Chang et al. (2012)</xref>. According to <xref rid="bb0060" ref-type="bibr">Chang et al. (2012)</xref>, an LRi value close to zero reflects two heterozygous peaks with similar intensities. We use an LRi cutoff value of 2.0 in the CryptoGenotyper to reflect the minimum cutoff to determine a ‘mixed’ peak based on fluorescent ratios (<xref rid="bb0060" ref-type="bibr">Chang et al., 2012</xref>). Those peaks with LRi values less than or equal to 2.0 are then converted in IUPAC nucleotide code to represent the multiple nucleotides present at that location.</p>
          <p id="p0090">Once the entire sequence is parsed, it is decomposed using the In<italic>d</italic>elligent algorithm (<xref rid="bb0070" ref-type="bibr">Dmitriev and Rakitov, 2008</xref>). This algorithm converts the IUPAC code to two corresponding bases, outputting a major and minor sequence (<xref rid="bb0070" ref-type="bibr">Dmitriev and Rakitov, 2008</xref>). For those bases that were ambiguous to the algorithm, major and minor bases are determined based on the intensities of the fluorescent signals.</p>
          <p id="p0095">The major and minor sequences are then queried using BLAST against the SSU rRNA reference database using the following parameters: word_size = 11, match = 1, mismatch = −2, gap_open = 5, gap_extend = 2. This determines the most possible variances (MPVs), which are then categorized as mixed sequences or indels and the optimal combinations are calculated as described by <xref rid="bb0060" ref-type="bibr">Chang et al. (2012)</xref>.</p>

          <p id="p0100">To determine the <italic>gp60</italic> sequence, the algorithm records the channel with the highest fluorescence at each base location. Afterwards, the <italic>gp60</italic> sequence is divided into two regions: the microsatellite region and the varying region.</p>
          <p id="p0105">The program searches the microsatellite region linearly, using a sliding window of three nucleotides, to determine which repeating trinucleotide sequence is encountered based on an array of previously determined trinucleotide repeat sequences. Once the repeat sequence is determined, the program searches linearly and counts the number of times each repeat appears. Finally, the repeat region is reported in standard notation as described in detail in <xref rid="bb9034" ref-type="bibr">Xiao and Feng (2017)</xref> and illustrated in <xref rid="bb0055" ref-type="bibr">Chalmers et al.

        <title>SSU rRNA</title>
        <p id="p0130">Sequence data from Canada, the United Kingdom and Sweden were used for the development and validation of the CryptoGenotyper tool. To test the SSU rRNA marker on the CryptoGenotyper program, Sanger chromatograms of 456 samples were analyzed on the contig mode setting from various Canadian studies at the National Microbiology Laboratory (NML, Public Health Agency of Canada, Guelph, Ontario, Canada). This includes 175 animal specimens (138 cattle, 22 dogs, 7 cats, 1 pig, 6 snakes and 1 chicken) collected from 2009 to 2011 and 2015 (unpublished), 119 clinical samples collected between 2006 and 2017 (<xref rid="bb0090" ref-type="bibr">Guy et al., 2021</xref>) and 162 water samples collected between 2008 and 2015 (unpublished). These samples were broken down to 275 samples (68 animal, 64 clinical, 143 water) containing single species and 181 samples (107 animal, 55 clinical, 19 water) containing either mixed species or variants (heterogeneous copies) of one species. In total, the single-species SSU rRNA test samples represent 18 distinct species and 9 wildlife genotypes of <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic>, and the mixed SSU rRNA test samples represent 7 different combinations of 2 species and 2 unique double variants of the same species (Table S3).</p>
        <p id="p0135">Additionally, chromatograms from 187 samples genotyped at the National Veterinary Institute (SVA, Uppsala, Sweden) between 2013 and 2020 were inputted into the tool using both forward and reverse sequences for each sample. These samples were collected from several studies (<xref rid="bb0110" ref-type="bibr">Pettersson et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="bb0010" ref-type="bibr">Åberg et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="bb0005" ref-type="bibr">Åberg et al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">Björkman et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="bb0035" ref-type="bibr">Björkman et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="bb0020" ref-type="bibr">Alsmark et al., 2018</xref>; unpublished), outbreak investigations and sporadic cases sent for routine diagnosis. The samples were comprised of 123 cattle, 34 pigs, 20 squirrels, 4 sheep, 2 horses, 2 chital deer and 1 roe deer. In total, the 167 single-species SSU rRNA test samples represent 11 species and genotypes of <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> (Table S3). The remaining 20 samples represent known mixed infections<italic>,</italic> including two different mixed species and one mixed variant (Table S3).</p>
        <p id="p0140">All samples were tested regardless of whether or not species could be determined manually from both forward and reverse sequences in order to test how well the program would deal with poor as well as good quality sequences. To generate the results table, we checked the results manually if the CryptoGenotyper was indicating a result with a bit score less than 400 (indicating suboptimal percent identity and percent coverage values) or had a check manually or no blast hits comment in the Comments header. The remaining automated results were compared against results obtained manually for validation.</p>

The clinical data was comprised of six different species with 32 distinct <italic>gp60</italic> subtypes (15 <italic>C. hominis</italic>, 12 <italic>C. parvum</italic>, 2 <italic>C. ubiquitum</italic>, 1 <italic>C. cuniculus</italic>, 1 <italic>C. meleagridis</italic> and 1 <italic>C. felis</italic>) and the cattle data represented 5 subtypes of <italic>C. parvum</italic>. Of these samples, 36 were tested on the reverse setting only as the forward primer binding site is very close to the microsatellite region, resulting in the initial messy sequence running into the repeat region.</p>
        <p id="p0150">Additionally, chromatograms from 693 samples tested at the Cryptosporidium Reference Unit (CRU, Swansea, UK) between 2018 and 2020, and comprising 52 different <italic>gp60</italic> subtypes (10 <italic>C. hominis</italic>, 40 <italic>C. parvum</italic> and 2 <italic>C. cuniculus</italic>) were tested using the reverse only setting in the program.

Furthermore, the CryptoGenotyper was unable to produce a contig for 3.2% of the samples (14/431), but 92.9% (13/14) of those samples agreed with manual analysis and 7.1% (1/14) were partially misidentified. Altogether, the CryptoGenotyper identified the correct <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> species in 99.3% (428/431) of the sample chromatograms that represented a single species.</p>

For 142 of the mixed samples, the tool accurately identified the mixed species or variants on at least the forward or reverse strand (<xref rid="t0015" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). For one water sample, the CryptoGenotyper detected an incorrect mixed infection of <italic>C. wrairi/C. sp.</italic> W1; this was not detected during manual analysis and could not be confirmed through re-analysis. Furthermore, the tool detected the dominant species in 37 of the samples in addition to outputting a comment that another mixed sequence may be present. Only 4 of these samples could be further resolved with manual analysis as the other 33 samples were suspected to be mixed but could not be resolved manually. Finally, the CryptoGenotyper was unable to produce a contig for one sample and flagged it for manual analysis. This sample corresponded to a chromatogram that was uninterpretable manually due to poor sequence quality. Removing the 33 sample chromatograms with heterozygous peaks that could not be resolved manually and the poor quality sequence, the CryptoGenotyper identified the two correct sequences present, whether from two distinct species or two variants from the same species, for 142/147 (96.6%) mixed specimens that were determined manually.<table-wrap position="float" id="t0015"><label>Table 3</label><caption><p>Validation of mixed SSU rRNA using Canadian and Swedish isolates.</p></caption><alt-text id="al0040">Table 3</alt-text><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Sample origin</th><th>Number samples with mixed sequences</th><th>Number (%) samples with mixed species/genotypes correctly identified on at least one strand</th><th>Number (%) samples with mixed species/genotypes incorrectly identified on at least one strand</th><th>Number (%) samples identified as a single species/genotype</th><th>Number (%) samples with one species/genotype correctly identified</th><th>Number (%) samples with one species/genotype incorrectly identified</th><th>Number (%) samples with one species/genotype correctly identified but second species/genotype further resolved with manual analysis</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td colspan="8">Canada:</td></tr><tr><td>Human</td><td>55</td><td>38 (69.1%)</td><td>0 (0%)</td><td>17 (30.9%)</td><td>13 (76.5%)</td><td>0 (0%)</td><td>4 (23.5%)</td></tr><tr><td>Animal<xref rid="tf0035" ref-type="table-fn">a</xref></td><td>107</td><td>94 (87.9%)</td><td>0 (0%)</td><td>13 (12.1%)</td><td>13 (100%)</td><td>0 (0%)</td><td>0 (0%)</td></tr><tr><td>Water</td><td>18<xref rid="tf0040" ref-type="table-fn">b</xref></td><td>10 (55.6%)</td><td>1 (5.6%)</td><td>7 (38.9%)</td><td>7 (100%)</td><td>0 (0%)</td><td>0 (0%)</td></tr><tr><td colspan="8">  </td></tr><tr><td colspan="8">Sweden:</td></tr><tr><td>Animal<xref rid="tf0045" ref-type="table-fn">c</xref></td><td>20</td><td>12 (60.0%)</td><td>1 (5.0%)</td><td>7 (35.0%)</td><td>5 (71.4%)</td><td>0 (0%)</td><td>2 (28.6%)</td></tr><tr><td>Total:</td><td>200</td><td>154 (77.0%)</td><td>2 (1.0%)</td><td>44 (22.0%)</td><td>38 (86.4%)</td><td>0 (0%)</td><td>6 (13.6%)</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn id="tf0035"><label>a</label><p id="np0035">Animal sample sources from 95 cattle, 2 dogs, 6 cats, 1 pig, 3 snakes.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot><table-wrap-foot><fn id="tf0040"><label>b</label><p id="np0040">1 sample was not typable either by CryptoGenotyper or manually so have been removed from this total.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot><table-wrap-foot><fn id="tf0045"><label>c</label><p id="np0045">Animal sample sources from 7 cattle, 10 squirrels, 2 chital deer, 1 sheep.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></p>

          <p id="p0210">In addition, we evaluated the results of the CryptoGenotyper's mixed SSU rRNA function using 20 Swedish samples that were manually identified to contain mixed species or multiple variants of the same species. For 12 of the 20 samples, the tool accurately identified the mixed species or variants on at least the forward or reverse strand (<xref rid="t0015" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). One of the samples was detected as a mixed infection, but only one of the species was correctly called as the CryptoGenotyper reported a <italic>C.</italic> ferret genotype<italic>/C. hominis</italic> mixed infection; however manual analysis revealed a <italic>C.</italic> ferret genotype<italic>/C.</italic> chipmunk genotype I infection. In the remaining seven samples, the tool detected one correct species and one of those samples was flagged as a potential mix for further manual analysis. For five of the samples where one species was correctly determined, the manual analysis was aided by complementary <italic>gp60</italic> analysis confirming a low grade mix, although the heterozygous peaks were not clear. Hence, since the manual analysis of the SSU rRNA marker alone could not identify the mixed infection, we conclude the CryptoGenotyper correctly identified 12/15 (80.0%) of the Swedish samples with mixed species compared to the manual analysis.</p>

The CryptoGenotyper reported 77.0% (154/200) of the mixed sequences correctly at one or both strands (<xref rid="t0015" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). However, the tool gave an incorrect mixed result for 1.0% (2/200) of the samples.

Of the remaining 38 samples where a single species was determined but could not be further resolved through manual analysis, 33 were suspected to be mixed when analyzed manually, but the two individual sequences could not be identified. In addition, 5 of those samples were determined to have mixed species through <italic>gp60</italic> analysis but heterozygous peaks were not visible by manual inspection. Excluding these 38 samples where two species could not be identified in the chromatograms manually, the CryptoGenotyper determined the correct mixed species or variants in 95.1% (154/162) of mixed chromatograms that were decipherable through manual analysis, with 1.2% (2/162) reported in error.</p>

    <title>Discussion</title>
    <p id="p0240">Obtaining usable results for all genotyping and sub-genotyping experiments of <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> is critical for fully understanding how this pathogen is transmitted. The CryptoGenotyper program automatically and consistently alleviates many of the difficulties encountered when analyzing <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> sequences: obtaining reproducible and accurate results in a timely manner, detecting and distinguishing between mixed variants of the same species and mixed infections, and reporting results in standard nomenclature.</p>
    <p id="p0245">The main benefit to utilizing the CryptoGenotyper during Sanger sequence analysis is obtaining accurate and complete results. This tool uses a high quality, manually curated reference database for molecular characterization, removing the potential for misclassifying or misnaming of the species due to errors in the public databases, a common human error when analyzing <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> sequences. Combined with the ability to analyze large datasets more efficiently, the results are reported in a timelier manner and with less systematic biases compared to manual analysis. To ensure accuracy and consistent results are obtained with the CryptoGenotyper, the tool was evaluated and fine-tuned using a comprehensive and diverse dataset that included Sanger sequencing chromatograms from laboratories in three different countries.</p>
    <p id="p0250">From the final evaluation of the CryptoGenotyper's performance on the SSU rRNA gene target, the tool correctly identified 99.3% of the chromatograms inputted that contained single peaks. For the remaining 0.7% of samples, the CryptoGenotyper outputted partially incorrect results as two species or two variants of the same species were identified but only one of species or variants could be verified manually. These partially incorrect results could be a result of the tool detecting peaks just above the background noise that is not discernable through manual analysis. Of the 99.3% samples that were correctly identified, the CryptoGenotyper was unable to produce a contig for 3.2% of those samples. The main reason why the tool was unable to produce a contig is due to an uninterpretable chromatogram for one of the strands being inputted. When the tool encounters this situation, both forward and reverse strands are analyzed separately, giving the results for a single direction despite contig mode being selected. For all cases, the result in the single direction corresponded to the manual findings obtained.</p>
    <p id="p0255">Further to the SSU rRNA gene target analysis, one of the most common issues in analyzing this target for <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> is the presence of heterozygous peaks within the chromatogram. This is usually the result of multiple sequences overlapping due to either a mixed infection of two or more species or the presence of variant copies of the gene in the genome of the infecting species (<xref rid="f0025" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>) (<xref rid="bb0155" ref-type="bibr">Xiao et al., 1999</xref>). It has been reported that mixed <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> samples are not uncommon (<xref rid="f0025" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>A) (<xref rid="bb0045" ref-type="bibr">Cama et al., 2006</xref>) and variant copies of the SSU rRNA gene in a single isolate have been reported, such as TGA polymorphisms between Type A <italic>C. parvum</italic> and Type B <italic>C. parvum</italic> (<xref rid="f0025" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>B) (<xref rid="bb0050" ref-type="bibr">Carraway et al., 1995</xref>; <xref rid="bb0085" ref-type="bibr">Gharieb et al., 2019</xref>), a thymine insertion between Type A <italic>C. andersoni</italic> and Type B <italic>C. andersoni</italic> (<xref rid="bb0095" ref-type="bibr">Ikarashi et al., 2013</xref>), and varying number of thymines (6, 8, 10, 11) in the poly-T repeat region in <italic>C. hominis</italic> (<xref rid="f0025" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>C) (<xref rid="bb0155" ref-type="bibr">Xiao et al., 1999</xref>; <xref rid="bb0145" ref-type="bibr">Sulaiman et al., 2001</xref>). Fortunately, the CryptoGenotyper is programmed to differentiate the sequence populations and identify up to two mixed sequences within a chromatogram, if present.<fig id="f0025"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption><p>Heterozygous peaks due to Mixed SSU rRNA populations.</p><p>Overlapping peaks are present throughout the SSU rRNA region, indicating mixed populations.

    <p id="p0260">When the CryptoGenotyper was given chromatograms representing mixed species or mixed variants of the same species, it correctly determined the two sequences in the chromatograms for 95.1% of samples. Of this testing dataset, only 1.2% had the second species called in error with the dominant species called correctly. Furthermore, 33 additional samples with chromatograms containing heterozygous peaks in which the second species or variant could not be deciphered manually were inputted into the CryptoGenotyper. Similarly to the manual analysis results, the tool was unable to determine the second species or variant causing the heterozygous peaks; however, it still outputted the correct dominant species along with a comment indicating manual analysis is required as a second species or variant may be present. Manually reading mixed chromatograms is not straightforward and requires experience, thus the CryptoGenotyper was valuable in identifying mixed samples that may have been misinterpreted. The tool's ability to decipher heterozygous peaks was especially beneficial in samples from impacted waters where a diversity of different species and wildlife genotypes are found.</p>
    <p id="p0265">The performance of the CryptoGenotyper on the <italic>gp60</italic> gene target was similar to the SSU rRNA gene target. In this case however, the tool was only designed to report the dominant subtype as it is less common to obtain mixed sequences with this gene target. Overall, the CryptoGenotyper reported the correct result for 95.6% of samples with 100% accuracy. The remaining 4.4% of samples were further resolved through manual analysis. For the majority of these cases, the CryptoGenotyper failed to report the full subtype due to either a sequencing artifact present or peak(s) with Phred quality less than 20 within the repeat region. Often, the beginning of the repeat region on the forward strand has poor quality due to the forward primer binding site being very close to this microsatellite region. If the CryptoGenotyper encounters these scenarios, it will fail to provide a complete subtype and will identify the sample for manual analysis to ensure accurate results are produced.</p>
    <p id="p0270">It is important to note the limitations of the program. First, the CryptoGenotyper relies heavily on an accurate and well-curated database. It is important to regularly update the database to ensure the most accurate results are being reported. The CryptoGenotyper's databases are planned to be updated as new information becomes available, though users are able to upload their own updated databases if desired. Furthermore, Sanger sequencing data may not be reflecting all the populations within the sample, but rather the species for which the primers have best affinity to or the one or few most popular alleles (<xref rid="bb0105" ref-type="bibr">Morris et al., 2019</xref>). There is strong evidence that sub-populations of <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> can be present within individual hosts due to genetic re-assortment during the sexual phase of the life cycle (<xref rid="bb0105" ref-type="bibr">Morris et al., 2019</xref>). It was demonstrated that Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) is more effective at identifying and resolving multiple populations within a sample (<xref rid="bb0170" ref-type="bibr">Zahedi et al., 2017</xref>). However, these methods are not commonly used due to costs and the inability to extract sufficient high quality DNA. Therefore, this program provides an immediate solution to resolve most Sanger chromatograms that show mixed populations within the data. However, it is important to note that due to the algorithm implemented, only two sequences can be resolved within a single chromatogram. The primary limitation of the program is poor quality chromatograms, as the program is unable to decipher these and will instead inform the user to perform a manual check. To ensure the CryptoGenotyper could handle poor quality data, a subset of samples that could not be genotyped manually due to failed sequencing or messy chromatogram were included in both the SSU rRNA and <italic>gp60</italic> gene target datasets. For all cases, the tools failed to genotype the samples and outputted a comment to check the sample manually. It was important to test poor quality data as one of the powers of the program is to process samples without prior screening of the chromatograms. Furthermore, it is critical for the user to check the comments section of the final results file outputted by the tool as the CryptoGenotyper was designed to output a message if it encountered something unfamiliar, or suspected there are mixed sequences it cannot resolve, or a bad quality chromatogram was inputted to ensure accurate results. Most importantly, if the CryptoGenotyper encounters a novel genotype that is not described in its database, the tool will output a message indicating no significant hits were found and that manual analysis is required. However, if a novel <italic>gp60</italic> family were to be inputted, the CryptoGenotyper will misclassify the sequence to that of its most closely related family due to high sequence similarities between <italic>gp60</italic> families. Though if the percent identity of this match is below 99.1%, the tool will flag the sample and output a message for the user to check manually as this may be indicative that a new <italic>gp60</italic> family has been identified. This further demonstrates the importance for the user to analyze the results file thoroughly.</p>

    <title>Conclusion</title>
    <p id="p0275">We have developed a freely available and user-friendly tool, called the CryptoGenotyper, to help <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> research groups analyze their Sanger sequencing results and triage complex samples for further manual processing. The CryptoGenotyper resolves heterozygous peaks and uses reputable reference alignments to characterize the genotype and subgenotype based on the SSU rRNA or <italic>gp60</italic> locus, respectively, in the presence of mixed infections or artifacts from the sequencing itself.</p>
    <p id="p0280">Evaluating the CryptoGenotyper in three independent laboratories demonstrated that the tool correctly classified 99.3% (428/431) of SSU rRNA chromatograms with a single species present and 95.1% (154/162) with mixed species or variants identified. For the single species analysis, 0.7% (3/431) of samples were partially incorrectly called as mixed variants or species when only one species could be determined through manual analysis for these samples. For the mixed species or variants of the same species analysis, 3.7% (6/162) of the samples could be further resolved with manual analysis and the tool misidentified 1.2% (2/162) of the mixed species in the entire testing dataset. For the <italic>gp60</italic> gene target, the tool accurately subtyped 95.6% (947/991) of <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> positive samples, with 44/991 (4.4%) of samples being further resolved with manual analysis, and none misclassified.</p>
    <p id="p0285">With the ability to accurately identify genotypes (SSU rRNA) and subtypes (<italic>gp60</italic>) in Sanger sequencing chromatograms, the CryptoGenotyper will provide further insights into the transmission dynamics of <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> as valuable data is recovered in a fast and reproducible way. Our tool will be useful for high throughput processing for labs with minimal bioinformatics expertise thanks to web-based accessibility options through the publicly accessible Galaxy server. Future developments will include the addition of analyzing other gene targets that could further aid in rapid identification and subtyping future <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> infections.</p>

    <p id="p0310">The authors would like to thank Prof. Rachel Chalmers at the Cryptosporidium Reference Unit, Swansea, for allowing the use of the UK isolate data in the evaluation. We would also like to thank Laura Martin at the National Microbiology Laboratory in Guelph for helping to develop the SSU rRNA reference database and Prof. Lihao Xiao for sharing his <italic>gp60</italic> reference database. We thank Prof. Jessica Kissinger and Dr. Susanne Warrenfeltz of the University of Georgia for evaluating the CryptoGenotyper for potentially hosting the tool on the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://CryptoDB.org" id="ir0075">CryptoDB.org</ext-link> Galaxy instance. Finally, we would like to thank Stephanie Murphy for testing the initial versions of the CryptoGenotyper during early development.
