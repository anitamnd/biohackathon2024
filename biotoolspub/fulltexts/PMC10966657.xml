      <p>Most online chemical reaction databases are not publicly
accessible
or are fully downloadable. These databases tend to contain reactions
in noncanonicalized formats and often lack comprehensive information
regarding reaction pathways, intermediates, and byproducts. Within
the few publicly available databases, reactions are typically stored
in the form of unbalanced, overall transformations with minimal interpretability
of the underlying chemistry. These limitations present significant
obstacles to data-driven applications including the development of
machine learning models. As an effort to overcome these challenges,
we introduce PMechDB, a publicly accessible platform designed to curate,
aggregate, and share polar chemical reaction data in the form of elementary
reaction steps. Our initial version of PMechDB consists of over 100,000
such steps. In the PMechDB, all reactions are stored as canonicalized
and balanced elementary steps, featuring accurate atom mapping and
arrow-pushing mechanisms. As an online interactive database, PMechDB
provides multiple interfaces that enable users to search, download,
and upload chemical reactions. We anticipate that the public availability
of PMechDB and its standardized data representation will prove beneficial
for chemoinformatics research and education and the development of
data-driven, interpretable models for predicting reactions and pathways.

    <title>Introduction</title>
    <p>The polar mechanism represents the most
prevalent type of mechanism
in organic and organometallic chemistry. These reactions are characterized
by heterolytic bond cleavage and the formation of charged intermediates.
Owing to the high reactivity of polar reactants, many such reactions
can take place under standard and physiological conditions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>−<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref></sup> Consequently, polar reactions are a subject of considerable interest
and are widely employed in the fields of organic, inorganic, organometallic,
biological, and environmental chemistry.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref></sup> As an illustration
of their significance, the field of organocatalysis, acknowledged
by the 2021 Nobel Prize in chemistry, is strongly dependent on polar
mechanistic steps. Organocatalysis is used in medicinal chemistry<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref></sup> and has been employed in the industrial production
of pharmaceuticals.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref></sup></p>
    <p>Machine learning
methods, and particularly deep learning, are increasingly
playing a central role in science and technology.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref></sup> In the domain of chemistry, considerable efforts have been
made to develop computer models that can automate tasks such as drug
discovery, organic synthesis, and molecular property predictions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>−<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref></sup> Data-driven machine learning techniques necessitate vast chemical
datasets for training, yet most of the currently available reaction
databases are either not readily accessible,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref></sup> or contain noisy and incomplete data, as well as inaccurate or unlabeled
information. These limitations make it challenging to train robust
and accurate predictive data-driven models for chemoinformatics reaction
problems. To partially address such limitations, we introduce PMechDB,
a comprehensive and extensible database containing over 12,000 elementary
polar reaction steps that have been manually curated. Additionally,
the database contains more than 90,000 polar reactions generated through
combinatorial methods using nucleophiles and electrophiles extracted
from the Mayr-Ofial database. The reactions encompassed in PMechDB
are manually curated and incorporate accurate reactive atom mappings,
balanced reactants and products, intermediates, side products, and
arrow-pushing mechanisms. This database is publicly available and
is hosted on a web server through the DeepRXN Web site at <uri xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://deeprxn.ics.uci.edu/pmechdb">https://deeprxn.ics.uci.edu/pmechdb</uri>. The Web site provides an interactive user interface that allows
for searching specific reactions, filtering reactions based on their
classification, displaying corresponding arrow-pushing mechanisms,
downloading the current dataset, and uploading novel elementary reaction
steps. The Web site allows users to draw individual elementary step
mechanisms or provide csv files to upload many elementary step mechanisms
concurrently. We emphasize the importance of dependable, accurately
annotated, and readily expandable datasets for effectively training
machine learning models in the field of chemistry. So, we invite users
to contribute additional reactions to the PMechDB database, which
will be curated, cleaned, and scrutinized by the PMechDB team of organic
chemists. If deemed satisfactory, the reactions will be aggregated
into the dataset, further enhancing its scope and reliability.</p>

      <title>Reaction Representation: Overall Transformation vs Elementary
Steps</title>
      <p>Overall transformations are popular and simple ways
for organic chemists to represent a reaction. This representation
consists of a set of reactant molecules that, when added together,
form a set of product molecules, usually focusing on a single target,
as seen in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref></xref>. This representation contains no information about intermediate
states or the stepwise mechanism of the reaction. Although this approach
clearly describes the reactants and the products of a reaction, the
limited amount of information makes it difficult for chemists to use
these representations to reason about how the reaction proceeded or
what the underlying driving forces were.</p>

          <p>Robinson annulation is
an important ring-forming reaction used
by organic chemists. This is an example of a total transformation
approach to representing the reaction. The final product is predicted
from the reactants without any intermediate states or mechanistic
steps.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref></sup></p>

      </fig>
      <p>The elementary step approach is a more complex
representation that
breaks the overall chemical transformations into a series of elementary
steps, as seen in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>. Each of these elementary mechanistic steps involves a single
transition state. This series of elementary steps can then be concatenated
together to represent the overall chemical transformation. By breaking
reactions down into smaller mechanistic steps, organic chemists can
gain insights into how these reactants will combine to form the resulting
products and why they may combine in the way they do.</p>

      <title>Existing datasets of Elementary Reaction Steps</title>
      <p>Existing
databases, including Open Reaction Database (ORD), REAXYS, and SciFinder,
have millions of reactions with information on reactants, products,
conditions, and yields, but they only present reactions as overall
transformations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref></sup> Although AI models can
learn from these data to predict chemical transformations and assist
synthetic chemists, they do not offer much insights into the underlying
mechanisms of chemical transformations. The PMechDB database, on the
other hand, enables the training of models to predict arrow-pushing
mechanisms involved in retrosynthetic planning, which offers a unique
perspective on chemical reaction training data.</p>
      <p>The most similar
known database to PMechDB is the Radical Mechanistic Database.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref></sup> RMechDB is a publicly accessible database of
5500 elementary radical reaction steps which contains an interactive
web interface for searching, downloading, and uploading the reactions.
These elementary step radical reactions were manually curated by expert
chemists from organic chemistry textbooks and atmospheric literature,
including research articles and publications related to gas-phase
radical processes. These elementary step reactions have been shown
to enable the training and development of radical reaction predictors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref></sup> Although this dataset is similar to PMechDB
in structure, it is entirely composed of radical reaction steps, while
PMechDB consists of polar reaction steps. Polar reactions are used
everywhere in organic chemistry, and understanding these mechanisms
is fundamental to developing ML models that are useful to synthetic
chemists. Additionally, PMechDB contains significantly more reactions
than RMechDB (∼100,000 compared to ∼5500) and includes
updates to the interactive web interface.</p>
      <p>To our knowledge,
the only other database of reaction mechanisms
is supported by reaction mechanism generator (RMG).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref></sup> RMG is a quantitative approach to predict mechanistic pathways
by (a) evaluating the rate constants of the possible competing elementary
steps of the reaction; (b) determining the rate ratio of the steps
by plugging in concentrations of the reactants into the rate law of
each elementary step.</p>
      <p>For thermochemical calculations, the RMG
mainly uses Benson group
increment theory (BGIT).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref></sup> However, since
the BGIT fails to properly describe ring strains and noncovalent interactions,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>−<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref></sup> for cyclic species, RMG carries out geometry optimization with molecular
mechanics and subsequent single-point calculation with advanced quantum
mechanical methods to derive the necessary thermodynamic parameters.
To approximate kinetic parameters, RMG generates reaction pathways
using a predetermined and extensible set of reaction families and
assumes that reactions between similar reacting sites in a family
will have similar rates.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref></sup> The original
RMG database focuses on constructing mechanisms for mainly radical
reactions with species involving carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, sulfur,
and nitrogen.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref></sup></p>
      <p>Our work aims to
create a database that better represents typical
polar reaction mechanisms found in organic chemistry research. Rather
than focusing on a limited group of reactions with quantitatively
estimated rate constants, our database represents feasible and manually
verified polar reactions found in organic chemistry textbooks and
the organic chemistry literature. Our hope is that by training on
a dataset of elementary steps found in literature, AI models can be
trained to predict arrow-pushing mechanisms for reactions that are
more relevant to retrosynthetic planning.</p>

    <title>PMechDB: Underlying Dataset</title>
    <sec id="sec3.1">
      <title>Manually Curated Dataset</title>
      <p>The primary dataset comprises
12,799 SMIRKS, each accompanied by an electron flow specification
conveyed by curved arrows (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref></xref>). Each SMIRK represents a plausible elementary reaction
step that corresponds to a single transition state that can be portrayed
through Lewis structures and curved arrows. It should be noted, however,
that applying curved arrows to nontraditional bonds, such as hydrogen
bonds, dative bonds, or molecular interaction representations depicted
through dotted/dashed lines, can lead to incorrect formal atomic charges.
To avoid such inaccuracies, and maintain consistency with the arrow-pushing
convention, the dataset employs widely accepted, one-step curved arrow
representations of some processes that are known to involve noncovalent
intermediates such as example proton transfers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref></sup> and <italic>S</italic><sub><italic>N</italic></sub>2 displacements.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref></sup> About 4% of the entries are resonance interconversions, but it is
worth noting that these resonance steps do not possess a transition
state. To the best of our knowledge, curved arrow mechanistic steps
are not used to reveal temperature effects, concentration effects,
implicit solvents, or roles of spectator species. The use of Lewis
structures and arrow-pushing is considered to be a valuable compromise
between generality and trainability versus precise chemical accuracy.
Before adding any of these mechanisms to the PMechDB dataset, our
organic chemistry team manually looked through each mechanism and
deemed these steps as both plausible and elementary.</p>

      <p>The dataset originated with 2989 polar reaction
steps derived using
Reaction Explorer, a rule-based system,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref></sup> and it was later expanded to 5551 polar reaction steps to train
reaction predictor.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref></sup> To add these additional
polar reactions, the reaction explorer was expanded to include more
atom types such as sulfur, phosphorus, and magnesium, and reactions
were manually curated from graduate-level textbooks to improve the
coverage of the dataset and introduce novel reaction types.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref></sup> Subsequently, the existing dataset underwent
a curation process to eliminate redundant entries and steps deemed
impractical under standard laboratory conditions (e.g., &lt;150 °C).
Eventually, the dataset was expanded to over 12,000 entries through
a series of iterative training and testing cycles of reaction predictors.
Additional elementary reaction steps were sourced from undergraduate-
and graduate-level organic chemistry course material, research presentations,
and primary research literature. Any gaps in training were identified
based on the presence of implausible steps in the top-ranked predictions.</p>
      <p>A major challenge in developing the PMechDB was determining the
plausibility of single-step mechanisms. In many cases, spectroscopic
techniques such as mass spectrometry, NMR, and IR can be employed
to describe published products. As a result, organic transformations
in databases such as REAXYS, SciFinder, and ORD can be readily confirmed.
However, validating mechanistic steps that involve a single transition
state is a more challenging. Typically, electronic structure computations
or time-consuming experimental techniques, including chemical kinetics,
isotopic labeling, and crossover experiments, are necessary for experimental
verification of a mechanistic step. It is often stated that mechanisms
can be refuted but never proven. To assist scientists in constructing
mechanistic pathways and predicting the outcomes of organic reactions,
we aimed to develop a dataset containing plausible fundamental reaction
steps from an organic chemist’s perspective.</p>
      <p>In PMechDB,
the plausibility of a mechanistic step is evaluated
subjectively by our organic chemistry team based on its likelihood
of occurrence. In instances where multiple pathways have been proposed
in the literature, and there is discordance between them, it is recommended
to incorporate steps from all potential pathways into the dataset.
This approach ensures that any suggested pathway utilizing the data
reflects the uncertainty present in the literature.</p>
      <p>To further
organize the data, each mechanism was classified by
an orbital interaction pair. Based on a system with three types of
filled orbitals interacting with three types of unfilled orbitals,
there are nine (3 × 3) categories of elementary arrow-pushing
steps as seen in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref></xref>.</p>

      <p>The complexity of molecular species in the core
dataset of PMechDB
ranges from simple species like those in RMG to structurally complex
molecules found in ORD, REAXYS, and SciFinder. It is not uncommon
for a curved arrow depiction of an elementary reaction step to involve
chains of frontier orbital interactions. For example, the enolization
depicted in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref></xref> represents three sequential types of orbital interactions: (1) donation
of <italic>n</italic><sub>N</sub> into π<sub>CO</sub>*, (2)
donation of π<sub>CO</sub> into σ<sub>HC</sub>*, and (3)
donation of σ<sub>HC</sub> into π<sub>CO<sup>+</sup></sub><sup>*</sup>. Orbital interactions (1) and (3) represent intramolecular
arrows, while orbital interaction (2) represents an intermolecular
arrow. To classify each reaction, we use the intermolecular orbital
interaction; therefore, the example above would be classified according
to the blue arrow as a pi_sigma* reaction.</p>

      <title>Combinatorial Elementary Steps Based on the Mayr Nucleophiles
and Electrophiles</title>
      <p>To supplement the core set of over 12,000
highly diverse polar steps, polar reaction steps were assembled from
combinatorial pairs of electrophiles and nucleophiles from the data
in the Mayr-Ofial database of nucleophilicity (<italic>N</italic>, <italic>s</italic><sub>N</sub>) and electrophilicity parameters (<italic>E</italic>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">32</xref></sup> For nucleophiles with multiple
entries in different solvents, only a single entry was chosen, but
parameters determined in protic solvents were excluded. Hindered electrophiles
and nucleophiles with steric dependences were excluded. Some hard
anionic nucleophiles such as acetate, benzoate, <italic>p</italic>-nitrobenzoate, 3,5-dinitrobenzoate, DMSO (O attack), and methyl
carbonate were excluded. 853 (out of 1254) Mayr nucleophiles and 313
(out of 352) Mayr electrophiles were selected leading to 257,712 nucleophile–electrophile
combinations. For five-star reference electrophiles and nucleophiles,
the diffusion limit, <italic>s</italic><sub>N</sub>(<italic>N</italic> + <italic>E</italic>) provides a good approximation of log  <italic>k</italic><sub>20°C</sub> but the equation is less accurate
for other entries.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34">34</xref></sup> In total, 96,558 nucleophile–electrophile
combinations with <italic>s</italic><sub>N</sub>(<italic>N</italic> + <italic>E</italic>) ≥ 3 were translated into mapped SMIRKS
with electron flow specification. One thousand of the least reactive
combinations were manually checked to confirm plausibility. <italic>S</italic><sub><italic>N</italic></sub>2 reactions are of seminal
importance in organic chemistry, but iconic sp<sup>3</sup> electrophiles,

      <title>Train and Test Splits</title>
      <p>PMechDB is primarily designed
to serve as a reliable source of training and evaluation data for
the development of machine learning models. Standard splits of training
and evaluation data are provided to facilitate the development and
comparison of these models. We offer standard data splits for both
manually curated and combinatorial mechanistic reactions. For manually
curated mechanistic reactions, we have compiled a set of 300 challenging
reactions meticulously selected by expert chemists. These reactions
are intended to assess the generalization capabilities of machine
learning models for large and complex reaction systems. We refer to
this test dataset as the challenging test split. For the combinatorial
dataset, we offer two standard train and test splits. First, a 90/10
split with a training set containing 86,303 reactions and a test set
containing 9585 reactions. The test reactions are sampled in such
a way that they contain the same proportion of the nine reaction classes
as the training set (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref></xref>). This train and test split enables the evaluation of the
performance of predictive models across each of the nine polar reaction
classes. However, due to the nature of the combinatorial data, many
of the reacting electrophiles and I have nucleophiles obtained from
the Mayr reactivity table that may appear in both the train and the
test sets. Therefore, a second split is constructed by initially partitioning
the reacting electrophiles and nucleophiles into train and test sets
and then performing the combinatorial generation. This train and test
split is designed to minimize the overlap of reacting functional groups
between the train and test data. Thus, this split enables the evaluation
of the generalization capability of predictive models for unseen reacting
groups. As the electrophiles and nucleophiles are split, the total
number of combinatorial reactions in the second split is smaller,
resulting in a total of 54,048 train reactions with 6093 test reactions.
Our preliminary experiments indicate that achieving high test performance
on the second split is more challenging, yet models trained on this
split demonstrate greater generalization capability and less overfitting.
The structure of PMechDB, along with the train and test data splits,
is illustrated in <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref></xref>.

      <title>Database Schema</title>
      <p>The database is implemented using the
PostgreSQL<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref35">35</xref></sup> database management system,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref36">36</xref></sup> to store, query, and retrieve reaction instances
both efficiently and safely. We use OpenEye Scientific Software<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref37">37</xref></sup> toolkits OEChem,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref38">38</xref></sup> and OEDepict<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref39">39</xref></sup> for chemoinformatics processing
and depiction. In addition, we use Chemaxon Marvin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref40">40</xref></sup> for displaying and characterizing chemical structures,
substructures, and steps with their corresponding arrow-pushing mechanisms.</p>
      <p>The PMechDB database schema comprises three fundamental models:
(1) Reaction, (2) Molecule, and (3) Atom. The inter- and intraintegration
of these three models allow for fast and efficient reaction search
and retrieval. As the naming suggests, each elementary step is stored
as an instance of the reaction model which comes with several descriptive
fields. These fields are designed to uniquely represent an elementary
step reaction and all of the available metadata associated with it.
Here, we list the main fields of the reaction model.<list id="list1" list-type="simple"><list-item><label>1.</label><p><bold>Reaction ID:</bold> Each reaction
is associated with a unique ID number.</p></list-item><list-item><label>2.</label><p><bold>Canonicalized atom mapped SMILES
of the reactants:</bold> The reactant molecules are represented by
SMILES strings, with the inclusion of integer labels denoting the
atoms involved in the reaction. A standardized labeling convention
is employed, whereby the participating atoms located in the nucleophile
component are assigned labels commencing at 10 and sequentially increasing
by one for each subsequent atom, while the participating atoms located
in the electrophile component are assigned labels commencing at 20
and also sequentially increasing by one for each subsequent atom.</p></list-item><list-item><label>3.</label><p><bold>Canonicalized atom
mapped SMILES
of the products:</bold> The unique SMILES representation of the product
molecules generated from the reactive reactants with atom mappings.</p></list-item><list-item><label>4.</label><p><bold>Canonicalized arrow
codes:</bold> The standard codes for arrow pushing mechanisms contain
the integer
labels of the participating atoms on the reactants side. The standard
arrow codes begin from the integer label (starting at 10) on the nucleophilic
group.</p></list-item><list-item><label>5.</label><p><bold>Spectator
molecules:</bold> The
unique SMILES representation of the molecules that are present in
the reaction but not participating in the electron transfer.</p></list-item><list-item><label>6.</label><p><bold>Source:</bold> The
SMILES string
of the reactant molecule with the source (nucleophilic) reactive atom
marked.</p></list-item><list-item><label>7.</label><p><bold>Sink:</bold> The SMILES string
of the reactant molecule with the sink (electrophilic) reactive atom

pair class belonging to the nine categories of orbital
interaction outlined in the <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.jcim.3c01810/suppl_file/ci3c01810_si_001.pdf">Supporting Information</ext-link>.</p></list-item><list-item><label>10.</label><p><bold>Date of Insertion:</bold> The
date and time when the reaction was inserted into the database.</p></list-item></list></p>
      <p>Given the fields associated with the Reaction model,
an instance
of this model in PMechDB can be uniquely retrieved from the database
using either the <bold>Reaction ID</bold> or the combined properties
2–5 as the key.</p>
      <p>The Molecule model has three fields corresponding
to the unique
molecule ID, canonicalized SMILES string of the molecule, and the
OEChem MolBase object.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref38">38</xref></sup> An instance of
the Molecule model has a many-to-many relation with the reactant molecules,
product molecules, and spectator molecules fields of the reaction
model.</p>
      <p>The Atom model has five fields corresponding to the unique
ID,
canonicalized atom mapped SMILES string of the parent molecule, a
boolean for if the atom can act as a source, a boolean for if the
atom can act as a sink, and the OEChem AtomBase object.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref38">38</xref></sup> An instance of the Atom model has a many-to-many

the other atoms are not labeled. The platform displays all elementary
steps in its database where the labeled atom acts as one of the two

is separated by the “.” character, and reactants and
products are separated by the “≫” character.
The same search rules apply as mentioned in the molecule search section

    <title>Conclusions</title>
    <p>PMechDB is a new platform for curating
and sharing polar chemical
reaction data. This platform addresses the limitations of existing
databases by storing reactions in the form of canonicalized and balanced
elementary steps with accurate atom mapping and arrow-pushing mechanisms.
PMechDB contains over 100,000 elementary step reactions and is publicly
accessible through its web interface. We postulate that this standardized
representation and support for the public availability of reliable
data will benefit research in chemoinformatics and the development
of data-driven and predictive models. A database of elementary reaction
steps can also be used in chemical education in different ways, for
instance in combination with interactive tools for learning chemical
reactions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref45">45</xref></sup> PMechDB is a significant step
toward improving the accessibility and usability of chemical reaction
data, and we hope that it will inspire further developments in this
field.</p>

      <p>Most online chemical reaction databases are not publicly
accessible
or are fully downloadable. These databases tend to contain reactions
in noncanonicalized formats and often lack comprehensive information
regarding reaction pathways, intermediates, and byproducts. Within
the few publicly available databases, reactions are typically stored
in the form of unbalanced, overall transformations with minimal interpretability
of the underlying chemistry. These limitations present significant
obstacles to data-driven applications including the development of
machine learning models. As an effort to overcome these challenges,
we introduce PMechDB, a publicly accessible platform designed to curate,
aggregate, and share polar chemical reaction data in the form of elementary
reaction steps. Our initial version of PMechDB consists of over 100,000
such steps. In the PMechDB, all reactions are stored as canonicalized
and balanced elementary steps, featuring accurate atom mapping and
arrow-pushing mechanisms. As an online interactive database, PMechDB
provides multiple interfaces that enable users to search, download,
and upload chemical reactions. We anticipate that the public availability
of PMechDB and its standardized data representation will prove beneficial
for chemoinformatics research and education and the development of
data-driven, interpretable models for predicting reactions and pathways.

    <title>Introduction</title>
    <p>The polar mechanism represents the most
prevalent type of mechanism
in organic and organometallic chemistry. These reactions are characterized
by heterolytic bond cleavage and the formation of charged intermediates.
Owing to the high reactivity of polar reactants, many such reactions
can take place under standard and physiological conditions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>−<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref></sup> Consequently, polar reactions are a subject of considerable interest
and are widely employed in the fields of organic, inorganic, organometallic,
biological, and environmental chemistry.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref></sup> As an illustration
of their significance, the field of organocatalysis, acknowledged
by the 2021 Nobel Prize in chemistry, is strongly dependent on polar
mechanistic steps. Organocatalysis is used in medicinal chemistry<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref></sup> and has been employed in the industrial production
of pharmaceuticals.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref></sup></p>
    <p>Machine learning
methods, and particularly deep learning, are increasingly
playing a central role in science and technology.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref></sup> In the domain of chemistry, considerable efforts have been
made to develop computer models that can automate tasks such as drug
discovery, organic synthesis, and molecular property predictions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>−<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref></sup> Data-driven machine learning techniques necessitate vast chemical
datasets for training, yet most of the currently available reaction
databases are either not readily accessible,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref></sup> or contain noisy and incomplete data, as well as inaccurate or unlabeled
information. These limitations make it challenging to train robust
and accurate predictive data-driven models for chemoinformatics reaction
problems. To partially address such limitations, we introduce PMechDB,
a comprehensive and extensible database containing over 12,000 elementary
polar reaction steps that have been manually curated. Additionally,
the database contains more than 90,000 polar reactions generated through
combinatorial methods using nucleophiles and electrophiles extracted
from the Mayr-Ofial database. The reactions encompassed in PMechDB
are manually curated and incorporate accurate reactive atom mappings,
balanced reactants and products, intermediates, side products, and
arrow-pushing mechanisms. This database is publicly available and
is hosted on a web server through the DeepRXN Web site at <uri xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://deeprxn.ics.uci.edu/pmechdb">https://deeprxn.ics.uci.edu/pmechdb</uri>. The Web site provides an interactive user interface that allows
for searching specific reactions, filtering reactions based on their
classification, displaying corresponding arrow-pushing mechanisms,
downloading the current dataset, and uploading novel elementary reaction
steps. The Web site allows users to draw individual elementary step
mechanisms or provide csv files to upload many elementary step mechanisms
concurrently. We emphasize the importance of dependable, accurately
annotated, and readily expandable datasets for effectively training
machine learning models in the field of chemistry. So, we invite users
to contribute additional reactions to the PMechDB database, which
will be curated, cleaned, and scrutinized by the PMechDB team of organic
chemists. If deemed satisfactory, the reactions will be aggregated
into the dataset, further enhancing its scope and reliability.</p>

      <title>Reaction Representation: Overall Transformation vs Elementary
Steps</title>
      <p>Overall transformations are popular and simple ways
for organic chemists to represent a reaction. This representation
consists of a set of reactant molecules that, when added together,
form a set of product molecules, usually focusing on a single target,
as seen in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref></xref>. This representation contains no information about intermediate
states or the stepwise mechanism of the reaction. Although this approach
clearly describes the reactants and the products of a reaction, the
limited amount of information makes it difficult for chemists to use
these representations to reason about how the reaction proceeded or
what the underlying driving forces were.</p>

          <p>Robinson annulation is
an important ring-forming reaction used
by organic chemists. This is an example of a total transformation
approach to representing the reaction. The final product is predicted
from the reactants without any intermediate states or mechanistic
steps.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref></sup></p>

      </fig>
      <p>The elementary step approach is a more complex
representation that
breaks the overall chemical transformations into a series of elementary
steps, as seen in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>. Each of these elementary mechanistic steps involves a single
transition state. This series of elementary steps can then be concatenated
together to represent the overall chemical transformation. By breaking
reactions down into smaller mechanistic steps, organic chemists can
gain insights into how these reactants will combine to form the resulting
products and why they may combine in the way they do.</p>

      <p>Existing
databases, including Open Reaction Database (ORD), REAXYS, and SciFinder,
have millions of reactions with information on reactants, products,
conditions, and yields, but they only present reactions as overall
transformations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref></sup> Although AI models can
learn from these data to predict chemical transformations and assist
synthetic chemists, they do not offer much insights into the underlying
mechanisms of chemical transformations. The PMechDB database, on the
other hand, enables the training of models to predict arrow-pushing
mechanisms involved in retrosynthetic planning, which offers a unique
perspective on chemical reaction training data.</p>
      <p>The most similar
known database to PMechDB is the Radical Mechanistic Database.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref></sup> RMechDB is a publicly accessible database of
5500 elementary radical reaction steps which contains an interactive
web interface for searching, downloading, and uploading the reactions.
These elementary step radical reactions were manually curated by expert
chemists from organic chemistry textbooks and atmospheric literature,
including research articles and publications related to gas-phase
radical processes. These elementary step reactions have been shown
to enable the training and development of radical reaction predictors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref></sup> Although this dataset is similar to PMechDB
in structure, it is entirely composed of radical reaction steps, while
PMechDB consists of polar reaction steps. Polar reactions are used
everywhere in organic chemistry, and understanding these mechanisms
is fundamental to developing ML models that are useful to synthetic
chemists. Additionally, PMechDB contains significantly more reactions
than RMechDB (∼100,000 compared to ∼5500) and includes
updates to the interactive web interface.</p>
      <p>To our knowledge,
the only other database of reaction mechanisms
is supported by reaction mechanism generator (RMG).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref></sup> RMG is a quantitative approach to predict mechanistic pathways
by (a) evaluating the rate constants of the possible competing elementary
steps of the reaction; (b) determining the rate ratio of the steps
by plugging in concentrations of the reactants into the rate law of
each elementary step.</p>
      <p>For thermochemical calculations, the RMG
mainly uses Benson group
increment theory (BGIT).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref></sup> However, since
the BGIT fails to properly describe ring strains and noncovalent interactions,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>−<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref></sup> for cyclic species, RMG carries out geometry optimization with molecular
mechanics and subsequent single-point calculation with advanced quantum
mechanical methods to derive the necessary thermodynamic parameters.
To approximate kinetic parameters, RMG generates reaction pathways
using a predetermined and extensible set of reaction families and
assumes that reactions between similar reacting sites in a family
will have similar rates.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref></sup> The original
RMG database focuses on constructing mechanisms for mainly radical
reactions with species involving carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, sulfur,
and nitrogen.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref></sup></p>
      <p>Our work aims to
create a database that better represents typical
polar reaction mechanisms found in organic chemistry research. Rather
than focusing on a limited group of reactions with quantitatively
estimated rate constants, our database represents feasible and manually
verified polar reactions found in organic chemistry textbooks and
the organic chemistry literature. Our hope is that by training on
a dataset of elementary steps found in literature, AI models can be
trained to predict arrow-pushing mechanisms for reactions that are
more relevant to retrosynthetic planning.</p>

    <title>PMechDB: Underlying Dataset</title>
    <sec id="sec3.1">
      <title>Manually Curated Dataset</title>
      <p>The primary dataset comprises
12,799 SMIRKS, each accompanied by an electron flow specification
conveyed by curved arrows (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref></xref>). Each SMIRK represents a plausible elementary reaction
step that corresponds to a single transition state that can be portrayed
through Lewis structures and curved arrows. It should be noted, however,
that applying curved arrows to nontraditional bonds, such as hydrogen
bonds, dative bonds, or molecular interaction representations depicted
through dotted/dashed lines, can lead to incorrect formal atomic charges.
To avoid such inaccuracies, and maintain consistency with the arrow-pushing
convention, the dataset employs widely accepted, one-step curved arrow
representations of some processes that are known to involve noncovalent
intermediates such as example proton transfers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref></sup> and <italic>S</italic><sub><italic>N</italic></sub>2 displacements.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref></sup> About 4% of the entries are resonance interconversions, but it is
worth noting that these resonance steps do not possess a transition
state. To the best of our knowledge, curved arrow mechanistic steps
are not used to reveal temperature effects, concentration effects,
implicit solvents, or roles of spectator species. The use of Lewis
structures and arrow-pushing is considered to be a valuable compromise
between generality and trainability versus precise chemical accuracy.
Before adding any of these mechanisms to the PMechDB dataset, our
organic chemistry team manually looked through each mechanism and
deemed these steps as both plausible and elementary.</p>

      <p>The dataset originated with 2989 polar reaction
steps derived using
Reaction Explorer, a rule-based system,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref></sup> and it was later expanded to 5551 polar reaction steps to train
reaction predictor.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref></sup> To add these additional
polar reactions, the reaction explorer was expanded to include more
atom types such as sulfur, phosphorus, and magnesium, and reactions
were manually curated from graduate-level textbooks to improve the
coverage of the dataset and introduce novel reaction types.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref></sup> Subsequently, the existing dataset underwent
a curation process to eliminate redundant entries and steps deemed
impractical under standard laboratory conditions (e.g., &lt;150 °C).
Eventually, the dataset was expanded to over 12,000 entries through
a series of iterative training and testing cycles of reaction predictors.
Additional elementary reaction steps were sourced from undergraduate-
and graduate-level organic chemistry course material, research presentations,
and primary research literature. Any gaps in training were identified
based on the presence of implausible steps in the top-ranked predictions.</p>
      <p>A major challenge in developing the PMechDB was determining the
plausibility of single-step mechanisms. In many cases, spectroscopic
techniques such as mass spectrometry, NMR, and IR can be employed
to describe published products. As a result, organic transformations
in databases such as REAXYS, SciFinder, and ORD can be readily confirmed.
However, validating mechanistic steps that involve a single transition
state is a more challenging. Typically, electronic structure computations
or time-consuming experimental techniques, including chemical kinetics,
isotopic labeling, and crossover experiments, are necessary for experimental
verification of a mechanistic step. It is often stated that mechanisms
can be refuted but never proven. To assist scientists in constructing
mechanistic pathways and predicting the outcomes of organic reactions,
we aimed to develop a dataset containing plausible fundamental reaction
steps from an organic chemist’s perspective.</p>
      <p>In PMechDB,
the plausibility of a mechanistic step is evaluated
subjectively by our organic chemistry team based on its likelihood
of occurrence. In instances where multiple pathways have been proposed
in the literature, and there is discordance between them, it is recommended
to incorporate steps from all potential pathways into the dataset.
This approach ensures that any suggested pathway utilizing the data
reflects the uncertainty present in the literature.</p>
      <p>To further
organize the data, each mechanism was classified by
an orbital interaction pair. Based on a system with three types of
filled orbitals interacting with three types of unfilled orbitals,
there are nine (3 × 3) categories of elementary arrow-pushing
steps as seen in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref></xref>.</p>

      <p>The complexity of molecular species in the core
dataset of PMechDB
ranges from simple species like those in RMG to structurally complex
molecules found in ORD, REAXYS, and SciFinder. It is not uncommon
for a curved arrow depiction of an elementary reaction step to involve
chains of frontier orbital interactions. For example, the enolization
depicted in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref></xref> represents three sequential types of orbital interactions: (1) donation
of <italic>n</italic><sub>N</sub> into π<sub>CO</sub>*, (2)
donation of π<sub>CO</sub> into σ<sub>HC</sub>*, and (3)
donation of σ<sub>HC</sub> into π<sub>CO<sup>+</sup></sub><sup>*</sup>. Orbital interactions (1) and (3) represent intramolecular
arrows, while orbital interaction (2) represents an intermolecular
arrow. To classify each reaction, we use the intermolecular orbital
interaction; therefore, the example above would be classified according
to the blue arrow as a pi_sigma* reaction.</p>

      <title>Combinatorial Elementary Steps Based on the Mayr Nucleophiles
and Electrophiles</title>
      <p>To supplement the core set of over 12,000
highly diverse polar steps, polar reaction steps were assembled from
combinatorial pairs of electrophiles and nucleophiles from the data
in the Mayr-Ofial database of nucleophilicity (<italic>N</italic>, <italic>s</italic><sub>N</sub>) and electrophilicity parameters (<italic>E</italic>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">32</xref></sup> For nucleophiles with multiple
entries in different solvents, only a single entry was chosen, but
parameters determined in protic solvents were excluded. Hindered electrophiles
and nucleophiles with steric dependences were excluded. Some hard
anionic nucleophiles such as acetate, benzoate, <italic>p</italic>-nitrobenzoate, 3,5-dinitrobenzoate, DMSO (O attack), and methyl
carbonate were excluded. 853 (out of 1254) Mayr nucleophiles and 313
(out of 352) Mayr electrophiles were selected leading to 257,712 nucleophile–electrophile
combinations. For five-star reference electrophiles and nucleophiles,
the diffusion limit, <italic>s</italic><sub>N</sub>(<italic>N</italic> + <italic>E</italic>) provides a good approximation of log  <italic>k</italic><sub>20°C</sub> but the equation is less accurate
for other entries.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34">34</xref></sup> In total, 96,558 nucleophile–electrophile

      <title>Train and Test Splits</title>
      <p>PMechDB is primarily designed
to serve as a reliable source of training and evaluation data for
the development of machine learning models. Standard splits of training
and evaluation data are provided to facilitate the development and
comparison of these models. We offer standard data splits for both
manually curated and combinatorial mechanistic reactions. For manually
curated mechanistic reactions, we have compiled a set of 300 challenging
reactions meticulously selected by expert chemists. These reactions
are intended to assess the generalization capabilities of machine
learning models for large and complex reaction systems. We refer to
this test dataset as the challenging test split. For the combinatorial
dataset, we offer two standard train and test splits. First, a 90/10
split with a training set containing 86,303 reactions and a test set
containing 9585 reactions. The test reactions are sampled in such
a way that they contain the same proportion of the nine reaction classes
as the training set (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref></xref>). This train and test split enables the evaluation of the
performance of predictive models across each of the nine polar reaction
classes. However, due to the nature of the combinatorial data, many
of the reacting electrophiles and I have nucleophiles obtained from
the Mayr reactivity table that may appear in both the train and the
test sets. Therefore, a second split is constructed by initially partitioning
the reacting electrophiles and nucleophiles into train and test sets
and then performing the combinatorial generation. This train and test
split is designed to minimize the overlap of reacting functional groups
between the train and test data. Thus, this split enables the evaluation
of the generalization capability of predictive models for unseen reacting
groups. As the electrophiles and nucleophiles are split, the total
number of combinatorial reactions in the second split is smaller,
resulting in a total of 54,048 train reactions with 6093 test reactions.
Our preliminary experiments indicate that achieving high test performance
on the second split is more challenging, yet models trained on this
split demonstrate greater generalization capability and less overfitting.

is illustrated in <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref></xref>.

      <p>The PMechDB database schema comprises three fundamental models:
(1) Reaction, (2) Molecule, and (3) Atom. The inter- and intraintegration
of these three models allow for fast and efficient reaction search
and retrieval. As the naming suggests, each elementary step is stored
as an instance of the reaction model which comes with several descriptive
fields. These fields are designed to uniquely represent an elementary

            <p>Molecule search: Using this method,
the user can search through the PMechDB database for reactions containing
specific molecules. The user is required to input a SMILES string
containing the desired reactant and product molecules. Each molecule
is separated by the “.” character, and reactants are
separated from products by the “≫” character.
If users want to search for reactants only, they may specify “≫”
after the list of molecules. If users want to search for products
only, they may specify “≫” before the list of
molecules. If “≫” is omitted, the search will
look for reactions where the molecule is contained on both sides of
the reaction. After validating the SMILES input, the platform displays
all elementary steps in its database that contain the specified molecules.</p>

            <p>Reactive atom (molecular
orbital) search:
Using this method, the user can search the PMechDB database for reactions
with specific atoms acting as the electron donor or electron acceptor.
The user is required to input the atom-mapped SMILES string of a molecule
and label the reactive atom using an integer between 1 and 11, while
the other atoms are not labeled. The platform displays all elementary
steps in its database where the labeled atom acts as one of the two
main reactive atoms.</p>

            <p>Substructure search: Using this method,
the user can search the PMechDB database for reactions containing
specific substructures. The user is required to input a SMARTS string
containing the desired reactant and product substructures. Each substructure
is separated by the “.” character, and reactants and
products are separated by the “≫” character.
The same search rules apply as mentioned in the molecule search section
for searching for reactants/products only. Each substructure provided
must be chemically valid. PMechDB displays all elementary steps in
its database containing molecule(s) with the input substructures.</p>

      <title>Uploading New Data</title>
      <p>As we continue to expand the database

contribute novel polar elementary steps. Uploading new data in the
form of polar mechanistic reactions can be done at: <uri xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://deeprxn.ics.uci.edu/pmechdb/upload">https://deeprxn.ics.uci.edu/pmechdb/upload</uri>. Contributing users are required to complete a submission form consisting
of three fields: (1) the SMIRKS notation of the elementary step, (2)
the corresponding electron flow specification, and (3) the source
of the elementary step. Additionally, there exists an optional field
where the user can provide <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.jcim.3c01810/suppl_file/ci3c01810_si_001.pdf">Supporting Information</ext-link> about the reaction. Following submission, the proposed elementary
step will undergo automated checks for validity and duplication followed
by a comprehensive evaluation by our team of proficient organic chemists
to ensure plausibility before its assimilation into the database.
We follow the same verification process as it was introduced in.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref></sup> Finally, users can choose to upload reactions

    <title>Conclusions</title>
    <p>PMechDB is a new platform for curating
and sharing polar chemical
reaction data. This platform addresses the limitations of existing
databases by storing reactions in the form of canonicalized and balanced
elementary steps with accurate atom mapping and arrow-pushing mechanisms.
PMechDB contains over 100,000 elementary step reactions and is publicly
accessible through its web interface. We postulate that this standardized
representation and support for the public availability of reliable
data will benefit research in chemoinformatics and the development
of data-driven and predictive models. A database of elementary reaction
steps can also be used in chemical education in different ways, for
instance in combination with interactive tools for learning chemical
reactions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref45">45</xref></sup> PMechDB is a significant step
toward improving the accessibility and usability of chemical reaction
data, and we hope that it will inspire further developments in this
field.</p>

      <p>Most online chemical reaction databases are not publicly
accessible
or are fully downloadable. These databases tend to contain reactions
in noncanonicalized formats and often lack comprehensive information
regarding reaction pathways, intermediates, and byproducts. Within
the few publicly available databases, reactions are typically stored
in the form of unbalanced, overall transformations with minimal interpretability
of the underlying chemistry. These limitations present significant
obstacles to data-driven applications including the development of
machine learning models. As an effort to overcome these challenges,
we introduce PMechDB, a publicly accessible platform designed to curate,
aggregate, and share polar chemical reaction data in the form of elementary
reaction steps. Our initial version of PMechDB consists of over 100,000
such steps. In the PMechDB, all reactions are stored as canonicalized
and balanced elementary steps, featuring accurate atom mapping and
arrow-pushing mechanisms. As an online interactive database, PMechDB
provides multiple interfaces that enable users to search, download,
and upload chemical reactions. We anticipate that the public availability
of PMechDB and its standardized data representation will prove beneficial
for chemoinformatics research and education and the development of
data-driven, interpretable models for predicting reactions and pathways.

    <title>Introduction</title>
    <p>The polar mechanism represents the most
prevalent type of mechanism
in organic and organometallic chemistry. These reactions are characterized
by heterolytic bond cleavage and the formation of charged intermediates.
Owing to the high reactivity of polar reactants, many such reactions
can take place under standard and physiological conditions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>−<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref></sup> Consequently, polar reactions are a subject of considerable interest
and are widely employed in the fields of organic, inorganic, organometallic,
biological, and environmental chemistry.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref></sup> As an illustration
of their significance, the field of organocatalysis, acknowledged
by the 2021 Nobel Prize in chemistry, is strongly dependent on polar
mechanistic steps. Organocatalysis is used in medicinal chemistry<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref></sup> and has been employed in the industrial production
of pharmaceuticals.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref></sup></p>
    <p>Machine learning
methods, and particularly deep learning, are increasingly
playing a central role in science and technology.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref></sup> In the domain of chemistry, considerable efforts have been
made to develop computer models that can automate tasks such as drug
discovery, organic synthesis, and molecular property predictions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>−<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref></sup> Data-driven machine learning techniques necessitate vast chemical
datasets for training, yet most of the currently available reaction
databases are either not readily accessible,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref></sup> or contain noisy and incomplete data, as well as inaccurate or unlabeled
information. These limitations make it challenging to train robust
and accurate predictive data-driven models for chemoinformatics reaction
problems. To partially address such limitations, we introduce PMechDB,
a comprehensive and extensible database containing over 12,000 elementary
polar reaction steps that have been manually curated. Additionally,
the database contains more than 90,000 polar reactions generated through
combinatorial methods using nucleophiles and electrophiles extracted
from the Mayr-Ofial database. The reactions encompassed in PMechDB
are manually curated and incorporate accurate reactive atom mappings,
balanced reactants and products, intermediates, side products, and
arrow-pushing mechanisms. This database is publicly available and
is hosted on a web server through the DeepRXN Web site at <uri xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://deeprxn.ics.uci.edu/pmechdb">https://deeprxn.ics.uci.edu/pmechdb</uri>. The Web site provides an interactive user interface that allows
for searching specific reactions, filtering reactions based on their
classification, displaying corresponding arrow-pushing mechanisms,
downloading the current dataset, and uploading novel elementary reaction
steps. The Web site allows users to draw individual elementary step
mechanisms or provide csv files to upload many elementary step mechanisms
concurrently. We emphasize the importance of dependable, accurately
annotated, and readily expandable datasets for effectively training
machine learning models in the field of chemistry. So, we invite users
to contribute additional reactions to the PMechDB database, which
will be curated, cleaned, and scrutinized by the PMechDB team of organic
chemists. If deemed satisfactory, the reactions will be aggregated
into the dataset, further enhancing its scope and reliability.</p>

      <title>Reaction Representation: Overall Transformation vs Elementary
Steps</title>
      <p>Overall transformations are popular and simple ways
for organic chemists to represent a reaction. This representation
consists of a set of reactant molecules that, when added together,
form a set of product molecules, usually focusing on a single target,
as seen in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref></xref>. This representation contains no information about intermediate
states or the stepwise mechanism of the reaction. Although this approach
clearly describes the reactants and the products of a reaction, the
limited amount of information makes it difficult for chemists to use
these representations to reason about how the reaction proceeded or
what the underlying driving forces were.</p>

          <p>Robinson annulation is
an important ring-forming reaction used
by organic chemists. This is an example of a total transformation
approach to representing the reaction. The final product is predicted
from the reactants without any intermediate states or mechanistic
steps.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref></sup></p>

      </fig>
      <p>The elementary step approach is a more complex
representation that
breaks the overall chemical transformations into a series of elementary
steps, as seen in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>. Each of these elementary mechanistic steps involves a single
transition state. This series of elementary steps can then be concatenated
together to represent the overall chemical transformation. By breaking
reactions down into smaller mechanistic steps, organic chemists can
gain insights into how these reactants will combine to form the resulting
products and why they may combine in the way they do.</p>

      <title>Existing datasets of Elementary Reaction Steps</title>
      <p>Existing
databases, including Open Reaction Database (ORD), REAXYS, and SciFinder,
have millions of reactions with information on reactants, products,
conditions, and yields, but they only present reactions as overall
transformations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref></sup> Although AI models can
learn from these data to predict chemical transformations and assist
synthetic chemists, they do not offer much insights into the underlying
mechanisms of chemical transformations. The PMechDB database, on the
other hand, enables the training of models to predict arrow-pushing
mechanisms involved in retrosynthetic planning, which offers a unique
perspective on chemical reaction training data.</p>
      <p>The most similar
known database to PMechDB is the Radical Mechanistic Database.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref></sup> RMechDB is a publicly accessible database of
5500 elementary radical reaction steps which contains an interactive
web interface for searching, downloading, and uploading the reactions.
These elementary step radical reactions were manually curated by expert
chemists from organic chemistry textbooks and atmospheric literature,
including research articles and publications related to gas-phase
radical processes. These elementary step reactions have been shown
to enable the training and development of radical reaction predictors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref></sup> Although this dataset is similar to PMechDB
in structure, it is entirely composed of radical reaction steps, while
PMechDB consists of polar reaction steps. Polar reactions are used
everywhere in organic chemistry, and understanding these mechanisms
is fundamental to developing ML models that are useful to synthetic
chemists. Additionally, PMechDB contains significantly more reactions
than RMechDB (∼100,000 compared to ∼5500) and includes
updates to the interactive web interface.</p>
      <p>To our knowledge,
the only other database of reaction mechanisms
is supported by reaction mechanism generator (RMG).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref></sup> RMG is a quantitative approach to predict mechanistic pathways
by (a) evaluating the rate constants of the possible competing elementary
steps of the reaction; (b) determining the rate ratio of the steps
by plugging in concentrations of the reactants into the rate law of
each elementary step.</p>
      <p>For thermochemical calculations, the RMG
mainly uses Benson group
increment theory (BGIT).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref></sup> However, since
the BGIT fails to properly describe ring strains and noncovalent interactions,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>−<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref></sup> for cyclic species, RMG carries out geometry optimization with molecular
mechanics and subsequent single-point calculation with advanced quantum
mechanical methods to derive the necessary thermodynamic parameters.
To approximate kinetic parameters, RMG generates reaction pathways
using a predetermined and extensible set of reaction families and
assumes that reactions between similar reacting sites in a family
will have similar rates.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref></sup> The original
RMG database focuses on constructing mechanisms for mainly radical
reactions with species involving carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, sulfur,
and nitrogen.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref></sup></p>
      <p>Our work aims to
create a database that better represents typical
polar reaction mechanisms found in organic chemistry research. Rather
than focusing on a limited group of reactions with quantitatively
estimated rate constants, our database represents feasible and manually
verified polar reactions found in organic chemistry textbooks and
the organic chemistry literature. Our hope is that by training on
a dataset of elementary steps found in literature, AI models can be
trained to predict arrow-pushing mechanisms for reactions that are
more relevant to retrosynthetic planning.</p>

    <title>PMechDB: Underlying Dataset</title>
    <sec id="sec3.1">
      <title>Manually Curated Dataset</title>
      <p>The primary dataset comprises
12,799 SMIRKS, each accompanied by an electron flow specification
conveyed by curved arrows (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref></xref>). Each SMIRK represents a plausible elementary reaction
step that corresponds to a single transition state that can be portrayed
through Lewis structures and curved arrows. It should be noted, however,
that applying curved arrows to nontraditional bonds, such as hydrogen
bonds, dative bonds, or molecular interaction representations depicted
through dotted/dashed lines, can lead to incorrect formal atomic charges.
To avoid such inaccuracies, and maintain consistency with the arrow-pushing
convention, the dataset employs widely accepted, one-step curved arrow
representations of some processes that are known to involve noncovalent
intermediates such as example proton transfers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref></sup> and <italic>S</italic><sub><italic>N</italic></sub>2 displacements.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref></sup> About 4% of the entries are resonance interconversions, but it is
worth noting that these resonance steps do not possess a transition
state. To the best of our knowledge, curved arrow mechanistic steps
are not used to reveal temperature effects, concentration effects,
implicit solvents, or roles of spectator species. The use of Lewis
structures and arrow-pushing is considered to be a valuable compromise
between generality and trainability versus precise chemical accuracy.
Before adding any of these mechanisms to the PMechDB dataset, our
organic chemistry team manually looked through each mechanism and
deemed these steps as both plausible and elementary.</p>

      </fig>
      <p>The dataset originated with 2989 polar reaction
steps derived using
Reaction Explorer, a rule-based system,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref></sup> and it was later expanded to 5551 polar reaction steps to train
reaction predictor.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref></sup> To add these additional
polar reactions, the reaction explorer was expanded to include more
atom types such as sulfur, phosphorus, and magnesium, and reactions
were manually curated from graduate-level textbooks to improve the
coverage of the dataset and introduce novel reaction types.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref></sup> Subsequently, the existing dataset underwent
a curation process to eliminate redundant entries and steps deemed
impractical under standard laboratory conditions (e.g., &lt;150 °C).
Eventually, the dataset was expanded to over 12,000 entries through
a series of iterative training and testing cycles of reaction predictors.
Additional elementary reaction steps were sourced from undergraduate-
and graduate-level organic chemistry course material, research presentations,
and primary research literature. Any gaps in training were identified
based on the presence of implausible steps in the top-ranked predictions.</p>
      <p>A major challenge in developing the PMechDB was determining the
plausibility of single-step mechanisms. In many cases, spectroscopic
techniques such as mass spectrometry, NMR, and IR can be employed
to describe published products. As a result, organic transformations
in databases such as REAXYS, SciFinder, and ORD can be readily confirmed.
However, validating mechanistic steps that involve a single transition
state is a more challenging. Typically, electronic structure computations
or time-consuming experimental techniques, including chemical kinetics,
isotopic labeling, and crossover experiments, are necessary for experimental
verification of a mechanistic step. It is often stated that mechanisms
can be refuted but never proven. To assist scientists in constructing
mechanistic pathways and predicting the outcomes of organic reactions,
we aimed to develop a dataset containing plausible fundamental reaction
steps from an organic chemist’s perspective.</p>
      <p>In PMechDB,
the plausibility of a mechanistic step is evaluated
subjectively by our organic chemistry team based on its likelihood
of occurrence. In instances where multiple pathways have been proposed
in the literature, and there is discordance between them, it is recommended
to incorporate steps from all potential pathways into the dataset.
This approach ensures that any suggested pathway utilizing the data
reflects the uncertainty present in the literature.</p>
      <p>To further
organize the data, each mechanism was classified by
an orbital interaction pair. Based on a system with three types of
filled orbitals interacting with three types of unfilled orbitals,
there are nine (3 × 3) categories of elementary arrow-pushing
steps as seen in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref></xref>.</p>

      <p>The complexity of molecular species in the core
dataset of PMechDB
ranges from simple species like those in RMG to structurally complex
molecules found in ORD, REAXYS, and SciFinder. It is not uncommon
for a curved arrow depiction of an elementary reaction step to involve
chains of frontier orbital interactions. For example, the enolization
depicted in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref></xref> represents three sequential types of orbital interactions: (1) donation
of <italic>n</italic><sub>N</sub> into π<sub>CO</sub>*, (2)
donation of π<sub>CO</sub> into σ<sub>HC</sub>*, and (3)
donation of σ<sub>HC</sub> into π<sub>CO<sup>+</sup></sub><sup>*</sup>. Orbital interactions (1) and (3) represent intramolecular
arrows, while orbital interaction (2) represents an intermolecular
arrow. To classify each reaction, we use the intermolecular orbital
interaction; therefore, the example above would be classified according
to the blue arrow as a pi_sigma* reaction.</p>

      <title>Combinatorial Elementary Steps Based on the Mayr Nucleophiles

      <p>To supplement the core set of over 12,000
highly diverse polar steps, polar reaction steps were assembled from
combinatorial pairs of electrophiles and nucleophiles from the data
in the Mayr-Ofial database of nucleophilicity (<italic>N</italic>, <italic>s</italic><sub>N</sub>) and electrophilicity parameters (<italic>E</italic>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">32</xref></sup> For nucleophiles with multiple
entries in different solvents, only a single entry was chosen, but
parameters determined in protic solvents were excluded. Hindered electrophiles
and nucleophiles with steric dependences were excluded. Some hard
anionic nucleophiles such as acetate, benzoate, <italic>p</italic>-nitrobenzoate, 3,5-dinitrobenzoate, DMSO (O attack), and methyl
carbonate were excluded. 853 (out of 1254) Mayr nucleophiles and 313
(out of 352) Mayr electrophiles were selected leading to 257,712 nucleophile–electrophile
combinations. For five-star reference electrophiles and nucleophiles,
the diffusion limit, <italic>s</italic><sub>N</sub>(<italic>N</italic> + <italic>E</italic>) provides a good approximation of log  <italic>k</italic><sub>20°C</sub> but the equation is less accurate

      <title>Train and Test Splits</title>
      <p>PMechDB is primarily designed
to serve as a reliable source of training and evaluation data for
the development of machine learning models. Standard splits of training
and evaluation data are provided to facilitate the development and
comparison of these models. We offer standard data splits for both
manually curated and combinatorial mechanistic reactions. For manually
curated mechanistic reactions, we have compiled a set of 300 challenging
reactions meticulously selected by expert chemists. These reactions
are intended to assess the generalization capabilities of machine
learning models for large and complex reaction systems. We refer to
this test dataset as the challenging test split. For the combinatorial
dataset, we offer two standard train and test splits. First, a 90/10
split with a training set containing 86,303 reactions and a test set
containing 9585 reactions. The test reactions are sampled in such
a way that they contain the same proportion of the nine reaction classes
as the training set (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref></xref>). This train and test split enables the evaluation of the
performance of predictive models across each of the nine polar reaction
classes. However, due to the nature of the combinatorial data, many
of the reacting electrophiles and I have nucleophiles obtained from
the Mayr reactivity table that may appear in both the train and the
test sets. Therefore, a second split is constructed by initially partitioning
the reacting electrophiles and nucleophiles into train and test sets
and then performing the combinatorial generation. This train and test
split is designed to minimize the overlap of reacting functional groups
between the train and test data. Thus, this split enables the evaluation
of the generalization capability of predictive models for unseen reacting
groups. As the electrophiles and nucleophiles are split, the total
number of combinatorial reactions in the second split is smaller,
resulting in a total of 54,048 train reactions with 6093 test reactions.
Our preliminary experiments indicate that achieving high test performance
on the second split is more challenging, yet models trained on this
split demonstrate greater generalization capability and less overfitting.

Here, we list the main fields of the reaction model.<list id="list1" list-type="simple"><list-item><label>1.</label><p><bold>Reaction ID:</bold> Each reaction
is associated with a unique ID number.</p></list-item><list-item><label>2.</label><p><bold>Canonicalized atom mapped SMILES
of the reactants:</bold> The reactant molecules are represented by
SMILES strings, with the inclusion of integer labels denoting the
atoms involved in the reaction. A standardized labeling convention
is employed, whereby the participating atoms located in the nucleophile
component are assigned labels commencing at 10 and sequentially increasing
by one for each subsequent atom, while the participating atoms located
in the electrophile component are assigned labels commencing at 20
and also sequentially increasing by one for each subsequent atom.</p></list-item><list-item><label>3.</label><p><bold>Canonicalized atom

codes:</bold> The standard codes for arrow pushing mechanisms contain
the integer
labels of the participating atoms on the reactants side. The standard
arrow codes begin from the integer label (starting at 10) on the nucleophilic
group.</p></list-item><list-item><label>5.</label><p><bold>Spectator

      <p>Given the fields associated with the Reaction model,
an instance
of this model in PMechDB can be uniquely retrieved from the database
using either the <bold>Reaction ID</bold> or the combined properties
2–5 as the key.</p>
      <p>The Molecule model has three fields corresponding
to the unique
molecule ID, canonicalized SMILES string of the molecule, and the
OEChem MolBase object.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref38">38</xref></sup> An instance of
the Molecule model has a many-to-many relation with the reactant molecules,
product molecules, and spectator molecules fields of the reaction
model.</p>
      <p>The Atom model has five fields corresponding to the unique
ID,
canonicalized atom mapped SMILES string of the parent molecule, a
boolean for if the atom can act as a source, a boolean for if the
atom can act as a sink, and the OEChem AtomBase object.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref38">38</xref></sup> An instance of the Atom model has a many-to-many

      <p>The schema with the fields described in <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">9</xref></xref> is designed not only to provide
efficient
storage and retrieval but also to enable the automated population

    <title>PMechDB: Web Server</title>
    <p>The web server of the PMechDB offers
three interfaces for (1) searching
the data; (2) downloading the data; and (3) uploading new data.</p>
    <sec id="sec4.1">
      <title>Searching the Data</title>
      <p>The PMechDB search interface is
accessible at <uri xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://deeprxn.ics.uci.edu/pmechdb/rsearch">https://deeprxn.ics.uci.edu/pmechdb/rsearch</uri>. This interface
offers a user-friendly means of searching through the expansive dataset
via two search methods: (1) reaction search, where the search entity
is a chemical reaction, and (2) compound search, where the search
entity can be a molecule, a substructure, or an atom. The capabilities
of the search interface allow for tailored filtration of the database
based on a variety of reaction attributes such as the reaction category
(e.g., manually curated vs combinatorial) or the 9-class classification
of polar reactions (e.g., lone-empty).</p>

      <list id="list2" list-type="simple">
        <list-item>
          <label>1.</label>
          <p>Exact search: Using this method, the
user can search through the database for specific chemical reactions
with known reactants and products. The user is required to input the
query in the form of the SMIRKS of an elementary step, specifying
the reactants and products, but not the arrow code. The system then
searches and displays all elementary steps with the same reactants
and products as the query but with additional molecules involved as
reagents or spectators.</p>
        </list-item>
        <list-item>
          <p>2.Similarity
search: Using this method, the user can
find the reactions in PMechDB that are most similar to an input reaction.
The user is required to input the query as the SMIRKS of an elementary
step, specifying the reactants and products, and the desired number
of similar reactions (N) to be retrieved. Upon searching, the system
displays N elementary steps sorted from the most similar to the least
similar to the input query. The current version of RMechDB is equipped
with the following similarity metrics computed on various representations
of the elementary steps:</p>

            <label>1.</label>
            <p>Molecule search: Using this method,
the user can search through the PMechDB database for reactions containing
specific molecules. The user is required to input a SMILES string
containing the desired reactant and product molecules. Each molecule
is separated by the “.” character, and reactants are
separated from products by the “≫” character.
If users want to search for reactants only, they may specify “≫”
after the list of molecules. If users want to search for products
only, they may specify “≫” before the list of
molecules. If “≫” is omitted, the search will
look for reactions where the molecule is contained on both sides of
the reaction. After validating the SMILES input, the platform displays
all elementary steps in its database that contain the specified molecules.</p>

          <list-item>
            <label>2.</label>
            <p>Reactive atom (molecular
orbital) search:
Using this method, the user can search the PMechDB database for reactions
with specific atoms acting as the electron donor or electron acceptor.
The user is required to input the atom-mapped SMILES string of a molecule
and label the reactive atom using an integer between 1 and 11, while
the other atoms are not labeled. The platform displays all elementary
steps in its database where the labeled atom acts as one of the two
main reactive atoms.</p>

            <label>3.</label>
            <p>Substructure search: Using this method,
the user can search the PMechDB database for reactions containing
specific substructures. The user is required to input a SMARTS string
containing the desired reactant and product substructures. Each substructure
is separated by the “.” character, and reactants and
products are separated by the “≫” character.
The same search rules apply as mentioned in the molecule search section
for searching for reactants/products only. Each substructure provided
must be chemically valid. PMechDB displays all elementary steps in
its database containing molecule(s) with the input substructures.</p>

    <title>Conclusions</title>
    <p>PMechDB is a new platform for curating
and sharing polar chemical
reaction data. This platform addresses the limitations of existing
databases by storing reactions in the form of canonicalized and balanced
elementary steps with accurate atom mapping and arrow-pushing mechanisms.
PMechDB contains over 100,000 elementary step reactions and is publicly
accessible through its web interface. We postulate that this standardized
representation and support for the public availability of reliable
data will benefit research in chemoinformatics and the development
of data-driven and predictive models. A database of elementary reaction
steps can also be used in chemical education in different ways, for
instance in combination with interactive tools for learning chemical
reactions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref45">45</xref></sup> PMechDB is a significant step
toward improving the accessibility and usability of chemical reaction
data, and we hope that it will inspire further developments in this
field.</p>
