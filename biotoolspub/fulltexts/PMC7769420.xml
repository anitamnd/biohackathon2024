    <abstract>
      <p>Identification of the target genes of microRNAs (miRNAs), <italic>trans</italic>-acting small interfering RNAs (ta-siRNAs), and small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) is an important step for understanding their regulatory roles in plants. In recent years, many bioinformatics software packages based on small RNA (sRNA) high-throughput sequencing (HTS) and degradome sequencing data analysis have provided strong technical support for large-scale mining of sRNA-target pairs. However, sRNA-target regulation is achieved using a complex network of interactions since one transcript might be co-regulated by multiple sRNAs and one sRNA may also affect multiple targets. Currently used mining software can realize the mining of multiple unknown targets using known sRNA, but it cannot rule out the possibility of co-regulation of the same target by other unknown sRNAs. Hence, the obtained regulatory network may be incomplete. We have developed a new mining software, sRNATargetDigger, that includes two function modules, “Forward Digger” and “Reverse Digger”, which can identify regulatory sRNA-target pairs bidirectionally. Moreover, it has the ability to identify unknown sRNAs co-regulating the same target, in order to obtain a more authentic and reliable sRNA-target regulatory network. Upon re-examination of the published sRNA-target pairs in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>, sRNATargetDigger found 170 novel co-regulatory sRNA-target pairs. This software can be downloaded from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.bioinfolab.cn/sRNATD.html">http://www.bioinfolab.cn/sRNATD.html</ext-link>.</p>

    <title>Introduction</title>
    <p>Small RNAs (sRNAs) is a class of non-coding RNAs with lengths ranging from 18 to 30 nucleotides and different functions. In plants, some sRNAs are complementarily matched with specific bases of the target mRNAs, resulting in cleavage and degradation of the target transcripts. This kind of regulation can negatively modulate the expression of target genes, and it plays important roles in many biological processes, such as plant growth and development, disease resistance, and stress response [<xref rid="pone.0244480.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0244480.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. sRNAs can be classified according to their distinct characteristics into a variety of categories such as microRNAs (miRNAs) and <italic>trans</italic>-acting small interfering RNAs (ta-siRNAs).</p>
    <p>Identifying and validating the target genes of these sRNAs are important steps for understanding their biological functions. sRNAs exert their effect by binding to the 3'-UTR of the target gene, and their function can be validated using reporter constructs, wherein genes such as luciferase are cloned upstream of the 3'-UTR of the target gene. The inhibitory effects of sRNAs on the target genes are quantified by comparing the changes in fluorescence values of in the presence or absence of sRNAs [<xref rid="pone.0244480.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. However, limited by the technical level, experimental cost, and experimental cycle, only a small number of sRNA-target pairs have been identified. Therefore, many computation-based sRNA-target prediction tools have been recently developed [<xref rid="pone.0244480.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0244480.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Making full use of the complementary property between sRNAs and their candidate targets, predictions can be achieved through large-scale sequence matching [<xref rid="pone.0244480.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Although these results identify some genuine targets, false positive results may exist; thus, further experimental verification is required.</p>
    <p>A large number of fragmented sequences captured by degradome sequencing can be mapped to the transcript sequences to find the signals for the enzymatic cleavages guided by specific sRNAs. Three types of high-throughput degradome sequencing platforms, <italic>i</italic>.<italic>e</italic>. parallel analysis of RNA ends (PARE) [<xref rid="pone.0244480.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], genome-wide mapping of uncapped and cleaved transcripts (GMUCT) [<xref rid="pone.0244480.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], and degradome sequencing [<xref rid="pone.0244480.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] provide an efficient way to obtain degradation signals. Bioinformatics tools such as CleaveLand [<xref rid="pone.0244480.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], SeqTar [<xref rid="pone.0244480.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], PAREsnip2 [<xref rid="pone.0244480.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], and sPARTA [<xref rid="pone.0244480.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] make full use of the degradome data for sRNA-target prediction. This prediction is mainly achieved by performing the following steps: (1) Potential sRNA-target genes are screened based on sequence complementarity. (2) Specific cleavage sites on potential target genes are obtained based on the matching analysis of degradome signatures. The regulatory relationship is determined based on the correlation between the cleavage site and the binding site of sRNA to the target.</p>
    <p>Currently, these tools are well used in different species and in different biological pathways [<xref rid="pone.0244480.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0244480.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. It is well known that sRNA-target regulation is a complex biological process. The same mRNA may have multiple sRNA regulators, and the same sRNA may also have multiple downstream targets [<xref rid="pone.0244480.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The software tools mentioned above can only predict the regulatory relationship between known sRNAs and mRNAs, which has the following problems: a) In addition to the known sRNAs, there may be other unknown sRNAs that co-regulate the target genes. If the regulatory role is attributed only to the known sRNA, it will lead to a big gap in the construction of the regulatory network. b) More importantly, if the expression levels of the unknown co-regulatory sRNAs are much higher than that of the annotated sRNA, the regulatory effect of this annotated sRNA on the predicted target might be replaced by the effects of the unknown sRNAs. Therefore, the key to highly reliable degradome-based identification of the sRNA-target relationship is to carefully consider the interference by unknown sRNAs.</p>
    <p>We have previously proposed an approach for regulatory miRNA mining using a reverse mining method [<xref rid="pone.0244480.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], which provides a feasible solution to the above problems. Once the target gene was predicted, all the potential sRNA regulators of this target could be extracted from sRNA high-throughput sequencing (HTS) data using the reverse mining method. The extent of the involvement of these sRNAs in target regulation can be determined according to their expression levels, so as to reliably identify most of the sRNAs that target a specific mRNA. Based on this idea, we improved the current degradome-based mining technology of sRNA-target genes, and developed a novel software named sRNATargetDigger for this purpose. sRNATargetDigger is easy to download and convenient to use, and it gives the user a good experience, as well.</p>

      <title>Data pre-processing</title>
      <p>To reliably obtain more sRNA-target pairs, we need sRNA, mRNA, and degradome sequencing data. sRNA and degradome sequencing data were pre-processed. First, the adapter sequences were removed and the short sequence (including "N") whose bases cannot be determined was deleted. Next, the short sequence with a read count of 0 was also deleted, and reads per million (RPM) was used as the unit for normalization of the expression value of the sequence. The normalized count of an sRNA/degradome sequence = (the raw read count of the sequence/ the total read counts of the data set) × 10<sup>6</sup>.</p>

      <title>Candidate target gene prediction</title>
      <p>In plants, sRNA and target genes show almost perfect base complementarity. A position-dependent scoring system based on the number of mismatches was used to judge the complementarity between an sRNA and its target gene(s). For example, the scoring rules proposed by Allen [<xref rid="pone.0244480.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] and Fahlgren [<xref rid="pone.0244480.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] have been used in many target gene prediction tools and models. According to the research results of Axtell <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pone.0244480.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], the latest psRNATarget [<xref rid="pone.0244480.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] tool included a new scoring rule to expand the seed sequence to 2–13 base pairs (bp), allowing only two mismatches (except G:U pairs), and a modified penalty score of the gap and final screening threshold. We screened potential candidate target genes of sRNAs from the cDNA database according to the psRNATarget scoring rules [<xref rid="pone.0244480.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]:</p>

          <p>For other nucleotide pairs that do not meet the Watson–Crick rule, a penalty of 1 point will be imposed for each occurrence. Except for a mismatch at positions 2–13, for each mismatch the score will be reduced by 0.5 points.</p>

      <title>Degradome-based identification of sRNA-target binding</title>
      <p>The target gene cleavage signals caused by sRNA-guided cleavage could be detected using degradome sequencing. First, the degradome data were matched to the candidate target gene obtained in the previous step through a fast hash-table-based algorithm, and all of the 5' end site information that can be completely matched was recorded. Second, the signal intensity of the cleavage site and the signal intensity of the degraded background were calculated according to formula 1 and formula 2, respectively, and the sites with a ratio of both values 5 times or more were screened as specific cleavage sites.</p>
      <p>Formula 1: The signal intensity of the cleavage site = the sum of counts of all sequences that are matched with degradomes at this site / the sum of the numbers of sequences that are matched with the degradomes at this site.</p>
      <p>Formula 2: The signal intensity of the degraded background = the sum of counts of sequences that are matched with degradomes except at the cleavage site / the sum of the numbers of sequences that are matched with the degradomes.</p>
      <p>According to the regulatory mechanisms of plant sRNAs and their specificities, when an mRNA sequence and the sRNA sequence satisfy the base complementarity characteristics, and the specific cleavage can be detected in the middle of sRNA binding site through the degradome, it is likely that there is a specific regulatory relationship between the mRNA and sRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0244480.g001">Fig 1</xref>).</p>

          <p>The potential targets of the sRNA were screened out from cDNA data using sequence complementarity. Then, degradome sequences were mapped to these potential targets to identify the actual cleavage signals. Only when the cutting signal was within the middle of sRNA binding site, the sRNA-target pairs were retained. In the reverse validation step, 30-nt sRNA binding site extracted from the target was used as sequence complementary bait to search all possible regulatory sRNAs from the sRNA HTS data set. The sRNA-target regulatory relationship was confirmed if the known sRNA was identified again according to its expression levels.</p>

      <title>Reverse verification of the sRNA-target regulatory relationship</title>
      <p>Since one mRNA can be regulated by multiple sRNAs, it is necessary to perform further validation of the bound sRNA-target regulatory relationship to rule out the interference from other unknown sRNAs. According to the previous reports [<xref rid="pone.0244480.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0244480.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0244480.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], if the same site is regulated by multiple sRNAs, the cleavage effect at this site is largely accomplished by the qualified sRNA with the highest expression. Therefore, we took the cleavage site on the mRNA as the center and collected 30-nt sequences surrounding this site (15 nt upstream and downstream) as the candidate sRNA binding regions. Upon using the reverse mining technology, all the possible regulatory sRNAs were identified from the sRNA sequencing data set and sorted according to the expression levels of sRNAs. The sRNAs whose expression levels were less than 1/10 of the highest expression level were deleted. If a known sRNA was identified again, the sRNA-target regulatory relationship was considered true, and all co-regulatory sRNA information was outputted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0244480.g001">Fig 1</xref>). If the known sRNAs were absent, this regulatory relationship was ignored.</p>

    <sec id="sec007">
      <title>Software test</title>
      <p>To test the reliability of the software tools, we used the degradome data, sRNA HTS data, and cDNA data stored in the public database to verify the sRNA-target regulatory relationship in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, which has been previously reported in the literature [<xref rid="pone.0244480.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Since the expression patterns of many sRNAs and mRNAs were tissue-specific, we considered that this regulatory relationship was true as long as one tissue passed the “Forward Digger” or “Reverse Digger”function module. We downloaded sRNA and degradome HTS data from the GEO database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/">www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/</ext-link>), comprising the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> sRNA HTS data (GSM707682, GSM707683, GSM707684, GSM707685) and the degradome data (GSM278333, GSM278334, GSM278335 and GSM278370). The cDNA sequence information of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> was downloaded from the TAIR10 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.arabidopsis.org/">http://www.arabidopsis.org/</ext-link>).</p>
      <p>The newly discovered co-regulatory sRNAs, which have not been reported in literature [<xref rid="pone.0244480.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], were further tested using PAREsnip2 [<xref rid="pone.0244480.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The parameters of PAREsnip2 were set as follows: " allow_mismatch_position_10 = true","allow_mismatch_position_11 = true"," core_region_start = 2", "core_region_end = 13", "max_mismatches_core_region = 2", "max_score = 5.5", and " max_gaps = 2".</p>

      <p>The sRNATargetDigger software used the degradome and sRNA HTS data to identify the potential sRNA-target regulatory relationship by including two function modules: “Forward Digger” and “Reverse Digger” (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0244480.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). Function of “Forward Digger”: sRNAs were known, and their regulatory target genes were identified from the cDNA data set.

          <p>A: Main interface. The regulatory relationship between the sRNA and the target mRNA can be identified bidirectionally by two modules, “Forward Digger” and “Reverse Digger”. B: “Forward Digger”. Candidate sRNA (regulatory sRNA) is used as query sequence to identify its regulatory target genes from cDNA data set and the co-regulatory sRNAs of the identified target genes will also be searched from sRNA HTS data set. C: “Reverse Digger”. The cDNA sequence (target gene) is used as query sequence to identify the regulatory sRNAs from the sRNA HTS data set according to the cleavage site on the target gene.</p>

      </fig>
      <p>Users can click to enter the “Forward Digger” module (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0244480.g002">Fig 2B</xref>), which requires input of regulatory sRNA sequence, cDNA data set (for finding candidate target genes), degradome set (for finding specific cleavage sites on target genes), and sRNA HTS data set (used to verify the true expression of the regulatory sRNAs and find unknown co-regulatory sRNAs), and the users need to select the source species of the data from the species using the drop-down box. The correct selection of species can easily show in the results whether a certain sRNA has been annotated in the miRBase (release 22). In addition, users can modify result fold conveniently and save the results to corresponding folders on their computers. The above files that required to be inputted must be in FASTA format. After the input is completed, click the “Run” button, and the program will automatically run according to the analysis process shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0244480.g001">Fig 1</xref>. The user can track the running progress of the program in real time from the running prompt box on the left side of the interface. The “T-Plot” box on the right side of the interface displays the t-plot map matched with the degradome at the corresponding position of the corresponding gene, and then the final results are outputted in the text box below. The results are sorted by gene name and sRNA expression counts in descending order for easy reference. After the operation is completed, the users can find all the results in the result folder.</p>
      <p>“Reverse Digger” is an improvement of our previous works [<xref rid="pone.0244480.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]; it can reversely identify regulatory sRNAs based on the cleavage sites on the target genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0244480.g002">Fig 2C</xref>). The improvement was carried out mainly in the following two aspects: a) The original algorithm is limited to identifying miRNA. However, the other sRNAs (such as ta-siRNA) can also specifically cleave the target transcripts; “Reverse Digger” reversely identifies almost all these regulatory sRNAs. b) The original algorithm only provides an analysis process, and the users need to develop a program and use different software to complete the relevant analysis; “Reverse Digger” is an integrated pipeline that can automatically complete the analysis by inputting the formatted data, which is very convenient for most biological researchers.</p>

      <title>Software evaluation</title>
      <p>We evaluated the sRNATargetDigger software on the sRNA-targets that have been reported in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. The corresponding benchmark data of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> collected from the literature [<xref rid="pone.0244480.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] included a total of 142 pairs of sRNA-target regulatory pairs. In plants, sRNAs are highly complementary to the target genes, and they often lead to the cleavage of the target gene mRNA by the Argonaute (AGO) protein; this specific cleavage can be detected using the degradome [<xref rid="pone.0244480.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0244480.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. We analyzed the regulatory relationship of 142 pairs of sRNA-targets. However, the results showed that no specific cleavage signal can be found using degradome in the middle of the sRNA binding site in 57 target genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0244480.s001">S1 Table</xref>). Therefore, the authenticity of the regulatory relationship in these 57 pairs of sRNA-targets needs to be further confirmed, and the possibility that their occurrence time was unmatched with the data set used for our verification could not be ruled out.</p>
      <p>The remaining 85 pairs of sRNA-targets with specific cleavage signals on the target genes passed the tests of the two analysis modules (“Forward Digger” and “Reverse Digger”) of sRNATargetDigger (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0244480.s002">S2 Table</xref>). As we expected, sRNATargetDigger found that the regulatory information reported in the literature [<xref rid="pone.0244480.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] was incomplete, and the co-regulatory sRNAs were missed for 69 target genes in one or more tissues, and 170 novel sRNA-target pairs were identified (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0244480.s002">S2 Table</xref>). The regulatory pair "ath-miR156a-5p-AT1G27360.4" was taken as an example, co-regulatory sRNAs had been found in all tissues except the root, they had almost the same complementarities and binding sites with the target genes, and the levels of AGO1 proteins was even higher than that of ath-miR156a-5p. Among these novel regulatory sRNAs, four were found in flowers (sRNA_AT_38, sRNA_AT_39, sRNA_AT_40, sRNA_AT_17) and the other two (sRNA_AT_39, sRNA_AT_40) were found in leaves and seedlings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0244480.g003">Fig 3</xref>).</p>

      <p>As most of the newly discovered co-regulatory sRNAs have not been reported previously, their functions in regulating the targets need to be further confirmed by other credible methods. PAREsnip2 [<xref rid="pone.0244480.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] was chosen to perform this confirmation and the 85 pairs of miRNA-targets supported by the literature [<xref rid="pone.0244480.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] were re-analysed. As a result of this experiment, 144 out of 170 novel co-regulatory sRNA-target pairs identified by sRNATargetDigger passed the examination. For the control, 81 out of 85 miRNA-target pairs passed the test (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0244480.s003">S3 Table</xref>). Thus, the credibility of the regulatory relationship in these novel co-regulatory sRNA-target pairs was confirmed using PAREsnip2.</p>
      <p>Interestingly, a study has shown that some sRNA-target regulatory relationships collected from the literature [<xref rid="pone.0244480.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] exhibit actually tissue-specific weak regulatory relationships. Taken "ath-miR167c-5p —&gt; ARF8 (AT5G37020.2)" as an example, only in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> roots, ath-miR167c-5p was found to be involved in the regulation of ARF8 as a low-expression co-regulatory sRNA. In the other three tissues (flowers, leaves and seedlings), its regulatory role was found to be negligible due to a relatively low-expression level, which cannot pass the “Forward Digger” test. When “Reverse Digger” was used to reversely search the regulatory sRNAs of ARF8, it was found that ath-miR167a-5p was the main regulator of ARF8. Its expression in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> flowers, leaves, roots, and seedlings was very high, and had a good match with the target genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0244480.g004">Fig 4</xref>). This finding is consistent with the results of the transgenic experiment by Wu et al., which found that MIR167a (ath-miR167a-5p precursor) was the major functional miR167 precursor <italic>in vivo</italic>, whereas MIR167c (ath-miR167c-5p precursor) had a weak regulatory effect on ARF8 [<xref rid="pone.0244480.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. In addition, sRNATargetDigger found that sRNA_AT_16 also has a co-regulatory effect on ARF8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0244480.g004">Fig 4</xref>).</p>

      <p>As we know, there are often many-to-many regulatory relationships in sRNAs-targets. When using the conventional degradome-based sRNA-target analysis software, the unknown co-regulatory sRNAs cannot be identified; thus, the obtained information is not comprehensive. The sRNATargetDigger by integrating with reverse mining technology, can solve this problem. The tests regarding sRNA-target in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> indeed found several co-regulatory sRNAs that were highly complementary to the target genes, with binding sites almost identical to known sRNAs. Notably, their expression levels in some tissues even exceeded those of known sRNAs, indicating that they may play a more important regulatory role. Among them, we found that the miRNA family members with high sequence identity often regulated some common target genes; the relevant results agreed also with the literature. For example, ath-miR169a-5p and ath-miR169d have been shown to co-regulate NFYA2 (AT3G05690.1) [<xref rid="pone.0244480.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0244480.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]; ath-miR172b and ath-miR172c to co-regulate AP2 (AT4G36920.1) [<xref rid="pone.0244480.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0244480.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]; ath-miR396a-5p and ath-miR396b-5p to co-regulate the GRF family (AT2G22840.1, AT4G37740.1, AT2G36400.1, AT3G52910.1 and AT2G45480.1) [<xref rid="pone.0244480.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Therefore, based on the degradome and sRNA HTS data, sRNATargetDigger can help researchers to build a more comprehensive and reliable sRNA-target regulatory relationship.</p>

    <title>Conclusions</title>
    <p>Based on HTS data analysis, we developed a novel software named sRNATargetDigger that has two function modules “Forward Digger” and “Reverse Digger”, and this software can identify regulatory sRNA-target pairs bidirectionally. Compared to the other sRNA-target mining softwares, it has the ability to identify unknown sRNAs co-regulating the same target, so as to reveal a more comprehensive and reliable sRNA-target regulatory relationship. When the published sRNA-target pairs in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> were re-examined, all the sRNA-targets with specific cleavage signals on the target genes passed the tests of sRNATargetDigger. Moreover, it identified 170 novel co-regulatory sRNA-target pairs. The developed pipeline can automatically complete the analysis only by inputting data. Therefore, this software may be a popular prediction tool for the plant biologists in sRNA-target research.</p>
