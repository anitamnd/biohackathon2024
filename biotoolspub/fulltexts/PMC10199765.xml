      <p>Deciphering cell-type-specific 3D structures of chromatin is challenging. Here, we present InferLoop, a novel method for inferring the strength of chromatin interaction using single-cell chromatin accessibility data. The workflow of InferLoop is, first, to conduct signal enhancement by grouping nearby cells into bins, and then, for each bin, leverage accessibility signals for loop signals using a newly constructed metric that is similar to the perturbation of the Pearson correlation coefficient. In this study, we have described three application scenarios of InferLoop, including the inference of cell-type-specific loop signals, the prediction of gene expression levels and the interpretation of intergenic loci. The effectiveness and superiority of InferLoop over other methods in those three scenarios are rigorously validated by using the single-cell 3D genome structure data of human brain cortex and human blood, the single-cell multi-omics data of human blood and mouse brain cortex, and the intergenic loci in the GWAS Catalog database as well as the GTEx database, respectively. In addition, InferLoop can be applied to predict loop signals of individual spots using the spatial chromatin accessibility data of mouse embryo.

    <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
    <p>Nowadays, single-cell chromatin accessibility sequencing (e.g. scATAC-seq) is widely used for deciphering the heterogeneity of regulatory epigenome [<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], and a growing number of computational tools have been developed for making good use of such data [<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. In a biological study that focuses on elucidating the mechanisms underlying genome function, the analysis of scATAC-seq data generally starts by using well-established computational frameworks, such as CellRanger [<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] and Signac [<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], for data preprocessing (reads mapping, quality control, peaks calling and dimension reduction), followed by the cell type annotation and the differentially accessible peak identification [<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Beyond such conventional analyses, people are pursuing innovative approaches to decipher the scATAC-seq data, including describing the activity of DNA binding proteins based on the motif analysis [<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], inferring the developmental trajectory using the chromatin velocity [<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] and leveraging the signals of chromatin accessibility for chromatin loops [<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p>
    <p>Characterizing the 3D structure of chromatin is an effective way to uncover how genetic information determines cell fates [<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13–15</xref>]. Currently, several high-throughput techniques have been developed to capture the chromatin conformation [<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], such as Hi-C [<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], ChIA-PET [<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] and HiChIP [<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Instead of using bulk tissue as input, the most cutting-edge technology can capture the 3D genome structure of single cells [<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20–22</xref>]. However, the experimental procedure is still complicated, preventing its wide application in large-scale studies. Unlike single-cell 3D genome structure sequencing, scATAC-seq is relatively simple, efficient and now widespread [<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23–25</xref>]. Plenty of scATAC-seq data have been generated from existing studies, such as a recently published single-cell atlas of chromatin accessibility in the human genome [<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. With the help of computational tools, researchers can leverage the signal of chromatin accessibility for chromatin loops [<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. However, most previously published tools, like EpiTensor [<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] and C3D [<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], are designed for bulk data. Existing single-cell tools, including Cicero [<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] and ArchR [<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], use the co-accessibility of peaks to identify potential chromatin loops but fail to output the exact loop signals of individual cell clusters, preventing researchers from deciphering the 3D genome structure of different cell types.</p>
    <p>Increasingly, studies have now revealed that identifying cell-type-specific chromatin structures is critical to elucidate the mechanism of cell fate determination [<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] and the pathogenesis of multiple diseases [<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31–33</xref>]. For example, Winick-Ng <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> described an experimental method named immunoGAM for mapping 3D chromatin topology in specific brain cell types [<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] and showed that the particular chromatin 3D structure of neuron subtypes is related to the gene regulation involved in specialized biological processes, such as addiction and synaptic plasticity. Besides, Perez <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> identified a list of cell-type-specific eQTL (expression quantitative trait loci) [<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] and unveiled that autoimmune-disease-associated genes, like <italic toggle="yes">ORMDL3</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">GSDMB</italic> [<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], are regulated by different eQTL in different cell types. As such, it is urgent to build a computational tool for accurately inferring the chromatin loop signals of different cell types using single-cell chromatin accessibility data.</p>
    <p>Here, we present InferLoop, a novel method for predicting loop signals of individual cell clusters using single-cell chromatin accessibility data (loops are identified by evaluating the co-accessibility of peaks). After conducting signal enhancement by grouping nearby cells into bins, InferLoop is designed to infer bins’ loop signals using bins’ accessibility signals. The inferred loop signal (ILS) is measured by a newly constructed metric that is similar to the perturbation of the Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) when adding each bin to all bins, which is inspired by the study of Liu <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> [<xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] (the original study of Liu <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> uses the perturbation of the correlation to build genes’ network). In this study, we have described three application scenarios of InferLoop, including the inference of cell-type-specific loop signals, the prediction of gene expression levels and the interpretation of intergenic loci. The superiority of InferLoop over other methods is validated by using multiple datasets with cutting-edge sequencing technologies, including the single-cell 3D genome structure data of human brain cortex [<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] and human blood [<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], the single-cell multi-omics data of human blood (10x Genomic Multiome dataset) and mouse brain cortex [<xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], and the intergenic loci in the GWAS Catalog database [<xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] and the GTEx database (GTEx Analysis v8 eQTL). Last but not least, InferLoop has shown the ability in accurately predicting loop signals of individual spots using the spatial chromatin accessibility (spatial-ATAC-seq) data of mouse embryo [<xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>].</p>

      <title>The calculation of ILS</title>
      <p>The overall study design of the computational framework and its applications are illustrated in <xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>. Briefly speaking, the first step is to conduct signal enhancement by grouping nearby cells into bins (based on <italic toggle="yes">k</italic>-means clustering, see Material and Methods). Second, for each bin, the accessibility signals are leveraged by InferLoop for loop signals. Third, the ILS is applied to obtain cell-type-specific loop signals, predict gene expression levels and interpret intergenic loci. Finally, multiple publicly available datasets are collected and used to validate the effectiveness of InferLoop. It should be noted that the input of InferLoop includes two files: The first file is a matrix of peak signals (row names are peaks; column names are bins), whereas the second file is a list of loops that are predicted by Cicero. Details of data preprocessing are provided in Material and Methods.</p>

        <graphic xlink:href="bbad166f1" position="float"/>
      </fig>
      <p>For a given loop that links two different peaks, the mission of InferLoop is to calculate the ILS of each bin. Since previous studies have already shown the effectiveness of using co-accessibility in predicting chromatin loops [<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], to quantify the loop signals of each bin, we aim to find a metric for measuring the perturbation of the co-accessibility when adding each bin to all bins. To this end, the most straightforward way is to use the PCC to represent the co-accessibility and assign the perturbation of the PCC as the ILS. It is worth noting that the deviation of PCC’s perturbation varies along with PCC’s value and the total number of bins, which is described in the study of Liu <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> [<xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. We, therefore, follow the formula proposed by Liu <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> to adjust the deviation of PCC’s perturbation (Formula 1 in <xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). However, as shown in <xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2(A)</xref>, the formula proposed by Liu <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> gives high ILS to some bins with extremely low signals (in both two peaks), which is intuitively inappropriate because of the over-valuation of bins with low signals. To verify our intuitive thought, we analyze the scATAC-seq data of the human frontal cortex [<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] and select a loop with the highest co-accessibility score (calculated by Cicero) among all loops near a well-known marker gene (<italic toggle="yes">PDGFRA</italic> [<xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>, <xref rid="ref41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]) of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs). Because the selected loop (chr4: 55093634–55094466 to chr4:55306011–55307162, hg19) is close to the TSS (transcription start site) (chr4:55095264, hg19) of <italic toggle="yes">PDGFRA</italic>, we expect that OPC has higher loop signals than other cell types. As can be seen in <xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2(A)</xref>, for the selected loop, OPC does have the highest real loop signals (derived from single-cell 3D genome structure data [<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]), and bins of OPC tend to be located in the top-right of the accessibility signal plot. This result suggests that bins with low signals should not be assigned with high ILS. In addition to the selected loop, we also check multiple loops near markers of other cell types (such as <italic toggle="yes">GJA1</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">MBP</italic>), and they show similar patterns (data not shown).</p>

      <p>Besides the over-valuation of bins with low signals, the low computational efficiency is another weak point of Formula 1 in <xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2(A)</xref>, which is caused by the calculation of the new PCC (PCC<sub>i</sub>) when adding each bin to all bins. To overcome those two weak points, we develop a set of new formulas for calculating the ILS (Formula 2–5 in <xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>, the detailed derivation process of Formula 2–5 is provided at <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>). As shown in <xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2(B) and (C)</xref>, the parameter ‘<italic toggle="yes">r</italic>’ in Formula 2 is used for adjusting the distribution of ILS, whereas Formula 4 is used for accelerating the computational speed (when ‘<italic toggle="yes">r</italic>’ is equal to 1, ‘<italic toggle="yes">D<sub>i</sub></italic>’ is approximately equal to PCC<italic toggle="yes"><sub>i</sub></italic>). For example, when dealing with 10 000 bins, the calculation of Formula 1 takes more than 20 seconds. In contrast, the calculation of our ILS (<italic toggle="yes">r</italic> = 1) takes less than 1 second (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 2A</xref>), showing the high computational efficiency of our method. By adjusting the value of ‘<italic toggle="yes">r</italic>’, we notice that if ‘<italic toggle="yes">r</italic>’ is equal to 0, those bins with low signal will not be assigned with high ILS. To test the efficacy of our ILS in representing the real loop signal, we use the signal of the selected loop (near the TSS of <italic toggle="yes">PDGFRA</italic>) to calculate the ILS (<italic toggle="yes">r</italic> = 0). As can be seen in <xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>, our ILS (<italic toggle="yes">r</italic> = 0) shows a smaller <italic toggle="yes">P</italic>-value (0.0006) than that of Liu <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> (0.007) when comparing the ILS between the OPC and other cell types, indicating that our ILS (<italic toggle="yes">r</italic> = 0) is better suited to represent the real loop signal of bins.

      <title>The inference of cell-type-specific loop signal</title>
      <p>The most straightforward application scenario of InferLoop is to predict cell-type-specific loop signals. To validate the effectiveness of InferLoop in this scenario, we have proposed a detailed workflow (<xref rid="f3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). First, cells in the scATAC-seq data are assigned into different cell types. Second, a list of candidate loops is predicted by Cicero. Third, we use InferLoop, together with other tested metrics, to predict cell-type-specific loop signals. Fourth, the single-cell 3D genome structure data are used to assign real loop signals of each cell type to candidate loops. Finally, the comparison between real and predicted signals is illustrated by using consensus matrix. As shown in <xref rid="f3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3(A)</xref>, real and predicted signals of the same cell type are expected to have high similarity (positive correlation), while other pairs in the consensus matrix should have a relatively low similarity. Here, we have prepared three other metrics for predicting loop signals: mean, harmonic mean and the metric proposed by Liu <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>. (<xref rid="f3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). It is worth noting that a previously published method named EpiTensor (designed for bulk data) used geometric mean as their metric [<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], and we have found that the output of harmonic mean is similar to that of geometric mean (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 2C</xref>). In addition, the harmonic mean shows a better result than the geometric mean in our benchmark (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 2C</xref>). Therefore, in our following study, we compare the ILS of InferLoop with the harmonic mean, but not the geometric mean.</p>

      <p>The scATAC-seq data and the paired single-cell 3D genome structure data of the first benchmark are derived from the studies of Zhang <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> [<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] and Lee <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> [<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], respectively. Both of those studies have involved normal samples of the human frontal cortex, and their data have matched cell types: astrocyte (Astro), microglia (MG), excitatory neuron (Neuron.Ex), inhibitory neuron (Neuron.In), oligodendrocyte (ODC) and oligodendrocyte progenitor cell (OPC). Here, we use the difference between the averaged PCCs of cell-type matched pairs (in the consensus matrix) and the maximum PCC of the unmatched pairs to evaluate the genome-wide performance of different metrics (the difference of PCCs is defined as ΔPCC, the higher the better). To illustrate the effectiveness and robustness of InferLoop, we first apply InferLoop to this benchmark and test the performance with different ‘<italic toggle="yes">r</italic>’. InferLoop gets the highest ΔPCC (0.141) when <italic toggle="yes">r</italic> is equal to 0 (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 3</xref>), whereas the ΔPCC of other situations (<italic toggle="yes">r</italic> is varied from −2 to 2) ranges from −0.536 to 0.132, demonstrating that InferLoop can achieve high accuracy when setting <italic toggle="yes">r</italic> at 0. Second, we test the performance of InferLoop by using different number of bins and top loops (the loops predicted by Cicero is reversely ranked by the co-accessibility, and top loops are considered as loops with high quality). The performance of InferLoop is quite stable when changing the number of bins (ΔPCC ranges from 0.141 to 0.144 when the number of bins ranges from 50 to 200; <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 4A</xref> and <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 5</xref>), but the performance of InferLoop can be affected by the number of top loops (100k: 0.169, 200k: 0.141, 300k: 0.126, 400k: 0.118; <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 4B</xref>), suggesting that InferLoop still requires loops with high quality as input. In the following study, the default numbers of bins and loops are set at 100 and 200k, respectively. Finally, we apply other metrics to the benchmark (<xref rid="f3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>) and find that InferLoop gets the highest ΔPCC (0.141) compared with other metrics (mean: −0.17, harmonic mean: −0.019, the metric of Liu <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>: 0.034), showing the superiority of InferLoop over other metrics in predicting cell-type-specific loop signals. In addition, calling peak from scATAC-seq is also a critical step in InferLoop. We have tested the performance of InferLoop by using peaks called independently on each bin of cells and then combined. As shown in <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 6</xref>, when using peaks called from individual bins, a larger bin number can further improve the performance of InferLoop (from 0.141 to 0.151).</p>
      <p>Rather than aggregating loop signals of multiple bins to get the cell-type-specific loop signal, people can directly use Cicero to calculate the co-accessibility of loops in each cell type and assign the cell-type-specific co-accessibility as cell-type-specific loop signals (<xref rid="f4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). We have applied Cicero to calculate the cell-type-specific co-accessibility of loops in each cell type (<xref rid="f4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>) and found that it gets a relatively higher ΔPCC (0.094) than that of other metrics (ranging from −0.17 to 0.034) but still lower than that of InferLoop (0.141). In <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 7</xref>, we have used different ‘<italic toggle="yes">k</italic>’ to run Cicero and shown that ‘<italic toggle="yes">k</italic>’ will not significantly affect the performance of Cicero. We have provided a detailed workflow to demonstrate the way to use different metrics in <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 8</xref>. In addition to testing the performance of inferring loop signals, we then check whether InferLoop can be used for obtaining cell-type-specific loops. To this end, we use the built-in function of Seurat [<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] to identify cell-type markers from the matrix of loop signals, and assign the top 10 000 loops of each cell type as cell-type-specific loops (loops are ranked by <italic toggle="yes">P</italic>-values). The genomic tracks around marker genes of different cell types are illustrated in <xref rid="f4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref> and <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 9</xref> (Neuron.Ex: <italic toggle="yes">CBLN2</italic> [<xref rid="ref42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], Neuron.In: <italic toggle="yes">VIP</italic> [<xref rid="ref43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], Astro: <italic toggle="yes">GJA1</italic> [<xref rid="ref44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], OPC: <italic toggle="yes">PDGFRA</italic> [<xref rid="ref41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], ODC: <italic toggle="yes">MBP</italic> [<xref rid="ref45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], MG: <italic toggle="yes">P2RY12</italic> [<xref rid="ref46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]). As shown in <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 9</xref>, the specificity of each marker is confirmed using the scRNA-seq data of human brain samples [<xref rid="ref47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. We notice that, in a number of regions around cell-type-specific marker genes, the predicted cell-type-specific loops are consistent with real signals of chromatin conformation. For example, in the genome track around <italic toggle="yes">GJA1</italic> (a marker of astrocyte) (<xref rid="f4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>), astrocytes have obviously more predicted cell-type-specific loops than other cell types, which is in line with the intensive real chromatin connection signal within the same region. Moreover, we randomly select one loop that links to the TSS of <italic toggle="yes">GJA1</italic> (chr6:121756574–121756787 to chr6:121913981–121914664, hg19) and confirm that those bins of astrocytes do have a higher ILS than that of other cell types (<xref rid="f4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>).

      <p>Recently, a research group has published a study [<xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] that includes the spatial-ATAC-seq data of mouse embryo (E13) (<xref rid="f5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). Since each spot (spot size: 50 μm) on the spatial image may include multiple cells (cell size: 1~10 μm) and the library size of spatial-ATAC-seq data is relatively larger than that of general scATAC-seq, the chromatin accessibility signal of the spatial data (around 100 000 reads per spot) is much higher than that of single-cell data (around several thousand reads per cell). Therefore, we would like to check whether InferLoop can be directly used for predicting the ILS of individual spots without generating bins. For this purpose, we first apply InferLoop to get the ILS of each spot. Second, the spatial spots are grouped into seven clusters (clusters 0 to 6) based on the signals of chromatin accessibility (<xref rid="f5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>). According to the original study [<xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], spots in cluster 5 are located in the region of the mouse liver, which is verified by checking the gene activity (the chromatin accessibility signal around the TSS of a given gene) of <italic toggle="yes">Sptb</italic> (<xref rid="f5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>), a marker for erythrocytes that are enriched in mouse embryonic liver [<xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>].

As shown in <xref rid="f5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>, in the genome track around <italic toggle="yes">Sptb</italic>, spots in cluster 5 have more identified cluster-specific loops than other clusters.

By now, InferLoop shows a good performance in predicting the ILS of each spatial spot. However, a comprehensive assessment is lacking due to the absence of matched spatial chromatin conformation data.</p>

      <title>The prediction of gene expression levels</title>
      <p>Considering that the scATAC-seq data of human blood is derived from a single-cell multi-omics dataset, each cell in this dataset has two types of sequencing signals (scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq). Since InferLoop can be used for inferring loop signal based on the signal of chromatin accessibility, whether InferLoop can be used for predicting gene expression levels is an interesting question. To this end, we first search for TSSs (the region of each TSS is extended by 1000 bp on both sides) that are overlapped with the loops predicted by Cicero. Second, for a given TSS having at least one overlapped loop, we define the aggregated signals of all overlapped loops as the gene’s loop signal (GLS) (<xref rid="f6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>). Finally, after calculating the correlation between GLS and gene expression level (the expression level is normalized and standardized), matched cell types of scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq data are clustered together in the consensus matrix (<xref rid="f6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>). Here, InferLoop is shown to get a higher ΔPCC (0.422) than that of other metrics (gene activity: 0.276, mean: 0.229, harmonic mean: 0.157, the metric of Liu <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>: −0.603, coaccess: −0.188) (<xref rid="f6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref>). Besides using the dataset of human blood, we collect another single-cell multi-omics dataset derived from the mouse brain cortex [<xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. As shown in <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 10</xref>, InferLoop consistently gets the highest ΔPCC (0.012) among all tested metrics (ranging from −0.632 to −0.022). The results of those two single-cell multi-omics datasets suggest that the GLS of InferLoop can be used for accurately predicting the expression level of genes. Nevertheless, the GLS only can be applied to genes overlapped with loops (4466 and 11 002 genes in the datasets of human blood and mouse brain cortex, respectively), which may limit its application scope and still needs further investigation. For above testing results (use ΔPCC to measure the performance of different metrics), we have conducted statistical test and provided boxplot in <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 11</xref>.</p>

      <title>The interpretation of intergenic loci</title>
      <p>The last application scenario of InferLoop is to interpret the intergenic loci. Specifically, this application scenario contains two purposes: (i) to identify cell types that are related to a given trait (disease or phenotype); (ii) to identify intergenic loci that regulate trait’s causal genes in a given cell type. To test whether InferLoop can achieve the first purpose, we build a workflow presented in <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 12</xref>. First, we download the information of SNPs (single-nucleotide polymorphisms) from the GWAS Catalog database [<xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] and then filter out SNPs located within the region of genes (the region of each gene body is extended by 10 000 bp on both sides). Second, we define the aggregated signal of all overlapped loops as the trait score (TS). Third, to test whether the trait score can be used for identifying cell types related to the given trait, we calculate the TS of cell-type-specific traits (we search for traits whose names contain the name of cell types) in the scATAC-seq data of human blood (10× Genomic Multiome dataset). Finally, we compare the TS of cell-type-specific traits in different cell types, and define the difference of TS’s quantile between the cell-type matched pair and the highest unmatched pair as the final score. As shown in <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 12</xref>, InferLoop (ILS, <italic toggle="yes">r</italic> = 0) achieves the highest final score (0.589) among all tested metrics (ranging from −0.499 to 0.517). It is worth noting that the simple mean (final score = 0.491) metric, in this case, is also good enough for cell-type identification (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 12</xref>). However, the higher final score of ILS (<italic toggle="yes">r</italic> = 0) suggests higher accuracy, which is consistent with other results in this study.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, we set up another workflow to test whether InferLoop can be used to achieve the first purpose (<xref rid="f7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref>). In this workflow, we collect scATAC-seq data (single-cell atlas of chromatin accessibility in the human genome [<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]) and eQTL data (GTEx Analysis v8 eQTL) of 26 human tissues. First, we merge nearby eQTL to avoid over counting some regions with intensive eQTL. We combine the eQTL of all 26 tissues to get 3 314 371 eQTL and merge nearby eQTL (using 1000 bp to identify nearby sites) to get 190 464 eQTL clusters. Second, we filter out eQTL clusters located within the region of genes (the region of each gene is extended by 10 000 bp on both sides) and keep eQTL clusters that are likely to be <italic toggle="yes">cis</italic>-regulatory elements of their target genes (&lt;500 000 bp, refer to previous studies [<xref rid="ref48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>, <xref rid="ref49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]). Totally, we get 81 329 eQTL clusters (in average, 6284 bp per cluster). Third, for each tissue, we artificially build a list of loops based on the matched pairs of eQTL clusters and TSS regions of target genes. Then, we assign −log<sub>10</sub>(<italic toggle="yes">P</italic>-value) (the nominal <italic toggle="yes">P</italic>-value is derived from the single-tissue <italic toggle="yes">cis</italic>-QTL data in the GTEx database) as the real loop signal (because a single eQTL cluster may contain multiple eQTL, we assign the median value as the real loop signal to avoid the influence of outliers) and assign the cell-type-specific ILS as the predicted loop signal. Finally, we calculate the correlation (PCC) between the real loop signal of 26 tissues and the predicted loop signal of 158 cell types. As eQTL are shown to have cell-type specificity [<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], the highest PCC’s rank of cell types with the matched tissue type (RMT) is expected to be higher than that of randomly selected cell types with unmatched tissue types. When using InferLoop to get the predicted loop signal, the highest RMT, as expected, is shown to be higher than the highest rank of randomly selected cell types with unmatched tissue types (<xref rid="f7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B</xref> and C). As an example, for the real loop signal of skin tissue, the predicted loop signal of ‘Skin_Epidermal’ gets the highest PCC among all 158 cell types. Furthermore, we have conducted a permutation test by constructing random background. As shown in <xref rid="f7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7C</xref>, InferLoop achieves the highest quantile value of the random background (99.4%) compared with other metrics (ranging from 0.4 to 80.2%), showing the effectiveness of InferLoop in identifying cell types that are related to a given trait.</p>

      <p>To test whether InferLoop can be applied to achieve the second purpose (i.e. identify intergenic loci that regulate trait’s causal genes in a given cell type), we investigate those disease-related intergenic loci using the scATAC-seq data of human blood (10x Genomic Multiome dataset). First, we filter out SNPs (GWAS Catalog) located within the region of genes (the region of each gene is extended by 10 000 bp on both sides). Second, we use InferLoop to calculate the ILS of loops with at least one SNP. Finally, we assign loops to different cell types based on the value of ILS. In the trait named ‘Systemic Lupus Erythematosus’, T cell, B cell and monocyte get a similar percentage of loops (T cell: 34%, B cell: 29%, monocyte: 37%), while T cell gets an extremely large percentage of loops (90.9%) in the trait named ‘Psoriasis’. It is worth noting that, in ‘Psoriasis’, we identify an intergenic SNP (rs7933433) that is intensively linked by loops (20 loops, the highest number among SNPs of all cell types) in T cell (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 13</xref>). For the genomic region around the identified SNP, we noticed that Chandra <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> recently reported a multi-enhancer hub (in mouse genome) that can control T-cell differentiation and allergic inflammation through 3D genome topology [<xref rid="ref50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. By mapping the human peak region (chr11:128324060–128325230, hg38) containing the identified intergenic SNP (rs7933433, chr11:128324555, hg38) to the mouse genome, we find that the mapped peak region (chr9:32910554–32911593, mm10) is exactly located in the same region with the multi-enhancer hub reported by Chandra <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> (chr9:32904069–32928966, mm10) (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 14</xref>), indicating that InferLoop can be used to identify intergenic loci that regulate trait’s causal genes in a given cell type. Nevertheless, more <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> experiments are still required to validate the clinical relevance of those intergenic SNPs identified by InferLoop.</p>

    <title>DISCUSSION</title>
    <p>The development of InferLoop begins from an intuitive assumption that the perturbation of the correlation between accessibility signals can be used for quantifying the strength of the chromatin interaction in different cell clusters (bins). The intuitive assumption is inspired by the study of Liu <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> [<xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. The original idea of Liu <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>. is to use the perturbation of the correlation for building genes’ network, which is well acknowledged and widely used by plenty of studies [<xref rid="ref51" ref-type="bibr">51–54</xref>]. However, according to our study, the intuitive assumption fails to handle those bins having low accessibility signals, which drives us to build a new method, named InferLoop, for accurately leveraging the chromatin accessibility signals for interaction signals. As we know, one of the most challenging parts of applying a mathematical model to predict biological signals is to prove its effectiveness in dealing with a wide range of practical scenarios. To this end, we have conducted a series of analyses to illustrate the effectiveness and versatility of our method. First, we use InferLoop to predict cell-type-specific loop signals from the scATAC-seq data of human frontal cortex [<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] and human blood (10x Genomic Multiome dataset), and compare the predicted signals with the real signals derived from the matched single-cell 3D genome structure data [<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The high correlation between predicted and real signals indicates the high accuracy of InferLoop. Second, using a recently published spatial-ATAC-seq dataset [<xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], InferLoop is shown to be capable of predicting ILS of individual spatial spots, highlighting the practical value of InferLoop in handling cutting-edge sequencing techniques. Third, ILS can be used to predict gene expression levels. We have used the single-cell multi-omics data of human blood (10x Genomic Multiome dataset) and mouse brain cortex [<xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] to illustrate the superiority of InferLoop over other methods, suggesting the expandability of InferLoop. Finally, we build three computational frameworks, which use SNPs in the GWAS Catalog database [<xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] and the GTEx database (GTEx Analysis v8 eQTL), to exhibit the strength of InferLoop in interpreting intergenic loci, revealing the potential clinical value of Inferloop. As such, we have rigorously validated the effectiveness and versatility of our method.</p>
    <p>In this study, the innovative points can be summarized into two parts: the algorithm design and the construction of the benchmark dataset. For the algorithm design, we have modified the mathematical model proposed by Liu <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> [<xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. We design a parameter ‘<italic toggle="yes">r</italic>’ for adjusting the distribution of ILS, which allows the ILS to accurately describe the relationship between chromatin accessibility signals and interaction signals. We have also provided a new formula for accelerating the computational efficiency of updated PCCs. We can use the new formula to infer loop signals, and other researchers can use it to build genes’ network as well. Besides modifying the mathematical model, we have built a series of computational workflows for validating the effectiveness of InferLoop in multiple aspects. Those workflows can be used to evaluate future algorithms’ performance. For the construction of benchmark datasets, we try to take advantage of data generated by cutting-edge sequencing technologies, such as single-cell 3D genome structure sequencing, single-cell multi-omics sequencing and spatial-ATAC sequencing. Those advanced sequencing technologies provide the most up-to-date gold standard for representing real biological signals and help us conduct a series of comprehensive benchmark analyses.</p>
    <p>However, there are still some weaknesses in this study. First, the most straightforward one is about the input data of InferLoop. So far, we only focus on loops predicted by evaluating the co-accessibility of peaks, but ignore those chromatin interactions occurring in other regions. To solve this problem, we plan to explore the possibility of using InferLoop to process other types of data, such as single-cell CUT&amp;Tag data [<xref rid="ref55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>, <xref rid="ref56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>], which is beyond the scope of ‘chromatin accessibility’ and will be done in the future. Second, the current method only deals with pairwise co-accessibility, and those multiple peak interactions are also essential for understanding the regulatory function of genomic elements, which is an important direction for future work. Third, Lin <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> recently found that the ultralong distance (&gt;megabases) enhancer network has a nested multilayer architecture that confers functional robustness of gene expression [<xref rid="ref57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>], suggesting that the distance between enhancers and genes should be studied. However, we here use Cicero to predict loops and the default upper limitation of distance is only 500 kb, and the accuracy of Cicero for predicting ultralong distance loops needs more evaluations, which still needs further investigation. Fourth, using multi-omics data can improve the accuracy of predicting loops. For example, Zeng <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> have developed a method, named DC3 [<xref rid="ref58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>], for deconvolution and coupled clustering from bulk and single-cell genomics data. The usage of multi-omics data and multi type (bulk and single-cell) data is also a future direction for improving InferLoop. Finally, in the section of interpreting intergenic loci, we only use computational workflows to validate the effectiveness of InferLoop, which is insufficient for supporting the clinical value of InferLoop. Therefore, we are now doing experiments to explore the functions of intergenic loci identified by InferLoop. Nevertheless, InferLoop has already shown a more reliable performance than other methods in various application scenarios. As such, we believe that this study’s algorithm and benchmark datasets should be of great use for accelerating both computational and experimental studies to decipher the 3D genome structure in the complex background of cell-type heterogeneity.</p>

    <title>MATERIAL AND METHODS</title>
    <sec id="sec11">
      <title>Data processing for scATAC-seq and scRNA-seq</title>
      <p>InferLoop requires two input files: a matrix of peak signals and a list of loops that are predicted by evaluating the co-accessibility of peaks. In the matrix of peak signals, the row names are peaks’ IDs of the scATAC-seq data, while the column names are bins. In this study, we use Signac (version = 1.7.0) [<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] to process the scATAC-seq data. First, the raw fragment file of scATAC-seq data is processed by using ‘CreateFragmentObject’ and ‘FeatureMatrix’ functions. Second, the peaks of chromatin accessibility signals are identified by using the function named ‘CallPeaks’ (the peak calling algorithm used by Signac is MACS2 (version = 2.2.7.1) [<xref rid="ref59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]). Third, signal normalization and dimension reduction are conducted by using a series of functions named ‘RunTFIDF’, ‘FindTopFeatures’, ‘RunSVD’ and ‘RunUMAP’. ‘RunUMAP’ function is in the package named Seurat (version = 4.1.1). Fourth, bins are generated by using the ‘kmeans’ function in R (version = 4.2.0) based on the coordinates of UMAP. The default number of bins is 100. The matrix of peak signals is finalized by the function named ‘.generate_mean’ (in the package named BEER, version = 0.1.9, [<xref rid="ref60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]) for getting the average value of normalized signals of each peak in each bin. Finally, loops are predicted using the ‘run_cicero’ function (from Cicero, version = 1.14.0, [<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], an R package). It is worth noting that the function named ‘glasso’ (in the package named glasso [<xref rid="ref61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]) used by Cicero has non-termination issues, and we replaced it with a function named ‘glassoFast’ (version = 1.0, <ext-link xlink:href="https://github.com/JClavel/glassoFast" ext-link-type="uri">https://github.com/JClavel/glassoFast</ext-link>). The default number of used loops is 200 000. In the Results section, we have tested the robustness of InferLoop in the analysis of different numbers of bins and used loops. For the scRNA-seq data, we use the ‘NormalizeData’ (with the option of ‘LogNormalize’) and ‘ScaleData’ in Seurat [<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] to get the normalized and standardized expression signals, respectively.</p>

      <title>Data processing for single-cell 3D genome structure and spatial-ATAC-seq</title>
      <p>For the single-cell 3D genome structure data of human frontal cortex [<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], we directly get the chromatin conformation file (resolution: 1 kb) of each cell type in COOL format [<xref rid="ref62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>] and use the tool named Cooler (version = 0.8.10) [<xref rid="ref62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>] to process the data. ‘L2_3’, ‘L4’ and ‘L5’ files are merged into ‘Neuron.Ex’, whereas ‘Ndnf’, ‘Pvalb’, ‘Sst’ and ‘Vip’ files are merged into ‘Neuron.In’. Read count signals of each cell type are normalized using the function named ‘RunTFIDF’ in Signac. For the single-cell 3D genome structure data of human blood [<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], we get the chromatin conformation file of each cell in BEDPE format (genome version: hg19) and use the tool named ‘liftOverBedpe.py’ (<ext-link xlink:href="https://github.com/dphansti/liftOverBedpe" ext-link-type="uri">https://github.com/dphansti/liftOverBedpe</ext-link>) to get BEDPE files of the genome version (hg38) matched with the scATAC-seq data (10x Genomic Multiome dataset). We use Cooler for converting the BEDPE files to COOL files. Because the original study contains only one B cell (totally contains 18 normal cells of human blood) [<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], according to the original study, we select one cell for each cell type to avoid the imbalance of cell numbers (T cell: ‘pbmc_01’, B cell: ‘pbmc_02’, Monocyte: ‘pbmc_09’) and use a relatively large bin size to enhance the signal (resolution: 10 kb). For the spatial-ATAC-seq data, we follow the workflow of processing scATAC-seq data to process the raw fragment file. Because the image file of the spatial-ATAC-seq data in the GEO database (GSE171943) is fuzzy, we obtain the image in high resolution from the figure of the original paper [<xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. We use Seurat [<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] to process the spatial data, in which functions named ‘Read10X_Image’, ‘SpatialFeaturePlot’ and ‘VlnPlot’ are used for loading the image, visualizing different types of signals (gene activity and loop signal) of spatial spots and comparing loop signals of different clusters, respectively. ‘Gene activity’ is defined as the chromatin accessibility signal around the TSS (transcription start site) of a given gene.</p>

      <title>Statistical analysis and data formatting</title>
      <p>In this study, statistical analyses are done by using functions and packages implemented in R and Python. PCC is used to quantify the correlation level, and is calculated by using the function named ‘cor’ in R and the package ‘scipy’ (version = 1.5.4) in Python (version = 3.7.9). The function named ‘t.test’ in R is used to conduct Student’s <italic toggle="yes">t</italic>-test. Cell-type (or cluster)-specific loops (marker loops) are identified by using the function named ‘FindAllMarkers’ (in Seurat [<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]) with the option of ‘t’. Heatmaps are generated by using ‘ComplexHeatmap’ (version = 2.12.0) package [<xref rid="ref63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. Besides using R to conduct statistical analyses, a series of other tools are used for data formatting. Bedtools (version = 2.29.1) [<xref rid="ref64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>], Cooler [<xref rid="ref62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>] and HiCExplorer (version = 3.7.2) [<xref rid="ref65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>] are used for processing files in BED, COOL and H5 (an intermediate format for processing chromatin conformation data) formats, respectively.</p>
