      <title>Abstract</title>
      <p>Splicing is one key mechanism determining the state of any eukaryotic cell. Apart from linear splice variants, circular splice variants (circRNAs) can arise via non-canonical splicing involving a <italic toggle="yes">back-splice junction</italic> (BSJ). Most existing methods only identify circRNAs via the corresponding BSJ, but do not aim to estimate their full sequence identity or to identify different, alternatively spliced circular isoforms arising from the same BSJ. We here present <sc>CYCLeR</sc>, the first computational method for identifying the full sequence identity of new and alternatively spliced circRNAs and their abundances while simultaneously co-estimating the abundances of known linear splicing isoforms. We show that <sc>CYCLeR</sc> significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of F score and quantification of transcripts in simulated data. In a in a comparative study with long-read data, we also show the advantages of <sc>CYCLeR</sc> compared to existing methods. When analysing <italic toggle="yes">Drosophila melanogaster</italic> data, <sc>CYCLeR</sc> uncovers biological patterns of circRNA expression that other methods fail to observe.</p>

    <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
    <p>One major source of complexity in eukaryotes is splicing, whereby one gene can give rise to a number of splicing products depending on the cell’s state (tissue, developmental stage, disease state etc.). Splicing not only gives rise to linear splicing isoforms, but—interestingly—has also been recently shown to yield so-called circular splice variants or isoforms (circRNAs). These arise via a so-called <italic toggle="yes">back-splice junction</italic>, when a downstream 5’ splice site is covalently linked to an upstream 3’ splice site (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). The corresponding junction is called a back-splice junction (BSJ).</p>
    <p>For decades, scientists have focused almost exclusively on linear splice variants and their functional roles. This focus, however, has recently shifted towards circRNAs (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>-<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). While the molecular functions of select circRNAs have already been identified (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3–7</xref>), we are only beginning to understand the mechanisms by which circRNAs arise and the functional roles they play <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic>.</p>
    <p>Since circRNAs constitute a form of alternative splicing of the nascent RNA transcript (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>), the raw RNA-seq reads deriving from linear and circular splicing isoforms of one and the same gene cannot be easily used to reliably infer any new circRNAs and their abundance, see Figure <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. Only RNA-seq reads spanning a <italic toggle="yes">back-splice junction</italic> provide direct evidence for circRNAs. These reads, however, provide only limited information on the full sequence identity of the underlying circRNAs, thus making the proper identification and quantification of new circRNAs impossible.</p>

      <caption>
        <p><bold>Challenge of identifying circRNAs from RNA-seq data</bold>. Typical, raw transcriptome data from linear and circular splicing isoforms (top left and right) comprises a multitude of pair-end reads covering the exons of these isoforms (E1 etc., colouring of pair-end reads according to the exon from which they derive). In order to infer the original splicing products from these raw transcriptome reads, they are typically first mapped to the genome (bottom). Most of the mapped reads will not cover splice sites (exon-intron boundaries) and could either derive from a linear and circular splicing isoform. One challenge is that only reads spanning a <italic toggle="yes">back-splice junction</italic> provide direct evidence for circRNAs (marked in light green). As is also clear from this picture, the correct identification and quantification of circRNAs cannot be achieved without the simultaneous identification and quantification of the linear splicing isoforms. Thus, if the linear splicing isoforms of a gene are known up-front, their correct quantification needs to be estimated in conjunction with the identification and correct quantification of unknown circRNAs.</p>

    </fig>
    <p>The ultimate goal in transcriptome assembly is to identify the full sequence identity of all linear and circular splice variants and to estimate their relative abundances. The relative expression levels are key requirements for differential expression analyses and co-expression correlation analyses. Most existing methods for transcriptome assembly, however, ignore circRNAs and only focus on linear splicing isoforms. Commonly used transcriptome assembly programs (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>) are based on creating a directed acyclic splice graph whose nodes and edges are determined by the presence of forward junction spanning reads in the raw transcriptome data. These programs, however, cannot handle the cyclic splice graphs that the circRNAs represent.</p>
    <p>One added challenge is that circRNAs typically constitute only a small fraction of the transcriptome (1–3% of linear poly-A transcripts in common cell lines (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>)), thus making the identification of circRNAs via an increased RNA-seq library depth no viable option. In addition, the expression of linear splicing isoforms from the same gene locus can significantly skew the circular transcript assembly. For efficient circRNA detection, there is thus the need for an enrichment of circRNAs in a sample. Due to the lack of free 5’- and 3’-ends, circRNAs are resistant to exonuclease enzymes (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). By using an exonuclease treatment, transcriptome libraries can thus be enriched in circRNAs. Alternatively, circRNA-enriched libraries can also be produced by poly-A depletion (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). These circRNA-enriched libraries help circRNA-identification, however, they cannot be used to improve circRNA-quantification as the depletion steps are known to effect different isoforms differently (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). A combination of treatments can lead to an almost exclusive circular RNA-seq library (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). In all of this manuscript, we refer to the RNA-seq library generated by any method for circular enrichment as <italic toggle="yes">circRNA enriched library</italic>. To allow for the simultaneous quantification of linear and circular transcripts and to facilitate genomic feature selection, our tool also requires a standard library of ribo-depleted total RNA-seq.</p>
    <p>In order to enable a fair assessment of <sc>CYCLeR</sc> compared to existing tools for circRNA identification and quantification, it is key to first classify the existing methods based on their goals.</p>
    <p>We define class I to comprise well-known circRNA tools that aim to identify and quantify circRNAs solely on reads spanning BSJs. Unlike <sc>CYCLeR</sc>, these tools do not aim to identify the full-sequence identity of new circRNAs, let alone multiple, alternatively splicing circRNAs overlapping the same BSJ (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>).</p>
    <p>Class II contains circRNA characterisation tools that take as input the predictions generated by methods from class I in order to produce a set of potential splicing events for each sequence interval defined by a BSJ. Since the alternative splicing of linear RNAs may obstruct the detection of circular alternative splicing (AS) events, class II tools require circRNA enriched libraries as input information in order to function properly. Two approaches to detect the alternative splicing of circRNAs from transcriptome RNA-seq data have emerged. The first approach is conceptionally based on exon and alternative splicing detection, using mate-pair information of pair-end reads spanning a BSJ (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). This approach, however, can only detect AS events within the range of the insert size used for making the RNA-seq library. The second approach compares circle enriched and total ribo-depleted libraries, similarly to <sc>CYCLeR</sc>. This strategy has the advantage of removing the dependency on the library insert size and is employed by the <sc>CIRCexplorer</sc>2 (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>) pipeline. Reads spanning a BSJ typically represent only around 0.1% of a library, thereby making quantification based solely on those reads unreliable.</p>
    <p>The challenges in circRNA quantification prompted the release of special quantification tools (defined as class III) that take as input the output of class II or class I tools and produce as output estimated circRNA levels. The tools of class III can be divided into two sub-classes. One sub-class (class IIIa) comprises tools that provide BSJ quantification as well as expression level ratios of the BSJ and FSJ in the locus of the same circRNA (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). While those values are reportedly in agreement with qPCR results (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>), they do not allow to derive the relative expression levels of all alternatively-spliced linear and/or circular isoforms that happen to overlap the same BSJ and FSJ, respectively, which is the goal of our method <sc>CYCLeR</sc>. An interesting case is <sc>sailfish-cir</sc> (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>), the sole member of the sub-class IIIb. <sc>sailfish-cir</sc> takes as an input a list of BSJs and known linear transcripts and makes a pseudo-linear reference of potential circRNA transcripts. <sc>sailfish-cir</sc> later uses a combination of the pseudo-linear reference and known linear transcripts to quantify linear and circular transcripts simultaneously. To conclude, all class III tools provide a circRNA abundance estimation that is only based on a BSJ, but ignore any additional, alternatively spliced circRNA isoforms that may be sharing the same BSJ.</p>
    <p>The tools (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>) which constitute class IV aim to recover the full-sequence identity of circRNAs. These tools also require as an input the output of tools from class I or class II. The need for BSJ identification is essential, as the experimental circRNA enrichment procedures are known to be imperfect and as some linear RNA transcripts will always remain. A BSJ set as input allows to focus only on the circRNAs in the data. The coordinates of the BSJ resolve a typical issue during linear transcript assembly - the identification of start and end exons of a transcript. One example is <sc>CIRI-full</sc> which employs an extension of the mate-pair approach of the class II tools in order to derive quantitative information on full-length circRNA isoforms. The recommended input to <sc>CIRI-full</sc> are 2 × 250 nt paired-end libraries, which allows for the full sequence-identity recovery of some circRNAs. This insert size used for making the RNA-seq library thus limits the scope of the algorithm’s output, thereby allowing only for the identification of circular isoforms of up to 600 nt length (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). The assembly strategy applied in <sc>CircAST</sc> is less ambitious, as the tool does not utilise quantitative information for the reconstruction (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). Class IV tools provide relative abundances of circRNA isoforms as counts based on fractions of the BSJ spanning reads. All class IV tools require circRNA enriched libraries as input.</p>
    <p>To conclude, the existing methods for circRNA investigation constitute a wide set of diverse tools with distinct goals and features, see classes I to IV defined above as well as Table <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">1</xref> (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15–23</xref>). Right now, however, there exists no method for identifying the full-sequence identity of circRNAs including their potential alternatively spliced variants and for simultaneously estimating the expression levels of known linear splicing isoforms. This is the challenge that our method <sc>CYCLeR</sc> (Co-estimate Your Circular and Linear RNAs) aims to address.</p>

    <p>By comparing total ribo-depleted (control) and circle-enriched RNA-seq libraries as input, the algorithm underlying <sc>CYCLeR</sc> first captures circle-specific features and then reconstructs full-length circRNA isoforms via a flow-based algorithm. The circRNA transcripts are then converted into a pseudo-linear isoform profile in order to estimate the abundance of linear and circular transcripts via expectation-maximisation (EM).</p>
    <p>As <sc>CYCLeR</sc> has several unique features, we benchmark different aspects of it by comparing it to the most adequate state-of-the-art methods that share the same feature. We thus assess the assembly of circRNAs in <sc>CYCLeR</sc> separately from isoform quantification. For the assembly benchmarking, we compare <sc>CYCLeR</sc> against class IV tools as well as <sc>CIRCexplorer</sc>2 from class II. This is because <sc>CIRCexplorer</sc>2’s isoform reconstruction module deduces all potential isoforms involving the identified <italic toggle="yes">alternative splicing</italic> events (and thus does not account for correlated pairs of <italic toggle="yes">alternative splicing</italic> events such as the skipping of two neighbouring exons, or mutually exclusive exons). For benchmarking the isoform quantification of <sc>CYCLeR</sc>, only class IV tools are considered. Note that class III tools cannot be utilised for this purpose, as they have no ability to distinguish multiple circular isoforms sharing the same BSJ.

    <p>Alternatively, circRNA isoforms can be discovered by nanopore sequencing linearized molecules that were generated via a rolling circle amplification of the corresponding circRNA (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). The tools that utilize this type of experimental data as input are marked as class VI. This procedure first requires linear transcript depletion ahead of rolling circle amplification of circRNA. This strategy for circRNA full-isoform identification, however, has issues with reproducibility and requires a high number of replicates to identify all circRNA isoforms (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). These methods also have known inherent biases. For example, not all known BSJs yield corresponding nanopore reads. While most of the BSJs with high splicing rates can be recovered, there is a lack of evidence for some isoforms (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). To summarize, conclusions drawn from this strategy are not reliable enough to serve as a reference annotation. Even with these issues fixed, this strategy would still not be able to simultaneously quantify both linear and circular transcripts. The corresponding tools that employ this strategy, however, can still serve as partial verification of the results in a comparative study between short-read circRNA assembly tools.</p>

    <title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title>
    <p>In this section, we introduce the steps and algorithms employed by <sc>CYCLeR</sc>. <sc>CYCLeR</sc> takes as an input a set of BSJs, total ribo-depleted and circRNA enriched libraries and—optionally—annotation information on linear transcripts. <sc>CYCLeR</sc> first prepares gene specific splice graphs and iteratively reconstructs potential isoforms. After <sc>CYCLeR</sc> assembles the isoforms from every sample, it prepares a complete combined set of isoforms to serve as a reference for quantification.</p>
    <p>In the following, we explain the reasoning behind the parameters of the different benchmarking strategies. We test the assembly efficacy as well as the quantification accuracy, as is common, with a simulated dataset. We also analyse real transcriptome data to illustrate the difference of the output produced by class III tools and by <sc>CYCLeR</sc> and to highlight the advantage that full-sequence information brings to an analysis. A qPCR benchmark is used to show the advantage of <sc>CYCLeR</sc> with respect to class IIIa tools. We also conduct an exploratory transcriptome analysis to highlight the advantages of <sc>CYCLeR</sc> over class IIIb tools.</p>
    <sec id="SEC2-1">
      <title>Selection of a reliable BSJ set</title>
      <p>The detection of BSJs relies on the capability of a mapper to detect chimeric reads. Different mappers detect different sets of chimeric reads per sample. To be certain that a reliable set of BSJ sites is identified, we use CIRI2 and CIRCexplorer2 as input. They employ <sc>BWA-MEM</sc> and <sc>star</sc> for chimeric detection, respectively. Optionally, <sc>CYCLeR</sc> allows the user to manually add a set of BSJs via an additional TSV input file. Since our method requires circRNA enriched libraries as input, we can readily adjust for false positives by comparing the BSJ set identified from total RNA-seq to the set identified from circRNA enriched RNA-seq. The possibility of combining BSJ sets from various tools gives an added advantage to <sc>CYCLeR</sc>, as all comparable existing methods are limited to a single type of BSJ input, see Table <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">2</xref>.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="SEC2-2">
      <title>Creation of circular splice graphs</title>
      <p><sc>CYCLeR</sc> utilises the two-pass mapping mode of <sc>star</sc> (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>) to recover all split-mapped reads. These mapped reads are then utilized to identify both annotated and new genomic features such as exons, retained introns and splice junctions. For each gene, <sc>CYCLeR</sc> subsequently creates a corresponding splice graph that also contains information on feature abundances (needed for the reconstruction algorithm). Then, only the genomic features that fall between a BSJ-start and a corresponding BSJ-end coordinate (i.e. a circle generating loci) get extracted and a circle-specific splice graph is constructed. The corresponding features (exons and splice-site junctions) within this graph are then re-quantified, normalised and adjusted for GC-content and length biases. Features that are depleted in circRNA-enriched samples are detected either through a direct quantity comparison or a negative binomial test (based on replicates) and excluded from the final splice graph in order to subsequently minimise the number of false reconstructions, see <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S3</xref>. <sc>CIRCexplorer</sc>2 employs a similar strategy, but the statistics is performed exclusively on the junction spanning reads in comparison of a single pair of ribo-depleted and circRNA enriched libraries. <sc>CIRCexplorer</sc>2 therefore suffers from a reduced sensitivity of feature detection. <sc>CIRI-full</sc> does not require such a genomic feature filter, but its feature detection is limited by the insert size of the RNA-seq library.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="SEC2-3">
      <title>Reconstruction of circRNA transcripts</title>
      <p>One common approach towards transcriptome assembly is to use a so-called flow-based algorithm to disentangle the splice graph (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>).</p>
      <p>In <sc>CYCLeR</sc>, we employ a greedy algorithm for the iterative reconstruction of transcripts to ensure a low number of false-positive-assembled transcripts. To this end, we use the comprehensive splice graph created in the previous step and start by selecting the exon with the lowest abundance. We then identify the maximum flow though this exon inside the splice graph and reconstruct the corresponding circular transcript. The corresponding exon abundances then need to be subtracted from the respective features of the original graph and any fully depleted features be removed. These steps are repeated until no more transcripts can be reconstructed, see Figure <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> for an example. Of the relevant existing tools, only <sc>CIRI-full</sc> possesses an algorithm for the optimization of exon abundances across circRNA transcripts. Its underlying algorithm is designed to take into account a rolling circle cDNA product. We avoid these bias-inducing experimental complications in our simulated dataset, please refer to section ‘Simulated dataset’.</p>

          <p><bold>Circle transcript reconstruction within <sc>CYCLeR</sc> for the example of the 5-HT2A gene</bold>. Starting with the full splice graph for the entire gene locus and its respective exon abundances (see top line, left, in grey for the graph and the FPKM-plot at the top right), <sc>CYCLeR</sc> extracts the circle-specific sub-graph corresponding to splice-site junction J4 which falls between a BSJ-start and a corresponding BSJ-end coordinate (see second line from top left, in blue for the graph). This blue sub-graph correponds to a single circular splicing isoform. This blue sub-graph and the corresponding exon abundances are subsequently subtracted from the original, full splice graph (see graph at the top left and middle FPKM-plot) to yield the remaining splice graph (third line from top, in grey). Similarly to before, <sc>CYCLeR</sc> then extracts the next circle-specific sub-graph, this time corresponding to a <italic toggle="yes">back-splice junction</italic>-spanning splice-site junction between exon E6 and E4 (fourth line from top, in red). This sub-graph provides evidence for a circular splicing isoform comprising three exons E4, E5 and E6 (note the different exon abundances). The quantities corresponding to this circular isoform are subsequently deleted from the remaining grey splice graph, resulting in a sub-graph (second line from bottom, left, grey) that corresponds to another circle-specific graph, this time comprising only exons E4 and E6, but not E5 (bottom line, in green). This sub-graph and its abundances provide evidence for a single circular isoform (bottom FPKM-plot).</p>

      <title>Combining circRNA transcript sets across samples</title>
      <p>Since different samples and replicates produce different sets of predicted transcripts, assembly tools often have modules for merging transcripts (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). In <sc>CYCLeR</sc>, transcripts from different samples are merged into a single reference, while simultaneously using the differences between sets to fix discrepancies caused by mapping artefacts. The final set of transcripts can then be exported in terms of an annotation file (in GTF format or as flat file) and a sequence file in FASTA format.</p>

    <sec id="SEC2-5">
      <title>CircRNA transcript quantification</title>
      <p><sc>CYCLeR</sc> performs transcript quantification similarly to <sc>sailfish-cir</sc> (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). For each circRNA transcript, a corresponding pseudo-linear reference is created, for details see <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S5</xref> and supplementary section ‘CircRNA transcript quantification’. This strategy allows us to account for the fact that circRNAs can produce more diverse fragments than a linear RNA with the same sequence, stemming from the sequence around the BSJ. Afterwards, the set of pseudo-linear transcripts is combined with annotated linear transcripts and used to create an index for quantification with <sc>Kallisto</sc> (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). The EM abundance estimation assigns read counts to transcripts that serve as a marker for relative quantification. False transcript reconstructions are inevitable and a portion of them are due to mapping artifacts. Conveniently, the transcripts associated with mapping artifacts have a very low number of reads assigned to them by the EM algorithm. Therefore, a hard threshold based on the number of assigned reads can be used as a secondary filter for erroneous transcript assemblies. The optimal threshold value, however, will naturally depend on the library depth, the type of library, the organism and the read length. Keeping the quantification process separate from the assembly gives <sc>CYCLeR</sc> thereby an advantage over tools that rely indiscriminately on transcript assembly.</p>

      <title>Benchmarking with simulated data</title>
      <p>The benchmarking of tools for transcriptome assembly and quantification is commonly based on dedicated, simulated data. Since <sc>CYCLeR</sc> aims to identify full-length circular isoforms and alternative splice variants and their abundance, we can only benchmark against the tools from class IV. In principle, <sc>CIRCexplorer</sc> 2 from class II can also be included in the benchmarking as it outputs potential transcripts derived from on all potential combinations of AS events. The parameters used for the programs are summarised in <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S18</xref>. Sensitivity, precision and F score are defined as usual:<disp-formula><tex-math id="M0001" notation="LaTeX">\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

      <p>The quantification correlations are based on the estimated values of correctly assembled transcripts.

        <title>Simulated dataset</title>
        <p>The transcript reconstruction in <sc>CYCLeR</sc> requires as input a total ribo-depleted and a circRNA enriched library, preferably as a pair of replicates. <sc>CIRCexplorer</sc> 2 has similar requirements. The Class IV methods require long library inserts with preferably 250 bases sequenced on both sides. With <sc>CYCLeR</sc>, we focus solely on library preparation involving RNA fragmentation in order to avoid a rolling circle amplification which would introduce unknown biases. For the benchmarking of <sc>CYCLeR</sc> and existing methods, we thus simulate two types of RNA-seq libraries: one library with a median fragment length of a 280 bp and 75 bp sequencing and one library with a median fragment length of 500 and 250 bp sequencing. From both, we simulate a pair of total ribo-depleted and circle-enriched libraries with two replicates each, for details see supplementary section ‘Simulation of RNA-seq data’ as well as <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Tables S1–S3</xref> and <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figures S1 and S2</xref>.</p>

      <sec id="SEC2-7-1">
        <title>Benchmarking with qPCR</title>
        <p>A quantitative benchmarking involving qPCR with primers converging on one BSJ only makes sense for tools of class I and class IIIa which have no ability to detect alternative splicing isoform mapping to the same BSJ. Those tools output the relative abundance of a circRNA based on BSJ-spanning reads and do not account for AS events that may occur within the locus of the same circle. Since <sc>CYCLeR</sc> has the ability to quantify multiple, alternatively spliced transcripts per BSJ, it is important to realise that the abundance values of our method are not directly comparable to qPCR results. We thus run <sc>CYCLeR</sc> on dataset GSE75733 and PA1 total ribominus libraries from GSE73325 (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>) and use the qPCR values reported in (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>) for BSJs associated with a unique circular isoform. For this, we average the estimated <sc>CYCLeR</sc> abundance for two PA1 replicates and correlate it to the average qPCR value per BSJ. This comparison is made with the values reported in (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Note that CIRIquant is not included in this benchmarking, as it cannot handle single-end RNA-seq input data.</p>

        <title>Analysis of <italic toggle="yes">D. melanogaster</italic> data</title>
        <p>As stated previously, every tool for circular transcript reconstruction relies on circRNA enriched libraries as input to function well. The lack of large, circRNA enriched data sets, however, is a major problem in the field. We chose <italic toggle="yes">D. melanogaster</italic> as a model organism for this study due the availability of RNase R treated samples from mature fly head, S2 cell line and early embryo (GSE69212, GSE55872) (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). After creating an index based on the aforementioned samples, <sc>CYCLeR</sc> quantification is performed on a data set containing 103 <italic toggle="yes">D. melanogaster</italic> samples by the Lai lab (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). We compare the predictions of <sc>CYCLeR</sc> to those predicted by representative methods of class I and class III. As representative for class I, we chose the BSJ identification module of <sc>CIRCexplorer</sc> 2, since this has been shown to outperform other tools in class I (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). The representatives of class IIIa produce optimal output when provided with circRNA enriched libraries for each sample. Since this dataset does not fit this requirement and as <sc>sailfish-cir</sc> is the only class III tool that outputs full transcriptome information and simultaneously quantifies linear and circular RNAs, we use <sc>sailfish-cir</sc> as representative for class III. The observed difference in performance between <sc>CYCLeR</sc> and <sc>sailfish-cir</sc> can be attributed to the lack of <italic toggle="yes">de novo</italic> assembly in <sc>sailfish-cir</sc>. Benchmarking against this tool allows us to highlight the advantage of circRNA transcriptome assembly and its influence on the full-isoform quantification. Note that class IV methods do not work efficiently without circRNA enriched data as indicated by simulations.</p>
        <p>We normalise BSJ counts from <sc>CIRCexplorer</sc> 2 as counts-per-billion (CPB) and convert abundance of <sc>CYCLeR</sc> and <sc>sailfish-cir</sc> to RPKM. We variance-stabilise the corresponding values using the <sc>DESeq2</sc> package and use them to calculate sample adjacencies (similarity) as Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient. Based on the adjacencies, we calculated sample distances with the topological overlap matrix calculation from the <sc>wgcna</sc> package (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>).</p>

However, as those protocols are known to have biases, the resulting data cannot serve as comprehensive benchmark. Nonetheless, the results of long-read sequencing can serve as a partial verification of the short-read results.</p>
        <p>With this in mind, we selected the data used in the CIRI-long publication (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>).

        <p>The different tools have varying default thresholds and parameters for assembly, which are not optimized for the high sequencing depth of this study. To put the tools on an equivalent base level of assembly parameters, we used a threshold that only circRNAs with at least five BSJ-spanning reads will be considered.</p>

For <sc>CIRI-full</sc>, only the transcripts reconstructed from circRNA enriched libraries are considered.</p>
      <p>We separate the simulated transcripts into two reference sets, a low complexity one (that serves as our reference set) and a high complexity one, see <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S2</xref> and <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table S2</xref>. We show sensitivity and precision plots based on the reference set in Figure <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>. Please refer to <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S4</xref> for the sensitivity and precision plot of the corresponding results for the high complexity reference set. For both data sets, <sc>CYCLeR</sc> clearly outperforms the existing tools both in terms of sensitivity and precision.</p>

      </fig>
      <p>As can be seen from the benchmarking, <sc>CIRI-full</sc> achieves high precision, but has only limited sensitivity. This is due to the fact that the algorithm outputs the full sequence of circRNAs only when there is no break in the coverage of its putative exons. This strategy essentially prevents the detection of any circle larger than the fragment length of the library. For the 2 × 75 bp dataset, <sc>CIRI-full</sc> covers mostly cases with single circRNA isoform. For the 2 × 250 bp dataset, the sensitivity increases, but the precision drops, due to the increased complexity of the alternative splicing landscape. <sc>CIRCexplorer</sc>2 was designed as a tool for detecting alternative splicing events in circRNAs and reports as output transcripts corresponding to <italic toggle="yes">all potential combinations</italic> of splice events, hence the resulting low precision.</p>
      <p>Any analysis steps such as quantification, rely on prior knowledge of the sequence identity of the transcripts. Sensitivity and precision of the assembly are equally important for generating a useful set of splicing isoforms. We therefore also report the F score, i.e. the harmonic mean of the sensitivity and precision. As Figure <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> shows, <sc>CYCLeR</sc> significantly outperforms both <sc>CIRI-full</sc> and <sc>CIRCexplorer</sc>2 in terms of F score.</p>
      <p>One advantage of <sc>CYCLeR</sc> is that it does not have any implicit or explicit limitations in terms of the insert sizes or the read lengths of the RNA-seq input libraries. In addition, the quantification of genomic features within <sc>CYCLeR</sc> does also not rely as strongly on high sequencing depths compared to other tools as our method solely relies on the quantification by junction reads. <sc>CYCLeR</sc> thus utilises the entire RNA-seq library for transcript assembly, not only a fraction of around 20% of the reads that happen to span splice sites. This unique feature of <sc>CYCLeR</sc>, requires a dedicated scaling and normalisation of read counts for exons which we apply. We optimise the scaling for reads spanning no more than two exons. In the 2 × 250 bp dataset, there are naturally more reads spanning multiple exons, thus leading to a decrease in performance of <sc>CYCLeR</sc> compared to the 2 × 75 bp set. With <sc>CYCLeR</sc>, we observe a minor difference between the results for the 2 × 75 bp and the 2 × 250 bp data sets. <sc>CIRCexplorer</sc>2 is less affected by the read length than <sc>CIRI-full</sc>. Nevertheless, the output decreases for the shorter length sequencing mode. This gives <sc>CYCLeR</sc> a slight advantage in sensitivity in 2 × 75 mode, while <sc>CIRCexplorer</sc>2 slightly outperforms in 2 × 250 mode. In the benchmark with the high complexity 2 × 250 bp reference set, <sc>CIRCexplorer</sc> 2 manages to outperform <sc>CYCLeR</sc> in terms of sensitivity, see <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S4</xref>, yet <sc>CYCLeR</sc> simultaneously significantly outperforms in terms of precision, thereby outperforming <sc>CIRCexplorer</sc>2 overall. Compared to all existing tools, <sc>CYCLeR</sc>’s strongest advantage is the graph algorithm that is tailor-made for circRNA transcript assembly. A second significant advantage is <sc>CYCLeR</sc>’s ability to be able to utilize a combination of BSJ identification tools. In its current version, we deliberately chose to exercise extreme caution in reconstruction from low abundance loci. This yields a high precision, but also filters out several low abundance features, i.e. implies a slightly reduced sensitivity. The primary advantage of <sc>CYCLeR</sc> is the assembly algorithm, yet attributing the success exclusively to the algorithm would be too simplistic. The difference in performance can be largely attributed to <sc>CYCLeR</sc>’s better genomic feature selection, which facilitates a lower number of erroneous reconstructions. In contrast to this, <sc>CIRI-full</sc> is limited to the assembly of only short circRNAs. <sc>CIRCexplorer</sc>2 performs poorly in assembly as it employs a tool for de novo linear assembly—Cufflinks/Stringtie. As these tools do not handle circRNA cases well, they induce errors that then propagate within the pipeline. <sc>CIRCexplorer</sc>2 has the additional disadvantage of being overly reliant on the annotation for detecting AS events. As additional evidence for <sc>CYCLeR</sc>’s merits, we provide the results in <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S13</xref>. The example shows the advantage of <sc>CYCLeR</sc>’s feature selection and how it yields a better assembly. We opted to show a case from the 2 × 250 sequencing mode, since this is optimal for <sc>CIRI-full</sc> assembly. For every tool, it is quite possible to select specific examples in the simulated data where any particular algorithm has an advantage. Nevertheless, it is clear that <sc>CYCLeR</sc> consistently outperforms in all cases with unannotated genomic features. It is important to note that the secure feature selection of <sc>CYCLeR</sc> is a statistical test that requires replicates based on the <sc>DEXSeq</sc> package. <sc>CIRCexplorer</sc>2—which uses a single pair of libraries for comparison—significantly underperforms when eliminating linear-isoform-specific features.</p>

      <p>We also compare the reconstruction from different treatments for circRNA enrichment. The PA1 cell line has available treatments, only polyA-depletion and a combination of polyA-depletion and RNase R treatment. Naturally, the sample with two types of depletion substantially increases the number of detected BSJs compared to a single type of depletion: ∼8000 versus ∼34 500. The set of reconstructed transcripts is dependent on the starting set of BSJs. We resolve the conflict by selecting a BSJ set that is derived from the total RNA-seq of the PA1 cell line (∼2500), since those are the BSJs that belong to the circRNAs quantified later. Based on that set of BSJs, we compare the sets of assembled transcripts. The difference is comparable to the different between biological replicates, please see Table <xref rid="tbl5" ref-type="table">5</xref>. This leads to the conclusion that—for the generation of a general purpose set of circRNA transcripts—a single type of depletion is sufficient.</p>

      <title>Benchmark with respect to qPCR values</title>
      <p>The benchmark from (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>) focuses on 13 BSJs. The BSJ locus of CAMSAP1 (Chr9:135881632–135883078), however, has been experimental evidence for two alternative isoforms sharing the same BSJ site, see <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S11 A</xref>. Based on the output from <sc>CYCLeR</sc>, we can also conclude that the BSJ locus CORO1C (Chr12:108652271–108654410) yields at least two alternative isoforms, see <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S11 B</xref>.</p>
      <p><sc>clear</sc> and <sc>CYCLeR</sc> are in very good agreement, as shown by a correlation of 0.95, see <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S12 A and B</xref>. The difference derives from the fact that <sc>clear</sc> uses the BSJ levels to estimate abundances, while <sc>CYCLeR</sc> uses a pseudoalignment strategy. The experimental biases that affect <sc>clear</sc> output are introduced by experimental biases in the short region around the BSJ. Therefore, the most likely sources of discrepancy are the differences in the length of the sequence and the GC-content between the full transcript sequence versus the BSJ region. <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S12 A and B</xref> show that the difference in GC-content can explain most of the discrepancy between <sc>clear</sc> and <sc>CYCLeR</sc>. Compared to <sc>clear</sc>, <sc>CYCLeR</sc> has a lower correlation with qPCR results (0.67 vs 0.75). As the region that is evaluated by <sc>clear</sc> mostly overlaps the region covered by the qPCR primers, the bias in GC-difference is minimized. Naturally, there are many experimental biases that can cause a difference between estimated qPCR and RNA-seq abundances. Thus, neither of the tools manages to match the qPCR results, but the poor performance of <sc>CYCLeR</sc> can be attributed to the fact that the quantification by <sc>CYCLeR</sc> is more affected by the difference in GC-content. The results of the abundance estimations can be seen in <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S10</xref>.

      <p>There are two noteworthy differences to observe. Using <sc>CYCLeR</sc> for quantification, it is possible to identify a gradient in the data that reproduces the known developmental stages. In addition, the quantification by <sc>CYCLeR</sc> makes the outliers in the data easily distinguishable. The reason for this advantage of <sc>CYCLeR</sc> derives from its variance stability between replicates, see <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S6</xref>. This difference can also be clearly seen within the dendrogram representing the sample distances based on circRNA transcript counts, see Figure <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">4C</xref> and <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">D</xref>. The clustering by <sc>CYCLeR</sc> in Figures <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> and <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">5</xref> is in complete agreement with the results from (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>) depicting two segregated stages of fly embryo development, namely pre-mbl expression and post-mbl expression. The corresponding MBL protein is known to affect circRNA expression by binding intronic sequences. The most notable difference in the circRNA profile is circ-mbl (exon 2) becoming the most expressed circRNA. Overall, the distances between replicate samples inferred by <sc>CYCLeR</sc> are a significantly better reflection of their true biological relationships, emphasizing that the correct assembly of full-sequence isoforms is key for the correct clustering of biological samples.</p>
      <p>The improved separation of samples from the embryo stage shown in Figure <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">5</xref> reflects the true similarity between the <italic toggle="yes">D. melanogaster</italic> samples well. An example is shown in <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S8</xref>, where we observe that the embryo-derived cell lines have a similar circRNA pattern to early stage (0-14h) embryo samples, whereas the samples from later embryo stages (16-24h) adopt a pattern that is already similar to subsequent stages in <italic toggle="yes">D. melanogaster</italic> development.</p>

      <title>Comparative study with long-read data</title>
      <p>The CIRI-long protocol has multiple steps for circRNA enrichment. This allows for the detection of circRNA isoforms beyond the capabilities of Illumina sequencing (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). There is, however, still a bias in the CIRI-long strategy. It is known that ∼50% of the BSJs recovered from Illumina data are missing in CIRI-long data. It is therefore safe to assume that this bias does not only affect the detection of BSJs, but also the AS detection within circRNA loci. Most likely, the majority of the bias is due to the 1000 nt fragment selection in the protocol, creating a bias against longer circRNAs. The CIRI-long data therefore cannot be used to determine true positives and false positives. The high recall of CIRI-long for low abundance isoforms makes it a poor benchmark for false negatives. The only reasonable statistic that can be performed is an evaluation of the overlaps of predictions between the Illumina based tools (<sc>CYCLeR</sc> , <sc>CIRI-full</sc>, <sc>CIRCexplorer</sc>2) and CIRI-long. The predictions that are supported by both—Illumina and Nanopore data—are thus considered to reflect the ground truth. What is important to track is the number of verified isoforms that are predicted by multiple Illumina-based tools (‘shared’), as well as the ones that are verified and predicted by a single tool (‘unique’). An additional significant statistic is the number of ‘unverified’ isoforms per Illumina-based tool, i.e. those isoforms that are not verified by the CIRI-long data. To compare <sc>CIRI-full</sc> on an equivalent level as the other tools, we adjust all results to account for the length limitation of <sc>CIRI-full</sc>. We thus limit all results to 2000 nt length. The full results are provided in <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S17</xref>. This length matches the CIRI-long limit well, as there is minor difference in the CIRI-long output in Figure <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">6</xref> and <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S17</xref>. In Figure <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">6A</xref> and <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">B</xref>, we observe the aforementioned comparison. We find that every tool manages to identify a unique set of circRNA isoforms that are verified by CIRI-long. We also observe that <sc>CIRCexplorer</sc>2 outputs very high number of isoforms compared to the other Illumina based tools. <sc>CIRCexplorer</sc>2 does provide the highest number of verified isoforms. However, the number of unverified isoforms from <sc>CIRCexplorer</sc>2 is disproportionately high.</p>

(<bold>B</bold>) A bar graph representation of the same data, but with emphasis on overlapping regions from the Venn diagram. In (B), the assembled transcripts for each Illumina-based tool are divided into <italic toggle="yes">verified</italic> (by CIRI-long) or <italic toggle="yes">unverified</italic>. The latter are further subdivided into <italic toggle="yes">unique</italic>—the transcripts that are shared only by one Illumina-based tool and CIRI-long, and <italic toggle="yes">shared</italic>—the transcripts that are shared by two or more Illumina-based tools and CIRI-long. <sc>CIRI-full</sc> has the lowest transcript count in every category. This is due to the length limit of its underlying assembly based on the library insert size. When comparing <sc>CIRCexplorer</sc>2 and <sc>CYCLeR</sc>, we notice that <sc>CIRCexplorer</sc>2 has only ∼100 more <italic toggle="yes">verified</italic> transcripts, while simultaneously having ∼3000 more <italic toggle="yes">unverified</italic> transcripts. Based on the information provided by the simulated benchmark, it is a safe assumption that the extra isoforms produces by <sc>CIRCexplorer</sc>2 are primarily erroneous assemblies.</p>

        <graphic xlink:href="gkac1100fig6" position="float"/>
      </fig>
      <p>To shed more light on the assembly results, we also provide <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S16</xref> which specifies the unique BSJs that correspond to the assembled transcripts. <sc>CYCLeR</sc> has a higher number of verified isoforms than <sc>CIRI-full</sc> as well as higher number of unverified isoforms. We observe that <sc>CIRCexplorer</sc>2 has the lowest number of unique BSJs in the output. Thus, the exceptionally high number of isoforms cannot be explained by the BSJ input alone. The number of unverified isoforms produced by <sc>CIRCexplorer</sc>2 goes beyond the expectations due to biases in the experimental procedures. The logical conclusion is that <sc>CIRCexplorer</sc>2 has a high number of false positives, due to the disadvantages of the algorithm. We observe that <sc>CYCLeR</sc> has more verified results than <sc>CIRI-full</sc>. Both tools, however, have a similar ratio of ∼60% unverified isoforms. This indicates that the precision of <sc>CYCLeR</sc> and <sc>CIRI-full</sc> is comparable when adjusting for the length of the sequence. There is an increase in the number of isoforms reported by <sc>CYCLeR</sc> while the number of unique BSJs is similar to <sc>CIRI-full</sc>. This can be explained by the fact that longer circRNAs are more likely to have alternative isoforms. Thus, we conclude that the increased number of isoforms predicted by <sc>CYCLeR</sc> as compared to <sc>CIRI-full</sc> is due to the ability of <sc>CYCLeR</sc> to correctly assemble even long splicing isoforms. The advantage of <sc>CYCLeR</sc> over <sc>CIRCexplorer</sc>2 and <sc>CIRI-full</sc> can be summarized by <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S14</xref>. In conclusion, both <sc>CYCLeR</sc> and <sc>CIRCexplorer</sc>2 outperform <sc>CIRI-full</sc> in terms of verified transcripts. However, the number of false positives in <sc>CIRCexplorer</sc>2 makes the tool unsuitable for isoform assembly. <sc>CIRI-full</sc> is limited by the isoform length and—even with reasonable precision statistics—the tool overlooks a significant number of verified cases. To conclude, even when analysing long-read data, <sc>CYCLeR</sc> is once again the only tool with a good balance between precision and recall.</p>

    <title>DISCUSSION</title>
    <p>We here present <sc>CYCLeR</sc>, the first computational method for identifying the full sequence identify of new circRNAs and their abundances while simultaneously co-estimating the abundances of known linear splicing isoforms. These linear isoforms can be specified as optional input by the user.</p>
    <p><sc>CYCLeR</sc> outperforms existing tools for circRNA identification and quantification on all accounts on simulated data. Our reference set provides a benchmark similar to existing circRNA studies and allows us to gain a better understanding of tool-specific biases caused by the challenging mapping of chimeric fragments. Our high complexity data set was devised to represent the full complexity of real data, where the low abundances of transcripts and the overlap between multiple circular and linear isoforms can render the identification of the full isoform profile a near impossible task. When dealing with complex data, the true value of the tool becomes less centered around the recall and more focused on precision. The full set of circRNA isoforms is impossible to reconstruct due to natural limitation imposed by the depth of the RNA-seq library. Our results from the analysis of simulated data are complemented by conclusions drawn from analysing long-read data generated by Nanopore sequencing. The algorithm of <sc>CYCLeR</sc> ensures that the full sequence identity of the most abundant isoforms is correctly reconstructed. This advantage of the assembly allows for reliable quantification of the predominant isoforms. The quantification of circRNAs in <sc>CYCLeR</sc> is enhanced by the fact its assembly and abundance estimations are performed in two separate steps. This makes <sc>CYCLeR</sc> very robust, as erroneously assembled transcripts are estimated with significantly lower abundance than the correctly assembled ones. Existing tools that depend on long library insert size typically fail to detect circRNAs that fall below the detection limit of the libraries (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). In contrast to this, <sc>CYCLeR</sc> is independent of the library insert size, thereby allowing for short insert sizes and retaining the ability to identify both short and long circRNAs.</p>
    <p>Last, but not least, the experimental workload required for transcriptome analyses performed with <sc>CYCLeR</sc> is substantially lower than that for existing methods.</p>
    <p>A natural question that arises is whether the need for the generation of an additional set of libraries is justified by the improvement in performance. As our as well as previously published results clearly show, circRNA enriched libraries are strictly required for proper circRNA isoform assembly. Moreover, a total RNA-seq library is also strictly necessary for correct isoform quantification. An optional, additional polyA-selected library used as control could further improve the circRNA genomic feature selection. Since the total RNA-seq library can serve as control for the feature selection, however, the additional cost for an additional polyA-selected library will typically not be justified.</p>
    <p>We show in a study of <italic toggle="yes">D. melanogaster</italic> transcriptomes that samples with RNase R treatment for a few key time points are sufficient to produce results that reveal biologically important relationships. We also showcase the merits of proper circRNA isoform detection for correct circRNA quantification. Finally, we find that <sc>CYCLeR</sc> improves sample clustering and facilitates outlier sample detection. This is an important feature that will play a key role in the technological transition towards single cell experiments.</p>
    <p>The common Bioinformatics approach towards identifying circRNAs is primarily based on tracing the levels of BSJ-spanning reads across different samples. Some existing tools supplement this BSJ information by ratios of BSJ/FSJ spanning reads (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). This forces the user to implement a circRNA-specific analysis pipeline (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Even these analysis pipelines, however, are still not able to distinguish between several alternatively spliced circRNAs mapping to the same BSJ. While the BSJ/FSJ ratio is very consistent with qPCR results for circRNAs comprising only two exons (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>), we currently completely lack methods that are able to identify the full sequence identity of <italic toggle="yes">all circRNAs and their alternative splice variants</italic> in order to be able to apply standard differential expression analyses or clustering pipelines. This is the gap that our method <sc>CYCLeR</sc> fills. CIRI-full provides full isoform sequence identification, but its underlying algorithm cannot correctly reconstruct and quantify the isoforms from non-enriched data. This forces the user to perform statistical analyses of the circRNAs based primarily on the BSJ-spanning reads, even when full isoform data is available. A further disadvantage is that circular and linear transcripts need to be quantified separately and can only subsequently be combined in a co-expression network (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>) which yields a biased clustering for both types of isoforms. In contrast to this, <sc>CYCLeR</sc> simultaneously quantifies linear and circular transcripts from the same sample in an integrated manner. In addition to the thus resulting superior prediction performance of <sc>CYCLeR</sc>, this feature gives the user the added advantage of being able to proceed with standard downstream pipelines for quantitative analyses for both types of isoforms. This is essential for enabling correct co-expression and simultaneous analyses of both linear and circular RNAs.</p>
