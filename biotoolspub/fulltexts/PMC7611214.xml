    <title>Introduction</title>
    <p id="P2">Organisms are composed of cells of various types, in different states, and functions. A key component is the intracellular metabolome, a repertoire of metabolites and lipids involved in virtually all cellular processes. Recent discoveries transformed our understanding of metabolites and lipids beyond being metabolic building blocks and shed light on their roles in signaling, epigenome regulation, immunity, inflammation, and cancer<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>. The importance of the metabolome, and the emerging capacities of metabolomics makes metabolome profiling an attractive approach to read out the state of the organism, organ, and cells<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>.</p>
    <p id="P3">In parallel, single-cell technologies have revolutionized biology by highlighting the extent of cellular heterogeneity within tissues<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> and even among monoclonal cells<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>–<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>. However, investigating metabolism at the single-cell level <italic>in situ</italic> was out of reach until recently<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>. Over the past years, pioneered by <sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>, the introduction of single-cell metabolomics methods demonstrated the feasibility of characterizing metabolic heterogeneity and discriminating cell types<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>–<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>. Certainly, their relatively low throughput, requirements for custom mass spectrometry instrumentation, challenges in analysis of cells cultured at a high density, and the lack of computational methods for downstream analyses, altogether led to a limited accessibility of single-cell metabolomics.</p>
    <p id="P4">Here, we aim to democratize single-cell metabolomics for cultured cells by introducing an open-source method, SpaceM, along with a toolbox of supplemental methods for metabolite intensity normalization and filtering, quality control, downstream data analysis, and interpretation. SpaceM is compatible with conventional cell culture practices, and can be applied to cells at high confluency. Importantly, our method does not require a custom mass spectrometry setup but rather uses commercially-available Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption Ionization (MALDI)-imaging mass spectrometry and light microscopy. The cornerstone of SpaceM is the precise estimation of which cell parts were locally ablated by the laser, achieved by co-registering microscopy images of cells with microscopy images of MALDI laser ablation marks with a subcellular precision.</p>
    <p id="P5">Ultimately, SpaceM generates a spatio-molecular matrix for each cell containing a normalized metabolic profile and microscopy-derived phenotypic properties such as cell fluorescence intensities and morpho-spatial features. SpaceM detects &gt;100 metabolites and lipids from &gt;1,000 cells per hour, demonstrating high sensitivity and throughput. The single-cell resolution of SpaceM was validated using our proposed model of co-cultured human epithelial cells (HeLa) and mouse fibroblast cells (NIH3T3) where the cell types were predicted with an accuracy of 91.3% solely based on the single-cell metabolomes.</p>
    <p id="P6">Using SpaceM, we characterized metabolic states within an isogenic cell population of human differentiated hepatocytes, dHepaRGs, an established <italic>in vitro</italic> model of Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) and Non-Alcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH)<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>, characterized by a profound and heterogeneous lipid metabolism remodelling<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>. SpaceM provided single-cell profiles from 29,738 hepatocytes representing intensities of &gt;700 lipids from various classes, including neutral glycerolipids (e.g. triglycerides), glycerophospholipids and sphingolipids. Among hepatocytes stimulated with fatty acids, we discovered a subpopulation with distinctly altered lipid profiles. These hepatocytes consistently compose 24% of the population and are characterized by an aberrant accumulation of lipid droplets and neutral lipids characteristic of a metabolic state called steatosis. We explored how inflammation affects hepatocyte heterogeneity by further challenging them with the cytokine IL-17A, a known player in NASH-associated inflammation<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>. This shifted almost all hepatocytes (93%) into the steatotic metabolic state and impacted metabolic cell-cell heterogeneity. Furthermore, SpaceM revealed that inhibiting canonical NF-κB signalling alters the relative cell distribution within metabolic states, indicating a potential role for this pathway in regulating hepatocyte metabolic heterogeneity under inflammation-induced conditions. Our metabolic state markers are in line with previous literature and were structurally and quantitatively validated using bulk lipidomics of an <italic>in vivo</italic> NASH murine model<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>. This highlights the relevance of the dHepaRG <italic>in vitro</italic> NAFLD/NASH model and the capacity of SpaceM to discover and characterize biologically-relevant metabolic states. Overall, considering the demonstrated potential of SpaceM to reveal and characterize disease-relevant metabolic states, as well as the accessible nature of the method, we expect to democratize single-cell metabolomics of diverse cell cultures and co-cultures.</p>

      <title>The SpaceM method</title>
      <p id="P7">A key challenge of MALDI-based single-cell metabolomics is the assignment of metabolite intensities to individual cells. To address this, we propose SpaceM as a method for single-cell metabolomics of cultured cells. SpaceM integrates MALDI-imaging with light microscopy followed by image segmentation and registration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Supp. Fig. 1</xref>).</p>
      <p id="P8">For SpaceM, cells need to be cultured on a microscopy-compatible substrate, followed by fixation, fluorescence staining and drying. SpaceM starts with the acquisition of microscopy images, called pre-MALDI. Cell segmentation of pre-MALDI images provides a broad panel of phenotypic information including fluorescent intensities and spatio-morphological properties of individual cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A i</xref>). Next, the sample is sprayed with a MALDI matrix salt and MALDI-imaging mass spectrometry is performed for untargeted detection of molecules, including metabolites and lipids<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A ii</xref>).</p>
      <p id="P9">The next steps of SpaceM aim to detect the sampled cell areas. The MALDI laser leaves discernable ablation marks in the overlaying matrix which can be used to identify the areas contributing to metabolite intensities. However, the opacity of the MALDI-matrix prevents simultaneous inspection of both cells and ablation marks. Therefore, the pre-MALDI image is co-registered with a second round of microscopy images, called post-MALDI, from which ablation marks are segmented (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Extended Data Fig 1</xref>). Although methods to integrate MALDI-imaging data and microscopy exist, their registration accuracies are worse than 1 μm. A prominent example includes registration of MALDI-imaging data of tissue sections with histological images by detecting ablation marks in autofluorescence microscopy images with the reported registration accuracy of 2.2 μm <sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>. While such accuracy is suitable for tissue section analysis, the aim of SpaceM is to precisely evaluate the ablated parts of single cells. For this reason we developed a high-precision image registration that employs pen marks drawn at the edges of the cell culture which provided over 400,000 fiducial points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Extended Data Fig 2</xref>). We estimated that at least 3,000 fiducials are needed to achieve a sub-micron registration accuracy (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Supp. Fig. 2</xref>), a prerequisite for estimating metabolite intensities at the single-cell level, given that in our study cell sizes range from 37μm to 59μm (25th/75th percentiles, 37μm to 49μm for the dHepaRGs, 39μm to 59μm for the NIH3T3 and 30μm to 39μm for the HeLa cells) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Supp. Fig. 3</xref>). Finally, the ablation marks are re-indexed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Fig 3</xref>) to couple MALDI data with microscopy.</p>
      <p id="P10">To construct single-cell metabolic profiles from MALDI measurements, we developed an approach accounting for the overlap between cells and ablation marks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A iii</xref>) to compensate for differences in cell sampling and filter out ambiguous ablation marks sampling multiple cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig 4</xref>). Ultimately, SpaceM provides a single-cell spatio-molecular matrix with a multiplex readout for each individual cell quantified in its native spatial context. This readout comprises an untargeted metabolic profile, fluorescence intensities and spatio-morphological features (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). This information can be used to link metabolism and phenotype at the single-cell level.</p>

    <sec id="S4">
      <title>Validating SpaceM by predicting cell types with single-cell resolution</title>
      <p id="P11">To validate SpaceM, we predicted the cell types of co-cultured human HeLa cells and mouse NIH3T3 fibroblasts, constitutively expressing H2B-mCherry and GFP respectively, solely based on their single-cell metabolic profiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C–E</xref>). To confirm the prediction, cell types were determined using a linear boundary between mCherry and GFP intensities (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Supp. Fig. 4A</xref>). SpaceM provided metabolic profiles of 88 metabolites for 445 HeLa and 400 NIH3T3 co-cultured cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) visualization based on metabolite intensities of two replicates reproducibly grouped cells by their type (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Supp. Fig. 4B</xref>). Metabolite intensities were also consistent across replicates, indicating low analytical variability (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Supp. Fig. 4C</xref>). Integration of the replicates preserved the relative organisation of cell types in UMAP (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Supp. Fig. 4D</xref>). The linear discriminant analysis performed on the metabolic profiles resulted in the classification of HeLa from NIH cells with an accuracy of 91.3% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Supp. Fig. 4E</xref>). The cell type markers include phosphatidylinositols PI(34:1) and PI(34:2) for HeLa cells and phosphoethanolamine PE(40:6) for NIH3T3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>). Importantly, cells surrounded by the other cell type were correctly classified, demonstrating the single-cell precision of SpaceM (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Supp. Fig. 4F</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">G</xref>). We investigated the impact of co-sampling neighboring cells and diffusible metabolites on the cell type classification. For this, we took advantage of the unbiased sampling of SpaceM and constructed the diffusion profile of each detected metabolite (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Supp. Fig. 5</xref>). Removing all co-sampling ablation marks and discarding the diffused metabolites did not affect the cell type classification accuracy (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Supp. Fig. 6A</xref>). The classification accuracy was optimal when including co-sampling ablation marks that share at least 90% of their sampling area with a cell of interest (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Supp. Fig. 6B</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">D</xref>). Metabolic markers were validated by using individual mono-cultures of each cell type analyzed with both SpaceM and LC-MS/MS (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Supp. Fig. 7</xref>). Overall, the fold change trends of the cell type markers were validated for 85.2% of the detected metabolites (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Supp. Fig. 7A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Supp. Fig. 7B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Supp. Fig. 7D</xref>). Using LC-MS/MS, a total of 19 lipids were detected in common with SpaceM; of which 15 lipids showed the same trends (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Supp. Fig. 7C</xref>). We found the relative metabolite intensities of cell-type-markers to be highly consistent between culture conditions although the NIH3T3 cells had higher intensities when co-cultured with HeLa cells, potentially indicating a metabolic adaptation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Supp. Fig. 7E</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">F</xref>).</p>

    <sec id="S5">
      <title>SpaceM identifies a steatotic subpopulation of human hepatocytes</title>
      <p id="P12">Beyond characterizing cell types, we used SpaceM to identify metabolic states within an isogenic cell line of differentiated human hepatocytes (dHepaRG) upon stimulation with fatty acids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). This model is of particular relevance to study the onset of NAFLD, in which hepatocytes undergo lipid metabolism remodeling and accumulate intracellular lipid droplets (LDs), known as steatosis. NAFLD, in turn, can progress towards NASH, characterized by systemic and hepatic inflammation<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>. The known high heterogeneity of LD accumulation in hepatocytes <sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> (also illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>) reinforces the need for single-cell methods.</p>
      <p id="P13">Hepatocytes were stimulated with oleic and palmitic fatty acids (FA) to model NAFLD-specific lipid metabolism<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>. The LD accumulation was quantified by the neutral lipid fluorescent dye LD540<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>. SpaceM provided profiles of 740 metabolites from 2,840 single dHepaRG cells. UMAP and unsupervised clustering of metabolic profiles revealed two distinct subpopulations characterized by statistically different amounts of LDs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Supp. Fig. 8</xref>). Correlating LD540 and lipid intensities provided the following markers: triglyceride TG(48:0) (Spearman r=0.38***) for a smaller subpopulation, and isomeric lipids lysophosphatidylethanolamine LPE(21:1) or lysophosphatidylcholine LPC(18:1) (Spearman r=−0.23***) for a bigger subpopulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>). Further marker analysis showed neutral lipids, including triglycerides and diglycerides, to be the strongest markers confirmed by lipid ontology enrichment analysis<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E</xref>). This is expected as these lipids are known components of hepatic LDs<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>). Interestingly, the analysis of lipids anti-correlated with LD540 indicated an enrichment of glycerophospholipids and localization to endoplasmic reticulum (ER), a likely manifestation of the ER stress in hepatic steatosis<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup>.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="S6">
      <title>Characterisation of metabolic states of lipid stimulated hepatocytes in an inflammatory environment</title>
      <p id="P14">The lipid composition in hepatocytes is tightly regulated under homeostatic conditions. However, an excess of free fatty acids, together with additional stressors, including inflammatory cytokines, promotes aberrant lipid storage, ultimately leading to NASH.</p>
      <p id="P15">To investigate the metabolic remodeling of single hepatocytes during NAFLD to NASH transition, we considered four conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>): (i) A control condition (CTRL) modelling the homeostatic state; (ii) stimulation with oleic and palmitic fatty acids (+FA) as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>, modelling non-inflammatory NAFLD; (iii) stimulation with FAs and inflammatory cytokine IL-17A (+FA+IL17A), modelling NASH and (iv) stimulation with FAs, IL-17A and TPCA-1 (+FA+IL17A+TPCA1), an inhibitor of NF-κB signalling, probing the metabolic response upon inhibition of IL-17A-induced inflammation.</p>
      <p id="P16">SpaceM provided profiles of 740 metabolites from 29,738 hepatocytes with high reproducibility between replicates (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Supp. Fig. 9</xref>). Unsupervised clustering of the metabolic profiles revealed three major clusters representing the homeostatic, intermediate and steatotic metabolic states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>) with statistically different LD levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). The CTRL condition was separated from FA-stimulated conditions and constitutes its own “homeostatic” metabolic state. Among +FA cells, 75.2% and 24.3% reside in the intermediate and steatotic states, respectively. Induction of inflammatory signalling with IL-17A drastically affected hepatocytes, with 93% of +FA+IL17A hepatocytes residing in the steatotic state. Of note, inhibition of NF-κB signalling by TPCA-1 prevents the uniform metabolic response seen upon stimulation with IL-17A as 75.2% of hepatocytes remain in the intermediate state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>).</p>
      <p id="P17">LD levels exhibit a higher variation in the +FA+IL17A condition (coefficient of variation, CV=0.54) compared to the +FA and +FA+IL17A+TPCA1 conditions (CV=0.37 and 0.45, respectively) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Supp. Fig. 10A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">10C</xref>). Conversely, individual lipids showed a higher variability of their single-cell intensities (showing a bimodal distribution) in the +FA and +FA+IL17A+TPCA1 conditions compared to the +FA+IL17A condition (showing a unimodal distribution) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Supp. Fig. 10B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">10C</xref>). Together, these results indicate that inducing inflammatory signalling in differentiated human hepatocytes with IL-17A increases cell-cell heterogeneity of LD levels but reduces heterogeneity of individual neutral lipids.</p>
      <p id="P18">Pseudo-time analysis of single-cell metabolic profiles allowed us to characterize the progression of hepatocytes from the homeostatic to the steatotic state, (black line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). Metabolic state markers change gradually along pseudotime, indicating metabolic heterogeneity within every state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>). Most markers of the homeostatic state are phospholipids such as phosphatidylcholines, phosphatidylethanolamines and phosphatidylinositols covering housekeeping metabolic functions including membrane composition of ER and mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E</xref>). On the other hand, metabolic markers of the steatotic state are mostly neutral lipids such as triglycerides and diglycerides with a functional relevance in lipid storage, LD formation and lipid-mediated signalling.</p>
      <p id="P19">The metabolic-state-markers were further validated using LC-MS/MS-based lipidomics of hepatic tissues from normal diet (ND) and Western diet (WD) mice. This helped perform MS/MS structural analysis and compare to the bulk levels of the markers <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3F</xref>). The differences discovered by SpaceM were highly consistent with the marker levels in ND and WD mice.

    <title>Discussion</title>
    <p id="P20">The topic of metabolic heterogeneity has attracted a wealth of attention<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>. Bottom-up efforts on metabolic characterization of cell types<sup><xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> and neighboring cells<sup><xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> as well as top-down efforts on creating metabolic atlases for major cell types<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> and finding metabolic subtypes in cancer cell lines<sup><xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> reinforce this interest. However, these efforts lack single-cell measurements to complement either bulk metabolomics or metabolic modeling. We aim to contribute to bridging this gap and democratize single-cell metabolomics by providing SpaceM, a method for single-cell metabolomics of cultured cells. For each cell, SpaceM delivers a metabolic profile as well as morphometric properties and fluorescence intensities, can analyse thousands of cells each sampled <italic>in situ,</italic> is applicable to a broad range of adherent cell types cultured according to commonly-used practices and avoids any cell perturbation prior to cell fixation.</p>
    <p id="P21">SpaceM complements other recently proposed single-cell metabolomics methods by delivering unique advantages in the context of analysis of cultured adherent cells. SpaceM offers higher throughput compared to cell microsampling followed by ultra-high-sensitive mass spectrometry<sup><xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup>. Compared to laser-capture microdissection coupled with mass spectrometry e.g. through the liquid vortex capture or open port interface<sup><xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup>, SpaceM focuses on the application to cultured cells (as compared to selected cells within a tissue section), offers a higher throughput, and delivers single-cell microscopy readouts.</p>
    <p id="P22">Using imaging mass spectrometry is emerging as a viable option for single-cell metabolomics <sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>–<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup>. Compared to one prominent example which uses a microarray for near-single-cell isolation <sup><xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup>, SpaceM allows cells to be analyzed in their native culturing environment thus avoiding any perturbation and delivering microscopy-based morphometric properties and cell-cell relationships. Compared to another prominent example, the MicroMS method using microscopy-guided cell ablation<sup><xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup>, SpaceM offers several advantages. First, SpaceM can use any modern MALDI-imaging source without the need for a custom laser control. This is achieved by registering pre- and post-MALDI microscopy images with a reproducible subcellular precision in a fully automated way (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Extended Data Fig. 2</xref>). Second, unlike MicroMS that requires cell dissociation, isolation, or reseeding to achieve sufficient spacing between cells<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup>, SpaceM can directly analyze cells cultured at a high confluency in their native growth context by avoiding perturbations prior to fixation which are known to otherwise cause stress responses, metabolome alterations, and cell damages. This provides a substantial advantage for various commonly-used cell types such as used in our study (e.g. HeLa). Third, estimation of ablated cellular parts with a subcellular precision allowed us to develop a novel signal processing pipeline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig 4</xref>) which provides a clear improvement of the co-cultured NIH3T3 and HeLa cell type classification, used here as a proxy for single-cell resolution (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Supp. Fig. 6B</xref>). We further proposed a model for validating single-cell metabolomics of cell cultures by predicting co-cultured cell types, following the validation principles established in single-cell RNA-sequencing<sup><xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup>. Addressing the current lack of established validation approaches, we hope this can benefit method development and validation in single-cell metabolomics.</p>
    <p id="P23">Unbiased MALDI-imaging analysis -- as used in SpaceM -- leads to the cases of co-sampling neighboring cells by the same ablation mark. Although our normalization and ablation mark filtering were already designed to minimize the propagation of this effect to the intensities of the co-sampled cells, we have systematically investigated possible negative effects of the co-sampling. We have found that, with our normalization and filtration, the co-sampling only minimally affects the accuracy of the cell type prediction in spatially-heterogeneous co-cultures thus also indirectly confirming no negative effect on the single-cell resolution (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Supp. Fig. 6</xref>). Further, we investigated the impact of the co-sampling on the metabolic states identified in hepatocytes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Supp. Fig. 11</xref>, data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref> were computed with a sampling specificity value of 40%). Although excluding co-sampling ablation marks heavily reduced the number of cells (21.009 cells, compared 29.738 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>), it led to the identification of the same metabolic states (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Supp. Fig. 11A</xref>). Moreover, it did not change the metabolic state markers although reducing their statistical significance, likely due the lower number of cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Supp. Fig. 11A</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">B</xref>). Finally, excluding co-sampling ablation marks did not affect the balance of the metabolic states within each hepatocyte culture condition (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Supp. Fig. 11C</xref>). Altogether, we conclude that the presented SpaceM processing approach delivers a substantial advantage over systematically excluding co-sampling ablation marks as it improves the single cell resolution while retaining more cells thus providing stronger statistical power.</p>
    <p id="P24">Single-cell metabolomics of NAFLD/NASH was long-demanded to answer open questions about the associated liver metabolic reprogramming, motivated by the rising incidence of NAFLD/NASH, lack of treatment<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> and high cell-cell heterogeneity of hepatic LDs<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>.

    <p id="P25">We used a differentiated human hepatocyte cell line, dHepaRG which, unlike 2D <italic>in vitro</italic> cultured primary hepatocytes, exhibit a stable gene expression pattern, and is broadly used for investigating hepatic lipid metabolism and drug development<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>. The considered conditions model the stages of NAFLD-NASH progression: from homeostasis (condition CTRL) towards NAFLD (condition +FA), and further towards NASH (condition +FA+IL17A)<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>.</p>
    <p id="P26">SpaceM helped characterize cell-cell metabolic heterogeneity of hepatocytes also within conditions. The clear separation of steatotic hepatocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>) from the rest of the population indicates a switch rather than a gradual change from the intermediate to the steatotic state. Previously, a steatotic subpopulation was associated with a protective function by accumulating LD-induced lipotoxicity that is advantageous for the whole population<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>.</p>
    <p id="P27">Although lipid droplets can greatly vary in composition<sup><xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref></sup>, this heterogeneity cannot be resolved by lipophilic stainings as LD540. We explored the heterogeneity of levels of some neutral lipids in stimulated hepatocytes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Supp. Fig. 10</xref>). The intensities of selected steatotic markers showed a bimodal distribution not observed for LD540. This suggests that hepatocytes can be divided into two distinct populations, with low and high levels of steatotic markers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Supp. Fig. 10A</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">B</xref>). The bimodality of intermediate cells indicates that the overall bimodality cannot be explained by the presence of two states alone (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Supp. Fig. 10B</xref>). This could either reflect a clustering artifact or biological heterogeneity of LD compositions for intermediate-state cells. Together, these results illustrate the importance of studying metabolism at single-cell resolution in combination with microscopy.</p>
    <p id="P28">In line with previous reports, a number of steatotic markers were reproduced in our <italic>in vivo</italic> mouse model of NASH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3F</xref>). All but one validated triglyceride marker of the steatotic state are composed of palmitic acid (16:0), palmitoleic acid (16:1), and oleic acids (18:1) which were reported to increase in the liver of patients with NAFLD/NASH<sup><xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref></sup>. The steatotic-state-markers TG(50:1) and TG(48:1) were reported among the three most associated lipids with the fatty liver index (FLI, in the Fenland and NSHD studies) and with fat accumulation upon NASH<sup><xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref></sup>. Together, this demonstrates the <italic>in vivo</italic> relevance of our single-cell metabolomics analysis of dHepaRG hepatocytes.</p>
    <p id="P29">SpaceM can differentiate cells within a state. The +FA steatotic cells (“benign” steatotic hepatocytes) and the +FA+IL17A steatotic cells (“inflammatory” steatotic hepatocytes) have little overlap in the PAGA plot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B–C</xref>) suggesting a difference in their metabolic profiles. Differential analysis revealed that ceramide phosphocholines (sphingomyelins) were highly enriched in the “inflammatory” steatotic hepatocytes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Supp. Fig. 12</xref>). This is consistent with studies reporting an increase in sphingolipids including ceramides and sphingomyelins upon NASH compared to “benign” NAFLD in both mice and humans<sup><xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>,<xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref></sup>. Although increased sphingolipids can be explained by the oxidative stress and systemic inflammation<sup><xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref></sup>, a mechanistic explanation is still lacking. Reproducing this effect in dHepaRG cells suggests the potential of <italic>in vitro</italic> single-cell metabolomics in deciphering the function of these bioactive lipids in NAFLD/NASH.</p>
    <p id="P30">Overall, the open source SpaceM method not only fills a large yet empty niche in the booming field of single-cell metabolomics but already helped characterizing metabolic heterogeneity and states of stimulated dHepaRG hepatocytes, with the results validated <italic>in vivo</italic> and in line with previous reports. The simple design, low requirements, and compatibility with cell biology practices will likely pave a way towards democratizing single-cell metabolomics of cell cultures.</p>

Then, we applied morphological image analysis operations of closing and then opening to fill in the holes in the image and to remove individual noisy pixels. This provided estimations of the centers of mass of each ablation mark (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Extended Data Fig 1</xref>). In step c), we fit a theoretical rectangular grid to the ablation marks. The numbers of X- and Y-grid steps were defined as set up during the MALDI acquisition. The center of the acquisition region was considered as the center of the grid. The orientation of the grid with respect to the post-MALDI microscopy image was optimized by finding an angle which resulted in the best overlap between the grid lines and the detected ablation marks. The X- and Y-spacing of the grid were optimized by minimizing the distance between the grid nodes and the center of mass of the nearest neighbor ablation mark. Then, only ablation marks which were the nearest neighbors to the grid nodes were taken and re-indexed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Fig 3</xref>). This provided X- and Y-coordinates for each ablation mark associated with a collected MALDI spectrum. In order to improve estimations of the ablations marks areas used later for normalization, their segmentation was further improved by applying a custom region-growing algorithm implemented in Python. In step d), co-registration of pre- and post-MALDI microscopy images was done based on the pen marks drawn on the edge of the wells used as fiducials. We first segmented the pen marks in both pre- and post-MALDI bright-field microscopy images using Otsu’s intensity thresholding method. Then, we used the basin-hopping optimization algorithm (Python implementation from the <italic>scipy</italic> package v0.18.1) to find the best linear transformation matching the coordinates of the edges of the pen marks between the pre- and post-MALDI images (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Extended Data Fig 2</xref>). The optimal linear transformation was applied to the post-MALDI microscopy images to map the ablation marks to the pre-MALDI microscopy images.</p>

      <p id="P44">A normalized intensity of each metabolite in a single cell was constructed as follows. For each cell, we only considered the ablation marks which were overlapping with cells by at least 45% of their ablation area. This overlap is called sampling area. Additionally, the ablation marks that share less than 90% of their sampling area with the cell of interest are discarded. The metabolite intensities coming from an ablation mark were normalized by dividing them by the ratio of the sampling area to the area of the ablation mark. Finally, for each cell its normalized metabolite intensities were calculated as the weighted average normalized intensities of the associated ablation marks where the weights are defined as the ratio of the shared pixels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig 4</xref>).</p>

      <title>Selecting intracellular metabolites</title>
      <p id="P45">We selected metabolite annotations corresponding to intracellular metabolites as follows. First, for each ablation mark we assigned to it the inside-cells label having values either of zero or one based on whether the mark has any overlap with any cell. Then, for each metabolite ion image, its intensities were binarized to zero-one values by selecting a threshold leading to the highest Spearman correlation with the inside-cells labels. The threshold value was found using the basin-hopping optimization algorithm. In order to consider only intracellular metabolites for further analysis, we selected those metabolite annotations whose binarized ion images were correlated with the inside-cells labels with the spearman correlation higher than 0.25. For the co-culture study we considered the metabolite annotations which were detected by METASPACE in at least 2 samples (out of 6 overall: 2 replicates of co-culture, 2 mono-cultures of NIH3T3 cells and 2 mono-cultures of HeLa cells) that led to 88 annotations. For each metabolite annotation, we pulled the ion images with the m/z tolerance of 3ppm from the imzML files.</p>

      <p id="P46">In the study of hepatocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>), we employed an advanced strategy to filter out background ions which might correspond either to matrix or contamination. First, we considered all ions annotated by METASPACE with 50% FDR. Then, two experts in MALDI-imaging performed manual tagging of these annotations (on-sample or off-sample) by loading every annotation in METASPACE and browsing the first 20 annotations from public METASPACE datasets. Based on the annotation ion images, the decision was made for each annotation whether it is more likely to be on- or off-sample. These taggings were then corrected using machine learning trained on the hepatocytes data following a molecular co-localization method we recently developed<sup><xref rid="R55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref></sup>. For every MALDI-imaging dataset, we have performed the following machine learning-based procedure to classify all its METASPACE annotations into on- and off-sample classes. First, for the ion image of each annotation we calculated its cosine co-localization with images of other annotations. As a result, every annotation was represented in a Euclidean space of the dimensions equal to the number of all considered annotations in this dataset. In this space, we have performed Support Vector Machine classification of on- and off-sample annotations by using the tags provided by experts as labels (using Python package <italic>scikit-learn</italic> 0.22.1). Overall 740 ions were classified as on-sample and were annotated by METASPACE.</p>

      <title>The SpaceM workflow and validation.</title>
      <p>SpaceM integrates light microscopy and MALDI-imaging mass spectrometry to provide a metabolic profile obtained <italic>in situ</italic> for each cell. Segmented microscopy images help delineate cells and quantify their morphometric properties, spatial organization, and fluorescence. The cells are further subjected to MALDI-imaging mass spectrometry and metabolite annotation which reveals their metabolomes, followed by normalization. <bold>B</bold>: SpaceM provides a single-cell spatio-molecular matrix that integrates the metabolic profiles and other information obtained using microscopy. <bold>C</bold>: We validated SpaceM by predicting cell types of co-cultured human HeLa epithelial cells (H1B-mCherry, magenta) and mouse NIH3T3 fibroblasts (GFP, cyan). Representative image from 2 independent experiments. <bold>D</bold>: UMAP visualization of 846 co-cultured cells (HeLa, magenta; NIH3T3, cyan) using intensities of 88 metabolites. Unsupervised Leiden clustering applied to the metabolic profiles classified both cell types with an accuracy of 91.3% (see also <bold>Figure S7</bold>). <bold>E</bold>: Volcano plot (log2 of the fold change HeLa/NIH3T3 vs. -log10 of the two-tailed independent <italic>t</italic>-test <italic>p</italic>-value) showing differential properties of the 88 detected metabolites.</p>

      <title>SpaceM identifies a steatotic subpopulation in lipid stimulated human hepatocytes.</title>
      <p><bold>A</bold>: Microscopy images of the human dHepaRG hepatocytes stimulated with oleic and palmitic fatty acids illustrating their heterogeneity in lipid droplets accumulation; red: LD540 staining for lipid droplets; blue: Hoechst staining for cell nuclei. Representative image from 4 independent experiments. <bold>B</bold>: UMAP visualization of single-cell metabolic profiles (740 metabolites) of 2,840 single cells revealed two co-existing subpopulations with statistically different lipid droplet levels (see also <bold>Figure S9</bold>). <bold>C</bold>: UMAP plots showing single-cell intensities of metabolites most associated with the lipid droplet accumulation: triglyceride TG(48:0), Spearman correlation r=0.38 (two-tailed test <italic>p</italic>-value=2.04e-100, ***), and an ion corresponding either to lysophosphatidylethanolamine LPE(21:1) or isomeric lysophosphatidylcholine LPC(18:1), negative Spearman r=−0.23 (two-tailed test <italic>p</italic>-value=1.09e-34, ***). <bold>D</bold>: Correlation values between LD540 and lipid intensities across 2,840 single-cells, grouped by the lipid class. Tri-(TG) and di-glycerides (DG) are the most correlated which is in line with their reported function to compose the hepatic LDs core. Tukey box plots for each lipid class: center line: median; box limits: upper and lower quartiles; whiskers: 1.5x interquartile range. <bold>E</bold>: Enriched lipid ontology terms (LO) for lipids with an LD540-correlation &gt;0.1 and &lt;−0.1. Enriched LO terms from lipids with a high correlation with LD540 show enrichment of the neutral lipid metabolism, TGs, DGs, and lipid droplet biology, which is expected and therefore serves as a supportive argument for the capacity of SpaceM to detect and quantify biologically relevant molecules.</p>

    <title>Introduction</title>
    <p id="P2">Organisms are composed of cells of various types, in different states, and functions. A key component is the intracellular metabolome, a repertoire of metabolites and lipids involved in virtually all cellular processes. Recent discoveries transformed our understanding of metabolites and lipids beyond being metabolic building blocks and shed light on their roles in signaling, epigenome regulation, immunity, inflammation, and cancer<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>. The importance of the metabolome, and the emerging capacities of metabolomics makes metabolome profiling an attractive approach to read out the state of the organism, organ, and cells<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>.</p>
    <p id="P3">In parallel, single-cell technologies have revolutionized biology by highlighting the extent of cellular heterogeneity within tissues<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> and even among monoclonal cells<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>–<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>. However, investigating metabolism at the single-cell level <italic>in situ</italic> was out of reach until recently<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>. Over the past years, pioneered by <sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>, the introduction of single-cell metabolomics methods demonstrated the feasibility of characterizing metabolic heterogeneity and discriminating cell types<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>–<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>. Certainly, their relatively low throughput, requirements for custom mass spectrometry instrumentation, challenges in analysis of cells cultured at a high density, and the lack of computational methods for downstream analyses, altogether led to a limited accessibility of single-cell metabolomics.</p>
    <p id="P4">Here, we aim to democratize single-cell metabolomics for cultured cells by introducing an open-source method, SpaceM, along with a toolbox of supplemental methods for metabolite intensity normalization and filtering, quality control, downstream data analysis, and interpretation. SpaceM is compatible with conventional cell culture practices, and can be applied to cells at high confluency. Importantly, our method does not require a custom mass spectrometry setup but rather uses commercially-available Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption Ionization (MALDI)-imaging mass spectrometry and light microscopy. The cornerstone of SpaceM is the precise estimation of which cell parts were locally ablated by the laser, achieved by co-registering microscopy images of cells with microscopy images of MALDI laser ablation marks with a subcellular precision.</p>
    <p id="P5">Ultimately, SpaceM generates a spatio-molecular matrix for each cell containing a normalized metabolic profile and microscopy-derived phenotypic properties such as cell fluorescence intensities and morpho-spatial features. SpaceM detects &gt;100 metabolites and lipids from &gt;1,000 cells per hour, demonstrating high sensitivity and throughput. The single-cell resolution of SpaceM was validated using our proposed model of co-cultured human epithelial cells (HeLa) and mouse fibroblast cells (NIH3T3) where the cell types were predicted with an accuracy of 91.3% solely based on the single-cell metabolomes.</p>
    <p id="P6">Using SpaceM, we characterized metabolic states within an isogenic cell population of human differentiated hepatocytes, dHepaRGs, an established <italic>in vitro</italic> model of Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) and Non-Alcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH)<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>, characterized by a profound and heterogeneous lipid metabolism remodelling<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>. SpaceM provided single-cell profiles from 29,738 hepatocytes representing intensities of &gt;700 lipids from various classes, including neutral glycerolipids (e.g. triglycerides), glycerophospholipids and sphingolipids. Among hepatocytes stimulated with fatty acids, we discovered a subpopulation with distinctly altered lipid profiles. These hepatocytes consistently compose 24% of the population and are characterized by an aberrant accumulation of lipid droplets and neutral lipids characteristic of a metabolic state called steatosis. We explored how inflammation affects hepatocyte heterogeneity by further challenging them with the cytokine IL-17A, a known player in NASH-associated inflammation<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>. This shifted almost all hepatocytes (93%) into the steatotic metabolic state and impacted metabolic cell-cell heterogeneity. Furthermore, SpaceM revealed that inhibiting canonical NF-κB signalling alters the relative cell distribution within metabolic states, indicating a potential role for this pathway in regulating hepatocyte metabolic heterogeneity under inflammation-induced conditions. Our metabolic state markers are in line with previous literature and were structurally and quantitatively validated using bulk lipidomics of an <italic>in vivo</italic> NASH murine model<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>. This highlights the relevance of the dHepaRG <italic>in vitro</italic> NAFLD/NASH model and the capacity of SpaceM to discover and characterize biologically-relevant metabolic states. Overall, considering the demonstrated potential of SpaceM to reveal and characterize disease-relevant metabolic states, as well as the accessible nature of the method, we expect to democratize single-cell metabolomics of diverse cell cultures and co-cultures.</p>

      <title>The SpaceM method</title>
      <p id="P7">A key challenge of MALDI-based single-cell metabolomics is the assignment of metabolite intensities to individual cells. To address this, we propose SpaceM as a method for single-cell metabolomics of cultured cells. SpaceM integrates MALDI-imaging with light microscopy followed by image segmentation and registration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Supp. Fig. 1</xref>).</p>
      <p id="P8">For SpaceM, cells need to be cultured on a microscopy-compatible substrate, followed by fixation, fluorescence staining and drying. SpaceM starts with the acquisition of microscopy images, called pre-MALDI. Cell segmentation of pre-MALDI images provides a broad panel of phenotypic information including fluorescent intensities and spatio-morphological properties of individual cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A i</xref>). Next, the sample is sprayed with a MALDI matrix salt and MALDI-imaging mass spectrometry is performed for untargeted detection of molecules, including metabolites and lipids<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A ii</xref>).</p>
      <p id="P9">The next steps of SpaceM aim to detect the sampled cell areas. The MALDI laser leaves discernable ablation marks in the overlaying matrix which can be used to identify the areas contributing to metabolite intensities. However, the opacity of the MALDI-matrix prevents simultaneous inspection of both cells and ablation marks. Therefore, the pre-MALDI image is co-registered with a second round of microscopy images, called post-MALDI, from which ablation marks are segmented (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Extended Data Fig 1</xref>). Although methods to integrate MALDI-imaging data and microscopy exist, their registration accuracies are worse than 1 μm. A prominent example includes registration of MALDI-imaging data of tissue sections with histological images by detecting ablation marks in autofluorescence microscopy images with the reported registration accuracy of 2.2 μm <sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>. While such accuracy is suitable for tissue section analysis, the aim of SpaceM is to precisely evaluate the ablated parts of single cells. For this reason we developed a high-precision image registration that employs pen marks drawn at the edges of the cell culture which provided over 400,000 fiducial points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Extended Data Fig 2</xref>). We estimated that at least 3,000 fiducials are needed to achieve a sub-micron registration accuracy (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Supp. Fig. 2</xref>), a prerequisite for estimating metabolite intensities at the single-cell level, given that in our study cell sizes range from 37μm to 59μm (25th/75th percentiles, 37μm to 49μm for the dHepaRGs, 39μm to 59μm for the NIH3T3 and 30μm to 39μm for the HeLa cells) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Supp. Fig. 3</xref>). Finally, the ablation marks are re-indexed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Fig 3</xref>) to couple MALDI data with microscopy.</p>
      <p id="P10">To construct single-cell metabolic profiles from MALDI measurements, we developed an approach accounting for the overlap between cells and ablation marks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A iii</xref>) to compensate for differences in cell sampling and filter out ambiguous ablation marks sampling multiple cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig 4</xref>). Ultimately, SpaceM provides a single-cell spatio-molecular matrix with a multiplex readout for each individual cell quantified in its native spatial context. This readout comprises an untargeted metabolic profile, fluorescence intensities and spatio-morphological features (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). This information can be used to link metabolism and phenotype at the single-cell level.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="S4">
      <title>Validating SpaceM by predicting cell types with single-cell resolution</title>
      <p id="P11">To validate SpaceM, we predicted the cell types of co-cultured human HeLa cells and mouse NIH3T3 fibroblasts, constitutively expressing H2B-mCherry and GFP respectively, solely based on their single-cell metabolic profiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C–E</xref>). To confirm the prediction, cell types were determined using a linear boundary between mCherry and GFP intensities (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Supp. Fig. 4A</xref>). SpaceM provided metabolic profiles of 88 metabolites for 445 HeLa and 400 NIH3T3 co-cultured cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) visualization based on metabolite intensities of two replicates reproducibly grouped cells by their type (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Supp. Fig. 4B</xref>). Metabolite intensities were also consistent across replicates, indicating low analytical variability (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Supp. Fig. 4C</xref>). Integration of the replicates preserved the relative organisation of cell types in UMAP (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Supp. Fig. 4D</xref>). The linear discriminant analysis performed on the metabolic profiles resulted in the classification of HeLa from NIH cells with an accuracy of 91.3% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Supp. Fig. 4E</xref>). The cell type markers include phosphatidylinositols PI(34:1) and PI(34:2) for HeLa cells and phosphoethanolamine PE(40:6) for NIH3T3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>). Importantly, cells surrounded by the other cell type were correctly classified, demonstrating the single-cell precision of SpaceM (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Supp. Fig. 4F</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">G</xref>). We investigated the impact of co-sampling neighboring cells and diffusible metabolites on the cell type classification. For this, we took advantage of the unbiased sampling of SpaceM and constructed the diffusion profile of each detected metabolite (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Supp. Fig. 5</xref>). Removing all co-sampling ablation marks and discarding the diffused metabolites did not affect the cell type classification accuracy (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Supp. Fig. 6A</xref>). The classification accuracy was optimal when including co-sampling ablation marks that share at least 90% of their sampling area with a cell of interest (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Supp. Fig. 6B</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">D</xref>). Metabolic markers were validated by using individual mono-cultures of each cell type analyzed with both SpaceM and LC-MS/MS (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Supp. Fig. 7</xref>). Overall, the fold change trends of the cell type markers were validated for 85.2% of the detected metabolites (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Supp. Fig. 7A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Supp. Fig. 7B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Supp. Fig. 7D</xref>). Using LC-MS/MS, a total of 19 lipids were detected in common with SpaceM; of which 15 lipids showed the same trends (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Supp. Fig. 7C</xref>). We found the relative metabolite intensities of cell-type-markers to be highly consistent between culture conditions although the NIH3T3 cells had higher intensities when co-cultured with HeLa cells, potentially indicating a metabolic adaptation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Supp. Fig. 7E</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">F</xref>).</p>

    <sec id="S5">
      <title>SpaceM identifies a steatotic subpopulation of human hepatocytes</title>
      <p id="P12">Beyond characterizing cell types, we used SpaceM to identify metabolic states within an isogenic cell line of differentiated human hepatocytes (dHepaRG) upon stimulation with fatty acids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). This model is of particular relevance to study the onset of NAFLD, in which hepatocytes undergo lipid metabolism remodeling and accumulate intracellular lipid droplets (LDs), known as steatosis. NAFLD, in turn, can progress towards NASH, characterized by systemic and hepatic inflammation<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>. The known high heterogeneity of LD accumulation in hepatocytes <sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> (also illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>) reinforces the need for single-cell methods.</p>
      <p id="P13">Hepatocytes were stimulated with oleic and palmitic fatty acids (FA) to model NAFLD-specific lipid metabolism<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>. The LD accumulation was quantified by the neutral lipid fluorescent dye LD540<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>. SpaceM provided profiles of 740 metabolites from 2,840 single dHepaRG cells. UMAP and unsupervised clustering of metabolic profiles revealed two distinct subpopulations characterized by statistically different amounts of LDs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Supp. Fig. 8</xref>). Correlating LD540 and lipid intensities provided the following markers: triglyceride TG(48:0) (Spearman r=0.38***) for a smaller subpopulation, and isomeric lipids lysophosphatidylethanolamine LPE(21:1) or lysophosphatidylcholine LPC(18:1) (Spearman r=−0.23***) for a bigger subpopulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>).

      <title>Characterisation of metabolic states of lipid stimulated hepatocytes in an inflammatory environment</title>
      <p id="P14">The lipid composition in hepatocytes is tightly regulated under homeostatic conditions. However, an excess of free fatty acids, together with additional stressors, including inflammatory cytokines, promotes aberrant lipid storage, ultimately leading to NASH.</p>
      <p id="P15">To investigate the metabolic remodeling of single hepatocytes during NAFLD to NASH transition, we considered four conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>): (i) A control condition (CTRL) modelling the homeostatic state; (ii) stimulation with oleic and palmitic fatty acids (+FA) as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>, modelling non-inflammatory NAFLD; (iii) stimulation with FAs and inflammatory cytokine IL-17A (+FA+IL17A), modelling NASH and (iv) stimulation with FAs, IL-17A and TPCA-1 (+FA+IL17A+TPCA1), an inhibitor of NF-κB signalling, probing the metabolic response upon inhibition of IL-17A-induced inflammation.</p>
      <p id="P16">SpaceM provided profiles of 740 metabolites from 29,738 hepatocytes with high reproducibility between replicates (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Supp. Fig. 9</xref>). Unsupervised clustering of the metabolic profiles revealed three major clusters representing the homeostatic, intermediate and steatotic metabolic states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>) with statistically different LD levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). The CTRL condition was separated from FA-stimulated conditions and constitutes its own “homeostatic” metabolic state. Among +FA cells, 75.2% and 24.3% reside in the intermediate and steatotic states, respectively. Induction of inflammatory signalling with IL-17A drastically affected hepatocytes, with 93% of +FA+IL17A hepatocytes residing in the steatotic state. Of note, inhibition of NF-κB signalling by TPCA-1 prevents the uniform metabolic response seen upon stimulation with IL-17A as 75.2% of hepatocytes remain in the intermediate state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>).</p>
      <p id="P17">LD levels exhibit a higher variation in the +FA+IL17A condition (coefficient of variation, CV=0.54) compared to the +FA and +FA+IL17A+TPCA1 conditions (CV=0.37 and 0.45, respectively) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Supp. Fig. 10A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">10C</xref>). Conversely, individual lipids showed a higher variability of their single-cell intensities (showing a bimodal distribution) in the +FA and +FA+IL17A+TPCA1 conditions compared to the +FA+IL17A condition (showing a unimodal distribution) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Supp. Fig. 10B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">10C</xref>). Together, these results indicate that inducing inflammatory signalling in differentiated human hepatocytes with IL-17A increases cell-cell heterogeneity of LD levels but reduces heterogeneity of individual neutral lipids.</p>
      <p id="P18">Pseudo-time analysis of single-cell metabolic profiles allowed us to characterize the progression of hepatocytes from the homeostatic to the steatotic state, (black line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). Metabolic state markers change gradually along pseudotime, indicating metabolic heterogeneity within every state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>). Most markers of the homeostatic state are phospholipids such as phosphatidylcholines, phosphatidylethanolamines and phosphatidylinositols covering housekeeping metabolic functions including membrane composition of ER and mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E</xref>). On the other hand, metabolic markers of the steatotic state are mostly neutral lipids such as triglycerides and diglycerides with a functional relevance in lipid storage, LD formation and lipid-mediated signalling.</p>
      <p id="P19">The metabolic-state-markers were further validated using LC-MS/MS-based lipidomics of hepatic tissues from normal diet (ND) and Western diet (WD) mice. This helped perform MS/MS structural analysis and compare to the bulk levels of the markers <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3F</xref>). The differences discovered by SpaceM were highly consistent with the marker levels in ND and WD mice.

    <title>Discussion</title>
    <p id="P20">The topic of metabolic heterogeneity has attracted a wealth of attention<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>. Bottom-up efforts on metabolic characterization of cell types<sup><xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> and neighboring cells<sup><xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> as well as top-down efforts on creating metabolic atlases for major cell types<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> and finding metabolic subtypes in cancer cell lines<sup><xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> reinforce this interest. However, these efforts lack single-cell measurements to complement either bulk metabolomics or metabolic modeling. We aim to contribute to bridging this gap and democratize single-cell metabolomics by providing SpaceM, a method for single-cell metabolomics of cultured cells. For each cell, SpaceM delivers a metabolic profile as well as morphometric properties and fluorescence intensities, can analyse thousands of cells each sampled <italic>in situ,</italic> is applicable to a broad range of adherent cell types cultured according to commonly-used practices and avoids any cell perturbation prior to cell fixation.</p>
    <p id="P21">SpaceM complements other recently proposed single-cell metabolomics methods by delivering unique advantages in the context of analysis of cultured adherent cells. SpaceM offers higher throughput compared to cell microsampling followed by ultra-high-sensitive mass spectrometry<sup><xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup>. Compared to laser-capture microdissection coupled with mass spectrometry e.g. through the liquid vortex capture or open port interface<sup><xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup>, SpaceM focuses on the application to cultured cells (as compared to selected cells within a tissue section), offers a higher throughput, and delivers single-cell microscopy readouts.</p>
    <p id="P22">Using imaging mass spectrometry is emerging as a viable option for single-cell metabolomics <sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>–<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup>. Compared to one prominent example which uses a microarray for near-single-cell isolation <sup><xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup>, SpaceM allows cells to be analyzed in their native culturing environment thus avoiding any perturbation and delivering microscopy-based morphometric properties and cell-cell relationships. Compared to another prominent example, the MicroMS method using microscopy-guided cell ablation<sup><xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup>, SpaceM offers several advantages. First, SpaceM can use any modern MALDI-imaging source without the need for a custom laser control. This is achieved by registering pre- and post-MALDI microscopy images with a reproducible subcellular precision in a fully automated way (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Extended Data Fig. 2</xref>). Second, unlike MicroMS that requires cell dissociation, isolation, or reseeding to achieve sufficient spacing between cells<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup>, SpaceM can directly analyze cells cultured at a high confluency in their native growth context by avoiding perturbations prior to fixation which are known to otherwise cause stress responses, metabolome alterations, and cell damages. This provides a substantial advantage for various commonly-used cell types such as used in our study (e.g. HeLa). Third, estimation of ablated cellular parts with a subcellular precision allowed us to develop a novel signal processing pipeline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig 4</xref>) which provides a clear improvement of the co-cultured NIH3T3 and HeLa cell type classification, used here as a proxy for single-cell resolution (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Supp. Fig. 6B</xref>). We further proposed a model for validating single-cell metabolomics of cell cultures by predicting co-cultured cell types, following the validation principles established in single-cell RNA-sequencing<sup><xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup>. Addressing the current lack of established validation approaches, we hope this can benefit method development and validation in single-cell metabolomics.</p>
    <p id="P23">Unbiased MALDI-imaging analysis -- as used in SpaceM -- leads to the cases of co-sampling neighboring cells by the same ablation mark. Although our normalization and ablation mark filtering were already designed to minimize the propagation of this effect to the intensities of the co-sampled cells, we have systematically investigated possible negative effects of the co-sampling. We have found that, with our normalization and filtration, the co-sampling only minimally affects the accuracy of the cell type prediction in spatially-heterogeneous co-cultures thus also indirectly confirming no negative effect on the single-cell resolution (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Supp. Fig. 6</xref>). Further, we investigated the impact of the co-sampling on the metabolic states identified in hepatocytes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Supp. Fig. 11</xref>, data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref> were computed with a sampling specificity value of 40%). Although excluding co-sampling ablation marks heavily reduced the number of cells (21.009 cells, compared 29.738 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>), it led to the identification of the same metabolic states (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Supp. Fig. 11A</xref>). Moreover, it did not change the metabolic state markers although reducing their statistical significance, likely due the lower number of cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Supp. Fig. 11A</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">B</xref>). Finally, excluding co-sampling ablation marks did not affect the balance of the metabolic states within each hepatocyte culture condition (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Supp. Fig. 11C</xref>). Altogether, we conclude that the presented SpaceM processing approach delivers a substantial advantage over systematically excluding co-sampling ablation marks as it improves the single cell resolution while retaining more cells thus providing stronger statistical power.</p>
    <p id="P24">Single-cell metabolomics of NAFLD/NASH was long-demanded to answer open questions about the associated liver metabolic reprogramming, motivated by the rising incidence of NAFLD/NASH, lack of treatment<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> and high cell-cell heterogeneity of hepatic LDs<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>.

    <p id="P25">We used a differentiated human hepatocyte cell line, dHepaRG which, unlike 2D <italic>in vitro</italic> cultured primary hepatocytes, exhibit a stable gene expression pattern, and is broadly used for investigating hepatic lipid metabolism and drug development<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>. The considered conditions model the stages of NAFLD-NASH progression: from homeostasis (condition CTRL) towards NAFLD (condition +FA), and further towards NASH (condition +FA+IL17A)<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>.</p>
    <p id="P26">SpaceM helped characterize cell-cell metabolic heterogeneity of hepatocytes also within conditions. The clear separation of steatotic hepatocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>) from the rest of the population indicates a switch rather than a gradual change from the intermediate to the steatotic state. Previously, a steatotic subpopulation was associated with a protective function by accumulating LD-induced lipotoxicity that is advantageous for the whole population<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>.</p>
    <p id="P27">Although lipid droplets can greatly vary in composition<sup><xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref></sup>, this heterogeneity cannot be resolved by lipophilic stainings as LD540. We explored the heterogeneity of levels of some neutral lipids in stimulated hepatocytes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Supp. Fig. 10</xref>). The intensities of selected steatotic markers showed a bimodal distribution not observed for LD540. This suggests that hepatocytes can be divided into two distinct populations, with low and high levels of steatotic markers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Supp. Fig. 10A</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">B</xref>). The bimodality of intermediate cells indicates that the overall bimodality cannot be explained by the presence of two states alone (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Supp. Fig. 10B</xref>). This could either reflect a clustering artifact or biological heterogeneity of LD compositions for intermediate-state cells. Together, these results illustrate the importance of studying metabolism at single-cell resolution in combination with microscopy.</p>
    <p id="P28">In line with previous reports, a number of steatotic markers were reproduced in our <italic>in vivo</italic> mouse model of NASH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3F</xref>). All but one validated triglyceride marker of the steatotic state are composed of palmitic acid (16:0), palmitoleic acid (16:1), and oleic acids (18:1) which were reported to increase in the liver of patients with NAFLD/NASH<sup><xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref></sup>. The steatotic-state-markers TG(50:1) and TG(48:1) were reported among the three most associated lipids with the fatty liver index (FLI, in the Fenland and NSHD studies) and with fat accumulation upon NASH<sup><xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref></sup>. Together, this demonstrates the <italic>in vivo</italic> relevance of our single-cell metabolomics analysis of dHepaRG hepatocytes.</p>
    <p id="P29">SpaceM can differentiate cells within a state. The +FA steatotic cells (“benign” steatotic hepatocytes) and the +FA+IL17A steatotic cells (“inflammatory” steatotic hepatocytes) have little overlap in the PAGA plot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B–C</xref>) suggesting a difference in their metabolic profiles. Differential analysis revealed that ceramide phosphocholines (sphingomyelins) were highly enriched in the “inflammatory” steatotic hepatocytes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Supp. Fig. 12</xref>). This is consistent with studies reporting an increase in sphingolipids including ceramides and sphingomyelins upon NASH compared to “benign” NAFLD in both mice and humans<sup><xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>,<xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref></sup>. Although increased sphingolipids can be explained by the oxidative stress and systemic inflammation<sup><xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref></sup>, a mechanistic explanation is still lacking. Reproducing this effect in dHepaRG cells suggests the potential of <italic>in vitro</italic> single-cell metabolomics in deciphering the function of these bioactive lipids in NAFLD/NASH.</p>
    <p id="P30">Overall, the open source SpaceM method not only fills a large yet empty niche in the booming field of single-cell metabolomics but already helped characterizing metabolic heterogeneity and states of stimulated dHepaRG hepatocytes, with the results validated <italic>in vivo</italic> and in line with previous reports. The simple design, low requirements, and compatibility with cell biology practices will likely pave a way towards democratizing single-cell metabolomics of cell cultures.</p>

MS parameters in the Tune software (version 2.5 Build 2042, ThermoFisher Scientific) were set to the spray voltage of 4.10 kV, S-Lens 80 eV, capillary temperature 250 C. The data was converted from the RAW format into the imzML format containing only centroided data using the ImageQuest software, v.1.1.0 (ThermoFisher Scientific). Metabolite annotation was performed using the METASPACE cloud software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://metaspace2020.eu">https://metaspace2020.eu</ext-link>) implementing the bioinformatics methods for False Discovery Rate-controlled annotation published by us earlier <sup><xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref></sup> with the m/z tolerance of 3 ppm and FDR of 10%, 20%, and 50% against the HMDB metabolite database v2.5.</p>

      <title>Post-MALDI microscopy to detect MALDI ablation marks</title>

      <title>Association of laser ablation marks with single cells</title>
      <p id="P42">This step is the key part of the method as it solves the challenge that single cells are not visible in the post-MALDI microscopy images due to the opaque layer of MALDI matrix covering cells. Here, ablation marks left by the MALDI laser were associated with single cells in three steps: a) cells segmentation in the pre-MALDI microscopy images, b) detection of laser ablation marks in post-MALDI microscopy images, c) matching between ablation marks and MALDI mass spectra and d) co-registration of pre- and post-MALDI microscopy images to overlay the ablation marks with the segmented single cells.</p>
      <p id="P43">In step a), cells were segmented using a custom pipeline in the CellProfiler software <sup><xref rid="R54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref></sup> where the DAPI staining channel was used to generate seeds for a region growing algorithm detecting cells boundaries in the LD540-staining channel. In step b), we first denoised the bright-field microscopy images by applying a low-pass filter in the 2D Fourier frequency domain, in particular to exploit both the regular distances between ablation marks as well as the repeated shape of the ablation mark itself. Then, we applied a contrast-enhancing filter (using the <italic>clip</italic> function from the Python module <italic>numpy</italic>) and Otsu’s thresholding method to binarize the image. Then, we applied morphological image analysis operations of closing and then opening to fill in the holes in the image and to remove individual noisy pixels. This provided estimations of the centers of mass of each ablation mark (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Extended Data Fig 1</xref>). In step c), we fit a theoretical rectangular grid to the ablation marks. The numbers of X- and Y-grid steps were defined as set up during the MALDI acquisition. The center of the acquisition region was considered as the center of the grid. The orientation of the grid with respect to the post-MALDI microscopy image was optimized by finding an angle which resulted in the best overlap between the grid lines and the detected ablation marks. The X- and Y-spacing of the grid were optimized by minimizing the distance between the grid nodes and the center of mass of the nearest neighbor ablation mark. Then, only ablation marks which were the nearest neighbors to the grid nodes were taken and re-indexed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Fig 3</xref>). This provided X- and Y-coordinates for each ablation mark associated with a collected MALDI spectrum. In order to improve estimations of the ablations marks areas used later for normalization, their segmentation was further improved by applying a custom region-growing algorithm implemented in Python. In step d), co-registration of pre- and post-MALDI microscopy images was done based on the pen marks drawn on the edge of the wells used as fiducials. We first segmented the pen marks in both pre- and post-MALDI bright-field microscopy images using Otsu’s intensity thresholding method. Then, we used the basin-hopping optimization algorithm (Python implementation from the <italic>scipy</italic> package v0.18.1) to find the best linear transformation matching the coordinates of the edges of the pen marks between the pre- and post-MALDI images (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Extended Data Fig 2</xref>). The optimal linear transformation was applied to the post-MALDI microscopy images to map the ablation marks to the pre-MALDI microscopy images.</p>

      <title>SpaceM processing</title>
      <p id="P44">A normalized intensity of each metabolite in a single cell was constructed as follows. For each cell, we only considered the ablation marks which were overlapping with cells by at least 45% of their ablation area. This overlap is called sampling area. Additionally, the ablation marks that share less than 90% of their sampling area with the cell of interest are discarded. The metabolite intensities coming from an ablation mark were normalized by dividing them by the ratio of the sampling area to the area of the ablation mark. Finally, for each cell its normalized metabolite intensities were calculated as the weighted average normalized intensities of the associated ablation marks where the weights are defined as the ratio of the shared pixels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig 4</xref>).</p>

      <title>Selecting intracellular metabolites</title>
      <p id="P45">We selected metabolite annotations corresponding to intracellular metabolites as follows. First, for each ablation mark we assigned to it the inside-cells label having values either of zero or one based on whether the mark has any overlap with any cell. Then, for each metabolite ion image, its intensities were binarized to zero-one values by selecting a threshold leading to the highest Spearman correlation with the inside-cells labels. The threshold value was found using the basin-hopping optimization algorithm. In order to consider only intracellular metabolites for further analysis, we selected those metabolite annotations whose binarized ion images were correlated with the inside-cells labels with the spearman correlation higher than 0.25. For the co-culture study we considered the metabolite annotations which were detected by METASPACE in at least 2 samples (out of 6 overall: 2 replicates of co-culture, 2 mono-cultures of NIH3T3 cells and 2 mono-cultures of HeLa cells) that led to 88 annotations. For each metabolite annotation, we pulled the ion images with the m/z tolerance of 3ppm from the imzML files.</p>

      <title>Classification of ion images of METASPACE annotations into on- and off-sample classes</title>
      <p id="P46">In the study of hepatocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>), we employed an advanced strategy to filter out background ions which might correspond either to matrix or contamination. First, we considered all ions annotated by METASPACE with 50% FDR. Then, two experts in MALDI-imaging performed manual tagging of these annotations (on-sample or off-sample) by loading every annotation in METASPACE and browsing the first 20 annotations from public METASPACE datasets. Based on the annotation ion images, the decision was made for each annotation whether it is more likely to be on- or off-sample. These taggings were then corrected using machine learning trained on the hepatocytes data following a molecular co-localization method we recently developed<sup><xref rid="R55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref></sup>. For every MALDI-imaging dataset, we have performed the following machine learning-based procedure to classify all its METASPACE annotations into on- and off-sample classes. First, for the ion image of each annotation we calculated its cosine co-localization with images of other annotations. As a result, every annotation was represented in a Euclidean space of the dimensions equal to the number of all considered annotations in this dataset. In this space, we have performed Support Vector Machine classification of on- and off-sample annotations by using the tags provided by experts as labels (using Python package <italic>scikit-learn</italic> 0.22.1). Overall 740 ions were classified as on-sample and were annotated by METASPACE.</p>

      <title>The SpaceM workflow and validation.</title>
      <p>SpaceM integrates light microscopy and MALDI-imaging mass spectrometry to provide a metabolic profile obtained <italic>in situ</italic> for each cell. Segmented microscopy images help delineate cells and quantify their morphometric properties, spatial organization, and fluorescence.

    <title>Introduction</title>
    <p id="P2">Organisms are composed of cells of various types, in different states, and functions. A key component is the intracellular metabolome, a repertoire of metabolites and lipids involved in virtually all cellular processes. Recent discoveries transformed our understanding of metabolites and lipids beyond being metabolic building blocks and shed light on their roles in signaling, epigenome regulation, immunity, inflammation, and cancer<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>. The importance of the metabolome, and the emerging capacities of metabolomics makes metabolome profiling an attractive approach to read out the state of the organism, organ, and cells<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>.</p>
    <p id="P3">In parallel, single-cell technologies have revolutionized biology by highlighting the extent of cellular heterogeneity within tissues<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> and even among monoclonal cells<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>–<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>. However, investigating metabolism at the single-cell level <italic>in situ</italic> was out of reach until recently<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>. Over the past years, pioneered by <sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>, the introduction of single-cell metabolomics methods demonstrated the feasibility of characterizing metabolic heterogeneity and discriminating cell types<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>–<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>. Certainly, their relatively low throughput, requirements for custom mass spectrometry instrumentation, challenges in analysis of cells cultured at a high density, and the lack of computational methods for downstream analyses, altogether led to a limited accessibility of single-cell metabolomics.</p>
    <p id="P4">Here, we aim to democratize single-cell metabolomics for cultured cells by introducing an open-source method, SpaceM, along with a toolbox of supplemental methods for metabolite intensity normalization and filtering, quality control, downstream data analysis, and interpretation. SpaceM is compatible with conventional cell culture practices, and can be applied to cells at high confluency. Importantly, our method does not require a custom mass spectrometry setup but rather uses commercially-available Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption Ionization (MALDI)-imaging mass spectrometry and light microscopy. The cornerstone of SpaceM is the precise estimation of which cell parts were locally ablated by the laser, achieved by co-registering microscopy images of cells with microscopy images of MALDI laser ablation marks with a subcellular precision.</p>
    <p id="P5">Ultimately, SpaceM generates a spatio-molecular matrix for each cell containing a normalized metabolic profile and microscopy-derived phenotypic properties such as cell fluorescence intensities and morpho-spatial features. SpaceM detects &gt;100 metabolites and lipids from &gt;1,000 cells per hour, demonstrating high sensitivity and throughput. The single-cell resolution of SpaceM was validated using our proposed model of co-cultured human epithelial cells (HeLa) and mouse fibroblast cells (NIH3T3) where the cell types were predicted with an accuracy of 91.3% solely based on the single-cell metabolomes.</p>
    <p id="P6">Using SpaceM, we characterized metabolic states within an isogenic cell population of human differentiated hepatocytes, dHepaRGs, an established <italic>in vitro</italic> model of Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) and Non-Alcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH)<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>, characterized by a profound and heterogeneous lipid metabolism remodelling<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>. SpaceM provided single-cell profiles from 29,738 hepatocytes representing intensities of &gt;700 lipids from various classes, including neutral glycerolipids (e.g. triglycerides), glycerophospholipids and sphingolipids. Among hepatocytes stimulated with fatty acids, we discovered a subpopulation with distinctly altered lipid profiles. These hepatocytes consistently compose 24% of the population and are characterized by an aberrant accumulation of lipid droplets and neutral lipids characteristic of a metabolic state called steatosis. We explored how inflammation affects hepatocyte heterogeneity by further challenging them with the cytokine IL-17A, a known player in NASH-associated inflammation<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>. This shifted almost all hepatocytes (93%) into the steatotic metabolic state and impacted metabolic cell-cell heterogeneity. Furthermore, SpaceM revealed that inhibiting canonical NF-κB signalling alters the relative cell distribution within metabolic states, indicating a potential role for this pathway in regulating hepatocyte metabolic heterogeneity under inflammation-induced conditions. Our metabolic state markers are in line with previous literature and were structurally and quantitatively validated using bulk lipidomics of an <italic>in vivo</italic> NASH murine model<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>. This highlights the relevance of the dHepaRG <italic>in vitro</italic> NAFLD/NASH model and the capacity of SpaceM to discover and characterize biologically-relevant metabolic states. Overall, considering the demonstrated potential of SpaceM to reveal and characterize disease-relevant metabolic states, as well as the accessible nature of the method, we expect to democratize single-cell metabolomics of diverse cell cultures and co-cultures.</p>

      <title>The SpaceM method</title>
      <p id="P7">A key challenge of MALDI-based single-cell metabolomics is the assignment of metabolite intensities to individual cells. To address this, we propose SpaceM as a method for single-cell metabolomics of cultured cells. SpaceM integrates MALDI-imaging with light microscopy followed by image segmentation and registration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Supp. Fig. 1</xref>).</p>
      <p id="P8">For SpaceM, cells need to be cultured on a microscopy-compatible substrate, followed by fixation, fluorescence staining and drying. SpaceM starts with the acquisition of microscopy images, called pre-MALDI. Cell segmentation of pre-MALDI images provides a broad panel of phenotypic information including fluorescent intensities and spatio-morphological properties of individual cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A i</xref>). Next, the sample is sprayed with a MALDI matrix salt and MALDI-imaging mass spectrometry is performed for untargeted detection of molecules, including metabolites and lipids<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A ii</xref>).</p>
      <p id="P9">The next steps of SpaceM aim to detect the sampled cell areas. The MALDI laser leaves discernable ablation marks in the overlaying matrix which can be used to identify the areas contributing to metabolite intensities. However, the opacity of the MALDI-matrix prevents simultaneous inspection of both cells and ablation marks. Therefore, the pre-MALDI image is co-registered with a second round of microscopy images, called post-MALDI, from which ablation marks are segmented (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Extended Data Fig 1</xref>). Although methods to integrate MALDI-imaging data and microscopy exist, their registration accuracies are worse than 1 μm. A prominent example includes registration of MALDI-imaging data of tissue sections with histological images by detecting ablation marks in autofluorescence microscopy images with the reported registration accuracy of 2.2 μm <sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>. While such accuracy is suitable for tissue section analysis, the aim of SpaceM is to precisely evaluate the ablated parts of single cells. For this reason we developed a high-precision image registration that employs pen marks drawn at the edges of the cell culture which provided over 400,000 fiducial points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Extended Data Fig 2</xref>). We estimated that at least 3,000 fiducials are needed to achieve a sub-micron registration accuracy (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Supp. Fig. 2</xref>), a prerequisite for estimating metabolite intensities at the single-cell level, given that in our study cell sizes range from 37μm to 59μm (25th/75th percentiles, 37μm to 49μm for the dHepaRGs, 39μm to 59μm for the NIH3T3 and 30μm to 39μm for the HeLa cells) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Supp. Fig. 3</xref>). Finally, the ablation marks are re-indexed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Fig 3</xref>) to couple MALDI data with microscopy.</p>
      <p id="P10">To construct single-cell metabolic profiles from MALDI measurements, we developed an approach accounting for the overlap between cells and ablation marks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A iii</xref>) to compensate for differences in cell sampling and filter out ambiguous ablation marks sampling multiple cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig 4</xref>). Ultimately, SpaceM provides a single-cell spatio-molecular matrix with a multiplex readout for each individual cell quantified in its native spatial context. This readout comprises an untargeted metabolic profile, fluorescence intensities and spatio-morphological features (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). This information can be used to link metabolism and phenotype at the single-cell level.</p>

    <sec id="S4">
      <title>Validating SpaceM by predicting cell types with single-cell resolution</title>
      <p id="P11">To validate SpaceM, we predicted the cell types of co-cultured human HeLa cells and mouse NIH3T3 fibroblasts, constitutively expressing H2B-mCherry and GFP respectively, solely based on their single-cell metabolic profiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C–E</xref>). To confirm the prediction, cell types were determined using a linear boundary between mCherry and GFP intensities (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Supp. Fig. 4A</xref>). SpaceM provided metabolic profiles of 88 metabolites for 445 HeLa and 400 NIH3T3 co-cultured cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) visualization based on metabolite intensities of two replicates reproducibly grouped cells by their type (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Supp. Fig. 4B</xref>). Metabolite intensities were also consistent across replicates, indicating low analytical variability (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Supp. Fig. 4C</xref>). Integration of the replicates preserved the relative organisation of cell types in UMAP (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Supp. Fig. 4D</xref>). The linear discriminant analysis performed on the metabolic profiles resulted in the classification of HeLa from NIH cells with an accuracy of 91.3% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Supp. Fig. 4E</xref>). The cell type markers include phosphatidylinositols PI(34:1) and PI(34:2) for HeLa cells and phosphoethanolamine PE(40:6) for NIH3T3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>). Importantly, cells surrounded by the other cell type were correctly classified, demonstrating the single-cell precision of SpaceM (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Supp. Fig. 4F</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">G</xref>). We investigated the impact of co-sampling neighboring cells and diffusible metabolites on the cell type classification. For this, we took advantage of the unbiased sampling of SpaceM and constructed the diffusion profile of each detected metabolite (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Supp. Fig. 5</xref>). Removing all co-sampling ablation marks and discarding the diffused metabolites did not affect the cell type classification accuracy (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Supp. Fig. 6A</xref>). The classification accuracy was optimal when including co-sampling ablation marks that share at least 90% of their sampling area with a cell of interest (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Supp. Fig. 6B</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">D</xref>).

      <title>SpaceM identifies a steatotic subpopulation of human hepatocytes</title>
      <p id="P12">Beyond characterizing cell types, we used SpaceM to identify metabolic states within an isogenic cell line of differentiated human hepatocytes (dHepaRG) upon stimulation with fatty acids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). This model is of particular relevance to study the onset of NAFLD, in which hepatocytes undergo lipid metabolism remodeling and accumulate intracellular lipid droplets (LDs), known as steatosis. NAFLD, in turn, can progress towards NASH, characterized by systemic and hepatic inflammation<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>. The known high heterogeneity of LD accumulation in hepatocytes <sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> (also illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>) reinforces the need for single-cell methods.</p>

SpaceM provided profiles of 740 metabolites from 2,840 single dHepaRG cells. UMAP and unsupervised clustering of metabolic profiles revealed two distinct subpopulations characterized by statistically different amounts of LDs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Supp. Fig. 8</xref>). Correlating LD540 and lipid intensities provided the following markers: triglyceride TG(48:0) (Spearman r=0.38***) for a smaller subpopulation, and isomeric lipids lysophosphatidylethanolamine LPE(21:1) or lysophosphatidylcholine LPC(18:1) (Spearman r=−0.23***) for a bigger subpopulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>). Further marker analysis showed neutral lipids, including triglycerides and diglycerides, to be the strongest markers confirmed by lipid ontology enrichment analysis<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E</xref>).

      <title>Characterisation of metabolic states of lipid stimulated hepatocytes in an inflammatory environment</title>
      <p id="P14">The lipid composition in hepatocytes is tightly regulated under homeostatic conditions. However, an excess of free fatty acids, together with additional stressors, including inflammatory cytokines, promotes aberrant lipid storage, ultimately leading to NASH.</p>
      <p id="P15">To investigate the metabolic remodeling of single hepatocytes during NAFLD to NASH transition, we considered four conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>): (i) A control condition (CTRL) modelling the homeostatic state; (ii) stimulation with oleic and palmitic fatty acids (+FA) as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>, modelling non-inflammatory NAFLD; (iii) stimulation with FAs and inflammatory cytokine IL-17A (+FA+IL17A), modelling NASH and (iv) stimulation with FAs, IL-17A and TPCA-1 (+FA+IL17A+TPCA1), an inhibitor of NF-κB signalling, probing the metabolic response upon inhibition of IL-17A-induced inflammation.</p>
      <p id="P16">SpaceM provided profiles of 740 metabolites from 29,738 hepatocytes with high reproducibility between replicates (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Supp. Fig. 9</xref>). Unsupervised clustering of the metabolic profiles revealed three major clusters representing the homeostatic, intermediate and steatotic metabolic states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>) with statistically different LD levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). The CTRL condition was separated from FA-stimulated conditions and constitutes its own “homeostatic” metabolic state. Among +FA cells, 75.2% and 24.3% reside in the intermediate and steatotic states, respectively. Induction of inflammatory signalling with IL-17A drastically affected hepatocytes, with 93% of +FA+IL17A hepatocytes residing in the steatotic state. Of note, inhibition of NF-κB signalling by TPCA-1 prevents the uniform metabolic response seen upon stimulation with IL-17A as 75.2% of hepatocytes remain in the intermediate state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>).</p>
      <p id="P17">LD levels exhibit a higher variation in the +FA+IL17A condition (coefficient of variation, CV=0.54) compared to the +FA and +FA+IL17A+TPCA1 conditions (CV=0.37 and 0.45, respectively) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Supp. Fig. 10A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">10C</xref>). Conversely, individual lipids showed a higher variability of their single-cell intensities (showing a bimodal distribution) in the +FA and +FA+IL17A+TPCA1 conditions compared to the +FA+IL17A condition (showing a unimodal distribution) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Supp. Fig. 10B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">10C</xref>). Together, these results indicate that inducing inflammatory signalling in differentiated human hepatocytes with IL-17A increases cell-cell heterogeneity of LD levels but reduces heterogeneity of individual neutral lipids.</p>
      <p id="P18">Pseudo-time analysis of single-cell metabolic profiles allowed us to characterize the progression of hepatocytes from the homeostatic to the steatotic state, (black line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). Metabolic state markers change gradually along pseudotime, indicating metabolic heterogeneity within every state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>). Most markers of the homeostatic state are phospholipids such as phosphatidylcholines, phosphatidylethanolamines and phosphatidylinositols covering housekeeping metabolic functions including membrane composition of ER and mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E</xref>). On the other hand, metabolic markers of the steatotic state are mostly neutral lipids such as triglycerides and diglycerides with a functional relevance in lipid storage, LD formation and lipid-mediated signalling.</p>
      <p id="P19">The metabolic-state-markers were further validated using LC-MS/MS-based lipidomics of hepatic tissues from normal diet (ND) and Western diet (WD) mice. This helped perform MS/MS structural analysis and compare to the bulk levels of the markers <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3F</xref>).

    <title>Discussion</title>
    <p id="P20">The topic of metabolic heterogeneity has attracted a wealth of attention<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>. Bottom-up efforts on metabolic characterization of cell types<sup><xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> and neighboring cells<sup><xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> as well as top-down efforts on creating metabolic atlases for major cell types<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> and finding metabolic subtypes in cancer cell lines<sup><xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> reinforce this interest. However, these efforts lack single-cell measurements to complement either bulk metabolomics or metabolic modeling. We aim to contribute to bridging this gap and democratize single-cell metabolomics by providing SpaceM, a method for single-cell metabolomics of cultured cells. For each cell, SpaceM delivers a metabolic profile as well as morphometric properties and fluorescence intensities, can analyse thousands of cells each sampled <italic>in situ,</italic> is applicable to a broad range of adherent cell types cultured according to commonly-used practices and avoids any cell perturbation prior to cell fixation.</p>
    <p id="P21">SpaceM complements other recently proposed single-cell metabolomics methods by delivering unique advantages in the context of analysis of cultured adherent cells. SpaceM offers higher throughput compared to cell microsampling followed by ultra-high-sensitive mass spectrometry<sup><xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup>. Compared to laser-capture microdissection coupled with mass spectrometry e.g. through the liquid vortex capture or open port interface<sup><xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup>, SpaceM focuses on the application to cultured cells (as compared to selected cells within a tissue section), offers a higher throughput, and delivers single-cell microscopy readouts.</p>
    <p id="P22">Using imaging mass spectrometry is emerging as a viable option for single-cell metabolomics <sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>–<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup>. Compared to one prominent example which uses a microarray for near-single-cell isolation <sup><xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup>, SpaceM allows cells to be analyzed in their native culturing environment thus avoiding any perturbation and delivering microscopy-based morphometric properties and cell-cell relationships. Compared to another prominent example, the MicroMS method using microscopy-guided cell ablation<sup><xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup>, SpaceM offers several advantages. First, SpaceM can use any modern MALDI-imaging source without the need for a custom laser control. This is achieved by registering pre- and post-MALDI microscopy images with a reproducible subcellular precision in a fully automated way (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Extended Data Fig. 2</xref>). Second, unlike MicroMS that requires cell dissociation, isolation, or reseeding to achieve sufficient spacing between cells<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup>, SpaceM can directly analyze cells cultured at a high confluency in their native growth context by avoiding perturbations prior to fixation which are known to otherwise cause stress responses, metabolome alterations, and cell damages. This provides a substantial advantage for various commonly-used cell types such as used in our study (e.g. HeLa). Third, estimation of ablated cellular parts with a subcellular precision allowed us to develop a novel signal processing pipeline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig 4</xref>) which provides a clear improvement of the co-cultured NIH3T3 and HeLa cell type classification, used here as a proxy for single-cell resolution (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Supp. Fig. 6B</xref>). We further proposed a model for validating single-cell metabolomics of cell cultures by predicting co-cultured cell types, following the validation principles established in single-cell RNA-sequencing<sup><xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup>. Addressing the current lack of established validation approaches, we hope this can benefit method development and validation in single-cell metabolomics.</p>
    <p id="P23">Unbiased MALDI-imaging analysis -- as used in SpaceM -- leads to the cases of co-sampling neighboring cells by the same ablation mark. Although our normalization and ablation mark filtering were already designed to minimize the propagation of this effect to the intensities of the co-sampled cells, we have systematically investigated possible negative effects of the co-sampling. We have found that, with our normalization and filtration, the co-sampling only minimally affects the accuracy of the cell type prediction in spatially-heterogeneous co-cultures thus also indirectly confirming no negative effect on the single-cell resolution (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Supp. Fig. 6</xref>). Further, we investigated the impact of the co-sampling on the metabolic states identified in hepatocytes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Supp. Fig. 11</xref>, data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref> were computed with a sampling specificity value of 40%). Although excluding co-sampling ablation marks heavily reduced the number of cells (21.009 cells, compared 29.738 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>), it led to the identification of the same metabolic states (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Supp. Fig. 11A</xref>). Moreover, it did not change the metabolic state markers although reducing their statistical significance, likely due the lower number of cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Supp. Fig. 11A</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">B</xref>). Finally, excluding co-sampling ablation marks did not affect the balance of the metabolic states within each hepatocyte culture condition (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Supp. Fig. 11C</xref>). Altogether, we conclude that the presented SpaceM processing approach delivers a substantial advantage over systematically excluding co-sampling ablation marks as it improves the single cell resolution while retaining more cells thus providing stronger statistical power.</p>
    <p id="P24">Single-cell metabolomics of NAFLD/NASH was long-demanded to answer open questions about the associated liver metabolic reprogramming, motivated by the rising incidence of NAFLD/NASH, lack of treatment<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> and high cell-cell heterogeneity of hepatic LDs<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>.

    <p id="P25">We used a differentiated human hepatocyte cell line, dHepaRG which, unlike 2D <italic>in vitro</italic> cultured primary hepatocytes, exhibit a stable gene expression pattern, and is broadly used for investigating hepatic lipid metabolism and drug development<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>. The considered conditions model the stages of NAFLD-NASH progression: from homeostasis (condition CTRL) towards NAFLD (condition +FA), and further towards NASH (condition +FA+IL17A)<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>.</p>
    <p id="P26">SpaceM helped characterize cell-cell metabolic heterogeneity of hepatocytes also within conditions. The clear separation of steatotic hepatocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>) from the rest of the population indicates a switch rather than a gradual change from the intermediate to the steatotic state. Previously, a steatotic subpopulation was associated with a protective function by accumulating LD-induced lipotoxicity that is advantageous for the whole population<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>.</p>
    <p id="P27">Although lipid droplets can greatly vary in composition<sup><xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref></sup>, this heterogeneity cannot be resolved by lipophilic stainings as LD540. We explored the heterogeneity of levels of some neutral lipids in stimulated hepatocytes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Supp. Fig. 10</xref>). The intensities of selected steatotic markers showed a bimodal distribution not observed for LD540. This suggests that hepatocytes can be divided into two distinct populations, with low and high levels of steatotic markers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Supp. Fig. 10A</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">B</xref>). The bimodality of intermediate cells indicates that the overall bimodality cannot be explained by the presence of two states alone (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Supp. Fig. 10B</xref>). This could either reflect a clustering artifact or biological heterogeneity of LD compositions for intermediate-state cells. Together, these results illustrate the importance of studying metabolism at single-cell resolution in combination with microscopy.</p>
    <p id="P28">In line with previous reports, a number of steatotic markers were reproduced in our <italic>in vivo</italic> mouse model of NASH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3F</xref>). All but one validated triglyceride marker of the steatotic state are composed of palmitic acid (16:0), palmitoleic acid (16:1), and oleic acids (18:1) which were reported to increase in the liver of patients with NAFLD/NASH<sup><xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref></sup>. The steatotic-state-markers TG(50:1) and TG(48:1) were reported among the three most associated lipids with the fatty liver index (FLI, in the Fenland and NSHD studies) and with fat accumulation upon NASH<sup><xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref></sup>. Together, this demonstrates the <italic>in vivo</italic> relevance of our single-cell metabolomics analysis of dHepaRG hepatocytes.</p>
    <p id="P29">SpaceM can differentiate cells within a state. The +FA steatotic cells (“benign” steatotic hepatocytes) and the +FA+IL17A steatotic cells (“inflammatory” steatotic hepatocytes) have little overlap in the PAGA plot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B–C</xref>) suggesting a difference in their metabolic profiles. Differential analysis revealed that ceramide phosphocholines (sphingomyelins) were highly enriched in the “inflammatory” steatotic hepatocytes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Supp. Fig. 12</xref>). This is consistent with studies reporting an increase in sphingolipids including ceramides and sphingomyelins upon NASH compared to “benign” NAFLD in both mice and humans<sup><xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>,<xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref></sup>. Although increased sphingolipids can be explained by the oxidative stress and systemic inflammation<sup><xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref></sup>, a mechanistic explanation is still lacking. Reproducing this effect in dHepaRG cells suggests the potential of <italic>in vitro</italic> single-cell metabolomics in deciphering the function of these bioactive lipids in NAFLD/NASH.</p>
    <p id="P30">Overall, the open source SpaceM method not only fills a large yet empty niche in the booming field of single-cell metabolomics but already helped characterizing metabolic heterogeneity and states of stimulated dHepaRG hepatocytes, with the results validated <italic>in vivo</italic> and in line with previous reports. The simple design, low requirements, and compatibility with cell biology practices will likely pave a way towards democratizing single-cell metabolomics of cell cultures.</p>

The estimated matrix density was 0.001383 mg/mm2. For MALDI imaging mass spectrometry, the glass slides with the dried cells on them were mounted onto a custom slide adaptor and loaded into the AP-SMALDI source (Transmit, Giessen, Germany). The MALDI laser focus was optimized manually using the source cameras with the focused beam diameter estimated to be between 15.0 and 43.0 μm (mean equal to 29.9 μm, standard deviation equal to 8 μm). The x-y step size (distance between the centers of ablation marks) was set to 50 μM. For each pixel, the spectrum was accumulated from 30 laser shots at 60 Hz. Both the positive and negative mode MS analysis were performed using an QExactive Plus mass spectrometer (ThermoFisher Scientific) in the full scan mode in the mass range of 200-1100 m/z (resolving power R=140000 at m/z 200). MS parameters in the Tune software (version 2.5 Build 2042, ThermoFisher Scientific) were set to the spray voltage of 4.10 kV, S-Lens 80 eV, capillary temperature 250 C. The data was converted from the RAW format into the imzML format containing only centroided data using the ImageQuest software, v.1.1.0 (ThermoFisher Scientific).

      <title>Post-MALDI microscopy to detect MALDI ablation marks</title>
      <p id="P41">The cells were imaged in bright-field microscopy after MALDI-imaging using the same microscopy setup and parameters as described earlier in the pre-MALDI microscopy section to define the positions of the ablation marks with respect to the fiducial marks.</p>

    <sec id="S22">
      <title>Association of laser ablation marks with single cells</title>
      <p id="P42">This step is the key part of the method as it solves the challenge that single cells are not visible in the post-MALDI microscopy images due to the opaque layer of MALDI matrix covering cells. Here, ablation marks left by the MALDI laser were associated with single cells in three steps: a) cells segmentation in the pre-MALDI microscopy images, b) detection of laser ablation marks in post-MALDI microscopy images, c) matching between ablation marks and MALDI mass spectra and d) co-registration of pre- and post-MALDI microscopy images to overlay the ablation marks with the segmented single cells.</p>
      <p id="P43">In step a), cells were segmented using a custom pipeline in the CellProfiler software <sup><xref rid="R54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref></sup> where the DAPI staining channel was used to generate seeds for a region growing algorithm detecting cells boundaries in the LD540-staining channel. In step b), we first denoised the bright-field microscopy images by applying a low-pass filter in the 2D Fourier frequency domain, in particular to exploit both the regular distances between ablation marks as well as the repeated shape of the ablation mark itself. Then, we applied a contrast-enhancing filter (using the <italic>clip</italic> function from the Python module <italic>numpy</italic>) and Otsu’s thresholding method to binarize the image. Then, we applied morphological image analysis operations of closing and then opening to fill in the holes in the image and to remove individual noisy pixels. This provided estimations of the centers of mass of each ablation mark (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Extended Data Fig 1</xref>). In step c), we fit a theoretical rectangular grid to the ablation marks. The numbers of X- and Y-grid steps were defined as set up during the MALDI acquisition. The center of the acquisition region was considered as the center of the grid. The orientation of the grid with respect to the post-MALDI microscopy image was optimized by finding an angle which resulted in the best overlap between the grid lines and the detected ablation marks. The X- and Y-spacing of the grid were optimized by minimizing the distance between the grid nodes and the center of mass of the nearest neighbor ablation mark. Then, only ablation marks which were the nearest neighbors to the grid nodes were taken and re-indexed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Fig 3</xref>). This provided X- and Y-coordinates for each ablation mark associated with a collected MALDI spectrum. In order to improve estimations of the ablations marks areas used later for normalization, their segmentation was further improved by applying a custom region-growing algorithm implemented in Python. In step d), co-registration of pre- and post-MALDI microscopy images was done based on the pen marks drawn on the edge of the wells used as fiducials. We first segmented the pen marks in both pre- and post-MALDI bright-field microscopy images using Otsu’s intensity thresholding method. Then, we used the basin-hopping optimization algorithm (Python implementation from the <italic>scipy</italic> package v0.18.1) to find the best linear transformation matching the coordinates of the edges of the pen marks between the pre- and post-MALDI images (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Extended Data Fig 2</xref>). The optimal linear transformation was applied to the post-MALDI microscopy images to map the ablation marks to the pre-MALDI microscopy images.</p>

      <title>SpaceM processing</title>
      <p id="P44">A normalized intensity of each metabolite in a single cell was constructed as follows. For each cell, we only considered the ablation marks which were overlapping with cells by at least 45% of their ablation area. This overlap is called sampling area. Additionally, the ablation marks that share less than 90% of their sampling area with the cell of interest are discarded. The metabolite intensities coming from an ablation mark were normalized by dividing them by the ratio of the sampling area to the area of the ablation mark. Finally, for each cell its normalized metabolite intensities were calculated as the weighted average normalized intensities of the associated ablation marks where the weights are defined as the ratio of the shared pixels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig 4</xref>).</p>

    <sec id="S24">
      <title>Selecting intracellular metabolites</title>
      <p id="P45">We selected metabolite annotations corresponding to intracellular metabolites as follows. First, for each ablation mark we assigned to it the inside-cells label having values either of zero or one based on whether the mark has any overlap with any cell. Then, for each metabolite ion image, its intensities were binarized to zero-one values by selecting a threshold leading to the highest Spearman correlation with the inside-cells labels. The threshold value was found using the basin-hopping optimization algorithm. In order to consider only intracellular metabolites for further analysis, we selected those metabolite annotations whose binarized ion images were correlated with the inside-cells labels with the spearman correlation higher than 0.25. For the co-culture study we considered the metabolite annotations which were detected by METASPACE in at least 2 samples (out of 6 overall: 2 replicates of co-culture, 2 mono-cultures of NIH3T3 cells and 2 mono-cultures of HeLa cells) that led to 88 annotations. For each metabolite annotation, we pulled the ion images with the m/z tolerance of 3ppm from the imzML files.</p>

      <title>Classification of ion images of METASPACE annotations into on- and off-sample classes</title>
      <p id="P46">In the study of hepatocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>), we employed an advanced strategy to filter out background ions which might correspond either to matrix or contamination. First, we considered all ions annotated by METASPACE with 50% FDR. Then, two experts in MALDI-imaging performed manual tagging of these annotations (on-sample or off-sample) by loading every annotation in METASPACE and browsing the first 20 annotations from public METASPACE datasets. Based on the annotation ion images, the decision was made for each annotation whether it is more likely to be on- or off-sample. These taggings were then corrected using machine learning trained on the hepatocytes data following a molecular co-localization method we recently developed<sup><xref rid="R55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref></sup>. For every MALDI-imaging dataset, we have performed the following machine learning-based procedure to classify all its METASPACE annotations into on- and off-sample classes. First, for the ion image of each annotation we calculated its cosine co-localization with images of other annotations. As a result, every annotation was represented in a Euclidean space of the dimensions equal to the number of all considered annotations in this dataset. In this space, we have performed Support Vector Machine classification of on- and off-sample annotations by using the tags provided by experts as labels (using Python package <italic>scikit-learn</italic> 0.22.1). Overall 740 ions were classified as on-sample and were annotated by METASPACE.</p>

      <title>The SpaceM workflow and validation.</title>
      <p>SpaceM integrates light microscopy and MALDI-imaging mass spectrometry to provide a metabolic profile obtained <italic>in situ</italic> for each cell. Segmented microscopy images help delineate cells and quantify their morphometric properties, spatial organization, and fluorescence. The cells are further subjected to MALDI-imaging mass spectrometry and metabolite annotation which reveals their metabolomes, followed by normalization. <bold>B</bold>: SpaceM provides a single-cell spatio-molecular matrix that integrates the metabolic profiles and other information obtained using microscopy. <bold>C</bold>: We validated SpaceM by predicting cell types of co-cultured human HeLa epithelial cells (H1B-mCherry, magenta) and mouse NIH3T3 fibroblasts (GFP, cyan). Representative image from 2 independent experiments. <bold>D</bold>: UMAP visualization of 846 co-cultured cells (HeLa, magenta; NIH3T3, cyan) using intensities of 88 metabolites. Unsupervised Leiden clustering applied to the metabolic profiles classified both cell types with an accuracy of 91.3% (see also <bold>Figure S7</bold>). <bold>E</bold>: Volcano plot (log2 of the fold change HeLa/NIH3T3 vs. -log10 of the two-tailed independent <italic>t</italic>-test <italic>p</italic>-value) showing differential properties of the 88 detected metabolites.</p>

      <title>SpaceM identifies a steatotic subpopulation in lipid stimulated human hepatocytes.</title>
      <p><bold>A</bold>: Microscopy images of the human dHepaRG hepatocytes stimulated with oleic and palmitic fatty acids illustrating their heterogeneity in lipid droplets accumulation; red: LD540 staining for lipid droplets; blue: Hoechst staining for cell nuclei. Representative image from 4 independent experiments. <bold>B</bold>: UMAP visualization of single-cell metabolic profiles (740 metabolites) of 2,840 single cells revealed two co-existing subpopulations with statistically different lipid droplet levels (see also <bold>Figure S9</bold>). <bold>C</bold>: UMAP plots showing single-cell intensities of metabolites most associated with the lipid droplet accumulation: triglyceride TG(48:0), Spearman correlation r=0.38 (two-tailed test <italic>p</italic>-value=2.04e-100, ***), and an ion corresponding either to lysophosphatidylethanolamine LPE(21:1) or isomeric lysophosphatidylcholine LPC(18:1), negative Spearman r=−0.23 (two-tailed test <italic>p</italic>-value=1.09e-34, ***). <bold>D</bold>: Correlation values between LD540 and lipid intensities across 2,840 single-cells, grouped by the lipid class. Tri-(TG) and di-glycerides (DG) are the most correlated which is in line with their reported function to compose the hepatic LDs core. Tukey box plots for each lipid class: center line: median; box limits: upper and lower quartiles; whiskers: 1.5x interquartile range. <bold>E</bold>: Enriched lipid ontology terms (LO) for lipids with an LD540-correlation &gt;0.1 and &lt;−0.1. Enriched LO terms from lipids with a high correlation with LD540 show enrichment of the neutral lipid metabolism, TGs, DGs, and lipid droplet biology, which is expected and therefore serves as a supportive argument for the capacity of SpaceM to detect and quantify biologically relevant molecules.</p>

      <title>SpaceM discovers and characterizes metabolic states of stimulated hepatocytes, cross-validated by preclinical NASH models.</title>
      <p><bold>A</bold>: Microscopy images of the human dHepaRG hepatocytes (CTRL), also stimulated with: fatty acids (+FA), further with IL-17A (+FA+IL17A), and further with an NF-kB inhibitor TPCA1 (+FA+IL17A+TPCA1); red: LD540 staining for lipid droplets; blue: Hoechst for nuclei; white: cells outlines. Representative images from 4 independent experiments per culture condition. <bold>B</bold>: PAGA visualization and unsupervised Leiden clustering of single-cell metabolic profiles (740 metabolites) reveal homeostatic, intermediate, and steatotic metabolic states of 29,738 hepatocytes. LD540 levels per metabolic states (homeostatic vs steatotic, two-tailed independent <italic>t</italic>-test <italic>p</italic>-value=0, ***; intermediate vs steatotic, two-tailed independent <italic>t</italic>-test <italic>p</italic>-value=1.4e-299, ***). Tukey box plots with center line: median; box limits: upper and lower quartiles; whiskers: 1.5x interquartile range. Black line shows a pseudotime trajectory from the homeostatic to steatotic states. <bold>C:</bold> Each condition separately, with cell values of LD540 in red, highlighting the gradient of the lipid droplet accumulation from the homeostatic to steatotic state. Pie charts show the proportions of the metabolic states in each condition. <bold>D</bold>: Normalized intensities of metabolic-state markers (t-statistic &gt;60) for all cells along the pseudotime. <bold>E</bold>: Heatmap for the metabolic-state markers from <bold>C</bold>. Red star indicates validation by LC-MS/MS in the considered mouse model. For each state, the enriched lipid ontology (LO) terms are displayed. <bold>F</bold>: Semi-quantitative validation of selected metabolic markers of the homeostatic and steatotic states in an <italic>in vivo</italic> NASH mouse model with the normal diet (ND) vs Western diet (WD). For HepaRG, intensities of 2,500 randomly-selected cells are shown for each state. For the mouse model, average LC-MS intensity (n=3 replicates) per diet group is shown. Molecular names, left: putative MS1 annotations; right: structurally-validated by LC-MS/MS. ***denotes p-value&lt;0.001.</p>
