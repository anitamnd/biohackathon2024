      <p>Exon capture across species has been one of the most broadly applied approaches
to acquire multi-locus data in phylogenomic studies of non-model organisms.
Methods for assembling loci from short-read sequences (eg, Illumina platforms)
that rely on mapping reads to a reference genome may not be suitable for studies
comprising species across a wide phylogenetic spectrum; thus, de novo assembling
methods are more generally applied. Current approaches for assembling targeted
exons from short reads are not particularly optimized as they cannot (1)
assemble loci with low read depth, (2) handle large files efficiently, and (3)
reliably address issues with paralogs. Thus, we present Assexon: a streamlined
pipeline that de novo assembles targeted exons and their flanking sequences from
raw reads. We tested our method using reads from <italic>Lepisosteus
osseus</italic> (4.37 Gb) and <italic>Boleophthalmus pectinirostris</italic>
(2.43 Gb), which are captured using baits that were designed based on genome
sequence of <italic>Lepisosteus oculatus</italic> and <italic>Oreochromis
niloticus</italic>, respectively. We compared performance of Assexon to
PHYLUCE and HybPiper, which are commonly used pipelines to assemble
ultra-conserved element (UCE) and Hyb-seq data. A custom exon capture analysis
pipeline (CP) developed by Yuan et al was compared as well. Assexon accurately
assembled more than 3400 to 3800 (20%-28%) loci than PHYLUCE and more than 1900
to 2300 (8%-14%) loci than HybPiper across different levels of phylogenetic
divergence. Assexon ran at least twice as fast as PHYLUCE and HybPiper. Number
of loci assembled using CP was comparable with Assexon in both tests, while
Assexon ran at least 7 times faster than CP. In addition, some steps of CP
require the user’s interaction and are not fully automated, and this user time
was not counted in our calculation. Both Assexon and CP retrieved no paralogs in
the testing runs, but PHYLUCE and Hybpiper did. In conclusion, Assexon is a tool
for accurate and efficient assembling of large read sets from exon capture
experiments. Furthermore, Assexon includes scripts to filter poorly aligned
coding regions and flanking regions, calculate summary statistics of loci, and
select loci with reliable phylogenetic signal. Assexon is available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/yhadevol/Assexon">https://github.com/yhadevol/Assexon</ext-link>.</p>

    <title>Introduction</title>
    <p>Both empirical and theoretical studies show that intensely sampled unlinked loci can
improve the estimation genetic parameters of populations<sup><xref rid="bibr1-1176934319874792" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="bibr2-1176934319874792" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> and resolve conflicts in
phylogenetic inference.<sup><xref rid="bibr3-1176934319874792" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="bibr4-1176934319874792" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>
Whole genome sequencing can be used for phylogenomic analyses,<sup><xref rid="bibr5-1176934319874792" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> but it is still unaffordable at large scale. Combining next-generation
sequencing (NGS) and target enrichment is one of the efficient ways to collect
plentiful loci across various taxonomic divergence.<sup><xref rid="bibr6-1176934319874792" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="bibr7-1176934319874792" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr8-1176934319874792" ref-type="bibr"/>-<xref rid="bibr9-1176934319874792" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> Studies have been focused on
collecting conserved sequences that can be reliably captured across divergent taxa
for phylogenomic analysis, including ultra-conserved elements (UCEs), anchored
elements,<sup><xref rid="bibr7-1176934319874792" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="bibr10-1176934319874792" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="bibr11-1176934319874792" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> conserved coding, and non-coding regions.<sup><xref rid="bibr12-1176934319874792" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="bibr13-1176934319874792" ref-type="bibr"/>-<xref rid="bibr14-1176934319874792" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> The targeted sequences are
enriched by hybridizing RNA oligonucleotide probes (aka “baits” designed from
transcriptomes or existing genomes) to homologous regions of the targeted taxa,
which are subsequently isolated and pooled for sequencing. Exons are among the most
well-studied and modeled parts of the genome and are generally more conserved than
introns, resulting in consistent capture across divergent taxa, and thus they have
been one of the promising markers for phylogenomic studies through target
enrichment.<sup><xref rid="bibr8-1176934319874792" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="bibr9-1176934319874792" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="bibr15-1176934319874792" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> However, to
date, approaches for de novo assembly of exons from short-read raw sequence data
have not be optimized.</p>
    <p>Streamlined pipelines have been developed for UCEs and Hyb-seq data, represented by PHYLUCE<sup><xref rid="bibr16-1176934319874792" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> and HybPiper,<sup><xref rid="bibr17-1176934319874792" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> respectively. PHYLUCE directly inputs the entire set of short reads into
assembler to assemble them into contigs. Then, contigs are parsed to homologous
loci. When dealing with large numbers of loci (&gt;10 000), computer memory becomes
a major limiting factor for simultaneous de novo assembly of raw reads pooled across
loci. HybPiper is able to extract exonic and intronic regions from Hyb-seq data from
raw sequence reads, but its assembler (multi-cell mode of SPAdes)<sup><xref rid="bibr18-1176934319874792" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> cannot assemble loci with low read depth (&lt;10×). Nonetheless, read depth
for short loci or for data from capturing divergent taxa tends to be low, which may
cause problems in read assembly using HybPiper.</p>
    <p>Another major problem in assembling loci for phylogenomic analysis is the challenge
of identifying and excluding paralogous loci after assembly. Including undetected
paralogs often leads to discordance between gene trees and species trees.<sup><xref rid="bibr19-1176934319874792" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> Targeting putatively single-copy loci can help to reduce the incidence of
enriching paralogs.<sup><xref rid="bibr20-1176934319874792" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> However, additional checks are still necessary to preclude mistakes in the
assemblies. Current pipelines either simply ignore verification of
orthologs<sup><xref rid="bibr21-1176934319874792" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="bibr22-1176934319874792" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> or do not use information from reference genomes to check on
paralogs. For example, in PHYLUCE, each reference sequence of the target loci is
compared to the assembled contigs. An assembled contig is accepted as orthologous if
it is the only hit for a given locus of reference sequence, and also no other target
locus has a hit on the same contig. This could be problematic because more than one
contig has a hit on the reference sequence of the target when non paralog exists.
For example, loci sometimes cannot be fully assembled, which could result in
multiple contigs. Thus, we would lose some orthologous loci if we discard them all.
Moreover, the orthologous copy of the locus may be lost or not enriched in the
experiment, so we may mistakenly accept a paralog as the orthologous sequence. An
alternative approach would be to compare the assembled contig to the whole genome
that the baits were designed from, or a genome of species that is closely related to
the target taxa, as a reference to evaluate all potential matches and determine if
it is the orthologous copy of the target locus.</p>
    <p>Flanking sequences often are captured through hitchhiking in addition to targeted
exon regions. Flanking sequences are available in the results from most read
assembling pipelines for exon capture data, but they were seldom incorporated into
phylogenetic analysis (but see Yuan et al<sup><xref rid="bibr23-1176934319874792" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> and Bi et al<sup><xref rid="bibr24-1176934319874792" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>), because some flanking regions are too variable to be aligned. Nonetheless,
discarding all flanking sequences may miss useful data for investigating population
histories or phylogenetic relationships between recently diverged taxa. Filtering
flanking sequences of exonic regions for useful data should be incorporated in the
pipelines for read assembling designed for exon capture data.</p>
    <p>Undetected paralogs, mis-assemblies, or missing data may result in poorly aligned
regions of sequence alignments. These regions could mislead phylogenetic inferences,
so data filtering should be a crucial final step in read assembly. In commonly used
pipelines, this step is either absent (eg, HybPiper) or sequences are filtered based
on simple statistics such as p-dist is applied (eg, PHYLUCE). More sophisticate
filtering methods could be developed for controlling the quality of alignments, such
as removing loci that are randomly aligned.<sup><xref rid="bibr25-1176934319874792" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="bibr26-1176934319874792" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> Filtering loci based on
whether their gene tree agrees with widely accepted phylogenetic relationship (eg,
known monophyletic groups) or other criteria (eg, fit a molecular clock)<sup><xref rid="bibr27-1176934319874792" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> may also be helpful.</p>
    <p>In order to address problems mentioned above, we designed Assexon (assembling exons),
a streamlined pipeline to turn short reads from exon capture experiments into
sequence alignments ready for phylogenomic analyses. Assexon has 3 phases: data
preparation, read assembly, and post-assembly processing. In data preparation steps,
reads are deduplicated and parsed to target loci according to their similarity to
the reference loci. Parsing reads before de novo assembling can increase efficiency
of assembling sequences from large read files. In post-assembly processing steps,
recovered sequences are compared against a reference genome to reduce the risk of
retrieving paralogs. Assexon includes scripts to remove poorly aligned flanking
sequences and use alignable data in the flanking regions. Assexon also comprises
filters to select loci with reliable phylogenetic signal. We evaluated performance
of Assexon by comparing it to commonly used pipelines. Assexon is aimed to assemble
data produced from cross-species exon capture; thus, mapping-based targeted
assembling pipelines, such as Mapsembler<sup><xref rid="bibr28-1176934319874792" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> and TASR,<sup><xref rid="bibr29-1176934319874792" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> are not included in the comparison. We selected 3 targeted read assembling
pipelines specifically designed for cross-species exon capture data, including
PHYLUCE, HybPiper, as well as a custom exon capture analysis pipeline from Yuan et al,<sup><xref rid="bibr23-1176934319874792" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> abbreviated as “CP” hereafter.</p>

  <sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="section2-1176934319874792">

    <p>Assexon is a suite of scripts written in Perl and wrapping around several
bioinformatics tools. Assexon consists of 3 parts: data preparation, read assembly,
and post-assembly processing. Read assembly was scripted in modules, so to allow
users to rerun portions of the pipeline.</p>
    <p>The input of Assexon includes paired-end reads in FASTQ format, a reference genome,
and exon marker sequences that are extracted from reference genome and used to
design baits in FASTA format. The genome sequences are used for identifying
paralogs. If sequences of multiple genomes from various species are used to design
markers, all genome sequences are required to be concatenated into a single file.
The marker sequences are used as a reference during assembly. If coding frames of
reference are not determined, known protein sequences of reference species and an
index file are required for prediction of coding frames. Known protein sequences of
reference species could be generally downloaded from public database like Ensembl.<sup><xref rid="bibr30-1176934319874792" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> Index file is generated from Evolmarkers.<sup><xref rid="bibr31-1176934319874792" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> It comprises the name of each reference sequence and corresponding known
protein sequence ID of each reference sequence, which can help to find protein
sequences of each reference sequence from file of known protein sequences. On the
contrary, known protein sequences and index file are not required to be provided if
coding frames can be determined by alternative approaches, such as using
transcriptome data to find the coding frames.</p>
    <sec id="section3-1176934319874792">
      <title>Data preparation</title>
      <p>The pipeline starts with trimming low-quality bases and sequence adaptors using
trim_galore v0.4.1 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/trim_galore/">http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/trim_galore/</ext-link>).
Coding frame of each marker sequence is predicted and corrected using a Perl
script (predict_frames.pl). It first checks the translated reference sequences
of the 3 frames for stop codons and eliminating any frames that contain
inappropriately placed stop codons. Known protein sequences of reference are
retrieved from file of known protein sequences and aligned with translated
protein sequences to find the correct frame. Finally, coding sequences are
extracted and translated into amino acid sequences using Bio::Seq module in Bioperl.<sup><xref rid="bibr32-1176934319874792" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup></p>

        <p>Duplicate reads are generated during the steps of polymerase chain reaction
(PCR) in library construction and exon capture. They are redundant and may
lower the efficiency of reads parsing and assembly, so it is necessary to
remove PCR duplication first. Size of input reads from exon capture could be
large, so de-duplicating entire dataset at once may be computationally
demanding. First, paired reads are concatenated into super-reads and then
the first “<italic>k</italic>” bases of the super-reads are taken as prefix.

significantly reduce the complexity and improve the efficiency of assembly.
To avoid including low-complexity reads from non-targeted region into the
assembling process, low-complexity sequences in de-duplicated reads and in

are done using DUST and Segmasker<sup><xref rid="bibr34-1176934319874792" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="bibr35-1176934319874792" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup> implemented in USEARCH

However, read depth
tends to be low for short loci or when targeted loci of samples are
divergent from baits in exon capture, so it is hard to choose a correct edge
depending only on read depth. A conservative assembler is required, which
does not arbitrarily choose the edge according to read depth, but aligns
resulting contigs to references and selects the edge that has higher
alignment score to reference. SGA<sup><xref rid="bibr39-1176934319874792" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup> was chosen to assemble reads of each locus into contigs, which is a
conservative but accurate assembler. It disallows any conflicting edges that
connect to the same node in the string graph if divergence between edges is
more than 5%. Graph is separated from the nodes that connect with multiple
edges. Overlapping information between contigs are available from the output
of SGA, which are used to reconstruct overlapping graph and help to reduce
conflicting edges in next step. Minimum overlap and maximum error rate
(denoted as <italic>e</italic>) allowed between contigs are 25 bp and 0.05,
respectively. The “filter” command in SGA extracts <italic>k</italic>-mers
(<italic>k</italic> = 27 in default) from reads and then removes reads
with low <italic>k</italic>-mer frequencies (&lt;3) before assembly, which
could induce erroneous edges. We disable this function for the loci whose
file size of input reads are below 500 Kb, to avoid loss of these loci due
to low read depth.</p>

        <title>Further assembly and extract candidate exons</title>
        <p>Multiple edges could be left in the string graph of the preliminary assembly.
We need to reduce the conflicting edges and extract candidate exons in this
step. Contigs are locally aligned to protein sequences of references using
the “protein2dna” model in the package under Exonerate<sup><xref rid="bibr40-1176934319874792" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup> to get their positions to the reference and alignment score, which
are used to determine the short overlap between contigs (shorter than 25 bp
but longer than 10 bp) and reduce conflicting edges. Two contigs are
regarded as having overlaps if their positions to reference are crossed.
However, some of the contigs could be accidentally aligned in a crossed
position, but they are not truly overlapped. It could be too slow to find
exact overlap for each pair of contigs in the following step, if too many
pairs of contigs that are not truly overlapped are included. To primary
screen out false overlaps, <italic>k</italic>-mers are extracted from
overlapped region of contigs, and the number of matched
<italic>k</italic>-mer is compared with minimum possible number of matched
<italic>k</italic>-mer between overlaps with given length. We do not
know the length of the exact overlap, so we define an “ambiguous overlap,”
which is close to the exact one. Ambiguous overlap consisted of crossed
region, unaligned bases at the end of the first contig, and unaligned bases
at the start of next contig. Substitutions, indels, or sequencing error may
occur at the both ends of contigs, so these bases cannot be aligned to
reference. We add them into ambiguous overlap because these bases may exist
in the true overlap. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1176934319874792">Figure
2</xref> shows the diagram of ambiguous overlap between contigs. We
consider that contigs probably have true overlap if ambiguous overlaps are
longer than 5 bp. Then, <italic>k</italic>-mers (<italic>k</italic> = 5) are
extracted from ambiguous overlaps of the contigs. If we denote length of
ambiguous overlap and maximum error rate allowed between overlapped
sequences as <italic>l</italic> and <italic>e</italic>, respectively,

paths are reduced by selecting paths with the highest alignment score to
reference. Only conflicted edges in coding regions can be reduced, because
they are covered by references, however, conflicted edges in flanking
regions still remain. We traverse through the graphs and retrieve all
possible paths that are aligned to protein sequences of references with
“protein2dna” model. We select sequences that are aligned with more than 80%
of reference sequences and have at least 60% of similarity to references.
Finally, we only retrieve one of the selected sequences with top alignment
score as candidate. Part of sequences embedded in the alignment boundaries
are retrieved as exons and rest of them are treated as flanking
sequences.</p>

levels of completeness. If genome sequences of taxa outside of targeted
samples are available, get_orthologues.pl can be used to retrieve
orthologous sequences to the reference loci, so extracted sequence can be
added into files of enriched loci using merge_loci.pl. After preparing the
datasets, each targeted locus is aligned using MAFFT, which is paralleled
using mafft_aln.pl. Coding sequences are translated and then aligned based
on protein sequences. Flanking sequences are non-coding, so sequences with

        <title>Data filtering</title>
        <p>Poor alignments could interfere phylogenetic inference, so we designed
filter.pl to remove badly aligned sequences in coding regions. Sequences
having long insertion or deletions (⩾10 bp) with respect to reference are
removed, which rarely occur in coding regions. A 50 bp sliding window with
25 bp per step is applied to scan alignment subsequently. Sequence is
discarded if at least one of the sequences across windows is distant from
the reference (p-dist ⩾ 0.4). Notably, entire sequences are removed instead
of partial sequences in the sliding to keep the intactness of coding region.
Finally, only alignments having length of at least 100 bp, and sequences
that cover more than 80% of alignments length are retained.</p>
        <p>Poorly aligned flanking sequences are removed using flank_filter.pl. Flanks
need to be trimmed to similar length, so that there is not much missing data
at both ends. Flanks are trimmed from each ends until at least 5 successive
columns having more than 50% of nucleotides are found. Sequences having
short insertions (⩾10 bp) are removed from flanks, which could lead to
non-homologous alignment and lots of gaps in flanks. After cleaning up
regions with lots of missing data, unalignable data in flanks must be
removed. Similar long sequences could be inserted in some of the intronic
flanks of closely related samples.<sup><xref rid="bibr41-1176934319874792" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup> Because the length of enriched flanking region is limited in the exon
capture experiments, it is likely that only partial insertions could be
enriched in flanks. These insertions are too diverged to be aligned with
other flanking sequences without the insertion, so one must keep either the
group of sequences with insertions or without insertions. Pair of distant
flanks is selected if p-dist between them exceeds 0.4. Then, average p-dist
of 2 flanks to the rest of the taxa are computed. The flank sequences that
are more distant to the rest of the taxa are removed. We iterate this
process until there are no pairs of distant sequences in flanking regions.
Comparing with the coding region, there are more sequences that are locally
diverged from other sequences in flanking region. To aggressively remove
those sequences, a stricter window (20 bp, 10 bp per step) is used to slide
through the flanks. Sequences are trimmed from the window that is the nearer
to the coding region to the ends, if at least one sequence across window are
too diverged from alignment consensus (p-dist ⩾ 0.4). Finally, only flanking
blocks having at least 65% of input taxa and sequences covering at least 65%
of the length of flanking alignments are possessed.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, scripts to screen out loci based on pre-defined monophyletic
groups are provided in Assexon, which could be very helpful when users have
knowledge about studied groups (monophyly_test.pl). It is too rigorous to
merely pick out loci whose topologies of gene trees strictly follow the
given monophyletic groups due to stochastic process of genealogy. Thus, we
build a maximum likelihood (ML) tree constrained with pre-defined groups for
each locus and a ML tree with no constraint. Then, Shimodaira and Hasegawa
(default) or Approximately Unbiased test implemented in PAUP* 4.0a164<sup><xref rid="bibr42-1176934319874792" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup> is applied to each locus, and we only select loci if there is no
significant difference between their relaxed ML and constrained ML tree
(<italic>P</italic> &gt; .05). Clocklike loci can be selected using
clocklikeness_test.pl, which computes the likelihoods of ML tree with given
alignment of each locus when they are constrained with molecular clock or
without using PAUP* 4.0a164. Loci are retained if there is no remarkable
difference between likelihoods with and without molecular clock constraint

      <title>Assess the performance of Assexon and other pipelines</title>
      <p>PHYLUCE, HybPiper, and a custom pipeline (CP) developed by Yuan et al were
selected. They are commonly used pipelines to assemble cross-species gene
capture data. PHYLUCE was specifically designed to assemble data captured by
baits that are designed based on UCEs. In PHYLUCE, first entire read set are
assembled into contigs and then contigs are aligned with reference sequences to
find the orthologous sequences of each locus. A contig is accepted as
orthologous if it is the only hit for the given reference sequence. HybPiper was
developed for Hyb-seq data, which is mostly captured by baits that are designed
based on exon markers. In HybPiper, first paired reads are parsed to homologous
loci, then reads of each locus is separately assembled. Assembled contigs are
aligned with reference sequences, and Hybpiper identifies the full-length
contigs that span more than 85% of the length of the reference sequences. A
contig is recognized as orthologous if it is the only full-length contig with
given reference sequence. If multiple full-length contigs are found, a read
depth cut-off is used to choose contig. A contig is chosen if its read depth is
at least 10 times greater than next best full-length contig. If read depths are
close among full-length contigs, the contig with the highest similarity to
reference sequences is chosen. CP was designed to assemble exon capture data.
Similar to Assexon, CP first removes PCR duplication from raw reads and then
reads are parsed to homologous loci. Each locus is individually assembled using
the Trinity assembler<sup><xref rid="bibr52-1176934319874792" ref-type="bibr">52</xref></sup> and then further assembled using Geneious v7.1.5 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.geneious.com">https://www.geneious.com</ext-link>). An assembly process normally includes
multiple samples and each sample could comprise thousands of loci that need to
be assembled, while only 2000 to 3000 loci can be assembled using Geneious
v7.1.5 in a single run. Thus, users need to manually run Geneious v7.1.5
multiple times to further assemble all sequences. Method to extract exon and
identify orthologous sequences in CP is almost the same as Assexon, except that
CP uses Smith-Waterman algorithms to find the contig with the highest alignment
score to reference. Performance of PHYLUCE, HybPiper, and CP to recover
assemblies from exon capture data will be assessed and compared with the
performance of Assexon.</p>
      <p>Reads from 2 exon-capture experiments were collected to test the performance of
Assexon and other pipelines. In experiment 1 (test 1), the species used to
design baits (<italic>Lepisosteus oculatus</italic>) and the targeted species
(<italic>Lepisosteus osseus</italic>) belonged to the same genus. In the
other experiment (test 2), species used to design baits and targeted species,
<italic>Oreochromis niloticus</italic> and <italic>Boleophthalmus
pectinirostris</italic>, were from different orders of teleost fishes.
Detailed information of the datasets is listed in <xref rid="table1-1176934319874792" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. The trimmed data without
adapters and low quality bases are lodged in GenBank with accession number
PRJNA562564. Single-copy exon markers were extracted from annotated genomes of
<italic>L oculatus, Danio rerio, Oryzias latipes, Gasterosteus aculeatus,
Tetraodon nigroviridis, Anguilla japonica, Gadus macrocephalus</italic>, and
<italic>O niloticus</italic> using Evolmarkers.<sup><xref rid="bibr31-1176934319874792" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> Baits, in 120-bp length, were designed based on 13 843 and 17 817
sequences of <italic>L oculatus</italic> and <italic>O niloticus</italic> with
2× tiling according to the recommendation of manufacturer (MYcroarray, Ann

      <p>Genomic DNA were sheared to 250 bp using Covaris (Covaris, Woburn, USA). Sheared
DNA (350-500 ng) was used to construct libraries. Exon capture was performed
following Li et al.<sup><xref rid="bibr12-1176934319874792" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> Custom adaptors with 8 index were used to discriminate reads of different
samples. These 2 samples were pooled with other 98 samples from other projects
in equimolar quantities for pair-ended sequencing on a Hiseq 2500 platform
(Illumina, Inc, San Diego, CA, USA).</p>
      <p>Raw reads were de-multiplexed to separated files based on 8 indices using
BclToFastq (Illumina, Inc, San Diego, CA, USA). Remaining adaptors and
low-quality bases were trimmed using trim_galore v0.4.1 with default parameter.
Then, trimmed reads, sequences of reference and genome were fed into Assexon,
PHYLUCE, HybPiper, and CP. Reads were assembled with default parameters in
different tools, except that E-value for read sorting in HybPiper was set to
1 × 10<sup>−4</sup> to keep the same setting as in Assexon and CP. Because
CP was single threaded, it was run in single thread on a Linux cluster. Assexon,
PHYLUCE, and HybPiper were executed in 12 threads on a Linux cluster.</p>
      <p>Completeness and accuracy of assemblies in coding region was evaluated by
comparing them to reference sequences and available genome sequences of species
that are most closely related to targeted samples. Because reference sequences
and assemblies in coding regions are generally in similar length, comparison
between reference sequences and assemblies helps to evaluate the completeness of
assemblies in coding region. Because species of genome sequences are the same
species as targeted samples (in test 2) or very closely related to targeted
samples (in test 1), its exonic sequences are almost the same as the ones in
targeted samples. Thus, those genome sequences help to evaluate the accuracy of
assemblies in coding region. Four metrics were extracted from comparison:
similarity between assembled contig and reference (SAR), similarity between
assembled contig and genome (SAG), coverage of assemblies to reference (CAR),
and coverage of assemblies to genome (CAG). These metrics were used to divide
assemblies into 3 classes: recovered, accurately assembled, and perfectly
assembled. Recovered loci were defined as assemblies having at least 60% of SAR
and 80% of PRA. A subset of recovered loci were considered as accurately
assembled, if their aligned exons had at least 99% of SAG and 100% of CAG.
Perfectly assembled loci were a subset of accurately assembled loci that have
100% of CAR. In test 1, as there was no existing genome of <italic>L
osseus</italic>, sequences of <italic>L osseus</italic> were compared
against the genomic sequences of <italic>L oculatus</italic>. In test 2,
sequences of <italic>B pectinirostris</italic> were compared against genomic
sequences of <italic>B pectinirostris</italic> from You et al.<sup><xref rid="bibr53-1176934319874792" ref-type="bibr">53</xref></sup></p>
      <p>Sequences were recognized as paralogs if they cannot be aligned to targeted
regions in genomes. For each recovered paralog, reference sequence, orthologous
sequence to reference in targeted species, recovered paralog, and sequence found
in genome of reference that is orthology to paralog were collected and aligned.
Phylogenetic trees were reconstructed using RAxML under GTRGAMMA model to
further prove the paralogy between the reference and recovered sequence.
Paralogy validation was not run in test 1, because no genome of <italic>L
osseus</italic> is available.</p>
      <p>In order to make precise comparison, assembling procedure of the 4 pipelines were
further divided into 5 steps including removing PCR duplication, parsing reads
to homologous loci, de novo assembly, extracting exons, and removing potential
paralogs. Extracting exons and removing potential paralogs were performed
simultaneously in PHYLUCE and HybPiper, so we categorized these 2 steps as
“extract exons.” As one of the main purposes of fourth step of Assexon (further
assembly and extract exon) is to extract exons from assemblies, we categorized
it as “extract exons,” even it was also aimed for further assembly. Peak RAM
usage and CPU time of each step was accessed separately using custom script
(RAM_CPU_time.pl). PHYLUCE does not include the step of removing PCR duplication
and parsing reads to homologous loci, and HybPiper does not comprise the step of
removing PCR duplication, thus corresponding total CPU time and peak RAM usage
were not available. RAM usage and CPU time of the further assembly step in CP
could not be accessed, because this step needed to be manually operated.</p>

        <p>For the number of accurately assembled loci, 9489 loci were accurately
assembled using Assexon in test 1. Comparing to Assexon, more than 154 loci
were accurately assembled using CP (9634), which was still near to Assexon.
The number of loci accurately assembled using PHYLUCE and HybPiper was 5638
and 7561 loci, respectively. In test 2, about 5700 loci were accurately
assembled using Assexon (5783) and CP (5770). Compared to Assexon and CP,
only about half the number of loci (2304) was accurately assembled using
PHYLUCE. The number of loci accurately assembled in test 2 using HybPiper
was 3486.</p>
        <p>For the number of perfectly assembled loci, 8684 loci were perfectly
assembled using Assexon in test 1. Compared to Assexon, 499 more loci were
perfectly assembled using CP (9183). The number of loci perfectly assembled
using PHYLUCE and HybPiper was 5369 and 7445, respectively. In test 2, 4913
loci were perfectly assembled using Assexon. Compared to Assexon, 375 more
loci were perfectly assembled using CP (5288). Number of loci perfectly
assembled using PHYLUCE and HybPiper was 2176 and 3405, respectively. Length
distribution of perfectly assembled loci is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1176934319874792">Figure 3</xref>. Length of the most of
perfectly assembled loci was centered around 120 to 300 bp in both tests.
Compared to PHYLUCE and HybPiper, relatively higher number of loci was
perfectly assembled using Assexon and CP in this length category.</p>

1, 3 paralogs were detected from assemblies of HybPiper. No paralogs were
found from sequences produced using other approaches. In test 2, one paralog
was detected in assemblies produced using PHYLUCE. Two paralogs were
assembled using HybPiper. None were found in assemblies of Assexon and CP.
The paralog recovered using PHYLUCE did not have BLAST hit with genome of
<italic>O niloticus</italic>, so we were not able to get orthologous
sequence of <italic>O niloticus</italic> to this paralog. We constructed
maximum likelihood trees using 2 loci with enriched paralogs. Relationship
between references and enriched sequences were proved to be paralogy

required only around one fifth of memory usage than CP in steps of removing
PCR duplication. Assexon used the least RAM than CP, but it consumed more
RAM than HybPiper in the step of parsing reads to homologous loci. Assexon
used least memory during de novo assembly and extracting exons, but required
approximately 10 times the memory of CP in the step of removing potential
paralogs.</p>

        <p>Only 2 to 10 minutes were used to remove PCR duplication in both tests.
Assexon spent most of CPU time in parsing reads to homologous loci and de
novo assembly, however, Assexon required at most one third of CPU time than
other method in these 2 steps. Assexon used only around 5 minutes to extract
exons and it is at least 5 times faster than other methods in both tests.
Assexon was at last 18 times faster than CP in the step of removing
potential paralogs in both tests. For total time of analysis, Assexon used
at most half of time than HybPiper, half of time than PHYLUCE, and one
eighth of times than CP in 2 testing runs. Assexon only used 2 to 3 seconds
per locus to recover sequences from raw reads in average, which was the
least time used among all pipelines (CP: 20-26 s, PHYLUCE: 5-11 s, HybPiper:
4-9 s).</p>

      <title>Assembly performance of different approaches in coding regions</title>
      <p>In test 1, Assexon recovered the considerably more loci than other approaches,
while CP produced slightly more accurately assembled loci than Assexon. Higher
assembling accuracy of CP could be resulted from the Trinity assembler applied
in CP, which identifies paths supported by paired reads when encountered
conflicted paths in de Bruijn graph. This feature could help to produce
plausible assemblies. PHYLUCE recovered the least number of loci in all classes.
In test 2, the percentage of recovered loci dramatically decreased as expected,
because bait design species and targeted sample species in test 2 were much more
diverged than the pairs in test 1. The genetic distance between reference and
target did not have effect on the superior performance of Assexon and CP. They
still recovered many more loci than HybPiper and PHYLUCE. Assexon and CP did not
assemble any paralog in both tests. HybPiper left 3 and 2 paralogs in assemblies
of test 1 and test 2, respectively, and paralogs in test 2 were ascertained only
by tree reconstruction, which revealed that HybPiper could not effectively
detect potential paralogs. In test 2, one potential paralog was found in
assemblies produced using PHYLUCE, while this sequence did not have hit with the
genome of <italic>O niloticus</italic> with default parameter setting. No hit
was found until E-value threshold was raised to 6, which suggested that
“potential paralog” produced using PHYLUCE was not a genuine paralog. It may be
a sequence comprising a motif that could be commonly found in the genome. Thus,
no paralog was detected from sequences assembled using PHYLUCE in our
dataset.</p>
      <p>Assexon required considerably lower memory usage than other methods except in the
steps of parsing reads to homologous loci and removing potential paralogs. These
2 steps needed around 2 Gb of RAM; however, it was still manageable even for a
desktop computer. CP used extraordinary high RAM when removing PCR duplication.
The strategy of CP for removing PCR duplication is responsible for the high RAM
usage; CP extracts the first 20 bp from paired reads, then concatenates them
together as keys of hash, and uses hash function to remove duplicated reads.
Keys extracted from entire read set are loaded into the RAM, which leads to high
RAM usage. CP also consumed high RAM usage when extracting exons. CP uses the
Smith-Waterman algorithm<sup><xref rid="bibr55-1176934319874792" ref-type="bibr">55</xref></sup> to extract exons from assemblies, which relies on dynamic programming to
find the local optimal alignment between 2 sequences. The computational
complexity of Smith-Waterman algorithm is positively correlated with length of
input sequences, thus inputting long sequences could make CP require
unacceptably high RAM usage to extract exons. PHYLUCE requires high RAM during
de novo assembly, which is probably due to it input whole read set into
assembler without any de-duplicating or parsing reads into loci.</p>
      <p>Assexon spent the least total CPU time among the 4 methods, especially in the
steps based on BLAST searches and de novo assembly. Assexon used USEARCH instead
of standard BLAST as searching tools. USEARCH accelerated the searching speed
using an index on the database that supports rapid retrieval of word counts or
seeds. PHYLUCE input the entire read set into assembler, which substantially
increased complexity of assembly, thus, it occupies considerably longer CPU
time. CP spent the longest CPU time among 4 methods. The Trinity assembler
applied in CP does help to slightly improve the accuracy of resulting assembly;
however, efficiency is impeded due to the information of read pair incorporated
in the assembling process. Results from testing runs showed that Assexon was
able to accurately and efficiently extract exons from reads of targeted samples
across different divergence time.</p>

      <title>Assembly performance of different approaches in flanking regions</title>
      <p>Flanking regions were not specifically targeted, but they could be captured by
hitchhiking. Length of the flanking regions is positively correlated with
insertion size of DNA libraries. Flanks assembled using methods other than
Assexon were mainly around 600 to 800 bp in test 1. Captured reads for each
locus were rather low in test 2 due to deep divergence between bait design
species and target sample. This depicted the declines of length of flanking
sequences among all approaches. Flanking sequences assembled using Assexon were
much shorter in both tests due to conservative nature of SGA. Flanking regions
should be assembled in a conservative way, because its read depth is often low
in exon capture. Some of the current assemblers<sup><xref rid="bibr56-1176934319874792" ref-type="bibr">56</xref><xref rid="bibr57-1176934319874792" ref-type="bibr"/>-<xref rid="bibr58-1176934319874792" ref-type="bibr">58</xref></sup> choose the edges with
higher read depth, while it is hard to discriminate true edge from error-induced
edge based on read depth in flanking region. SGA breaks the graph apart from
diverged conflict edges, so that uncertain edges in flanking region are not
arbitrarily elongated. This guarantees the accuracy of assembled flanking
sequences.</p>

      <title>Implementing methods of different approaches</title>
      <p>Assexon and HybPiper are designed in a modular style, and all modular can be
called using a wrapper script (assemble.pl in Assexon and reads_first.py in
HybPiper). Such designing concept makes pipeline highly automated but flexible.
Users could also rerun partial pipeline to adapt various parameters. On the
contrary, each step of PHYLUCE and CP need to be separately implemented, so they
are not easy-to-use compared to Assexon and HybPiper. After de novo assembling
using Trinity, resulting contigs of each locus is required to be further
assembled using Geneious v7.1.5 in CP. Only 2000 to 3000 loci can be assembled
using Geneious v7.1.5 in a single run, so it could be labor-intensive when
hundreds of samples need to be assembled and each sample could have thousands of
loci.</p>

        <p>To obtain minimum amount of DNA required for exon capture and sequencing,
samples were amplified before and after enrichment. PCR de-duplication is
ignored by most of the current pipelines, because duplicated reads are
collapsed into the same k-mers, or de-duplicated by assemblers.
Nevertheless, the datasets from exon capture are typically larger than
Hyb-seq and UCE, so larger amounts of PCR duplicates could significantly
slower the efficiency of reads parsing and increase the RAM usage of de novo

        <title>Parse reads to homologous loci before assembling</title>
        <p>Short low-complexity sequences may be naturally included in exons, and thus
in markers designed to sequence them, and therefore low-complexity sequences
from non-targeted regions may be unintentionally captured and possibly
incorporated into assemblies. Non-targeted low-complexity sequences from
non-targeted regions could be wrongly parsed to some of the loci,
compromising the assembly of these loci. Thus, it is necessary to softly
mask low-complexity sequences of both the reference and the target reads
before parsing, so to avoid parsing non-targeted reads to the targeted loci.
Furthermore, read size of each locus was rather small (no more than 9.6 Mb
in 2 tests) after parsing. Because of this small size, they can be assembled
efficiently in parallel, reducing computational burden.</p>

        <p>Assembling exon capture data should accommodate low read depth, which is
frequently occurred in short loci or when targeted species diverge from the
reference used in bait design. However, multi-cell mode of SPAdes applied in
HybPiper requires at least 10× read depth to initiate assembly, which caused
loss of large number of loci in both tests. Reads can be preliminarily
assembled in conservative manner and then elongated further according to
synteny and alignment score between contigs and references to guarantee the

and flanking sequences, summarize basic statistics, and reformat dataset for
phylogenetic analysis in post-assembly processing phase, some of those
functions are also found in PHYLUCE and HybPiper. Assexon additionally
offers 2 scripts to select loci with desirable properties, which may help to
remove problematic loci, such as loci including undetected paralogs. The
monophyly_test.pl can be used to filter loci based on pre-defined
monophyletic groups that any loci that do not agree with the assumption are
probably error-prone (eg, undetected paralogs, insufficient length). The
clocklikeness_test.pl can be used to select clocklike loci from dataset.

filtering. Problematic loci, including potentially paralogous sequences,
could deviate from a molecular clock and very considerably in branch length.
Filtering out non-clocklike loci would thus be helpful way to detect
problematic loci, especially when no prior knowledge about topology of the

among flanking sequences of the same species is above 0.8 as well. p-dist of
about 2% to 3% of the flanks is greater than 0.4. This suggests that small
fraction of flanks could be too variable to be aligned, even for sequences from
the same species. Maximum p-dist among flanks were decreased to around 0.4 after
filtering, which suggested that extremely unalignable flanks were removed. The
number of SNPs per kb in filtered flanks was almost twice as many as the ones in
coding regions, which indicated rich variabilities in flanking regions. The data
