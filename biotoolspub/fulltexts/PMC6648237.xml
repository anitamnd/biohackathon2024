      <p>In
this study, we show that equilibrium pH can be obtained for
any specified fluid with any number of buffers and dissociations.
This is done by root finding in the equation for charge balance. We
demonstrate that this equation is monotonic in proton concentration
for conceivable buffers. We show that the total charge on any buffer
is a function of only the total buffer concentration and pH, given
the thermodynamic dissociation constants. Using the Davies’
equation as a placeholder for single-ion activity coefficients as
a function of charge and ionic strength, we develop an iterative algorithm,
whereby the apparent dissociation constants are updated from the thermodynamic
dissociation constants, and from this, the equilibrium is also identified
in the nonideal state. We show how this algebra leads to guaranteed
conservation of both thermodynamic dissociation constants and total
buffer concentrations because the distribution of buffer species is
fixed by the updated dissociation constants, actual pH, and total
buffer concentration. Strong ions are assumed to contribute fixed
charges. In order to concentrate on the process of modeling the equilibrium
pH alone, this algorithm is examined against a series of theoretical
results in which the Davies’ equation was given the same status.
However, a large sample of clinical pH measurements is also examined.
To enhance the practical utility, CO<sub>2</sub> and albumin are present
as the default condition. We developed “ABCharge”, a
package in R, an open source language. The main function returns pH,
activity coefficients, buffer species distribution, ionic strength,
and charge balance for both the ideal and nonideal cases, for any
mixture of any buffers with any number of known thermodynamic dissociation
constants. Our algorithm can be updated if a more reliable and practical
assessment of single-ion activities becomes available. Can Stock Photo/miceking</p>

    <title>Introduction</title>
    <p>Understanding of acid–base
physiology can be obtained through
deriving rules that allow prediction of pH from elementary measurements.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref></sup> The possibility of achieving this is equivalent with the ability
to calculate pH from the chemical constituents of a given fluid. The
underpinnings for these calculations are the thermodynamic principles
for dissociation and mass conservation and the requirement for balance
between moieties with positive and negative charges. At the bedside,
understanding acid–base disorders amounts to explaining the
current status from known determinants,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref></sup> thereby, suggesting mechanisms for explaining deviations and examining
specific hypotheses.</p>
    <p>The calculations of equilibrium pH have
been technically difficult
but methods to automate identification have been developed as advanced
numerical solutions became available. Ganesh et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref></sup> separate two mathematical approaches, an algebraic and
a dynamic. The algebraic approach may result in polynomial equations
in which the proper root identifies the equilibrium condition. The
dynamic method solves together a series of differential equations
and may address the development over time and not only the equilibrium
situation.</p>
    <p>In this paper, we propose that it is possible to
find a unique
expression of the net equilibrium charge in any specified fluid. Because
the charges are derived either from strong ions with pH-independent
fixed charge or from buffers, for which the total charge and distribution
of each charged species is a function of pH and total concentration
and the dissociation constants, root finding in this expression of
charge balance is tantamount to identification of both pH and the
distribution of buffer species. We show in the <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsomega.9b00270/suppl_file/ao9b00270_si_001.pdf">Supporting Information</ext-link> (“Derivation of charge-balance
expression”) that charge balance is always monotonic in [H<sup>+</sup>], which guarantees a single root. Crucially, from the algebraic
formulation of the model, it is ensured that the fitting procedure
enforces the conservation of thermodynamic dissociation constants
and total buffer concentrations.</p>
    <p>An important problem is how
to account for ionic strength and apply
activity coefficients for nonideal or not very dilute solutions. A
recent series of publications<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>−<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref></sup> attest to the perceived importance
of this subject. They all used Davies’ equation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref></sup> as an approximation to the Debye–Hückel theory,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref></sup> and implicitly assumed that, hereby, a useful
single-ion activity coefficient was at hand. In reality, the Davies’
equation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref></sup> delivers the mean ionic activity
coefficient for prevalent cations and anions. Therefore, assuming
that this value can be used as an estimate of single-ion activity
coefficient is certainly problematic.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref></sup></p>
    <p>Over the years, it has even been an enigma if single-ion activities
can at all be defined, measured, or calculated.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>−<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref></sup> As our aim
here is to explore the utility of charge-balance in the modeling of
acid–base equilibrium, it is worthwhile to present in brief
one argument in favor of the reality of single-ion activity as given
by Valiskó and Boda.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref></sup> The impossibility
(according to Valiskó and Boda<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref></sup>) of operating with a single-ion activity roots in the perceived
impossibility of adding positive or negative charge without also adding
the respective counterions. However, as stressed by these authors,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref></sup> the requirement of charge-balance is relevant
in the macroscopic realm, whereas in the microscopic world and over
short periods of time, charge imbalance is frequent and important—for
instance, in physiology. On the other hand, Kontogeorgis et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref></sup> in a recent review on Debye–Hückel
modeling conclude that the status of single-ion activity coefficients
is uncertain, while also acknowledging that progress in theoretical
and practical construction of these takes place<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref></sup> by Poisson–Fermi modeling and otherwise. Recently, it has
been suggested that single-ion activity coefficients can be obtained
from the theoretically well-established single-ion conductivity,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref></sup> lending some support to the reality of the former
and probably also, eventually, means for the estimation.</p>
    <p>In
any case, in the papers considered here,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>−<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref></sup> nonideal conditions
are handled by correcting for ionic strength and charge by the use
of activity coefficients obtained from the Davies’ equation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref></sup> Our intention here is, therefore, to explore
how identification of equilibrium in the nonideal state can be obtained
by a charge-balance approach given that the Davies’ equation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref></sup> is understood to deliver single-ion activities.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>−<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref></sup> It is acknowledged that this modeling of the nonideal state is provisional
and must be improved if and when a more established notion of single-ion
activity coefficient becomes available. Therefore, the mean activities
obtained by the Davies’ equation are interpreted as placeholders
for single-ion activities. Alternatively, we may choose to consider
the single-ion activities that results from the disputed activity
coefficients as conventional rather than physical entities.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref></sup> The modeling and theoretical comparisons presented
here will be insensitive to this choice.</p>
    <p>The studies selected
for consideration here were chosen because
they deliver theoretical calculated pH values, and our intention is
to present an algorithm for obtaining such estimates in the equilibrium
state in a robust and conceptually simple way.</p>
    <p>Tessman and Ivanov<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref></sup> described a general
procedure for finding equilibrium including activity coefficients
based on Debye–Hückel via Davies equation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref></sup> This involved solving polynomials and fitted
available measurements well. Similarly, Glaser et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref></sup> obtained dynamic results for multiequilibria problems by
writing up all possible chemical reactions in the fluid as differential
equations. Both equilibrium and off-equilibrium situations were thereby
characterized. It was shown that the algebraic approach yielded a
single solution, which was identical to the dynamic approach in the
equilibrium situation. Schell et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref></sup> augmented
this dynamic approach to take ionic strength into account, again using
the Davies’ equation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref></sup> Also, Baeza-Baeza
and García-Álvarez-Coque<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref></sup> used the Davies’ equation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref></sup> to
find activity coefficients and found the equilibrium pH through minimizing
a composite criterion. This consisted of the squared difference of
the sum of buffer concentrations from known total values, the squared
difference of charge balance from zero, and the squared final change
in ionic strength after an iterative procedure.</p>
    <p>A straightforward
and reliable method to model pH may also lead
to further improvements in the techniques for measuring the pH. It
may seem an unproblematic statement that no matter how the pH is modeled
from chemical variables, the final criterion for evaluating putative
models will be how well the actual pH measurements are predicted.
In contrast, the measurement of pH itself is a highly contentious
subject.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref></sup> Central to this problem is just
the relationship between ion activities and electric potentials which
impact pH measurement as classically defined.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref></sup> Therefore, in the current study, we will mainly examine results
which have been obtained by theoretical arguments to avoid the possible
problems in measuring pH. However, we will also use a clinical sample
of more than 2000 measurements for validation.</p>
    <p>Finally, we have
placed our methods into a package in R,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref></sup> “ABCharge”, with which it is possible
to estimate equilibrium characteristics for arbitrary fluids with
any number of buffers with any number of dissociations, with and without
CO<sub>2</sub> and albumin. The default option includes, for lack
of better options at present, single-ion activity coefficients obtained
from the Davies’ equation,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref></sup> but
this can be omitted, assuming ideal circumstances. The algorithm proposed
to update the estimate of activity coefficients is sensitive to only
absolute ionic charge and ionic strength and will therefore require
augmentation if other details are taken into account to describe the
activity coefficient. Likewise, the algorithm can be modified to include
any number of mono- or multivalent bases.</p>

    <title>Methods</title>
    <p>We will
first present the charge-balance model with single-ion
activity coefficients based on Debye–Hückel/Davies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref></sup> for a very simple system and describe the algorithm
for deriving the system characteristics in equilibrium. In the <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsomega.9b00270/suppl_file/ao9b00270_si_001.pdf">Supporting Information</ext-link> (see: “Derivation
of the charge-balance expression”), we present a complete derivation
of a more extensive and clinically useful model together with a demonstration
of the fact that for any conceivable buffer mixture, the charge-balance
expression is monotone in proton concentration. Then, theoretical
data from the recent literature will be applied, and the results from
the model will be compared to the results from the original publications.
Finally, we will analyze a series of clinical data to examine the
correspondence with actually measured quantities.</p>

      <title>Charge-Balance in an Acetate-Buffered

      <p>To explain

      <p>Furthermore, we have from water autodissociation that<disp-formula id="eq3"><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="ao-2019-00270p_m003" position="anchor"/><label>3</label></disp-formula></p>

      <p>Thereby the charge-balance

      <p>As described
in the <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsomega.9b00270/suppl_file/ao9b00270_si_001.pdf">Supporting Information</ext-link> (“Derivation
of charge-balance expression”), we model
albumin using the model of Watson,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref></sup> which
assigns 21 fixed and 16 variable charges to each mol albumin. The
mobility of these charges in the fluid is difficult to know, and because
the molar concentration of albumin is likely to be less than 0.001,
we have decided to ignore albumin in the calculation of ionic strength.</p>
      <p>The procedure to find pH and distribution of ionized species on
the basis of charge balance, then, is as follows:</p>

      <p>For more complex solutions
including multivalent buffers, for example,
carbonic acid, a generalization of Henderson–Hasselbalch as
employed implicitly in <xref rid="eq1" ref-type="disp-formula">eq <xref rid="eq1" ref-type="disp-formula">1</xref></xref> is used.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref></sup> This is described in the <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsomega.9b00270/suppl_file/ao9b00270_si_001.pdf">Supporting Information</ext-link> (see: “Derivation
of the charge-balance expression”).</p>
      <p>When extending the
charge balance to be dependent on ionic strength,
the thermodynamic dissociation constants for the buffers are expressed
as based on activities as shown in <xref rid="eq1" ref-type="disp-formula">eq <xref rid="eq1" ref-type="disp-formula">1</xref></xref> above. From this, corrected concentrations of the
buffer species are calculated to update the charge-balance expression.
The only unknown in the charge balance equation then is the H<sup>+</sup> concentration. It is crucial, as detailed in the <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsomega.9b00270/suppl_file/ao9b00270_si_001.pdf">Supporting Information</ext-link> (see: “Derivation
of the charge-balance expression”), that all considered buffer
species can be shown to contribute with increasing charge as [H<sup>+</sup>] increases. Therefore, root finding in the charge-balance
equation is very efficient. When comparing this root to measured pH
values based on the IUPAC convention,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref></sup> the activity coefficient obtained for a single charge is then multiplied
by the H<sup>+</sup> concentrations.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec2.2">
      <title>Practical Implementation</title>
      <p>We used open-source, R,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref></sup> for specifying
the models and fitting and plotting
the results. All results are documented in the <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsomega.9b00270/suppl_file/ao9b00270_si_001.pdf">Supporting Information</ext-link> and on ACS figshare as R markdown files.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref></sup> The functions are given as an extensively commented
and freely available package in R, “ABCharge”. Thereby,
the user will be able to analyze any conceivable fluid by specifying
total concentrations of any number of individual buffers, each with
any number of known thermodynamic dissociation constants. A range
of strong ions are included as default but set to zero concentration,
if not present. Likewise, <italic>p</italic>CO<sub>2</sub> and albumin
are handled, if needed. The derivation is presented as <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsomega.9b00270/suppl_file/ao9b00270_si_001.pdf">Supporting Information</ext-link> (see: “Derivation

      <title>Materials for Testing the Charge Balance Model</title>
      <p>In order
to find material for validation of a charge-balance based formulation
of acid–base, both in the ideal state and after imposing activity
coefficients, we sought publications in which the resulting pH was
theoretically derived. Thereby, we could in a first step concentrate
on the principles of the modeling in the competing formulations without
concern for the validity of the pH measurements.</p>
      <p>Here, we focused
primarily on a recent publication by Schell et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref></sup> that identifies the equilibrium condition in mixtures of
dihydrogen phosphate and citric acid with and without correction for
ionic strength employing Davies’ equation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref></sup> This analysis is presented in detail. Also, some of the
results from Tessman and Ivanov<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref></sup> are presented
and analyzed to further expose the consequences of disagreement in
assessing the equilibrium conditions. Furthermore, we modeled a set
of previously examined<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref></sup> clinically obtained
pH values on the basis of electrolyte, albumin, phosphate, lactate,
and <italic>p</italic>CO<sub>2</sub> values. Finally, analyses of
the papers by Glaser et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref></sup> and Baeza-Baeza
and García-Álvarez-Coque<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref></sup> are presented in brief.</p>
      <p>To assess our methods in comparison
with those from the literature,
the estimated pH values were compared, but also, if possible, we tried
to evaluate if charge balance approached zero in equilibrium. Likewise,
the recovery of thermodynamic dissociation constants in equilibrium
was appraised. Clearly, agreement in these respects is required for
the methods to be consistent. This means that at the estimated equilibrium,
the distribution of buffer concentrations together with strong ions
must result in a charge balance close to zero. The sum of the buffer
species (including uncharged items) must be the known starting total
concentrations, and, with the calculated activity coefficients, recovery
of thermodynamic dissociation constants must be verified. Although,
as shown below, our methods guarantee fulfillment of these requirements
in principle, in actual applications, the finite accuracy in numeric
calculations may result in minor deviations.</p>

dissociation constant for the third dissociation of phosphoric acid.</p>
      <p>Therefore, we can see that there is a guarantee that the algorithm
delivers estimates of concentrations of the buffer species that algebraically
align with the requirements of preserved dissociation constants. Again,
in actual applications, due to imperfections in computer representation
of floating-point numbers, minor deviations are possible.</p>
      <p>First,
the results from Schell et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref></sup> assuming
ideal conditions that is with all activity coefficients
fixed at 1 were compared to the results from the proposed charge-balance
algorithm. The agreement between the calculated results by our charge-balance
method and the results from Schell et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref></sup> is good with a correlation coefficient of 0.99996. The difference
between the pH reported by Schell et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref></sup> and our calculated pH values has a median of 0.002 with a range
of −0.027 to 0.036 (Point 1 in supplementary “Schell2018.pdf”).
Equally, for the results after imposing correction for ionic strength,
the correlation coefficient is similar at 0.9996 and the differences
in pH values by our method and the reported method has a median of
0.004 and a range of −0.031 to 0.044; (point 2 in the <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsomega.9b00270/suppl_file/ao9b00270_si_001.pdf">Supporting Information</ext-link> “Schell2018.pdf”).</p>
      <p>Differences between results obtained from our method and those
employed in Schell et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref></sup> do exist, however,
if we consider the reported distribution at equilibrium of citric
acid and phosphoric acid species using the results with correction
for ionic strength. The distribution of the buffer species allows
reconstruction of thermodynamic dissociation constants from the results
of Schell et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref></sup> because the activity
coefficients can be calculated from the reported ionic strength using <xref rid="eq7" ref-type="disp-formula">eq <xref rid="eq7" ref-type="disp-formula">7</xref></xref>. As described, the dissociation
constants for triprotic acids are given in <xref rid="eq13" ref-type="disp-formula">eq <xref rid="eq13" ref-type="disp-formula">13</xref></xref>/<xref rid="eq15" ref-type="disp-formula">eq <xref rid="eq15" ref-type="disp-formula">15</xref></xref>, so with the reported distribution of buffer species and
the reported ionic strength, based on the results reported by Schell
et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref></sup> we have the following results (see:
point 3 in the <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsomega.9b00270/suppl_file/ao9b00270_si_001.pdf">Supporting Information</ext-link> “Schell2018.pdf”).

      <p>Apparently, these problems are not the consequence
of the fact
that concentrations of the buffer species are rounded to 0.1 mM in
the results of Schell et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref></sup> because the
maximal charge imbalance (see below) is more than 10 times higher
than the cutoff value. Furthermore, plotting the difference between
the known thermodynamic dissociation constant and the one estimated
on the basis of the given data yields a clear regression with the
ionic strength. This is demonstrated in the <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsomega.9b00270/suppl_file/ao9b00270_si_001.pdf">Supporting Information</ext-link> (“Schell2018.pdf”) and with example(Schell)

      <title>Analysis of Results from Tessman and Ivanov<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref></sup></title>
      <p>We restrict attention to the results in <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="other">Table <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="other">1</xref></xref> of Tessman and Ivanov<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref></sup> of two mixtures of boric acid, phosphoric acid,
acetic acid, and NaOH. Concentrations were: 0.0267, 0.0267, 0.0267,
and 0.0667 for the first sample, and 0.02, 0.02, 0.02, and 0.1 for
the second sample, all in M.</p>
      <p>Several details from the modeling
by Tessman and Ivanov<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref></sup> were not available,
for instance, the exact form of the Davies’ equation employed
or the assigned value of the water autodissociation constant. The
entire analysis is available from package ABCharge using “example(Tessman)”.
As reported also in “Tessman.rmd” on ACS figshare and
as “Tessman2002.pdf” in the <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsomega.9b00270/suppl_file/ao9b00270_si_001.pdf">Supporting Information</ext-link>, for the first example, the reported pH was 6.812
at an ionic strength of 0.0798, whereas our charge balance application
gave pH of 6.771 and ionic strength of 0.07997. However, it is observed
that our first ionic strength calculated before assignment of activity
coefficients is 0.079806. This is available from step 3 in the first
iteration of our algorithm.</p>
      <p>The next example demonstrates a
wider difference as the reported
pH is 12.005, whereas we find 11.5244 at the ionic strength of 0.1428
compared to the reported ionic strength of 0.1367. Again, it is observed
that our initial ionic strength before the application of Davies’
equation is very similar at 0.13669, and likewise it is observed that
the first pH in the iterations, that is before going beyond all activity
coefficients being equal to 1, is 12.00455, that is quite similar
to the reported value.</p>
      <p>Although for the reasons mentioned above,
we are unable to compare
these methods directly, we can examine the characteristics of the
results in Tessman and Ivanov<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref></sup> in their
equilibrium, that is pH 12.005 and ionic strength 0.1367. This requires
finding the activity coefficients via the Davies’ equation,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref></sup> and from these and the known total concentrations
of buffer species, the known thermodynamic dissociation constants,
and the found pH (12.005), we can find the concentration of individual
buffer species and hence, the charge balance. As shown in the <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsomega.9b00270/suppl_file/ao9b00270_si_001.pdf">Supporting Information</ext-link> (“Tessman2002.pdf”)
and demonstrated in code (“Tessman.rmd” on ACS figshare),
this charge balance is rounded to −22 mM. This is found using
the form of Davies’ equation in Schell et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref></sup> with <italic>b</italic> = 0.1 but using <italic>b</italic> = 0.2 and the <italic>A</italic> of 0.509 in <xref rid="eq7" ref-type="disp-formula">eq <xref rid="eq7" ref-type="disp-formula">7</xref></xref> as used by Baeza-Baeza and García-Álvarez-Coque<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref></sup> does not change that significantly (results not
shown). This will inevitably generate a very huge potential. With
the uncertainty resulting from the fact that the methods in Tessman
and Ivanov<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref></sup> are not wholly specified, this
must still leave some doubt as to the validity of the estimate in
the paper.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref></sup> In contrast, we should be able
to closely inspect the results obtained by our charge balance approach
for validity.</p>
      <p>Hence, if the distribution of buffer species identified
at equilibrium
is examined, a proper identification of equilibrium is verified if:
(a) the total concentrations of buffer species are maintained, (b)
the thermodynamic dissociation constants after taking account of the
found activity coefficients are all conserved, and (c) the charge
balance at equilibrium approaches zero. These are, we believe, the
necessary and sufficient conditions for identifying equilibrium. As
shown in the <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsomega.9b00270/suppl_file/ao9b00270_si_001.pdf">Supporting Information</ext-link> (“Tessman2002.pdf”),
these three points are all confirmed, with buffer concentrations and
dissociations closely recovered, and with a charge balance of 68 ×
10<sup>–6</sup> mM, which is approximately half a million times
better compared to the charge imbalance inferred for the results reported
in the paper.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref></sup></p>
      <p>Furthermore, as the
system described by Tessman and Ivanov<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref></sup> is quite complicated with eight different dissociation
constants (including water autodissociation), it would be of interest
to inspect charge-balance as a function of pH to get an impression
that the expression of charge-balance could contain sufficient information
for close identification of pH. The curves are generated by finding
the charge balance as a function of pH and the found activity coefficients,
first over the entire pH range (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref></xref>) and next as a close-up near the identified equilibrium

      <title>Analysis of Clinical Data
from Critically Ill Patients</title>
      <p>Modeling pH was accomplished
based on a set of 2437 values found
in Ring<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref></sup> by way of the thermodynamic dissociations
corrected for ion strength and taking the measured pH to be −log(<italic>a</italic>H<sup>+</sup>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref></sup> This was a
sample from critically ill but very heterogenous patients, and the
modeling was based on all of the nine measured moieties, corresponding
to 13 different charges (see “Derivation of the charge-balance
model” in the <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsomega.9b00270/suppl_file/ao9b00270_si_001.pdf">Supporting Information</ext-link>). Problems with measurements of every item including pH were expected,
and the presence of unmeasured anions and cations were considered
likely.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref></sup> The ionic strength was, as typical
for clinical samples, high around 0.15, and correspondingly, the single-charge
activity coefficients about 0.733, that is far from 1.</p>
      <p>Hence,
it was expected that the pH corrected for ionic strength would be
different from the estimate obtained assuming ideal conditions. As
shown in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref></xref>,
assuming ideal conditions caused the modeled pH to overestimate the
measured pH (green curve). In contrast, taking the H<sup>+</sup> values
from the estimation including activity coefficients directly as the
basis for pH resulted in the modeled pH underestimating the measured
pH (blue curve). However, correcting this last H<sup>+</sup> for the
found activity coefficient for single charges resulted in the difference
between modeled and measured pH to be approximately centered on zero.</p>

described previously, the agreement between measured and modeled pH
was less convincing. On the other hand, given the circumstances of
a clinical study as described, and given the uncertain status of the
employed Davies’ correction, we believe the charge-balance
model to be potentially useful, also in the clinical context. Again,

      <title>Results from Glaser et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref></sup></title>
      <p>Glaser
and coworkers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref></sup> first reported
finding pH in mixtures of malate, malic acids alone, and combinations
of these using a dynamic approach resulting in a polynomial model,
for which they show that exactly one root corresponds to the equilibrium
situation. As shown in our analysis (see “Glaser2014.rmd”
on ACS figshare for the entire analysis, and the results as “Glaser2014.pdf”
in the <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsomega.9b00270/suppl_file/ao9b00270_si_001.pdf">Supporting Information</ext-link>), we can
confirm these pH values with a correlation greater than 0.99999 in
one single run, that is taking the three cases together, because all
we need for estimation is total buffer concentration, the two p<italic>K</italic><sub>a</sub> values for diprotic malic acid, and strong
ion concentration (assuming complete dissociation of the malate salt).
As shown (see “Glaser2014.pdf” in the <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsomega.9b00270/suppl_file/ao9b00270_si_001.pdf">Supporting Information</ext-link>), given the quite high ionic strength
in these experiments, we can also assess the importance of taking
ionic strength into account. These analyses also are shown with example(malate).</p>
      <p>Next, Glaser et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref></sup> analyzed the dissociation
of bromic acid (HBrO<sub>3</sub>) in mixtures of sulfuric acid and
bromate salts over a grid of assumed p<italic>K</italic><sub>a</sub> values for bromic acid. Assuming the ideal situation (all activity
coefficients 1), we can again, with correlation 0.9999, confirm the
resulting pH values, and we can reproduce the distribution of bromate
and bromic acid species. Taking ionic strength into account, we can
again show the shifts in results as shown by the distribution of species
concentrations over the grid of p<italic>K</italic><sub>a</sub> values.

      <title>Results from Baeza-Baeza and García-Álvarez-Coque<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref></sup></title>
      <p>Baeza-Baeza and García-Álvarez-Coque<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref></sup> developed a method in Excel to take ionic strength
into account using a composite criterion for optimization, consisting
of the sum of the squared deviations of total concentrations of buffers,
charge balance, and change in ionic strength during iterations. We
only look at their first example, where potassium hydrogen phthalate
is mixed with hydrochloric acid. Our results are reproduced in “Baeza-Baeza2012.rmd”
on ACS figshare and shown in “Baeza-Baeza2012.pdf” in
the <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsomega.9b00270/suppl_file/ao9b00270_si_001.pdf">Supporting Information</ext-link> We get a corrected
pH of 3.1003, which is in good agreement with the reported 3.100.
However, their charge balance (calculated from column F in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref></xref>) is −2.61
× 10<sup>–6</sup> M, whereas we find a balance of 0. We
recover the total phthalate concentration closely and obtain 2.9500001
and 5.4100025 for the 2p<italic>K</italic><sub>a</sub> values, whereas
from the results reported by Baeza-Baeza and García-Álvarez-Coque,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref></sup> 2.9491 and 5.4096 can be recovered. Again, example(Baeza)
shows the code and results.</p>

  <sec id="sec4">
    <title>Discussion</title>
    <p>We
have demonstrated that the charge-balance model effectively
estimates pH for specified fluids, including clinical samples.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref></sup> Most of our results demonstrate excellent concordance
between the results obtained with the charge-balance method as implemented
and the original methods described in the literature. However, there
are a few deviations which require consideration. First, the second
example from Tessman and Ivanov<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref></sup> yields
a distinctly different pH value. We cannot be absolutely sure why
this difference occurs, but the reported equilibrium value that is
identified with our charge-balance model evidently has better characteristics
in terms of charge balance, which we know must be close to zero. Apparently,
the requirement of charge balance at equilibrium is better enforced
by the explicit formulation in the charge-balance expression. This
is also manifest in examining the results from Schell et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref></sup> and Baeza-Baeza and García-Álvarez-Coque,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref></sup> as a second deviation. The algorithm is attractive
because the requirement for conserved total buffer concentrations,
minimization of charge balance, and the stability of thermodynamic
dissociation constants are directly enforced in the formulation of
the charge balance equation. Hence, we do not need to optimize separately
for these items as, for example, Baeza-Baeza and García-Álvarez-Coque<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref></sup> have. As shown in the <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsomega.9b00270/suppl_file/ao9b00270_si_001.pdf">Supporting Information</ext-link> (see: “Derivation of the charge-balance
expression”), the step to find the equilibrium [H<sup>+</sup>] is effective because the charge balance is monotonic in [H<sup>+</sup>] for all of the cases considered up to trivalent acids and
bases and their mixtures. We are working to prove that this has to
be so in general and so far, have managed to prove the monotonicity
for any multivalent buffer.</p>
    <p>It may appear surprising that it
is possible to confidently identify
the equilibrium pH from the calculated charge. As demonstrated for
the single example reported by Tessman and Ivanov<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref></sup> in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref></xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>, the identification of the equilibrium
pH from the charge balance is apparently quite feasible, at least
in these examples.</p>
    <p>A sensible objection to the validity of the
approach could be that
strong ions and buffer species are reported typically with error margins
in a millimolar range. Hence, it might appear unreasonable to expect
the charge balance expression to yield distinctive information on
the proton concentration at a magnitude several orders lower. However,
as it appears from the charge-balance expression, for example in <xref rid="eq8" ref-type="disp-formula">eq <xref rid="eq8" ref-type="disp-formula">8</xref></xref>, protons appear mainly
in the denominator and simulations show that 10% shift in proton concentration
has a similar effect on the charge as 10% shift in strong ions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref></sup> However, strong ions obviously have a major influence
on the charge balance. Amazingly, the fact that there could be an
impact of the strong ions on the pH has been controversial in the
literature.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref></sup> In contrast, from a charge-balance
perspective, charges in a fluid can be divided between those that
are independent of pH (strong ions) and those that are dependent on
pH. Because the balance must still be zero, if we change the net charge
on those moieties that are charged independently of pH, we only have
the possibility to balance by those that change their charge dependently
on pH. And this cannot happen unless pH changes.</p>
    <p>In comparison
with the original reports, our methods may be better
in defining the equilibrium conditions. As mentioned, a reasonable
criterion for consistent identification of equilibrium could be that
charge balance is close to zero, total buffer concentrations conserved
at input values, and thermodynamic dissociation constants maintained.
As shown, this is true theoretically for the charge balance model
and also approximately in praxis. In contrast, the results from Schell
et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref></sup> Glaser et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref></sup> Baeza-Baeza, and García-Álvarez-Coque<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref></sup> may have issues in these respects. We cannot
be sure about what causes these minor problems in the reported studies.
In the case of Baeza-Baeza and García-Álvarez-Coque,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref></sup> it is possible that the combined criterion, on
which the optimization occurs, results in opaque trade-offs among
the three items (squared difference in total buffer concentrations
vs sum of calculated species, squared differences in charge balance,
and squared last difference between results for ionic strength). For
the studies by Schell et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref></sup> and Glaser
et al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref></sup> we have no access to the complete
code used, and therefore are unable to comment further. It is crucial
to realize that, for instance, with regard to the results from Schell
et al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref></sup> the recovery of the thermodynamic
dissociation constants shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref></xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> was carried
out entirely on their own reported results. Hence, their ionic strength
(from “S1.dat”) gives the activity coefficients using
their version of the Davies’ equation,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref></sup> and the equilibrium concentrations of buffer species (their <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsomega.9b00270/suppl_file/ao9b00270_si_001.pdf">Table S2a,b</ext-link>, given here as “Citrate.dat”
and “Phosphate.dat”) together with the definitions of
the thermodynamic dissociation constants (<xref rid="eq13" ref-type="disp-formula">eq <xref rid="eq13" ref-type="disp-formula">13</xref></xref>/<xref rid="eq15" ref-type="disp-formula">eq <xref rid="eq15" ref-type="disp-formula">15</xref></xref>).</p>
    <p>Finally, the validation using clinical samples, extending
the model
to cover the CO<sub>2</sub> buffer system and albumin, may indicate
that the model may be useful in clinical research and perhaps even
in clinical practice. The versatility of the charge balance model
must be stressed. For instance, patients may have a significantly
lower pH than that calculated from measured standard quantities and
instead of just accepting a diagnosis of anion-gap acidosis, an anion
with specific concentration and <italic>K</italic><sub>a</sub> could
be added to the charge balance expression, such as <inline-formula id="d30e1477"><inline-graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="ao-2019-00270p_m019.gif"/></inline-formula> which could be verified, for instance,
with NMR spectrometry. We have used this to confirm the diagnosis
of pyroglutamate intoxication.</p>
    <p>However, this implementation
is certainly not free of conundrums
or loose ends. The central problem is how to account for nonideal
circumstances. It is evident from the derivations that the specification
of thermodynamic dissociation constants builds heavily on single-ion
activity coefficients. In the introduction, we have alluded to the
ongoing debate about their status and to the fact that the Davies’
equation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref></sup> specifies a mean and not single-ion
activity coefficient. However, the papers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>−<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref></sup> from which we
took the material for testing our modeling use just this specification
of single-ion activity coefficients and other have done likewise.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref></sup> First and foremost, however, we saw no other
opportunity if we wanted to use the mentioned material to test our
modeling approach.</p>
    <p>Also, even if the specification of the nonideal
situation as employed
here is indeed wanting from a theoretical point of view, it may nonetheless
have some value as indicated by the assessment of a large clinical
material.</p>
    <p>Furthermore, we may regard the current specification
of single-ion
activity coefficient as a placeholder for a true value, if this true
value is mainly determined by ionic strength and charge because then,
our updating algorithm will also be appropriate for the true value.</p>
    <p>We hope eventually that our modeling can be used to test better
specifications of nonideality so that, for instance, activity coefficients
for positive and negative ions with the same absolute charge are not
identical<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref></sup> as in the current implementation
of the Davies’ equation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref></sup> Also,
eventually, we might add a correction for uncharged species by way
of the Sechenov equation,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref></sup> but this does
not deviate far from 1, and therefore has little effect on the results
and so was omitted.</p>
    <p>Finally, in contrast to the dynamic systems
used by Glaser et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref></sup> and Schell et al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref></sup> our methods are unable to clarify the situation
outside equilibrium.</p>

    <title>Conclusions</title>
    <p>It has been shown that
the charge balance approach allows a simple
direct modeling of pH in situations where no correction for ionic
strength is performed. If activity coefficients are applied by way
of Debye–Hückel/Davies to the buffer species, an excellent
reproduction of the equilibrium pH values obtained with previously
reported tools are obtained. Crucially, the mathematical elegance
of the charge-balance approach results in improved characteristics
of the results in terms of conservation of thermodynamic constants
and charge difference. Finally, the implementation is provided as
an R package and all methods are totally transparent and can be scrutinized,
modified, and extended as desired.</p>
