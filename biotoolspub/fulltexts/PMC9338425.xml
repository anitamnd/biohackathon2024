      <title>Abstract</title>
      <p>Survival analysis is a branch of statistics that deals with both the tracking of time and the survival status simultaneously as the dependent response. Current comparisons of survival model performance mostly center on clinical data with classic statistical survival models, with prediction accuracy often serving as the sole metric of model performance. Moreover, survival analysis approaches for censored omics data have not been thoroughly investigated. The common approach is to binarize the survival time and perform a classification analysis.</p>
      <p>Here, we develop a benchmarking design, SurvBenchmark, that evaluates a diverse collection of survival models for both clinical and omics data sets. SurvBenchmark not only focuses on classical approaches such as the Cox model but also evaluates state-of-the-art machine learning survival models. All approaches were assessed using multiple performance metrics; these include model predictability, stability, flexibility, and computational issues. Our systematic comparison design with 320 comparisons (20 methods over 16 data sets) shows that the performances of survival models vary in practice over real-world data sets and over the choice of the evaluation metric. In particular, we highlight that using multiple performance metrics is critical in providing a balanced assessment of various models. The results in our study will provide practical guidelines for translational scientists and clinicians, as well as define possible areas of investigation in both survival technique and benchmarking strategies.</p>

    <title>Background</title>
    <p>Survival models are statistical models designed for data that have censored observations, that is, time-to-event data, which are ubiquitous, including in health, tourism [<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], economics [<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], and engineering [<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. In this paper, we will follow the terminology of survival analysis in which the event of interest is captured through a âstatusâ variable, âsâ typically, considered a binary class outcome. The waiting time to this status event is defined as the âsurvivalâ time, either measured as continuous or discrete time periods. Survival models target both outcomes: status and time-to-event, whereas neither regression analysis on time nor classification analysis on status explain this bivariate outcome information [<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Classes of models dealing with these events have wide applicability well beyond the clinical and omics applications that are considered here.</p>
    <p>Numerous survival models have been developed over the last decades. There are many studies in the literature that give a good overview on right-censored data sets without time-dependent covariates, for example [<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. However, few of these studies take a practical viewpoint, and few make sufficient real-world data set comparisons, particularly in the biomedical field. This motivated us to develop a benchmarking design for the diverse clinical and omics survival data in health. This work intends to improve the knowledge and understanding of such models and guide clinical decision-making. We first performed an exhaustive search for various types of available survival analysis methods and the methods of performance evaluations for the different types of data sets.</p>
    <p>Among the comparative studies that included real-world data sets in health, we found that most have a specific focus such as on a certain disease (e.g., colon cancer) or on a certain data platform (e.g., omics or clinical). For example, Schober and Vetter [<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] and Ahmed et al. [<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] conduct reviews on classical survival models such as the KaplanâMeier (KM) method and the Cox Ppoportional Hhzards (CoxPH) model with a focus on clinical data with an induced anasthesia state and a specific colon cancer type, respectively. Lee and Lim [<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] apply the penalized Cox model, survival support vector machine (SVM), random survival forest (RSF), and Cox boosting models on large genomic data. To date, no systematic review encompasses data sets obtained from multiple disease types. Therefore, this necessitates the development of a benchmarking design that will provide a better understanding of how different survival models perform in practice across various disease types.</p>
    <p>With the emergence of different modeling approaches from various disciplines, many of these recent comparison studies have limited their focus on either within classical models (KM method, CoxPH model) or within modern machine learning (ML) methods. Recently, a comprehensive survey article [<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] compares three categories of statistical survival and ML methods with a focus on theoretical mathematical details. However, this study does not provide practical implications of the various methods, and no comparison of performance using real-world data sets is made. There is a need for better guidance on what data analysis strategy to use.</p>
    <p>A recent exception is the benchmark study by Herrmann et al. [<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. This valuable contribution includes both real-world clinical and omics data sets and analyzes these with classical regression and modern ML methods with particular focus on the impact of considering the multi-omics structure to the survival model predictability. However, this study includes cancer diseases only, and data sets are solely obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas. There remains a pressing need to look into more diverse and thus more heterogeneous data sets coming from multiple databases to benchmark the survival model performances from more diverse aspects.</p>
    <p>To this end, we develop a benchmarking design SurvBenchmark that considers multiple aspects with several evaluation metrics on a large collection of real-world health and biomedical data sets that guides right-censored data survival method selection and new method development.</p>

    <title>Survival Models and Their Evaluation</title>
    <p>Survival models can deal with data that explain censored observations with a bivariate outcome variable, consisting of âtimeâ (the minimum of âtime-to-eventâ and âcensoring timeâ) and âeventâ (binary: âclass 1â = âevent did occur,â âclass 0â = âotherwiseâ). There are two key features of such censored survival objects. First, the class label â0â means an observation is censored as its exact event time is not observed. Second, an additional tracking time measurement is included as part of the response.</p>
    <p>There are two main branches of survival models: classical statistical survival models, which include parametric, nonparametric, and semiparametric models, and modern ML survival models, which include ensemble-based methods and state-of-the-art deep learningâbased approaches. Both sets of models are briefly reviewed in the following sections.</p>

      <p>The CoxPH model [<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] is the most widely used classical survival model. CoxPH works on the hazard function, which is given by

Using the L1 penalty inÂ Equation (<xref rid="update1657157469458" ref-type="disp-formula">2</xref>) gives the Lasso Cox estimation and using the L2 penalty gives the Ridge Cox solution, respectively. If instead of a single regularization term, we consider a weighted average of the L1 and L2 penalty, we obtain the Elastic Net Cox model. One remarkable characteristic of the Lasso Cox model and the Elastic Net Cox model is that they can simultaneously perform feature selection and prediction, because some of the beta parameters can be penalized all the way to 0 when maximizing (2). Notice that the various types of regularization terms can also appear in the loss function of modern ML methods, which we introduce in the next subsection.</p>

      <title>Modern machine learning models</title>
      <p>There has been a growing interest in the use of modern ML methods in health as a result of their exceptional performance in many other areas, such as in finance [<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], environment [<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], and internet of things [<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Notable examples in health include the application of RSF on complex metabolomics data [<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] and SurvivalSVM to the survival of prostate cancer patients [<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Both approaches are survival analysis extensions to two widely used ML algorithms for binary classification, namely, random forest and SVM.</p>
      <p>SurvivalSVM was developed by Van Belle et al. [<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] for time-to-event data. It is a variant of the regularized partial log-likelihood function (2) above but has a different penalty term. In contrast to using <inline-formula><tex-math id="TM0009" notation="LaTeX">\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

\begin{document}
}{}$\lambda \mathop \sum \limits_{j\,\, = {\rm{\,\,}}1}^p \pi ( {{\beta _j}} )$\end{document}</tex-math></inline-formula>, SurvivalSVM uses penalized splines and then applies both, ranking constraints and regression constraints to the corresponding partial log-likelihood function. SVM with those constraints enables models for high-dimensional omics data to have more flexible structure, for example, additive (non)linear models. One distinct feature of SurvivalSVM is that it treats the prognostic problem as a ranking problem and therefore the estimation of the hazards is not directly incorporated in the model.</p>
      <p>RSF was first proposed by Ishwaran et al. [<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] as an extension of random forest to model censored survival data. Random forest [<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] is a nonparametric bagging-based ensemble learning method that adds variation in the training data sets by bootstrapping the data. Multiple models are generated based on many resamples. The ensemble prediction result is then an average of these multiple models or the result of a majority vote. The key components in our application of RSF are that we use Harrell's C-index to evaluate the survival tree instead of the mean square error for regression problems or confusion matrix for classification problems and that we use the log-rank score in each node as the stopping rule.</p>
      <p>Another ensemble-based approach is the boosting method, which contains multiple learners and sequentially gives more weight to weak learners to enhance predictability. For example, the Cox boosting model [<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] is developed based on Cox models with boosting being applied to the estimation of the regression parameter vector <inline-formula><tex-math id="TM0010" notation="LaTeX">\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

      <p>These models so far only focus on optimizing a single objective. Because survival data are time dependent, it is natural to have multiple tasks related to one or more time points of interest. This naturally leads to multitask learning, a method that deals with the need to predict for more than a single response variable, based on joint optimization of multiple likelihood functions corresponding to each task. The multitask logistic regression model (MTLR) by Yu et al. [<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] is a survival model for multiple time points, where for each, the task is to predict survival using a logistic regression model and the parameters from each model are estimated simultaneously in the maximization of the joint likelihood function.</p>
      <p>More recently, the ML and artificial intelligence communities refer to the methods described above as classical ML methods due to the emergence of deep learning (DL), a conceptual advancement based on neural networks (NN). In survival analysis, a number of DL survival models were developed such as Cox-nnet [<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], DeepSurv [<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], and DeepHit [<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The key concept here is having different loss functions that particularly target either the hazard or the survival probability for those neurons in hidden layers when building the DL architecture. High-dimensional complex biological information can be better represented with the application of those hidden layers [<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] and through relaxing the proportional hazard assumption.</p>

      <title>Feature selection methods applied to survival models</title>
      <p>The input features are fundamental to every statistical or machine learning model, and the survival model is no exception [<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Wrapper and filter [<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] are two feature selection methods that are widely used for not only regression and classification models but also survival models.</p>
      <p>The wrapper approach is a model-dependent method in which the performance of the model determines the selection of subsets of features. Stepwise feature selection approaches fall into this category since one feature is deemed to be included or deleted as the model's performance improves. Other more computational approach such as the genetic algorithm (GA) [<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], which was originally developed to solve an optimization problem, has been extended to use as a feature selection approach [<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. The main idea is to start with an initial set of features to then replace it with one that includes features from other parts of the data to optimize the classification accuracy based on a linear discrimination analysis model.</p>
      <p>The filtering approach, on the other hand, is a model-independent feature selection method that produces a subset of features without involving the models. This step often occurs outside and before building prediction models.Â Many of these strategies select features using hypothesis testingÂ statistics from a univariate study. With the advent of omics data in the 1990s, the statistics community embraced the development of differential expression (DE) analysis, which is a filter-type feature selection method for identifying promising genes/features using âparallel univariate strategiesâ based on linear modeling [<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>].</p>

      <title>Classical performance evaluation metric for survival data</title>
      <p>Classically, survival analysis is evaluated in 3 broad settings: the concordance index, the Brier score, and the time-dependent area under the curve (AUC). Similar to evaluating classification and regression models, metrics for calibration and discrimination are developed with incorporating censoring by applying rank-based methods or error-based methods together with a weighting scheme.</p>
      <sec id="h3content1658387186572">
        <title>C-index and its extension in survival analysis</title>
        <p>C-indices in survival analysis are concordance-based methods, where âconcordanceâ measures how close a prediction is to the truth. The original C-index for survival analysis was introduced by Frank E. Harrell [<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] as a time-independent performance measure. C-indices range from 0 to 1, where 1 means perfect performance and 0 means worst possible performance. If a model would not take into account any information from the data, that is, a random prediction is made, then the corresponding C-index would be around 0.5. For most clinical data sets, a C-index around or larger than 0.6 is considered an acceptable prediction. Harrell's C-index [<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] defines concordance by looking at ranks of pairs of subjects in the data (there are <italic toggle="yes">n</italic> choose 2 pairs for data with <italic toggle="yes">n</italic> subjects). Harrell's C-index further depends on the censoring distribution of the data, is motivated by Kendall's tau statistic, and is closely related to Somersâ D. When ranking the subjects, censored subjects are excluded, and pairs included in the formula are only those comparable, noncensored pairs. There are different versions of the C-index, where the differences come from the different ways that censored subjects are ranked.</p>
        <p>We will use the following 3 concordance indices: Begg's C-index, Uno's C-index, and GH C-index. First, Begg's C-index [<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] uses KM estimation to incorporate both censored and uncensored subjects by assigning different weight to them. Second, Uno et al. [<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] develop a new way to calculate the rank with the help of inverse probability of censoring weight (IPCW). Third, the GH C-index [<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] changes the concordance function into a probability function based on the Cox model estimation and then approximates its distribution, which is robust to censoring.</p>

        <title>Brier score</title>
        <p>The Brier score [<xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>, <xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] uses IPCW to handle censored subjects when measuring discrepancies between the estimated values and the actual values. This score can be considered a similar measure to the mean squared error (MSE) in regression models to some extent. Like the MSE, the Brier score takes a value greater than 0 that depends on the data, and the smaller the Brier score, the better. However, to have better interpretability, the integrated Brier score (IBS) is introduced, which also takes values between 0 and 1â it averages the loss over time in situations where there is no interest in a particular time point but performance is with regards to all time points as a whole.</p>

      <sec id="h3content1658387347931">
        <title>Time-dependent AUC</title>
        <p>The time-dependent AUC is inspired from binary classification model evaluations. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve is a classical model assessment plot that examines the relationship between the sensitivity and the false-positive rate. The area under the ROC curve is termed <italic toggle="yes">AUC</italic>. In survival analysis, event statuses are changing over the time, which requires a dynamic measurement to discriminate the predicted versus the actual. Chambless and Diao [<xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] were the first to propose a time-dependent AUC for survival analysis. They define the AUC(<italic toggle="yes">t</italic>) as the probability that a person with disease onset by time <italic toggle="yes">t</italic> has a higher score than the person with no event by time <italic toggle="yes">t</italic>. Changes of model predictability for different time points can therefore be visualized by time-dependent AUC curves, which allows people to compare long time versus short time predictability.</p>

      <p><underline>Evaluation metrics:</underline> We examine model performance metrics that can be broadly grouped into 4 categories and assess performance in terms of each methodâs flexibility, predictability, stability, and computational efficiency, detailed in <xref rid="sup6" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table S1</xref> and briefly summarized as follows:</p>
      <list list-type="roman-lower">
        <list-item>
          <p>We measure <italic toggle="yes">model flexibility</italic> by looking at whether a given method can handle different data modality, different level of sparsity, and represents multiple ways, including the type of data required (clinical, omics), type of input required (categorical, numerical), sparsity of the data allowed (yes, no), and prediction ability evaluation metrics allowed.</p>
        </list-item>
        <list-item>
          <p>We measure <italic toggle="yes">model predictability</italic> using 3 different metrics: C-index, time-dependent AUC, and Brier score. We apply 4 different modified versions of the C-index: Harrell's C-index, Begg's C-index, Uno's C-index, and GH C-index. For identification of different time points, we equally divided the survival time ranging from the first quartile to the third quartile into 15 time points for each data set, and therefore, we obtained 15 AUC values corresponding to each time point. As for the Brier score, we calculated the raw Brier score and the IBS. The raw Brier score is calculated by taking the sum of all Brier scores for all event times in the data set.</p>
        </list-item>
        <list-item>
          <p>We measure the <italic toggle="yes">model computational efficiency</italic> using both computational time and memory. Computational time is calculated using the âSys.timeâ function in R. Memory is calculated using the âRprofâ function in R, and the total memory used is summarized for each experiment.</p>
        </list-item>
        <list-item>
          <p>We measure <italic toggle="yes">model stability</italic> using model reproducibility and the standard deviation (SD) of model predictability metrics. Model reproducibility is defined as the proportion of successful runs among all the runs attempted. For each model predictability metric, we calculated its SD. We then ranked the values for all the methods for each data set from the most stable (smallest SD) to the least stable (largest SD).</p>

In this benchmark study, hyperparameter sets used in these methods are chosen to be the default set. All compared methods (<xref rid="sup6" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Data</xref>) and evaluation metrics (<xref rid="sup6" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table S1</xref>) are applied and evaluated on real-world data sets listed earlier. We apply 20 times (runs) repeated 5-fold cross validation using RStudio server (<ext-link xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/RRID:SCR_000432" ext-link-type="uri">RRID:SCR_000432</ext-link>) with 15 cores in parallel. For each run, the whole data is split into a training data set (80%) and a testing data set (20%) with each method trained using the training data set and values of evaluation metrics calculated using the testing data set. For methods with a feature selection step, a nested feature selection step is applied on those training folds within each 5-fold cross-validation procedure. Detail about the packages and parameters can be found in the <xref rid="sup6" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Data</xref>, and functions used to evaluate the methods are shown in <xref rid="sup6" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table S1</xref>.</p>

      <title>Comprehensive benchmarking design</title>
      <p>To comprehensively evaluate the strength and weakness of the survival analysis approaches, we select 20 representative methods from our extensive literature review and study their performance when applied to 16 diverse data sets. The performance of each method is measured against 11 metrics representing multiple aspects, including feasibility, predictability, stability, and computational efficiency. There are 3 key aspects of our comparison design SurvBenchmark, as depicted in FigureÂ <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>: (i) practical focus through applying the design to a broad range of data sets and by including a taxonomic methods system that evaluates multiple aspects, (ii) extensive comparison of methods from classical to state-of-the-art ML approaches, and (iii) comprehensive evaluation of the model performance with the utilization of a customizable weighting framework (Fig.Â <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1B</xref>). To apply this in practice, the following steps are needed:</p>
      <list list-type="order">
        <list-item>
          <p>Provide a âweight vectorâ of length <italic toggle="yes">q</italic>, where each weight represents the strength for each of the <italic toggle="yes">q</italic> practical aspects.

      <title>Practical consideration in assessing model performance</title>
      <p>Many comparison studies define method performance solely in terms of method predictability, with only a few studies taking into account computational time. Often the feasibility of the method is not properly considered or discussed. Practically, it is paramount that a method can be applied to the data at hand, based on both the flexibility (data modality, sparsity) and computational requirement.</p>
      <p>Given the diverse collection of data characteristics that is now available in the biomedical field, not all survival approaches are feasible to be applied to all data types, e.g., some classical Cox models (Fig.Â <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2A</xref>, from column 1 to 10; a blue box indicates âmethod not feasibleâ) cannot handle large <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> (features) small <italic toggle="yes">n</italic> (samples) datasets (such as GE-1) which is a distinct feature of any molecular (omics) study. Advanced feature selection methods together with ML survival models such as CoxBoost(DE) can only take numerical data as the input (purple box for input type, where model characteristics are coded using 0, 1, and 2 with questions defined as below. Is input type numeric only? Yes: numerical only. No: both numerical and categorical are OK. Is output type survival risk? Yes: survival risk. No: survival probability. Can the model handle <italic toggle="yes">n</italic>&lt; <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> situation? Yes: it can. No: it cannot. The other case: output is the rank of survival risk.).</p>

      <p>Next, we look at the computational aspect, and we notice that DL-based methods are computationally inefficient as highlighted by the star icon (Fig.Â <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2A</xref>). From the many rowwise stars, we observe that RSF (5 stars) and MTLR (5 stars) are not as computationally efficient as Cox-based approaches such as Lasso_Cox (1 star) and CoxBoost (0 stars).</p>
      <p>Lastly, a summary tabulating the readily applicability associated with each of the evaluation metrics for prediction is provided in FigureÂ <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2B</xref>. The results highlight that Begg's C-index and GH C-index are applicable only for Cox methods (red indicates readily applicability), that the integrated Brier score can be calculated for the Cox model and RSF (red), and that the Brier score cannot be calculated for SurvivalSVM (blue).</p>

      <title>Performance evaluation from multiple perspectives: no âone size fits allâ</title>
      <p>To achieve a comprehensive overview of different survival approaches, we assess method performance from multiple perspectives across a large collection of data sets. Here, we color the methods according to their performances for all 3 broad categories: model predictability, model stability, and computational efficiency (Fig.Â <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2C</xref> shows ranks of those methods where red means the best and blue the worst; similarly, Fig.Â <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2D</xref> shows Harrell's C-index values with red referring to high values and blue to small values). We find that no method performs optimally across all 3 categories, and there are various trade-offs among the categories.</p>
      <p>For model predictability, we use 7 different measures based on C-index, Brier score, and time-dependent AUC. Here, MTLR-based approaches perform evidently better than others, which is most apparent by looking at the performance results using C-index and time-dependent AUC. In order to further examine whether MTLR-based approaches have similar performance across all data sets, we show our examination on one specific criterion (the most popular Harrell's C-index; Mean_hc). In FigureÂ <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2D</xref>, we demonstrate that MTLR has optimal performance for all but 1 of the 6 clinical data sets with PBC having optimal performance for one of the clinical data sets. Variants of MTLR (MTLR(GA) and MTLR(DE)) outperformed MTLR when applied to any of the 10 omics data sets, suggesting the performance of the approaches depends on the type of data set.</p>
      <p>For computational efficiency as measured by computational time and memory usage, the best-performing methods are classical Cox-based models and CoxBoost. In particular, Cox, Cox_bw_AIC, and Cox_bw_BIC are the top 3 performing methods for computational time (Fig.Â <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2C</xref>). For model stability, we have 7 criteria, and they are based on calculating the SD of predictability metrics described above. Similar to the the computational efficiency performance, when using SD criteria, Cox, Cox_bw_AIC, and Cox_bw_BIC are also the top 3 performing methods in all but one criterion; the exception is the standard deviation of the Brier score (SD_bs), where DNNSurv ranks first, suggesting its ability to discriminate survival probabilities for different observations.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, the above observations demonstrate that no method performs optimally for all those categories. In practice, we recommend first completing a feasibility check first to draw conclusions on time constraints and to heighten awareness of the data types actually present and then explicitly deciding on the focus of the research, for example, that model predictability is the top priority. Our analysis supports the use of MTLR and its variants for both omics and clinical data sets when survival prediction is the key priority, despite the fact that these approaches are inefficient [<xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. However, Cox-based models are preferable when comparing the effect of variables, such as the treatment effect for clinical data sets, because of their efficiency and interpretability.</p>

      <title>Cox-based modern ML methods have similar prediction performance compared to classical Cox-based methods</title>
      <p>To understand the gain in model predictability from Cox-based modern ML methods (CoxBoost, Coxboost (GA)), we compare these models with classical Cox-based methods (Lasso_Cox, EN_Cox), which are used as a gold-standard method in many studies. Our results indicate that they have similar performance (Fig.Â <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>) across a large collection of data sets. For example, in the ANZ data, which is a representative clinical data set, we observe similar model predictability measured by both Harrell's C-index and Brier score. For GE_5, a representative data set of omics with large <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> small <italic toggle="yes">n</italic> data characteristics, the same conclusion is drawn. This suggests the performance of modern ML methods in complex health and clinical data is not as clear-cut as in some other domains.</p>

    <title>Conclusions</title>
    <p>This benchmark study comprehensively evaluated the relevance and usefulness of survival models in practice, where emphasis is on performance over diverse data sets. In our review, we assessed a broad variety of survival methods from classical CoxPH models to modern ML models. In this study, we did not survey the extensive tuning procedures for those survival approaches. The main reason is that, in practice, often the default hyperparameter sets are used. Therefore, we also decided to use the default sets in our study here. However, we note that applying targeted tuning methods for a particular data set may lead to different performances for the considered approaches. The findings of our systematic assessment will provide specific guidance for translational scientists and clinicians, as well as define areas of potential study in both survival methodology and benchmarking strategies.</p>
    <p>In recent years, there is a clear shift in how survival data are analyzed, from modeling directly the hazard function to building models directly on survival functions. Conceptually, modeling hazard functions is a good way to identify key risk factors related to various patientsâ risk levels. On the other hand, if our key criterion is to predict accurately survival, modeling survival probability directly improves predictability. Methods including MTLR, DNNSurv, and SurvivalSVM, which directly model the survival function, showed better performance in terms of model predictability, and this is consistent with what Yu et al. [<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] have commented on when discussing the performance of their proposed MTLR method.</p>
    <p>It is striking that MTLR shows remarkably high model predictability in our benchmark study. We now highlight technical advantages, disadvantages, and its applications. Numerous reasons could contribute to the better model prediction performance of the MTLR-based approaches. These include the 3 main reasons as discussed by Yu et al. [<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]: direct modeling of the survival function, simultaneous building of multiple logistic regression models, and dynamic modeling. Interestingly, the majority of extended MTLR models since 2011 are based on neural networks as researchers extend the concept to account for nonlinearity in data sets [<xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. To date, only a limited number of studies have applied MTLR in health using clinical data in HIV patients [<xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>] or on large omics data sets to predict patient survival in breast and kidney cancers [<xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Given its outstanding model predictability observed for most of the data sets in our study, we believe there is opportunity to use MTLR more widely for survival risk modeling in health contexts.</p>
    <p>Model predictability is one of the key metrics to assess survival studies, with Harrell's C-index being currently the most popular. As this kind of ranking-based concordance measurement is suitable to evaluate predicted outcomes with censored data, various concordance indices are developed using different methods to handle censoring such as Uno's C-index using IPCW. Besides concordance indices, other predictability metrics such as the time-dependent AUC, which applies a similar idea as the AUC in binary classification but divides the whole time interval into multiple time points, are also adopted in some survival studies [<xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Given that model predictability could be measured by multiple types of indices, we suggest that hybrid evaluation metrics should be applied in practice to provide relatively comprehensive assessments for the fitted model.</p>
    <p>While many survival approaches are applicable to both clinical and omics data, there are a number of recently developed approaches that are specifically tailored for high-dimensional omics data, such as CoxBoost. The rationale behind developing data-specific methods is to better capture the distinct data characteristics in either the clinical or omics studies. Clinical data usually include mixed-modality variables and large sample sizes but have large <italic toggle="yes">n</italic> (observations) and small <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> (features). In contrast, omics data naturally come with a large collection of molecular features and with small <italic toggle="yes">n</italic> but their data type is homogeneous. When it comes to various real-world data sets, performances are also affected by many other aspects besides data type (clinical, omics) such as data modality, and therefore, it is challenging to directly examine whether those tailored methods indeed improve the performance. Further examination of the aspects that affect model predictability can be found in <xref rid="sup6" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table S2</xref>.</p>
    <p>Deep learningâbased methods failed for some data sets on some cross-validation runs. Taking the method DNNSurv as an example, among all 100 runs, DNNSurv had a 100% completion rate for 5 out of the 12 applicable data sets (<xref rid="sup6" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. S2</xref>) only. For the remaining 7 data sets, completion rate was around 80% and as low as 63% for the Melanoma_itraq data. This instability is likely due to tuning parameter sensitivity when the sample size is small [<xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. All failed iterations are not recorded when generating the results.</p>
