    <abstract>
      <p>The fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2) locus has been consistently identified as a breast cancer risk locus in independent genome-wide association studies. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying FGFR2-mediated risk are still unknown. Using model systems we show that FGFR2-regulated genes are preferentially linked to breast cancer risk loci in expression quantitative trait loci analysis, supporting the concept that risk genes cluster in pathways. Using a network derived from 2,000 transcriptional profiles we identify SPDEF, ERα, FOXA1, GATA3 and PTTG1 as master regulators of fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 signalling, and show that ERα occupancy responds to fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 signalling. Our results indicate that ERα, FOXA1 and GATA3 contribute to the regulation of breast cancer susceptibility genes, which is consistent with the effects of anti-oestrogen treatment in breast cancer prevention, and suggest that fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 signalling has an important role in mediating breast cancer risk.</p>

<body>
  <p>Nearly 70 loci show significant association with breast cancer risk in genome-wide association studies (GWAS)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. However, in most cases we do not yet understand how these loci contribute to the risk of developing cancer. A locus within an intron of the <italic>FGFR2</italic> (fibroblast growth factor receptor 2) gene is consistently the most strongly associated with risk<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. Here we take a systems biology approach to examine the regulatory network in breast cancer, how it is perturbed by FGFR2 signalling and how the identified network and its master regulators relate to disease risk.</p>
  <p>The highly significant association of the <italic>FGFR2</italic> locus with breast cancer risk<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref> has been replicated in multiple studies in Europeans<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>, Asians and African-Americans<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. The risk is for ER+ disease<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>. The known role of FGFR2 signalling, the occurrence of <italic>FGFR2</italic> gene amplification in breast cancer and the location of the risk SNPs (single-nucleotide polymorphism) within its intron, make FGFR2 a plausible mediator of risk. Functional studies suggest that the risk allele increases <italic>FGFR2</italic> gene expression<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>, most likely in mammary epithelial cells, but recent genotype-expression correlations in breast tumours have failed to confirm an association of the risk SNPs either with expression of <italic>FGFR2</italic> (refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>) or with other nearby potential target genes (K.B.M., unpublished observation). However, studies in the mouse have shown that FGFR2 has an important role in mammary development<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref> and in maintenance of breast tumour initiating cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>, consistent with a role for FGFR2 in conferring risk.</p>
  <p>FGFR2 signalling cascades have been studied in some detail<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>, but less is known about the resulting changes in gene expression and how different risk genotypes might affect this response. Gene expression changes are ultimately mediated by the activity of transcription factors (TFs). In a number of systems, such as embryonic stem cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref> or glioblastoma<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>, it has been demonstrated that a small number of TFs act as master regulators (MRs) that co-ordinate cellular behaviour. MRs can be identified by deriving TF-centric regulatory networks using algorithms such as ARACNe<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>, where each TF in the network is connected to a set of genes that it directly regulates (referred to as a ‘regulon’). Enrichment of a relevant gene signature in each of the regulons can point to the TFs acting as MRs of the response or phenotype (master regulator analysis, MRA)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>.</p>
  <p>Here we describe a network-based strategy to uncover the molecular mechanism underlying breast cancer risk. We identify the TFs acting as MR of the FGFR2 response and demonstrate that FGFR2-responsive genes and genes in the regulons of the MRs are linked to GWAS hits. Our results suggest that the risk-associated with altered FGFR2 signalling is due to altered activity of the ERα-associated transcriptional network (TN) that includes SPDEF and we provide evidence that the FGFR2 signalling pathway is an important contributor to ER+ disease risk.</p>

      <title>Deriving an FGFR2-associated gene expression signature</title>
      <p>To examine the effects of FGFR2 signalling in breast cancer, we established three model systems for FGFR2 signalling. As the <italic>FGFR2</italic> locus primarily confers risk of ER+ disease, we chose to study the ER-dependent breast cancer cell line MCF-7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>). First, we stimulated endogenous FGFRs (FGFR1b and FGFR2b) with FGF10 (Exp1). FGF10 has higher affinity for FGFR2b, but can also signal through FGFR1b<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. Second, we used a system where the FGFR2-kinase domain is linked to a dimerization domain (iF2 construct)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref> and the kinase is activated artificially by adding the small molecule AP20187 (Exp2). Third, we overexpressed the full-length FGFR2b from a tetracycline-inducible expression vector and again activated the receptor using FGF10 (Exp3). In each experiment, MCF-7 cells were synchronised by oestrogen starvation, before adding minimal levels of estradiol in conjunction with the relevant FGFR stimulus (Methods). <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figs S1–S3</xref> summarize the experimental design and results. Gene expression was examined at multiple time points and the software limma was used to call differentially expressed genes (DEGs) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Methods</xref>). Principal component analysis demonstrated low experimental variation and the specificity of the FGFR response (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figs S1–S3</xref>). The gene expression response to estradiol increased from 6 to 24 h. In contrast, the FGF10 response in Exp1 and 3 was greatest after 6 h. In Exp2, where AP20187 was used to stimulate FGFR2, the response continued to increase with time. Each estradiol plus FGFR2 stimulation was compared with estradiol stimulation alone, ensuring that the derived DEG list is FGFR2 specific. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1b</xref> summarizes the number of DEG called in each of the experiments (Exp1–3). A full list of DEG derived from each experiment is available in the R package <italic>Fletcher2013a</italic>.</p>
      <p>The microarray data were confirmed in independent biological replicates by performing quantitative RT–PCR for a number of selected genes. <italic>IL8</italic> is one of the most strongly induced genes and we demonstrate that increased <italic>IL8</italic> mRNA expression is detected similarly by two microarray probes and by RT–PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c,d</xref>). Furthermore, we find that IL8 secretion increased after FGF10 stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1e</xref>). Both increased expression and secretion were blocked by the FGFR kinase inhibitor PD173074, confirming that the effect is FGFR specific.</p>

    <sec disp-level="2">
      <title>FGFR2-regulated genes are linked to breast cancer risk loci</title>
      <p>As the <italic>FGFR2</italic> locus is strongly associated with breast cancer risk, we wished to examine whether FGFR2-regulated genes are risk genes themselves. To allow us to map risk SNPs to genes, we combined variant set enrichment analysis (VSE)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref> with expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analysis. eQTL are polymorphisms associated with changes in gene expression. Our analysis examined whether or not breast cancer risk SNPs, and SNPs in linkage disequilibrium (LD) with these, can act as eQTL for particular groups of genes, such as FGFR2-responsive genes. This cis-eQTL/VSE analysis was carried out between breast cancer risk SNPs and the FGFR2 gene signatures (Exp1–3). First, we repeated the VSE analysis with the currently reported list of 51 independent breast cancer GWAS hits ((ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>) and GWAS catalogue). Rather than examining an effect of the tagging SNP at each GWAS locus, this method defines an associated variant set (AVS) of SNPs in linkage with each tagging SNP (<italic>D</italic>′=0.99, LOD &gt;3; similar results were obtained with using <italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup> &gt;.8 in the AVS selection) and then tests whether this set is associated with chromatin features (Methods). As previously reported<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>, we found that FOXA1- and ESR1-binding sites are significantly enriched in the breast cancer AVS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref>). Next we carried out a cis-eQTL analysis between the risk AVS and potential target genes, using gene expression profiles and genotype data from 997 breast cancer samples (METABRIC discovery data set<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>) in 400 kb windows around each SNP cluster. This analysis found that among the genes linked to the risk AVS, there was a significant enrichment for FGFR2-responsive genes (Exp1–3: E2+FGF10, E2+AP20187, Tet+E2+FGF10, each compared with E2 treatment alone; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c</xref>), but not for oestrogen responsive genes (E2 and Tet+E2, each compared with vehicle treatment, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref>). (In this system, the E2 response compares resting and cycling cells and is likely to include many genes associated with this change in the cell cycle.) A cis-eQTL analysis of the <italic>FGFR2</italic> and <italic>E2</italic> gene signatures with AVS for prostate or colorectal cancer GWAS and bone mineral density (BMD) did not shown any significant associations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1d–f</xref>). In conclusion, we provide evidence that breast cancer risk SNPs are preferentially linked to genes that, on a background of oestrogen stimulation, are responsive to FGFR2 signalling.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec disp-level="2">
      <title>Regulatory network derived from gene expression profiles</title>
      <p>To better understand the pathways involved in the FGFR2 signalling response, we constructed a regulatory network for breast cancer based on the METABRIC data set<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref> (computational pipeline summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref>). METABRIC consists of a discovery and a validation cohort of 997 and 995 breast tumour samples each, for which gene expression data are available (=a: gene expression data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref>). The data were normalized and probes with low variation removed from the analysis (b: filtered gene expression data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref>). The TN<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref> was then derived by computing the mutual information (MI) between annotated TFs (<italic>n</italic>=1,388 probes) and all potential targets (<italic>n</italic>=20 K probes after filtering) in each cohort (=c in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref>) (Methods). In this network, each TF has been assigned a list of candidate regulated genes referred to as its regulon. In the TN, each target can be linked to multiple TFs and regulation can occur as a result of both direct (TF<sub>1</sub>–target) and indirect interactions (TF<sub>1</sub>–TF<sub>2</sub>–target)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. We therefore applied the data processing inequality (DPI) (Methods), which removes the weakest interaction in any triangle of two TFs and a target gene, thus preserving the dominant TF-target pairs, resulting in the filtered TN (=d in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref>). The filtered TN has less complexity and highlights the most significant interactions.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec disp-level="2">
      <title>Master regulators of FGFR2 signalling</title>
      <p>Next, we used MRA to identify the MRs of FGFR2 signalling by testing for significant enrichment of FGFR2-responsive genes (Exp1–3) in each regulon. We first ranked regulons based on the enrichment score obtained on the unfiltered TN and found good agreement between Exp1–3, both for the total set of regulons as well as the top 50 regulons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4</xref>), and also between cohort I and II (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figs S4–S6</xref>), suggesting that our three model systems identify similar sets of regulated genes following FGFR2 signalling. Then, to define a smaller set of functionally important MRs, we applied the MRA to the filtered TN and found that 20 regulons are significantly enriched across the two breast cancer cohorts in at least one experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a</xref>). The agreement between the two cohorts was very high. When a DPI tolerance of 0.05 is allowed, the regulons of five MRs were enriched in both cohorts in all three experimental systems (a DPI tolerance from 0.01 to 0.05 gives the same consensus). These were SPDEF, ESR1 and its co-factors FOXA1 and GATA3, and PTTG1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5b</xref>). None of the identified regulons were significantly enriched using a random gene set of comparable size. When carrying out the MRA on a network derived for a completely independent breast cancer data set (TCGA breast cancer data set)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>, regulons for four of the five MRs (SPDEF, ERα, FOXA1 and GATA3) were again found to be enriched in FGFR2-responsive genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S7</xref>). We also computed a filtered TN for 144 normal breast tissue samples from METABRIC patients. In this network, three of the five MRs (SPDEF, GATA3 and FOXA1) were enriched, and this enrichment was found in all three experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5b</xref>). Interestingly, ESR1 and PTTG1 regulons are not enriched, possibly reflecting the fact that in normal breast the majority of epithelial cells are ER−, non-dividing cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. GATA3 and FOXA1 have been postulated to function upstream of ER and are required early in mammary development<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref> and might therefore be more easily detected in the network for normal tissue. We also derived a filtered TN for a gene expression data set from T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (T-ALL)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref> and found that the PTTG1 regulon in this network was enriched for two of the three FGFR2 gene signatures (Exp2 and Exp3). The enrichment for PTTG1 in two distinct cancer tissues, but not in normal breast tissue, may indicate a large number of proliferation-related (and not breast cancer-specific) genes in the PTTG1 regulon. Our analysis of the extended MR list supports this idea (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S8</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Methods</xref>). An association of PTTG1 with proliferation was confirmed by carrying out the MRA using a proliferation-based gene signature, termed meta-PCNA<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>, on both cohort I and II of the METABRIC data. The most strongly enriched regulon in both cohorts is that of PTTG1, while none of the other MR regulons are enriched (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5c</xref> depicts the regulons of the five MRs of the FGFR2 response in our breast cancer gene expression network, highlighting FGFR2-responsive genes (purple shading). Interestingly, transcription of <italic>SPDEF</italic> was not perturbed by FGFR2, but many of its target genes were (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5c</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S9</xref>), suggesting that the activity of this TF is regulated at the protein, rather than the transcriptional level. The identification of SPDEF highlights the increased power of the MRA over simple differential expression-based approaches.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec disp-level="2">
      <title>Experimental confirmation of computationally defined regulons</title>
      <p>To validate the identified regulons, we examined whether there was enrichment of TF binding near transcription start sites (TSS) of genes found in the regulons of a particular MR. This validation was carried out for MRs whose regulons were enriched in the cancer and normal breast tissue, but not in T-ALL: ESR1, FOXA1, GATA3 and SPDEF. Bioinformatic analysis using position weight matrices (PWM, consensus binding motifs) from Transfac showed a strong enrichment of binding motifs for ESR1, FOXA1 and GATA3 in each of their identified regulons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6a</xref>). Next, we examined actual TF binding and carried out triplicate chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-seq experiments for ERα and SPDEF in MCF-7 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S10</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Tables S2, S3</xref> for full QC). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6b</xref> shows that SPDEF binding is strongly enriched near the promoters of its own regulon. Interestingly, these promoters are also enriched for GATA3, ESR1 and FOXA1 binding. <italic>De novo</italic> motif finding within these data sets reveals PWMs that are very similar to those previously reported<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>. Enrichment of binding by these four TFs in each other’s regulons is widespread (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S11</xref>), suggesting that these MRs function co-operatively to regulate sets of genes.</p>
      <p>The target genes for ERα, GATA3 and FOXA1 in MCF-7 cells are already well defined<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref> and our data fit well with these results (see above). As validation of the SPDEF and PTTG1 regulons, we carried out small interfering RNA (siRNA) knock down experiments for these TFs (previously published ESR1 data are included as positive control) to confirm that the responsive gene sets are indeed enriched in the relevant regulons. For each of these three putative MRs we find that its own regulon was significantly enriched (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S4</xref>). Further evidence for cross-regulation between the MRs and all five MR regulons was obtained by gene set enrichment analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S12</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Methods</xref>). The DEG list after PTTG1 knock down was enriched for genes of the PTTG1 regulon as well as additional proliferation-related regulons (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary information</xref>, MR overlap and synergy analysis). There is remarkable overlap between the MRs perturbed after siPTTG1 treatment and MRs enriched with the proliferation-based meta-PCNA signature<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref> in both cohorts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>). Our knock-down experiments provide further experimental support for the computationally derived network structure.</p>
      <p>Finally, to demonstrate the link between the identified MRs and FGFR2 signalling, we examined ERα occupancy at FGFR2-responsive genes using ChIP. For the binding sites tested here, ERα occupancy is induced by estradiol, but importantly this occupancy is increased by additional treatment with FGF10 and reversed by the FGFR kinase inhibitor PD173074 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6c–f</xref>). These results were obtained for the known ER-induced genes <italic>MYC</italic> and <italic>GREB</italic>, the ER-repressed gene <italic>EGR2</italic> and for <italic>TOX3</italic>, a likely breast cancer risk gene, which does not respond to estradiol, but is induced by FGF10. Our results show that FGF10 signalling can alter ERα occupancy at FGFR2-responsive genes.</p>

      <title>Transcriptional modules of MRs are highly overlapping</title>
      <p>To be able to identify MRs from our gene expression network, we used the DPI filter in our bioinformatics pipeline to remove overlap between regulons. However, in a real cellular setting co-operating TFs regulate overlapping sets of genes, with the expression of individual genes being affected by the activity of multiple TFs. We therefore examined the overlap of all TF regulons (based on the unfiltered TN in cohort I) by unsupervised clustering. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Figure 7a</xref> shows the Jaccard coefficient (JC) for overlap between regulons. Only a few, very highly connected TF clusters exist and the FGFR2 response is mediated by the largest cluster (centred on regulon 250 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7a</xref>). An enlargement of these data for the five MRs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7b</xref>) highlights the strong overlap between the ERα network of TFs (ESR1, GATA3 and FOXA1) and SPDEF and a smaller overlap with the PTTG1 regulon. The regulons most highly enriched for the FGFR2 signatures strongly overlap with those enriched for the estradiol signatures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7a,b</xref>), but both E2 and FGFR2 unique genes exist, in keeping with our finding that the two responses peak at different times (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figs S1a–S3a</xref>) and differ in their association with risk genes. We used RedeR<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref> to visualize the overlap between different TF regulons in the unfiltered TN in a network graph. The edges within this network represent inter-regulon overlaps with a JC &gt;0.4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7c</xref>). The MRs ESR1, FOXA1 and GATA3 cluster very closely and the newly identified MR SPDEF is also tightly connected to this central cluster. (See <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S13</xref> for a fully annotated network.) The PTTG1 regulon, which is associated with both breast cancer and T-ALL, maps to a different part of the network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7c</xref>). It is closely linked to E2F2 and FOXM1, which are part of the extended MR list and have previously been linked to control of proliferation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>. The close link between these regulons was confirmed in our siRNA analysis, where the E2F2 and FOXM1 regulons were significantly perturbed by siRNA against PTTG1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S4</xref>). The relationship between clusters of TFs was explored using the previously described synergy and shadowing analyses<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S14</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Methods</xref>). Our results are consistent with identification of a central ER-related MR cluster and the presence of a second cluster that is likely to be related to changes in cell proliferation.</p>

      <title>Risk SNPs link to FGFR2-responsive genes in MR regulons</title>
      <p>Having defined the regulons, we investigated how risk SNPs are distributed among them and carried out a cis-eQTL analysis between the risk SNP list (AVS) and the genes in the regulons for each of the MRs. Our analysis showed a statistically significant enrichment for genes in the ESR1, GATA3 and FOXA1 regulons with breast cancer risk SNPs but not prostate, colon or BMD risk SNPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8a</xref>). This is the first report of a statistically significant link of GATA3 with risk gene expression. Within each regulon, we found that only the FGFR2-responsive genes were associated with risk (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8b,c</xref>). However, we note that all FGFR2 responses were measured on a background of oestrogen signalling, so that ER may still play a critical role, but in conjunction with FGFR2. As an additional control, we examined whether risk is associated with ER status and only observed significant enrichment when the regulons were derived for ER+, but not ER− tumours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8d,e</xref>), fully in keeping with the central role for ER that we postulate.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, we demonstrate that at least three of the identified MRs, ESR1, GATA3 and FOXA1 are linked to risk gene expression. This association with risk is restricted to the FGFR2-responsive genes in each regulon, suggesting that FGFR2 activity is an important determinant of ER+ breast cancer risk.</p>

    <title>Discussion</title>
    <p>Although the number of known breast cancer risk loci is increasing rapidly, we still have little knowledge of the cellular pathways that are perturbed in cancer predisposition. Here we take a systems biology approach to gain insight into pathways and networks associated with breast cancer susceptibility. We focus on FGFR2, the most significant risk locus in multiple independent GWAS<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. Using eQTL analysis, we show that breast cancer risk SNPs are preferentially linked to genes affected by FGFR2 signalling, supporting the idea that breast cancer risk SNPs cluster in pathways, as has been shown for metabolic diseases<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>. Our findings support other evidence that risk SNPs in the intron of <italic>FGFR2</italic> mediate their effect through altering expression of the <italic>FGFR2</italic> gene. We identify MRs of the FGFR2 signalling response and find a central role for the ERα TN, including ESR1, FOXA1 and GATA3. In addition to these known factors, we identify SPDEF as a novel co-regulator of the ERα network. Our analysis separates this network from MRs related to proliferation changes, especially PTTG1, which is also known as securin and specifically interacts with p53 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>).</p>
    <p>Several lines of evidence support the identification of these five MRs and regulons. The genes whose expression is altered by FGFR2 signalling were consistent across the three methods used to activate FGFR2. The gene expression networks identified from the METABRIC samples, and the MRs identified by subsequent analysis, were again consistent across the methods of FGFR2 activation and between the discovery and validation cohorts. Four of the five MRs consistently identified from the breast cancer signalling networks were absent from a similar analysis using networks obtained from another malignancy, T-ALL, as a control. The same four MRs were also identified when a parallel analysis was carried out on the TCGA breast cancer data set. Finally, the unfiltered TN for breast cancer groups together many TFs that have previously been linked to ERα activity, such as GATA3 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>), FOXA1 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>) and XBP<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>. The striking overlap of the network defined by our analysis with previously described regulatory circuits<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref> supports the validity of our approach.</p>
    <p>Further support for the importance of these MRs comes from comparison with somatic alterations in breast cancer<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. Two of the five MRs of the FGFR2 response, <italic>FOXA1</italic> and <italic>GATA3</italic>, are frequently mutated in breast tumours<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>, suggesting that pathways mediating susceptibility overlap with those perturbed during cancer progression.</p>
    <p>The identification of the ERα-network, which has long been known to be critical to mammary gland development and cancer progression, as central mediator of the FGFR2 response is consistent with the epidemiological findings that the FGFR2 risk is restricted to ER+ disease<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. Furthermore, the identification of FOXA1 and GATA3 as TFs associated with the expression of breast cancer risk genes is consistent with functional analysis of risk loci available to date. FOXA1 has been confirmed as a mediator of risk at the <italic>TOX3</italic> gene<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref> and GATA3 binds to one of the causative SNPs at the <italic>CCND1</italic> risk locus<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>.</p>
    <p>SPDEF is of interest as a MR of the FGFR2 response and as a novel cofactor of the ERα-network, as validated by both our network and ChIP-seq analysis. SPDEF is normally expressed in a range of epithelial cell types, especially in hormone-regulated tissues<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>, and has previously been associated with cancer: The SPDEF protein is overexpressed in breast cancer cells compared with normal tissue<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>, but is often lost in high grade, invasive tumours<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>. SPDEF was originally identified as a co-factor of AR<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref> and acts to suppress metastasis in prostate tumour models <italic>in vivo</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>. Similarly, SPDEF overexpression in breast cancer cell lines also results in an inhibition of invasion, migration and growth<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>.</p>
    <p>Using a network approach has allowed us to distinguish two key components of the FGFR2 response: the ERα-related MRs (ESR1, FOXA1, GATA3 and SPDEF) and a proliferation-related cluster around PTTG1. These results improve on analyses based on differential gene expression, which primarily reflect increased proliferation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>. By identifying specific MRs we also improve on GO-term enrichment-based methods that identify very broad biological categories<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>. Our approach of testing MR regulons for association with risk SNP clusters should be widely applicable to the follow-up of other GWAS.</p>
    <p>Although consistently the ‘top hit’ in GWAS, FGFR2 is merely a contributor to a much larger picture of polygenic susceptibility. A large amount of this susceptibility remains unexplained, the so-called ‘missing heritability’. Our finding that SNPs cluster in pathways suggests that FGFR2-regulated gene loci near SNPs that may not have reached genome-wide significance may also be functional and may account for some of this missing heritability.</p>
    <p>Our results are also relevant to prevention. The risk variant in <italic>FGFR2</italic> has an estimated population attributable fraction of 19%, which implies that restoring FGFR2 signalling to the wild-type state in the population could in principle reduce breast cancer incidence by that amount. The network approach revealed ERα as a mediator of the FGFR2 effect, a finding fully consistent with the successful use of anti-estrogens in prevention. However, our findings strongly suggest that FGFR2 has a role in risk beyond that of ERα. If so, the FGFR2 pathway may be an additional target for both therapy and prevention<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>.</p>

      <title>Variant set enrichment</title>
      <p>The VSE analysis was carried out as described by Cowper-Sal lari <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref> Briefly, the VSE method tests enrichment of the AVS for a particular trait in a genomic annotation. Although the first represents clusters of risk-associated and linked SNPs, the second corresponds to chromosomal coordinates to which a particular property or function has been attributed. The enrichment statistics assesses the overlap between these clusters and the genomic annotation, a quantity referred to as the mapping tally. This corresponds to the number of SNP clusters in the AVS that contain at least one linked SNP that overlaps the genomic annotation. The enrichment score is then obtained by comparing the observed mapping tally to a null distribution based on random permutations of the AVS (that is, matched random variant sets—MRVS). All risk-associated SNPs were obtained from the GWAS catalogue (accessed January 2013; http:/ <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.genome.gov/gwastudies/">www.genome.gov/gwastudies/</ext-link>).

      <title>Extended variant set enrichment</title>
      <p>The VSE method provides a robust framework to cope with the heterogeneous structure of haplotype blocks, and has been designed to test enrichment in cistromes and epigenomes. In order to extend the variant set enrichment to gene loci here we applied an additional step using expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs). The rationale of this extended approach is that the simple overlap between a given cluster of SNPs and a particular gene locus does not imply functional association with gene expression. Therefore, the VSE analysis was conditioned to a cis-eQTL validation. We assessed cis eQTLs using METABRIC data<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref> by applying a multivariate linear model, placing on the right hand side of the model the genotypes as predictors (representing a given cluster of risk-associated and linked SNPs that have been genotyped in METABRIC, with the assumption of additive effect), and in the left hand side the gene expression as response variable (representing a given gene set or regulon, assuming a Gaussian distribution). Cis-eQTL analysis was carried out only for genes 200 kb up- or downstream from a particular cluster. Provided that HapMap linkage disequilibrium data have been mapped for markers up to 200 kb apart, the effective cis-eQTL analysis extended up to 400 kb radius around the AVS. The overall exact <italic>P-</italic>value for the AVS, conditioned to the cis-eQTL validation, was obtained from the null distribution derived from 1,000 MRVS as described by Cowper-Sal lari <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref> Only enrichment scores satisfying the Bonferroni-corrected threshold (<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.001) are reported as significant.

DNA sequences were retrieved using the Genome Browser<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56">56</xref> (assembly NCBI36/hg18) and motif searching was performed using the command line version of MEME 4.8.1 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57">57</xref>). Motifs between 9 and 15 bases were searched from both strands assuming one binding site per sequence model (mod=oops). Similar motifs were also obtained from peak summits ranked 1–1,000 and zero or one binding site per sequence model (mod=zoops).</p>
      <p>Further detail on the statistical analysis and the source code that reproduces the statistical analysis on the ChIP-Seq data is available in the R package <italic>Fletcher2013b.</italic> This also includes the analysis of siRNA data and the analysis of the meta-PCNA signature.</p>

Box plots in each panel show the normalized null distributions (box: 1st–3rd quartiles; bars: extremes). Black diamonds show the corresponding VSE scores. Red diamonds highlight mapping tallies that satisfy a Bonferroni-corrected threshold for significance (<italic>P</italic>&lt;1e-4). <italic>P-</italic>values are based on null distributions from 1,000 MRVSs. Binary matrices show clusters of risk-associated and linked SNPs with at least one SNP mapping to the genomic annotations and validated by cis-eQTL analysis. The bottom row of numbers indicates the number of linked SNPs in each SNP cluster. The mapping tally shows the number of clusters per annotation. Rows highlighted in dark grey show statistically significant enrichment. The cis-eQTL analysis extends the original VSE method by conditioning the mapping tallies to functional links. Non-disjoint AVSs with risk-associated SNPs in LD were merged in order to avoid inflated mapping tallies.</p>
