      <title>Abstract</title>
      <p>Extracellular vesicle (EV) research increasingly demands for quantitative characterisation at the single vesicle level to address heterogeneity and complexity of EV subpopulations. Emerging, commercialised technologies for single EV analysis based on, for example, imaging flow cytometry or imaging after capture on chips generally require dedicated instrumentation and proprietary software not readily accessible to every lab. This limits their implementation for routine EV characterisation in the rapidly growing EV field. We and others have shown that single vesicles can be detected as light diffraction limited fluorescent spots using standard confocal and widefield fluorescence microscopes. Advancing this simple strategy into a process for routine EV quantitation, we developed ‘EVAnalyzer’, an ImageJ/Fiji (Fiji is just ImageJ) plugin for automated, quantitative single vesicle analysis from imaging data. Using EVAnalyzer, we established a robust protocol for capture, (immuno‐)labelling and fluorescent imaging of EVs. To exemplify the application scope, the process was optimised and systematically tested for <italic toggle="yes">(i)</italic> quantification of EV subpopulations, <italic toggle="yes">(ii)</italic> validation of EV labelling reagents, <italic toggle="yes">(iii) in situ</italic> determination of antibody specificity, sensitivity and species cross‐reactivity for EV markers and <italic toggle="yes">(iv)</italic> optimisation of genetic EV engineering. Additionally, we show that the process can be applied to synthetic nanoparticles, allowing to determine siRNA encapsulation efficiencies of lipid‐based nanoparticles (LNPs) and protein loading of SiO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles. EVAnalyzer further provides a pipeline for automated quantification of cell uptake at the single cell–single vesicle level, thereby enabling high content EV cell uptake assays and plate‐based screens. Notably, the entire procedure from sample preparation to the final data output is entirely based on standard reagents, materials, laboratory equipment and open access software. In summary, we show that EVAnalyzer enables rigorous characterisation of EVs with generally accessible tools. Since we further provide the plugin as open‐source code, we expect EVAnalyzer to not only be a resource of immediate impact, but an open innovation platform for the EV and nanoparticle research communities.</p>

    <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
    <p>The biology of extracellular vesicles (EVs) is inherently linked to their complexity and heterogeneity at the single vesicle level (Mizenko et al., <xref rid="jev212282-bib-0038" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>; Willms et al., <xref rid="jev212282-bib-0062" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). Current understanding suggests that cells not only secrete different classes of vesicles through distinct biogenesis pathways, but that even specific EV subtypes such as exosomes, derived from the same cell type through the same canonical biogenesis pathway, comprise a spectrum of individual vesicles when zooming in on the molecular level (Bordanaba‐Florit et al., <xref rid="jev212282-bib-0004" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>). Protein machineries such as the ESCRT complexes (Colombo et al., <xref rid="jev212282-bib-0007" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Juan &amp; Fürthauer, <xref rid="jev212282-bib-0026" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>) control the sorting of molecules into each individual vesicle. The repertoire of EV cargoes not only varies between cell types but dynamically changes with the state of the producing cell (Willms et al., <xref rid="jev212282-bib-0062" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). This is exemplified in a recent study that made use of microfluidics to capture single cells, combined with Total Internal Reflection Microscopy (TIRF) for imaging of the vesicles after immunostaining (Nikoloff et al., <xref rid="jev212282-bib-0041" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>). This revealed that even an individual cell secretes a remarkably heterogeneous population of different vesicles under the same conditions and within a short time frame–illustrating the critical importance of quantitative information at the single vesicle level. The EV field is still young and resolving EV mechanisms to the molecular level will require a deepened understanding of single vesicle populations, beyond characterisation by classical ensemble averaging methods.</p>
    <p>One possible solution for single vesicle visualisation and quantification is fluorescence microscopy. Tracking individual fluorescent vesicles by imaging was first reported by Tian et al. (<xref rid="jev212282-bib-0055" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>) in a study which relied on lipophilic dyes to monitor EV (‘exosome’) uptake into live cells. We later used genetic reporters for unambiguous labelling of CD63‐positive vesicles with fluorescent protein (FP) tags for resolving their cell uptake routes. This revealed that tetraspanin‐FP labelling stoichiometries are sufficient for single vesicle detection on confocal microscopes, thereby enabling single vesicle quantification both in vitro as well as in live and fixed cells (Corso et al., <xref rid="jev212282-bib-0008" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>; Heusermann et al., <xref rid="jev212282-bib-0024" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Following this early work, fluorescence imaging of single vesicles, both by tetraspanin‐reporters as well as immunolabelling, has been used increasingly in the field to track single EVs in cellular and in vivo models (e.g., Riazanski et al., <xref rid="jev212282-bib-0044" ref-type="bibr">2022</xref>; Strohmeier et al., <xref rid="jev212282-bib-0049" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>; Sung et al., <xref rid="jev212282-bib-0052" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>; Verweij et al., <xref rid="jev212282-bib-0058" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>) as well as to quantify EV subpopulations. For example, Burbidge <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> reported on centrifugation mediated immobilisation of EVs on microscope slides (‘spinoculation’) to characterise EV subpopulations after immunolabelling and high‐resolution wide field deconvolution microscopy with image analysis by the Imaris software (Burbidge et al., <xref rid="jev212282-bib-0005" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). Hartjes <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>. described 3D confocal imaging of lipid‐dye labelled EVs after embedding and immunostaining within a polyacrylamide gel. This assay potentially allows a quasi‐solution measurement of EVs, however, a systematic validation as well as testing for more diverse samples is still required (Hartjes et al., <xref rid="jev212282-bib-0023" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). Similar strategies have been reported elsewhere using more advanced technologies such as TIRF microscopy (Han et al., <xref rid="jev212282-bib-0021" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>; Martín‐Cófreces et al., <xref rid="jev212282-bib-0032" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>) or single molecule localisation microscopy (Strohmeier et al., <xref rid="jev212282-bib-0049" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>) for in depth characterisation and tetraspanin profiling of single vesicles.</p>
    <p>Specialist companies have also recognised the potential of single vesicle imaging for the EV community. Platforms for EV capture on chips and fluorescence‐based detection using tetraspanin antibodies have recently been commercialised for example by NanoView or Oxford Nanoimaging. These platforms are increasingly used in EV studies (e.g., Melling et al., <xref rid="jev212282-bib-0034" ref-type="bibr">2022</xref>; Tertel et al., <xref rid="jev212282-bib-0053" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>; Wolf et al., <xref rid="jev212282-bib-0063" ref-type="bibr">2022</xref>) and are promising to make an impact for the field, although they generally require integrated instrumentation, software and consumables. Due to the significant initial investment, operation costs and required expert know‐how, such technologies are primarily implemented in highly specialised EV labs but not readily accessible to all academic institutions, and also of limited access to community innovation.</p>
    <p>Recently, we and others have demonstrated that single EVs can be visualised even with standard widefield microscopes and on regular quartz glass slides (Burbidge et al., <xref rid="jev212282-bib-0005" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>; Corso et al., <xref rid="jev212282-bib-0008" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). This suggested that a straightforward, cheap and robust process could be devised for quantitative single vesicle analysis by standard fluorescence microscopy. It turned out that the bottleneck is not only in the sample preparation, but also in the automated quantification of multiple images with freely available software. Here we introduce ‘EVAnalyzer’, a Fiji (Fiji is just ImageJ) plugin for automated, quantitative single vesicle analysis from large sets of imaging data. Using this tool, we established a robust protocol for capture, (mmobi‐)labelling and fluorescent imaging of Evs using exclusively standard reagents, materials and equipment. We provide EVAnalyzer as an open access / open‐source code tool for the EV community after systematic validation with Evs from different sources, LNPs SIO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles and using different labelling methods, and describe its use for key questions in EV research which require single vesicle quantification, ranging from EV sample characterisation to single cell / single vesicle uptake quantification.</p>

The climate chamber settings were 4°C and 75% relative humidity. Aliquots of 4 μl sample were applied to the carbon side of the grid and front‐side blotted for 1—4 s using the instrument's sensor function and Whatman filter paper #1 (Little Chalfont, Great Britain). Instant vitrification was achieved by plunge‐freezing grids into liquid ethane at approximately −180°C. Cryo‐samples were imaged with a Glacios cryo‐transmission electron microscope (Thermo Scientific, Hillsboro, OR, USA) equipped with a X‐FEG and a Falcon3 direct electron detector (4096 × 4096 pixels).

Briefly, samples were measured on a Clarina II Reader (Evotec Technologies) with 488 nm argon ion laser excitation, a 40x water immersion 1.15 N.A. objective (UAPO Olympus), 50 micrometre pinhole and a SPCM‐AQR‐13FC avalanche photodiode (Perkin‐Elmer Optoelectronics). The confocal volume was calculated in approximation according to (Lakowicz, <xref rid="jev212282-bib-0030" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>) using the measured diffusional correlation time t<sub>diff</sub> of free dye (Alexa488, Life Technologies), the known translational diffusion coefficient of Alexa488 (Molecular Probes; D = 280 mm<sup>2</sup>/s) and the axis ratio fitted from calibration measurements. For each sample, several dilutions were made and measured in a 96‐well glass bottom plate (Whatman) with 30 repetitive measurements of 10 s each. NP40s at 1% v/v (Nonidet P40 substitute, G‐Biosciences) was used to induce vesicle disruption for determination of detergent sensitivity and quantification of GFP molecules per vesicle. Upon vesicle lysis (verified by a drop in the translational diffusion time), the number of diffusing GFP molecules increases according to the loading stoichiometry, whereas the brightness per particle decreases. Average numbers of molecules per vesicle were derived both, from the relative increase in particle numbers as well as the relative decrease in single particle brightness after correction for quenching of the fluorophore within the vesicles.</p>

      <p>For MemGlow labelling, 1 × 10<sup>9</sup> particles/ml of UF SEC purified FP‐tagged HEK293T Evs (CD63 mNeon stable line) were immobilised and Formaldehyde‐fixed on regular QG slides following the staining SOP (Supplementary File <xref rid="jev212282-supitem-0004" ref-type="supplementary-material">4</xref>) provided in this manuscript. The slide was incubated with 200 nM of MemGlow (Hölzel Biotech, Germany) diluted in PBS for 1 h followed by three washing steps to remove excess dye and embedding in Vectashield embedding medium.</p>

      <p>DODAG, cholesterol and CPA were dissolved in absolute ethanol, DOPE was dissolved in dichloromethane (all at 10 mg/ml) and Cy5‐DOPE was dissolved in chloroform (1 mg/ml). Appropriate aliquots of these lipid stock solutions were mixed in the ratio DODAG/DOPE/cholesterol/CPA/Cy5‐DOPE 20:49.5:20:10:0.5 (m/m/m/m/m) then heated up to 60°C. This lipid mixture was then injected into a 7‐fold volume of 4 mM HEPES, pH 7, heated up to 60°C shaken manually and hard‐vortexed for 5 min. The organic solvents were first evaporated in a water bath (at 65°C) for 30 min and then slowly evaporated using an Eppendorf Vacufuge Concentrator (at 60°C) for 10 min. The resulting suspension of fluorescent labelled cationic liposomes free of organic solvents were extruded using Avanti® Mini‐Extruder through one Whatman® Nucleopore™ polycarbonate membrane (pore size 100 nm) with 14 extrusion cycles at room temperature and collected in the 15<sup>th</sup> extrusion cycle to yield fluorescent labelled empty LNPs. Under sterile conditions, aliquots of an siRNA stock solution (50 μM) were then added gradually (10 additions of the same volume) to the fluorescent‐labelled empty LNPs up to a final mol charge ratio of 6:1 m/m (ratio of positive charges of cationic lipids to negative charges of siRNAs). After the addition of each aliquot, the mixture was gently agitated by vortex mixing for 15 s, and finally the resulting fluorescent‐labelled siRNA‐loaded LNPs were incubated for 30 min at room temperature before further studies.</p>

Three fields of view were recorded for each sample using direct stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (dSTORM) on a Nanoimager S Instrument (Oxford Nanoimaging, UK) using 40%, 20% and 20% power for the 488 nm, 561 nm and 640 nm laser, respectively. For localisation mapping, 2500 images were recorded per channel.

      <title>Image processing by EVAnalyzer</title>
      <p>Image analysis was performed with Fiji and the EVAnalyzer plugin (version 7.2.1) downloaded on a 64‐bit operating system with 8 GB RAM and an InteI) quad Core(™) i5‐8265U CPU @ 1.60 GHz. The images are saved as Olympus ‘.vsi’ format, however, also tif, jpg, ics and czi formats are supported by the EVAnalyzer. 16bit grayscale images with 2048 × 2048 pixels (IX83) or 1920 × 1200 pixels (IX73) resolution were used.</p>
      <p>The image analysis processing is described in detail in Supplementary File <xref rid="jev212282-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">1</xref> and <xref rid="jev212282-supitem-0002" ref-type="supplementary-material">2</xref> (Handbook). Briefly, all images selected for the analysis with EVAnalyzer belonging to the same experiment are compiled into one input folder and sorted into subfolders according to the experimental design. EVAnalyzer processes all images within the selected input folder with the same settings and stores the results by default into an automatically generated output folder. The results include a report file in .xlsx format (compatible with Microsoft Excel 2007 and newer or other related spreadsheet programs like OpenOffice Calc), output images and a .json file (contains all settings and can be used to reload settings). The report file is organised according to the subfolder structure in the input folder. Within one experiment all samples and controls are analysed with the same settings.</p>
      <p>For single channel images analysed by the ‘EV Count’ pipeline, the Series import ‘series 2’ was used. For all multichannel images ‘series 1’ was used. To find the appropriate image series, a test image was opened in Fiji, which offers different Bio‐ Formats Input Series Options.  The different image types were assigned to individual channels whereas C = 0 corresponds to the first channel recorded. Different image types can be either channels with EVs (EV_DAPI, EV_GFP, EV_CY3, EV_CY5, EV_CY7, EV_CY3FCY5), with cells (CELL_BRIGHTFIELD, CELL_FLUORESCENCE), with nuclei, negative control, background or a Tetraspeck (TS) beads channel. A maximum of five channels can be analysed in version 7.2.1, however, this may be expanded in future releases.</p>
      <p>For single EV imaging either the function ‘EVCount’ or ‘EVColoc’ was used with 1–3 individual channels. In all automated ‘single vesicle imaging’ analysis (except for Figure <xref rid="jev212282-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2e</xref>) a constant threshold (TH) was set by the user to assure comparability between the analysed images. The threshold was chosen by using the preview option integrated in the EVAnalyzer. Additionally, the output generated by the EVAnalyzer was compared to the original images for quality control to assure that an accurate TH was set. Within all analyses (except for Figure <xref rid="jev212282-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2e</xref>) a size filter of 3–99999 pixels was set to remove small artefacts. More specific filtering is used in the following Figures:</p>
      <p>In Figure <xref rid="jev212282-fig-0006" ref-type="fig">6d</xref> a colocalisation area of 70% was compared to the default setting of 1% colocalisation. The analysis performed for Figure <xref rid="jev212282-fig-0009" ref-type="fig">9hk</xref> used spike‐in of Tetraspeck beads for focusing. Accordingly, one channel was specified as ‘TETRASPECK_BEAD’ to exclude spots colocalising with TS‐beads from the EV detection.</p>
      <p>For Figure <xref rid="jev212282-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2e</xref> the images were either processed by manual quantification or with the EVAnalyzer plugin. For manual quantification an image was manually opened in Fiji, followed by manual TH adjustment (Path: Image/Adjust/Threshold/Apply), particle analysis (Path: Analyze/Analyze Particles). Size and circularity filters were set to ‘off’ (Size: 0‐Infinity; Circularity 0–1). A summary of the data was transferred to an Excel list and the same was repeated for all 10 images. For quantification in the EVAnalyzer pipeline either an auto threshold was set (Max Entropy, Moments, Otsu, Triangle, Li, Min Error) or a defined TH was chosen by each user and adjusted in the preview images. No size or circularity filters were used. With the EVAnalyzer, all 10 images were automatically analysed in a sequence and a report output file was automatically generated.</p>
      <p>For EV quantification in the cell the pipeline ‘EVCount per Cell‐ remove cropped cells’ was used. ‘Series 1’ was used for import. The four different channels were specified as EV_GFP (CD63mNeon expressing HEK293T EVs), EV_CY5 (CY5 NHS label), CELL_BRIGHTFIELD and NUCLEUS (Höchst stained nucleus). EVs were detected with a user defined constant TH. Cells were detected with the automated MinError threshold and the nuclei were detected with the automated Triangle threshold. A z‐projection of the individual z‐stacks was done before image processing (‘Z‐Projection’ was set to ‘max’ for all used channels). For EV detection a size filter of 3–99999 was used. All 336 images (16 images/well; three wells per condition; seven conditions) were processed in a batch using the same settings.</p>

          <p>Quantitative single vesicle analysis by EVAnalyzer. (a) General workflow for EV imaging by standard laboratory equipment. (b) The Fiji plugin EVAnalyzer is organised in four packages comprising (I) Filters from the Fiji repository, which are described in more detail in Supplementary File <xref rid="jev212282-supitem-0002" ref-type="supplementary-material">2</xref> and (II) specifically developed pipelines for image processing which enable the quantification of EVs in vitro or in cells for diverse types of samples and applications. Pipelines for single vesicle quantification comprise options for single and multi‐channel analysis (‘EVCount’) as well as colocalisation of detected particles across channels (‘EVColoc’). To detect the vesicles (‘Find EVs’), images are processed by the following steps: First, pre‐processing for background subtraction using a rolling ball filter and, optionally, subtraction of a background image. Second, smoothing to blur residual noise using a Gaussian filter. This allows to reduce low intensity background noise. Third, an intensity threshold is defined (by the user or the software) to optimally discriminate between signal and noise. During this step, the image is converted into a binary image. Using the binary image, regions of interest (ROI) are converted into individual objects. Additional area and circularity filters can be applied by the user. If internal reference particles such as TetraSpeck (TS) beads or orthogonally labelled EVs are used, these can be excluded (‘Remove TS’). Identified objects are quantified and annotated with their individual parameters including brightness, circularity, area and spectral channel. For colocalisation calculation (‘EVColoc’), these preprocessing steps are performed for multiple channels (up to 5 channels in version 7.2.1). The regions of interests are then compared between two or more channels as defined by the user. Per default, the object is classified as colocalised if the intersection of the ROI areas is &gt; 0. This can be individually changed with a min coloc factor or a snap area. Pipelines enabling single cell‐ single vesicle quantification essentially require EV detection (‘Find EVs‘) and cell area detection (‘Find cell area‘) and optionally can also include nuclei detection for single cell analysis (‘Find single cells‘). Package (III) comprises the code for generation of output files, images and documentation of the settings. The graphical user interface (GUI) is covered in package (IV). See details of all EVAnalyzer packages, filters and pipelines in Supplementary File <xref rid="jev212282-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">1</xref> and the handbook in Supplementary File <xref rid="jev212282-supitem-0002" ref-type="supplementary-material">2</xref>.</p>

      <p>Here we describe the development of a robust procedure for EV sample preparation, fluorescence imaging as well as image analysis using exclusively standard laboratory equipment and a new open‐source plugin for Fiji, which we are making publicly available under the name EVAnalyzer. The plugin was developed in the open‐source code editor <italic toggle="yes">Visual Studio Code</italic>, compiled in Java and offers image processing tools optimised for both, single vesicle quantification in purified and complex EV samples, as well as quantification of cell uptake data at the single cell–single vesicle level. EVAnalyzer has been designed for fast and automated quantification of multiple images in a batch process and can be downloaded via the Fiji repository (version 7.2.1) or via GitHub (<ext-link xlink:href="https://github.com/joda01/evanalyzer/releases" ext-link-type="uri">https://github.com/joda01/evanalyzer/releases</ext-link>). To enable further community development, the source code is provided together with a docker image comprising all tools and libraries to compile the plugin.</p>
      <p>The software development and the detailed image processing procedures are described in Supplementary File <xref rid="jev212282-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">1</xref>. A handbook is provided in Supplementary File <xref rid="jev212282-supitem-0003" ref-type="supplementary-material">3</xref>. An outline of the plugin workflow is shown in Figure <xref rid="jev212282-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>. Essentially, the software has been organised into four packages (I) Filters: classes and methods for image processing algorithms. To minimise the processing time, an image abstraction is used for multi‐ threading. (II) Pipelines: This package comprises pipelines to automate the succession of image processing steps for different applications. In the current version (7.2.1), EVAnalyzer provides default pipelines for vesicle detection in single and multiple channels, multi‐channel colocalisation as well as single vesicle–single cell quantification for cellular uptake assays and high content screening applications. The identified vesicles are annotated with their features such as brightness, circularity and area for each spectral channel and are quantified with or without additional filtering or classification (e.g., based on colocalization area or size thresholds). EVAnalyzer provides additional features to generally facilitate processing of large sets of images. This includes preview images to facilitate parameter setting, automated Z‐stack processing (e.g., generation of maximum intensity projections) and corrections for chromatic aberrations. (III) Output: After batch processing of all images, an output file is generated with spreadsheet tables in .xlsx format providing mean values for each image, individual values for each single spot, hyperlinks to the processed images (output images) and the settings of the analysis. Additionally, a .json file is generated which can be read into EVAnalyzer for re‐using previously applied settings. Package (IV) comprises the code for the EVAnalyzer control window (Graphical User Interface, GUI).</p>
      <p>EVAnalyzer currently supports .tif, .vsi, .jpg, .ics and .czi file formats (8‐bit and 16‐bit). Theoretically, there is no limitation of the number of images that can be batch processed by the plugin, however, the data volume for a given session is practically limited by the available free RAM (typically ca. 10 MB of free RAM required per image). Details on typical processing times and data volumes are listed in the handbook (Supplementary File <xref rid="jev212282-supitem-0002" ref-type="supplementary-material">2</xref>).</p>

      <title>Immobilisation and immunolabelling of EVs for imaging based single vesicle quantification using standard laboratory equipment</title>
      <p>EVAnalyzer was first used to establish a robust, straightforward and reproducible process for immobilising, detecting and imaging EVs on regular microscope slides suitable for widefield (as well as confocal and super‐resolution) fluorescence microscopy. The systematic development and optimisation of the process is described in detail in Supplementary File <xref rid="jev212282-supitem-0004" ref-type="supplementary-material">4</xref> and included testing of different commercially available surfaces, immobilisation conditions, fixatives, blocking agents, influence of detergents, embedding media and storage stability. EVs from HEK293T cells stably transfected with a CD63‐mNeon transgene were used to monitor the vesicles throughout all steps. As a result, we provide an SOP with the optimised protocol using exclusively commercially available, low cost materials and reagents (Supplementary File <xref rid="jev212282-supitem-0004" ref-type="supplementary-material">4</xref>). To test the robustness and reproducibility of this protocol, three independent operators followed this SOP for immunostaining of CD81‐ emGFP HEK293T EVs using an anti‐CD81 antibody (Figure <xref rid="jev212282-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>). Independently obtained microscopy data were then analysed with EVAnalyzer by the same operator (operator 2) for total EV numbers and % colocalization, which led to almost identical results (Figure <xref rid="jev212282-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2a‐c</xref>), thereby demonstrating the robustness of the protocol.</p>

      <p>To validate the image analysis output by EVAnalyzer, four independent operators with expertise in EV analytics were asked to analyse 10 images of CD63mNeon HEK293T EVs in a blinded manner with manual thresholding and counting in Fiji. These results were compared to automated batch processing of the same images by EVAnalyzer using either auto thresholding, or threshold setting by the four users (Figure <xref rid="jev212282-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2e</xref>). As default we recommend setting a constant threshold for all images within a series, whether in EVAnalyzer or with manual image analysis. Depending on the application, however, automated threshold setting may be preferable. Based on our experience, Li and Triangle auto threshold filters work generally well on samples with low background, while MaxEntropy is superior for discrimination of bright spots from diffuse background. As illustrated by the example in Figure <xref rid="jev212282-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2e</xref>, the optimal auto threshold settings depend on the application and should be tested on a subset of images by visual inspection of the recognized particles in the output images as compared to the original images prior to batch processing. Manual image analysis resulted in relatively comparable results between three out of four operators. One user, however, obtained substantially different results for two out of the 10 images, revealing the possible user bias by manual image analysis with subjective and image‐to‐image threshold setting. In contrast, the results of automated image batch processing by the same four operators using EVAnalyzer were highly consistent between the individual users and further corresponded well to the results of the manual image analysis by the majority of the operators. This confirms that automated image batch processing by EVAnalyzer provides results which are consistent with the average subjective classification of light diffraction limited spots as EVs by the human eye, though with substantially reduced processing time.</p>
      <p>In the following examples we describe how EVAnalyzer can be applied to address a variety of common questions of high relevance for EV research, with an intention to illustrate the breadth of information that can be generated. Additionally, we also provide prototypic examples for synthetic nanoparticle analysis since we foresee a wide application potential also in nanomaterial sciences. For all applications described here, we have made an emphasis on straightforward implementation in virtually all laboratories with access to standard equipment and infrastructure. As exemplified for the single vesicle–single cell uptake assay, they can, however, also be miniaturised and automated for medium‐ to high‐throughput screening for labs with access to automated imaging instrumentation. Pre‐sets for single vesicle detection, colocalisation and cell uptake quantification are provided in the plugin as well as in the handbook (Supplementary File <xref rid="jev212282-supitem-0002" ref-type="supplementary-material">2</xref>) as a starting point for other researchers using the plugin.</p>

      <title>EVAnalyzer can be applied for rapid quantification of EV subpopulations at the single vesicle level in purified and crude samples</title>
      <p>In most EV research projects there is an increasing demand for characterising subpopulations at the single vesicle level in both, purified and crude EV samples. To exemplify this, we first used EVs from HEK293T cells genetically engineered with fluorescent protein tagged tetraspanins for in situ antibody validation. As illustrated in Figure <xref rid="jev212282-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>, immunostaining of FP tagged EVs from transiently transfected cells can result in different species: <italic toggle="yes">(i)</italic> tetraspanin‐FP tagged EVs which are recognized by the antibody and resulting in a double positive vesicle (yellow, true positives), <italic toggle="yes">(ii)</italic> EVs with endogenous tetraspanins recognized by the antibody (red only, true positives), <italic toggle="yes">(iii)</italic> EVs with FP‐tagged tetraspanins not recognized by the antibody (green only, false negatives) and <italic toggle="yes">(iv)</italic> unspecific binding of the antibody (red only, false positives). Ideally, all green fluorescent EVs should be recognized by the antibody. This can be assessed by the fraction of colocalisation (% red in green), which is a direct measure of antibody sensitivity. For red only vesicles it can per se not be discriminated what the contributions of true and false positives are. This requires additional controls such as genetic knockouts or combination with orthogonal, non‐neutralising antibodies recognising the same antigen. Unspecific binding of the secondary antibody as well as antibody precipitates can be determined by corresponding controls omitting the primary antibody or samples without EVs. HEK293T EVs with CD63‐mNeon, CD81‐emGFP or CD9‐emGFP were purified by UF‐SEC (Figure <xref rid="jev212282-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3b</xref> and Supplementary File <xref rid="jev212282-supitem-0003" ref-type="supplementary-material">3</xref>) and subjected to immunostaining with their corresponding matched antibodies (anti‐CD63, anti‐CD81 or anti‐CD9, respectively). EVAnalyzer was used to quantify the total numbers of EVs in both, the GFP/mNeon and the AlexaFluor555 channels, as well as the colocalisation between the two channels using the ‘EVColoc’ pipeline. As shown in Figure <xref rid="jev212282-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3c</xref> and <xref rid="jev212282-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">d</xref>, the CD63 antibody used in this example recognised over 80%, the two CD81 and CD9 antibodies even &gt; 90% of all tetraspanin‐FP positive EVs, demonstrating a high sensitivity. For CD9 and CD81, approximately 70% of all antibody positive vesicles lack the FP tagged transgene, which can largely be explained by the incomplete (transient) transfection of the parent cells (Supplementary File <xref rid="jev212282-supitem-0003" ref-type="supplementary-material">3</xref>). In contrast, only a small fraction of red only vesicles was detected by CD63 antibody staining of CD63‐mNeon EVs. The lower abundance of non‐mNeon positive vesicles detected by the CD63 antibody is well in line with the fact that these samples were derived from a stably transfected HEK293T cell line, whereas the CD9‐emGFP and CD81‐emGFP EVs were derived from transiently transfected cells. No unspecific binding of the secondary antibody was detected.</p>

      <p>These data validate the immunostaining and image analysis process for highly enriched EV samples such as obtained by UF‐SEC. Certain applications would, however, be greatly facilitated by analysis directly in conditioned medium (Figure <xref rid="jev212282-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>), thereby minimising the required sample preparation time and any potential bias introduced by the isolation principle. We therefore compared CD81 immunostaining on CD81‐emGFP HEK293T EVs either isolated by UF‐SEC or directly in conditioned medium (Figure <xref rid="jev212282-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>, bottom). The vesicles per FoV in CM samples were in the upper range (ca 3000 vesicles per FoV). This demonstrates that the surface capture also works directly in conditioned medium, and that the EV concentration in CM is in a suitable range without any enrichment for direct application of our SOP, at least for EVs derived from HEK293T cells. Remarkably, the relative quantification data were almost identical for CD81‐emGFP EVs from CM and after UF‐SEC, demonstrating that the immunolabelling with single vesicle quantification can be directly applied in crude samples such as conditioned medium.</p>

      <title>Single vesicle brightness analysis by EVAnalyzer provides information on molecular loading densities and vesicle subpopulations</title>
      <p>EVAnalyzer not only counts but also annotates each vesicle with its additional parameters such as intensity, circularity or area in all channels. Therefore, a multidimensional analysis with cross‐correlation at the single vesicle level is possible–in analogy to flow cytometry or high content screening technologies. We would like to point out that widefield imaging cannot resolve sizes beyond the light diffraction limit. On our microscope using the 100 × 1.45NA objective the Abbe's resolution limit is in the range of 200–400 nm, depending on the wavelength. For objects smaller than the resolution limit, the apparent spot size becomes primarily a function of the fluorescence brightness of the point light source and should not be misinterpreted as true EV size. To derive total intensities for each vesicle, the mean intensity was multiplied with the spot area, resulting in the ‘sum intensity per particle. We next tested how well the vesicle brightness obtained by fluorescence imaging correlates with the number of fluorescent molecules per vesicle. We used EVs from HEK293T cells engineered to express different versions of FP‐tagged CD63. This included stable, random integration of CD63‐mNeon (Wiklander et al., <xref rid="jev212282-bib-0061" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>) or CD63‐GFP (‘OE’, (Strohmeier et al., <xref rid="jev212282-bib-0049" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>)), as well as transient transfection of CD63‐emGFP. In addition, we used a HEK293T line with GFP engineered into the CD63 locus by CRISPR/Cas9 technology (‘CD63‐GFP CRISPR’) (Strohmeier et al., <xref rid="jev212282-bib-0049" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>). EVs from these different parent cells were isolated by UF‐SEC (Supplementary File <xref rid="jev212282-supitem-0003" ref-type="supplementary-material">3</xref>) and analysed by Fluorescence Correlation Spectroscopy (FCS) to determine the average number of fluorescent molecules per vesicle, following a previously described protocol (Corso et al., <xref rid="jev212282-bib-0008" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). For the four different EV samples, the loading densities of CD63‐FP ranged from ca 30 molecules/vesicle for the CD63‐mNeon stable line, to 2–3 molecules/vesicle for EVs from CD63‐GFP CRISPR cells (Figure <xref rid="jev212282-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>). These samples were then imaged by fluorescence microscopy with quantification using the ‘EVCount’ pipeline of EVAnalyzer (constant threshold setting) to derive sum intensities per vesicle as explained above. As shown in Figure <xref rid="jev212282-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>, the mean of the sum intensity per vesicle correlated well with the number of molecules per vesicle, indicating that single vesicle brightness analysis allows to estimate and compare molecular loading densities. Figure <xref rid="jev212282-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4c</xref> illustrates the additional information provided by analysis of single vesicle brightness distribution, revealing the heterogeneity across the sample and the potential presence of defined subpopulations.</p>

      <title>Application of EVAnalyzer for rapid optimisation of genetic EV engineering directly in conditioned medium</title>
      <p>Much EV research builds on genetically engineered EVs, such as for tracking EVs with fluorescent reporters (Sung et al., <xref rid="jev212282-bib-0051" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; Verweij et al., <xref rid="jev212282-bib-0059" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>) or the development of modified EVs as therapeutics (Claridge et al., <xref rid="jev212282-bib-0006" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>; Dooley et al., <xref rid="jev212282-bib-0014" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>; Gupta et al., <xref rid="jev212282-bib-0020" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>; Wiklander et al., <xref rid="jev212282-bib-0061" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). Monitoring secreted EV populations directly in small volumes (35 μl or below) of conditioned medium provides an opportunity to rapidly optimise genetic engineering of EVs, exemplified in some simple prototypic applications shown in Figure <xref rid="jev212282-fig-0005" ref-type="fig">5</xref>. We transiently transfected expression constructs for fluorescently tagged tetraspanins in HEK293T cells under different conditions and monitored both, the parent cells as well as the secreted EVs by quantitative single vesicle imaging after immunostaining directly in conditioned medium. Interestingly, at low polyethyleneimine (PEI) and plasmid concentrations, the transfection resulted in an approximately 4‐fold increase in the total number of CD63 positive vesicles detected in conditioned medium (Figure <xref rid="jev212282-fig-0005" ref-type="fig">5a,b</xref>). This is consistent with previous notions that cells generally secrete more exosomes upon stress (e.g., Essandoh et al., <xref rid="jev212282-bib-0017" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; Qin et al., <xref rid="jev212282-bib-0043" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>). At increasing concentrations of plasmid /PEI, the total number of CD63 positive vesicles declined again, in line with an apparent cell growth inhibition at elevated transfection stress (Supplementary Figure <xref rid="jev212282-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">1a</xref>). As expected, the fraction of CD63‐emGFP positive vesicles increased with the PEI/plasmid concentration (Figure <xref rid="jev212282-fig-0005" ref-type="fig">5b, d</xref> (Green in red coloc)), while the absolute numbers of vesicles carrying the transgenic CD63 remained relatively constant above ca 4 μg plasmid (Figure <xref rid="jev212282-fig-0005" ref-type="fig">5c</xref>). This indicates that increasing levels of CD63‐emGFP in the parent cells increase the fraction but not the total number of CD63 positive vesicles, whereas mild cellular stress generally boosts EV secretion.</p>

In contrast, the average brightness of CD63‐emGFP per GFP positive vesicle remained relatively stable, irrespective of the plasmid concentration. This suggests that the population of vesicles carrying the transgenic CD63 might carry generally higher numbers of CD63 molecules than vesicles with endogenous CD63 only. This was confirmed by dissecting the intensity of anti‐CD63 antibody labelling for the respective subpopulations, demonstrating that CD63 antibody signals were significantly higher for CD63‐emGFP positive than CD63‐emGFP negative vesicles within the same conditioned medium (Figure <xref rid="jev212282-fig-0005" ref-type="fig">5f</xref>).

      <p>Using an optimal PEI/plasmid concentration derived from these data (4–8 μg plasmid per T25 flask), we next illustrate the application of EVAnalyzer to assess optimal conditions for EV engineering with multiple receptors. Fluorescent protein tagged tetraspanin constructs were combinatorically transfected into HEK293T cells (Supplementary Figure <xref rid="jev212282-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">1b</xref>) and EVs were again quantified directly in conditioned medium. As illustrated in Figure <xref rid="jev212282-fig-0006" ref-type="fig">6a</xref> (left panel), CD63‐mCherry was co‐transfected with emGFP tagged CD63, CD9 or CD81 either in combined <italic toggle="yes">(i)</italic> or separate <italic toggle="yes">(ii)</italic> lipoplexes. As negative control, the constructs were transfected individually in separate flasks and conditioned media were mixed for imaging <italic toggle="yes">(iii)</italic>. In addition, we used a CD63‐mCherry‐emGFP fusion construct <italic toggle="yes">(iv)</italic>, The colocalisation data in Figure <xref rid="jev212282-fig-0006" ref-type="fig">6a</xref> (right panel) demonstrate that a high fraction of double positive vesicles was observed for all single lipoplex combinations of the three tetraspanins <italic toggle="yes">(i)</italic>, whereas this was substantially reduced when the constructs were transfected in separate lipoplexes <italic toggle="yes">(ii)</italic>. This is plausible given that the probability of the same cells being transfected is lower when different constructs are applied in separate polymer vesicles. Interestingly, a small number of vesicles in the fusion construct sample showed signal only in either the GFP or the mCherry channels, which was assigned correctly by EVAnalyzer as assessed by visual inspection of the output control images. This can for example be explained by a small fraction of donor quenching due to FRET between the two fluorescent proteins (red only), or partial cleavage of the N‐terminal mCherry (green only). Mixing conditioned media from either mCherry or emGFP transfected cells resulted in only minimal counts of double positive vesicles <italic toggle="yes">(iii)</italic>, validating the colocalisation analysis. As expected, the fraction of double positive vesicles was highest for the fusion construct <italic toggle="yes">(iv)</italic>. While the number of false double positive vesicles in the negative control was negligible, an in‐depth analysis of additional parameters provided by EVAnalyzer revealed that for these particles the mean overlap area between the two channels was smaller (Figure <xref rid="jev212282-fig-0006" ref-type="fig">6b</xref> (iii)). In contrast, the overlap area for the truly double positive vesicles in the control samples was between 90–100 % (Figure <xref rid="jev212282-fig-0006" ref-type="fig">6b</xref> (iv)). Such random overlap can be filtered out by setting a threshold for the minimal colocalisation area, which is facilitated by the single vesicle distribution of the colocalisation area (Figure <xref rid="jev212282-fig-0006" ref-type="fig">6c</xref>). Using a threshold of 70 % min overlap, re‐analysis of the mixed CM controls reduced false positives by approximately two‐fold, resulting in &lt; 2% residual double positives (Figure <xref rid="jev212282-fig-0006" ref-type="fig">6d</xref>). These remaining false positives could represent either randomly occurring perfect overlay, aggregation or fusion. To facilitate such advanced colocalisation analysis we included an option for user defined colocalisation area threshold setting in the EVColoc pipeline (<italic toggle="yes">‘min coloc factor %’</italic>,). We would like to point out that these data additionally allow to assess the contribution of single spots representing more than one particle, which for the examples shown is less than 1.5% at optimized EVAnalyzer thresholds.</p>

      <p>Further information on subpopulations can be obtained from 2D‐scatter plots of the individual fluorescence intensities in the CD63‐mCherry and CD63‐emGFP detection channels (Figure <xref rid="jev212282-fig-0006" ref-type="fig">6e</xref>). Transfecting the two constructs in separate lipoplexes resulted in a lack of correlation between the emGFP and mCherry brightnesses (Figure <xref rid="jev212282-fig-0006" ref-type="fig">6e</xref>. (ii)), indicating random sorting of both fusion constructs into the same vesicle. In addition, the red only and green only vesicles were also apparent in the 2D brightness analysis, consistent with the low degree of colocalisation for this sample. Transfecting both constructs in one lipoplex showed a slightly increased tendency that vesicles with higher brightness of CD63‐emGFP also comprise higher intensity of CD63‐mCherry (Figure <xref rid="jev212282-fig-0006" ref-type="fig">6e</xref> (i)). This is consistent with the notion that the plasmids are introduced into the cells together thereby giving rise to more homogeneous distributions and expression ratios in the parent cells. As expected, EVs with the CD63‐mCherry‐emGFP fusion construct resulted in a high degree of correlation in the two‐colour brightness distribution (Figure <xref rid="jev212282-fig-0006" ref-type="fig">6e</xref>
<italic toggle="yes">(iii)</italic>) whereas the mixed media showed two independent, red and green only populations (Figure <xref rid="jev212282-fig-0006" ref-type="fig">6e</xref>. (iv)). Interestingly, double transfection of CD63‐mCherry with either CD81‐emGFP or CD9‐emGFP resulted in only a poor correlation of single vesicle intensities even when transfecting the two constructs in the same lipoplex (Supplementary Figure <xref rid="jev212282-supitem-0002" ref-type="supplementary-material">2a</xref> (CD81) and <xref rid="jev212282-supitem-0002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2b</xref> (CD9)), indicating that loading densities of CD9 or CD81 do not correlate with loading densities of CD63 at the single vesicle level. These data exemplify how such single vesicle brightness distribution analysis can reveal subpopulations and provide further insight into whether two markers are sorted independently or are mechanistically correlated.</p>

      <title>Application of EVAnalyzer for validation of EV labelling dyes at the single vesicle level</title>
      <p>To track EV uptake and biodistribution in cells or in vivo, labelling with synthetic dyes is commonly used. In particular for EVs from sources incompatible with genetic manipulation, post‐isolation biochemical labelling strategies are required. Many of these dyes bear additional advantages in chemical and biological stability and photophysical properties as compared to fluorescent proteins. However, since they typically rely on generic molecular interactions such as lipid anchoring or conjugation to amino acids, their specificity and stability are key issues. In many studies, the labelling of EVs is considered successful if the dye co‐purifies with the vesicles. We propose that single vesicle analysis should be rigorously employed to judge which particles are labelled within a complex EV sample. To illustrate how EVAnalyzer enables such analysis, UF‐SEC purified CD63‐mNeon HEK293T EVs were labelled with Cy5 by NHS chemistry, MemGlow as well as DiI as three commonly used reagents (Figure <xref rid="jev212282-fig-0007" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). Both, Cy5‐NHS as well as MemGlow resulted in nearly quantitative (ca 90 %) labelling of all CD63‐mNeon positive EVs. The fraction of additionally labelled, non CD63‐mNeon vesicles was higher for MemGlow than Cy5‐NHS indicating an extra population of particles recognized by MemGlow in the samples. In contrast, the large majority of DiI labelled particles did not colocalise with CD63‐mNeon, raising caution of interpreting results with this dye (Figure <xref rid="jev212282-fig-0007" ref-type="fig">7a</xref>).</p>

      <p>EVs labelled with Cy5‐NHS were generally brighter than particles labelled by MemGlow. Interestingly, the single vesicle intensity data revealed that the distribution of Cy5/CD63‐mNeon double positive vesicles was shifted to substantially higher intensities as compared to Cy5 labelled, CD63‐mNeon negative particles within the same sample–which was not observed for MemGlow (Figure <xref rid="jev212282-fig-0007" ref-type="fig">7b</xref>). CD63‐mNeon is restricted to bona fide extracellular vesicles, whereas both dyes, Cy5 NHS as well as MemGlow may arguably label both, vesicles and non‐vesicular particles in the sample. The different behaviour in the brightness shift of the two dyes may be explained by the fact that non‐vesicular particles, such as lipoproteins, are less efficiently labelled by NHS ester chemistry due to their lower protein/particle content than EVs. Since the MemGlow‐only particles have similar brightness as the CD63mNeon/Memglow double positive particles, this would indicate that this dye in contrast labels CD63 positive and negative particles at similar stoichiometries.</p>

      <title>Single vesicle analysis of EVs from non‐human sources by EVAnalyzer</title>
      <p>EVs from non‐human sources represent an increasingly relevant area in EV research and biomedical application development. The availability of tools such as antibodies for non‐human EVs currently still poses a severe practical limitation, in particular with validation at the single vesicle level.  To test how our described imaging protocols with single vesicle characterisation by EVAnalyzer may enable straightforward validation of cross‐species use of EV detection tools, we characterised different antibodies for immunolabeling of bovine milk EVs (Figure <xref rid="jev212282-fig-0008" ref-type="fig">8</xref>). We first cloned mNeon‐tagged expression constructs of bovine tetraspanins (CD63, CD81, CD9) for transfection into HEK293T cells (Supplementary File <xref rid="jev212282-supitem-0003" ref-type="supplementary-material">3</xref>) in a side‐by‐side comparison with the corresponding human tetraspanin variants. The different genetically engineered EVs were immunostained with the corresponding CD63, CD9 or CD81 antibodies previously validated for human EVs (Figures <xref rid="jev212282-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, <xref rid="jev212282-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref> and <xref rid="jev212282-fig-0005" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). Recognition of the human or bovine tetraspanins was assessed based on colocalisation with the corresponding FP‐tagged receptors using EVAnalyzer (Figure <xref rid="jev212282-fig-0008" ref-type="fig">8a</xref>). Both, the CD9 as well as CD81 antibody cross‐reacted with the bovine expression constructs with similar efficiency as for the human variants, with approximately 80–90 % of mNeon positive vesicles being recognised by the antibody (Figure <xref rid="jev212282-fig-0008" ref-type="fig">8b</xref>). In contrast, two different CD63 antibodies failed to effectively cross‐react with bovine CD63, with only 5–15 % of mNeon positive vesicles being detected. Consistently, bovine CD9 and CD81 were both successfully detected by Western blotting of bovine milk derived EVs whereas no signal was obtained for CD63 (Figure <xref rid="jev212282-fig-0008" ref-type="fig">8c</xref>), despite confirmed presence of all tetraspanins by mass spectrometry‐ based proteomics (Figure <xref rid="jev212282-fig-0008" ref-type="fig">8d</xref>). Single vesicle imaging of bovine milk derived EVs labelled with Cy5 NHS resulted in positive signals for anti‐CD9 (Figure <xref rid="jev212282-fig-0008" ref-type="fig">8e</xref>). Due to the difficulty of genetic engineering of milk EVs, it is not possible to directly control the specificity of antibody recognition in these samples, however, a majority of these particles colocalised with Cy5 signals (Figure <xref rid="jev212282-fig-0008" ref-type="fig">8e</xref>, right panel), which is in line with the specificity demonstrated on the EVs with bovine CD9‐mNeon in Figure <xref rid="jev212282-fig-0008" ref-type="fig">8a</xref>. CD81 was not detected by imaging of milk EVs, however, also the signal intensity in Western blotting was very weak (Figure <xref rid="jev212282-fig-0008" ref-type="fig">8c</xref>) and the levels detected by MS‐proteomics (Figure <xref rid="jev212282-fig-0008" ref-type="fig">8d</xref>) were substantially lower than CD9, suggesting that the abundance of CD81 in milk EVs might be too low to provide sufficient signal for single vesicle imaging. In line with the lack of cross‐reactivity with bovine CD63‐mNeon on HEK293T Evs, no signal was obtained for immunolabelling of milk derived Evs with the two CD63 antibodies (Figure <xref rid="jev212282-fig-0008" ref-type="fig">8e</xref>).</p>

      <title>EVAnalyzer can be applied to haracterize synthetic nanoparticles</title>
      <p>EVAnalyzer was primarily developed for EV research, however, is inherently applicable also for other types of nanoparticles as long they can be detected by fluorescence microscopy. A prototypical application area is the LNP (lipid‐based nanoparticle) field, which has gained substantial momentum after the successful development and global application of LNP formulated mRNA vaccines for Covid19 (Baden et al., <xref rid="jev212282-bib-0002" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). RNA encapsulation efficiencies by empty LNPs are typically determined indirectly such as by non‐membrane permeable RNA intercalating dyes (Huang et al., <xref rid="jev212282-bib-0025" ref-type="bibr">2022</xref>; Michel et al., <xref rid="jev212282-bib-0036" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>; Wu et al., <xref rid="jev212282-bib-0064" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>), or fractions of RNA co‐isolating with liposomes, quantified by RT‐qPCR (Saha et al., <xref rid="jev212282-bib-0046" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>; Tsuji et al., <xref rid="jev212282-bib-0056" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). We reasoned that quantitative single particle imaging enabled by EVAnalyzer might provide a straightforward and direct method to characterise RNA encapsulation at the single particle level. To test this, fluorescently labelled LNPs were prepared with Cy5‐DOPE (DODAG/DOPE/Cholesterol/CPA/Cy5‐DOPE = 20:49.5:20:10:0.5 m/m/m/m/m) and used either empty or for encapsulation of AlexaFluor488‐siRNA at a final mol charge ratio of 6:1 (ratio of positive charges of cationic lipids to negative charges of siRNAs, Figure <xref rid="jev212282-fig-0009" ref-type="fig">9a</xref>). NTA, light scattering and cryo‐TEM analyses confirmed formation of spherical LNPs for both samples. LNPs with fluorescent siRNA showed a mean particle size of 154.6 ± 3.2 nm, a surface ζ‐potential of 45.6 ± 2.0 mV and a polydispersity index (PdI) of 0.136 ± 0, while for empty LNPs we measured a mean particle size of 124.5 ± 2.5 nm, a surface ζ‐potential of 43.8 ± 2.2 mV and a PdI of 0.115 ± 0.00+ (Supplementary Figure <xref rid="jev212282-supitem-0003" ref-type="supplementary-material">3a</xref> and <xref rid="jev212282-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3b</xref>). The resulting siRNA‐loaded LNPs were analysed by fluorescence imaging following protocols optimised for EVs, whereas positively charged microscope slides worked best for LNP immobilisation (data not shown). Cy5‐labelled LNPs were well detectable by high‐resolution widefield microscopy (Figure <xref rid="jev212282-fig-0009" ref-type="fig">9b</xref>), thereby allowing successful application of single vesicle quantification by EVAnalyzer (Figure <xref rid="jev212282-fig-0009" ref-type="fig">9c</xref>). Nearly 100 % of AlexaFluor488 signals were colocalised with Cy5‐positive spots, directly demonstrating successful encapsulation of siRNA. Interestingly, the double positive particles comprised only ca 20 % of all LNPs visualised (Figure <xref rid="jev212282-fig-0009" ref-type="fig">9d</xref>), revealing that siRNA is not homogeneously encapsulated by all LNPs but rather accumulates in a subset of particles, at least at the tested stoichiometric ratio. A 2D scatter dot plot of Cy5 and AlexaFluor488 single particle sum intensities further demonstrates a weak positive correlation between the Cy5‐lipid and siRNA signals (Figure <xref rid="jev212282-fig-0009" ref-type="fig">9e</xref>, R<sup>2</sup> = 0.24). Since the Cy5‐DOPE density correlates directly with the LNP size, this indicates that siRNA is more likely loaded into larger LNPs. These data clearly demonstrate the application potential of single particle imaging enabled by EVAnalyzer for LNP characterisation and exemplify the level of information that can be obtained to guide formulation optimisation.</p>

      <p>To test the scope of nanomaterials beyond EVs one step further, we applied EVAnalyzer on imaging data with mesoporous silica‐based nanoparticles (SiO<sub>2</sub> NPs) loaded with fluorescent proteins (Figure <xref rid="jev212282-fig-0009" ref-type="fig">9f</xref>). β‐lactoglobulin and lysozyme were labelled with TMR‐NHS or Cy7‐NHS, respectively, and purified by size exclusion chromatography on spin columns to remove excess free dye. Protein labelling efficiency and quantity were determined by RP‐HPLC and SDS‐PAGE (Supplementary File <xref rid="jev212282-supitem-0005" ref-type="supplementary-material">5</xref>). Labelled proteins were loaded onto approximately 75 nm‐sized mesoporous (approx. 4 nm pore size) SiO<sub>2</sub> NPs by physical adsorption either separately or in combination and protein loading was quantified as above (Supplementary File <xref rid="jev212282-supitem-0005" ref-type="supplementary-material">5</xref>, Figures <xref rid="jev212282-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref> and <xref rid="jev212282-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). The protein‐coated particles were immobilised on QG slides following a similar protocol as optimised for EVs. Interestingly, in contrast to EVs the immobilisation of the SiO<sub>2</sub> NPs on regular QG slides or positively charged QG slides was not successful (data not shown). However, after pre‐treatment of the glass surface with concentrated sulfuric acid/hydrogen peroxide (Piranha solution) to expose the ‐OH groups we were able to capture SiO<sub>2</sub> NPs for detection by fluorescence microscopy (Figure <xref rid="jev212282-fig-0009" ref-type="fig">9g</xref>). The particles showed an increased tendency for aggregation and cluster formation on the surface, which was not observed in suspension (Supplementary File <xref rid="jev212282-supitem-0005" ref-type="supplementary-material">5</xref>, Table <xref rid="jev212282-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref>). In addition to the light diffraction limited spots, diffuse fluorescent background was observed, indicating a certain degree of protein dissociation from the particles, complicating the definition of the focal plane. Further, the fluorescence intensity was prone to rapid photobleaching during focus adjustment. This issue was resolved by spike‐in of TetraSpeck (TS) beads into the sample, allowing to use the 488 nm spectral channel for focus adjustment. The obtained images, therefore, provided a stress test for single particle detection by EVAnalyzer. We used the pipeline ‘EVColoc’ and selected the 488 nm channel for TS bead removal. Additionally, we defined a size threshold of max. 500 pixel (corresponding to ca 2 μm<sup>2</sup> for the used optical settings) to filter out aggregates, and an intensity threshold adapted to the increased background fluorescence. As shown in Figure <xref rid="jev212282-fig-0009" ref-type="fig">9g</xref> (right panel), this allowed to selectively detect the light diffraction limited spots on the diffuse background signal, while efficiently removing the TS beads as well as the large clusters. Using these settings to analyse all samples allowed to quantify both, TMR‐β‐lactoglobulin–as well as Cy7‐lysozyme‐coated SiO<sub>2</sub> NPs (Figure <xref rid="jev212282-fig-0009" ref-type="fig">9h</xref>). Interestingly, the β‐lactoglobulin‐conjugated particles showed high variability between individual fields of view, whereas the lysozyme‐conjugated particles were relatively homogeneously distributed. Further, the number per FoV was generally higher for β‐lactoglobulin‐ than for lysozyme‐conjugated SiO<sub>2</sub> NPs despite applying identical particle concentrations to the cover slides. This might indicate a lower conjugation efficiency of lysozyme, in line with a just very small difference in zeta potential value (Supplementary File <xref rid="jev212282-supitem-0005" ref-type="supplementary-material">5</xref>, Table <xref rid="jev212282-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref>), and/or a reduced binding of these particles to the cover slide. Consistently, the combined loading resulted in a higher number of β‐lactoglobulin than lysozyme‐positive particles, with approximately 80 % of double‐positive particles (Figure <xref rid="jev212282-fig-0009" ref-type="fig">9i</xref>, left panel). The mean sum intensity per particle was not reduced but slightly increased for combined loading of both proteins (Figure <xref rid="jev212282-fig-0009" ref-type="fig">9i</xref>, right panel), indicating that the loading of the two proteins is not competitive. Consistently, the single vesicle intensity distribution of the double coated particles showed a weak positive correlation between the two channels (Figure <xref rid="jev212282-fig-0009" ref-type="fig">9j</xref>, R<sup>2</sup> = 0.39), indicating that the loading of the two proteins was cooperative rather than competitive. Further in line with this conclusion, separating the population of particles from the combined loading into double and single positives (Figure <xref rid="jev212282-fig-0009" ref-type="fig">9k</xref>) reveals that the particles carrying both, lysozyme and β‐lactoglobulin are shifted to higher intensities in both channels.</p>
      <p>A more routine application of single vesicle imaging for non‐biological, respectively, inorganic nanoparticles may clearly benefit from further optimisation of the experimental conditions. Nonetheless, we conclude that EVAnalyzer can already be successfully applied to single particle quantification of nanoparticles beyond extracellular vesicles, even on suboptimal microscopy images.</p>

      <title>Single‐cell / single‐vesicle quantification of EV cell uptake by EVAnalyzer pipelines</title>
      <p>A recurring question in EV as well as nanoparticle research is the quantification of particle uptake into recipient cells. We therefore extended the EVAnalyzer features to enable quantification of internalised vesicles not only based on intracellular fluorescence intensities but also down to the single‐vesicle / single‐cell level. This requires both the identification of individual vesicles as well as image segmentation to define the cell area and segregation into single cells. We aimed to avoid the need for specific dyes to label the plasma membrane or cytosol. Instead, the EVAnalyzer pipeline was developed for cell area detection on brightfield images (‘EVCount per total cell area’), whereas the segregation into individual cells requires nuclear stains only (EVCount per cell’). Figure <xref rid="jev212282-fig-0010" ref-type="fig">10a</xref> shows the general workflow for processing images from cell uptake assays. For EV detection, the image is duplicated, blurred by applying a median filter, and subtracted from the original image. After additional smoothing, the same steps as described for ‘CountEVs’ (Figure <xref rid="jev212282-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) are used for EV object recognition. In a second set of processing steps, the cellular area is assigned from a user‐defined channel, whereas both, brightfield or fluorescence detection is suitable (‘Find Cell area’). The corresponding image is subjected to edge detection, smoothing and thresholding steps to create a cellular region of interest. Again, preview images are provided to facilitate manual threshold setting, however, auto thresholds have proven to work well for brightfield images. As a result, a binary image is created with only one region of interest, including all pixels assigned to the entire area of cells within a field of view. All detected EVs within this ROI can then be calculated (‘EVCount per total cell area’). Optionally, the total cell area can be further segregated into single cells (‘EVCount per cell’). This requires nuclear detection by, for example, DNA intercalating dyes such as DAPI or Hoechst, which is fed into the calculation of a Voronoi grid. This grid is then used to dissect the total cell area into individual cells. Optionally, cells which are only partially captured in the field of view can be eliminated based on lack or incomplete coverage of the nucleus (‘EV count per Cell‐ remove cropped cells’). To exemplify the process, we used Cy5‐NHS labelled HEK293T CD63‐mNeon EVs (Figure <xref rid="jev212282-fig-0007" ref-type="fig">7a</xref>) for uptake into A549 human lung epithelial cells at different concentrations. Cells were fixed after 60 min and nuclei were visualised with Hoechst. A typical image from widefield fluorescence microscopy (40x NA0.95) with maximum intensity projection of a z‐stack is shown in Figure <xref rid="jev212282-fig-0010" ref-type="fig">10b</xref>, illustrating both the original image and processing results obtained by EVAnalyzer. It is worth mentioning that EVAnalyzer also provides an option for automated z‐projection on serial images (max, min and average intensity projections), further minimising the need for manual image processing steps. Different options for quantification of the dose response data are shown in Figure <xref rid="jev212282-fig-0010" ref-type="fig">10c‐i</xref>. A dose‐dependent increase of EV internalisation can in principle already be inferred from total EV fluorescence intensity per total cell area (Figure <xref rid="jev212282-fig-0010" ref-type="fig">10c</xref>). However, in our example the Cy5‐NHS ester labelling resulted in substantially higher brightness and number of labelled vesicles than CD63‐mNeon fluorescence in the same sample (as demonstrated in Figure <xref rid="jev212282-fig-0007" ref-type="fig">7a</xref>). Accordingly, the increase in total mNeon signal within the cells was not sufficient to quantify the uptake based on total intensity on the background of the relatively high cellular autofluorescence in the 488 nm channel. Figure <xref rid="jev212282-fig-0010" ref-type="fig">10d</xref> demonstrates how this issue was resolved by detecting and quantifying the number of vesicles per cell, revealing a dose dependent saturation curve in both channels. Nearly all CD63‐mNeon positive intracellular spots showed also Cy5 signal (&gt; 90 %), consistent with the data obtained from single vesicle imaging of the same sample on coverslips (Figure <xref rid="jev212282-fig-0007" ref-type="fig">7a</xref> vs. Figure <xref rid="jev212282-fig-0010" ref-type="fig">10e</xref>). In contrast the fraction of Cy5 positive spots which also had CD63‐mNeon fluorescence was reduced ca 2‐fold after uptake and detection in the cells. This could be either due to a biased internalisation, or due to lower efficiency of mNeon fluorescence detection caused by cellular autofluorescence and/or quenching of mNeon within the cells. Additional features that can be extracted by EVAnalyzer are cellular size distribution histograms with an optional pixel‐to‐μm correction (Figure <xref rid="jev212282-fig-0010" ref-type="fig">10f</xref>), histograms of EV numbers per cell (Figure <xref rid="jev212282-fig-0010" ref-type="fig">10g</xref>), as well as 2D correlations of all features (Figure <xref rid="jev212282-fig-0010" ref-type="fig">10h‐i</xref>). For our uptake data, this reveals for example that the number of Cy5 and mNeon positive EVs detected within the cells increases linearly with the cell size (Figure <xref rid="jev212282-fig-0010" ref-type="fig">10f</xref>). Interestingly, a strong positive correlation was detected between the number of Cy5 and CD63mNeon EVs within the same cell. Given the low percentage of double positives, this indicates that both subpopulations (Cy5/CD63‐mNeon double positives and Cy5‐NHS positives/CD63‐mNeon negatives) are taken up by the same cell with the same efficiency (Figure <xref rid="jev212282-fig-0010" ref-type="fig">10i</xref>).</p>

    <title>DISCUSSION</title>
    <p>The complex biology of extracellular vesicles demands quantitative methods capable of resolving heterogeneous subpopulations at the single vesicle level (Arab et al., <xref rid="jev212282-bib-0001" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>). Methods like NTA and TRPS allow to determine the size and number of single particles and are now routinely used for basic characterisation of EV samples (Hartjes et al., <xref rid="jev212282-bib-0022" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). However, individual populations of vesicles not only differ in size, density, or morphology, but also in their molecular composition. Consequently, there is a need to link molecular information to individual vesicles. TEM has been a gold standard for EV visualisation and in principle allows for detection of molecular markers on individual vesicles by immunogold labelling (Su et al., <xref rid="jev212282-bib-0050" ref-type="bibr">2022</xref>). Since electron microscopy is generally limited in throughput and multiplexing possibilities, hard to standardise, and not readily accessible for every‐day sample characterisation, orthogonal technologies are required. Extensions of the NTA technology to include multiple fluorescence channels is an emerging opportunity to combine size information from single particle tracking with fluorescent detection of EV markers. However, NTA is inherently biased against small particles and currently still limited in detection sensitivity (Desgeorges et al., <xref rid="jev212282-bib-0013" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>).</p>
    <p>More recent developments which have impacted the field are based on advanced flow cytometry as well as surface capture methods. Key hurdles for EV flow cytometry are the low sensitivity of standard flow cytometers for particles smaller than approximately 200 nm in size, linked to pitfalls like coincidence, swarm detection and discrimination of antibody‐ or lipoprotein‐mediated background artefacts (Görgens et al., <xref rid="jev212282-bib-0019" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). A recent breakthrough was achieved by combining flow cytometry with imaging optics and CCD camera detection. In a systematic study, Gorgens and coworkers demonstrated the application of imaging flow cytometry (IMFC, commercialised by Luminex/Amnis Image Stream) for robust detection and quantification of EVs down to about 40 nm (Görgens et al., <xref rid="jev212282-bib-0019" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>), and meanwhile IMFC has seen more widespread use in the EV field (Li et al., <xref rid="jev212282-bib-0031" ref-type="bibr">2022</xref>; Ricklefs et al., <xref rid="jev212282-bib-0045" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>; Tertel et al., <xref rid="jev212282-bib-0054" ref-type="bibr">2022</xref>). Other approaches available are based on affinity‐capture of EVs on surfaces followed by light microscopy using scattering and/or fluorescence detection by proprietary technologies, such as from NanoView (‘ExoView’) or Oxford Nanoimaging amongst the most advanced implementations (<xref rid="jev212282-bib-0040" ref-type="bibr">Nanoview</xref>; <xref rid="jev212282-bib-0039" ref-type="bibr">Nanoimager</xref>). These technologies have started to prove powerful for quantitative single vesicle characterisation in various EV research areas (e.g., Gomes et al., <xref rid="jev212282-bib-0018" ref-type="bibr">2022</xref>; Melling et al., <xref rid="jev212282-bib-0034" ref-type="bibr">2022</xref>; Silva et al., <xref rid="jev212282-bib-0047" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>; Wolf et al., <xref rid="jev212282-bib-0063" ref-type="bibr">2022</xref>). The experimental challenges underlying robust single vesicle quantification of EVs and other submicron particles have created a need for guidelines in standardising and reporting. The recently published MIFlowCyt‐EV framework has addressed this for flow cytometry studies of EVs (Welsh et al., <xref rid="jev212282-bib-0060" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>).</p>
    <p>Commercialised platforms like IMFC, NanoView or ONI generally require integrated systems of specialised equipment, materials, and proprietary software. The significant costs and required expert operator know‐how limit the application primarily to labs highly specialised in EV research. This complicates a broad implementation across the dramatically growing community of researchers interested in EV biology. Since these technologies are proprietary in nature, they are inherently not open to community development. Also, they still face technical limitations such as a sensitivity‐based size limit of currently ca 40–200 nm in flow cytometry or detection biases due to affinity capture.</p>
    <p>We and others have shown that EVs are well suited for detection and single particle tracking by both confocal (Corso et al., <xref rid="jev212282-bib-0008" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>; Heusermann et al., <xref rid="jev212282-bib-0024" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>; Tian et al., <xref rid="jev212282-bib-0055" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>) as well as wide field fluorescence microscopy (Bağcı et al., <xref rid="jev212282-bib-0003" ref-type="bibr">2022</xref>; Burbidge et al., <xref rid="jev212282-bib-0005" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>; Corso et al., <xref rid="jev212282-bib-0008" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). Single vesicles can be detected and quantified as light diffraction limited spots after intrinsic labelling with FP‐tagged marker proteins (Corso et al., <xref rid="jev212282-bib-0008" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>; Heusermann et al., <xref rid="jev212282-bib-0024" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>) or immunostaining (Bağcı et al., <xref rid="jev212282-bib-0003" ref-type="bibr">2022</xref>; Burbidge et al., <xref rid="jev212282-bib-0005" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>; Han et al., <xref rid="jev212282-bib-0021" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>; Hartjes et al., <xref rid="jev212282-bib-0023" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>) when immobilised on optical surfaces. More recent studies have focused on more advanced microscopy techniques for imaging of individual EVs using custom developed TIRF (Han et al., <xref rid="jev212282-bib-0021" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>) or single molecule localisation microscopy setups (Strohmeier et al., <xref rid="jev212282-bib-0049" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>). Despite the development of these highly specialised applications, the fact that even standard widefield fluorescence microscopes can be used (Corso et al., <xref rid="jev212282-bib-0008" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>) provided an ideal starting point to derive a more generically usable, straightforward process for single vesicle quantification with standard laboratory equipment. This required both, robust, generically applicable SOPs and possibilities for automated image analysis. Notably, several commercial image analysis softwares provide features for spot detection such as Imaris/Bitplane, MatLab, as well as ScanR or other professional high content screening software. The fact that none of these, often costly proprietary tools have so far been widely applied in the EV field is symptomatic of the need for open access, simple tools tailored to EV applications.</p>
    <p>Fiji in contrast has grown into a widely used platform for microscope image analysis due to the open access–open‐source code spirit, enabling community development efforts. To date, several algorithms have been developed for spot detection in microscopy images (Smal et al., <xref rid="jev212282-bib-0048" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). Different Fiji plugins are available for spot detection in images ranging from microscopy of biological samples to astronomy, (e.g., ComDet or BIII (Katrukha, <xref rid="jev212282-bib-0027" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>; Kozubek &amp; B, <xref rid="jev212282-bib-0029" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>)). So far, these are limited to manual, image‐by‐image analysis, not allowing for automated batch processing, and have also not been systematically tested, optimised, and validated for EV applications. The development of EVAnalyzer was therefore originally driven by our own need for a robust, straightforward, and user‐friendly open access tool for automated image analysis to enable routine, high content single vesicle quantification. Developed by and for EV researchers in collaboration with programmers, EVAnalyzer was optimised and systematically tested for key applications in the EV research field. In our experience, the batch processing capability for automated analysis of large sets of images within one experimental series is an essential feature for practical use. First, it provides the throughput needed for routine analysis of larger sets of EV samples, where additionally technical replicate samples and multiple images per sample are advisable to obtain statistically significant quantitative data. Secondly, it ensures identical processing of all images within one series and comparability of results within the same experiment. The parameter setting for batch processing is facilitated by preview images in the GUI which illustrate the vesicle detection on the original images.</p>
    <p>Notably, it is difficult to obtain a ground truth for real EV samples since the absolute number of EVs adhering to the glass slide is unknown. Also, the spot detection with any kind of analysis will always depend on relative threshold setting and classification criteria–whether defined by human or artificial intelligence. Therefore, it is currently not possible to assess how many spots in a realistic image truly correspond to EVs. Synthetic images as a possible alternative would, however, again comprise a bias of what signal to noise is to be expected for different EV preparations. For validation of image analysis by EVAnalyzer, we therefore used experimentally obtained images of EV samples with subjective object classification by the human eye as a benchmark. A comparative study confirmed that automated analysis by EVAnalyzer obtained outputs very similar to the average results obtained by blinded, image‐by‐image analysis by four independent EV researchers. A certain operator bias was observed for manual image analysis, which was minimised when the same four persons used EVAnalyzer, whereas the analysis time for the same set of images was reduced from ca 40 min to &lt; 2 min.  Despite this validation of automated image processing by EVAnalyzer on representative, real EV samples, we advise to routinely spot check the results from automated batch processing for each analysis session. This is facilitated by the annotated output images, which are provided for each of the original images in the EVAnalyzer output files and allow scrutinising the settings for the automated image processing. The numerical data are provided in a systematically structured Excel file, with an overview sheet summarising the results for each image, hyperlinked to individual worksheets per image listing the data of each individual vesicle and cell.</p>
    <p>EVAnalyzer was optimised and tailored to answer typical questions in the EV research requiring single vesicle quantification, including the multiplexed characterisation of subpopulations based on immunostaining of EV markers, optimisation of genetic engineering, estimation of molecular loading densities, quantitative validation of antibodies for EV surface proteins in situ or determining the specificity and efficiency of EV labelling with fluorescent dyes. We particularly aimed to provide a SOP for EV immobilisation and immunostaining that is entirely based on standard materials and reagents, and compatible with imaging on standard fluorescence microscopes. This procedure was validated for both, purified and crude EV samples from diverse sources and species, ranging from human cell line‐derived EVs to food‐derived EVs. Notably, the EV capture and immunostaining protocol can even be applied directly in conditioned medium, which is a major benefit for practical use. In consequence, the procedure can be used, for example, for rapid assessment of EV sample quality during conditioning, using only 30–50 μl aliquots directly from the cell supernatant, thereby limiting the amount of required material, saving time and effort needed for sample clean up and additionally avoiding any bias by EV purification protocols. Our SOP has so far been well established for detection of FP‐tagged EVs, fluorescently labelled EVs or immunolabelling of surface markers. We would like to note that immunolabelling of luminal cargo has not been successful so far in our hands since the permeabilization resulted in loss of EVs from the surface, potentially due to lysis. Burbidge <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> reported immunolabelling of Tsg101 in EVs permeabilized by Saponin after immobilisation by spinoculation (Burbidge et al., <xref rid="jev212282-bib-0005" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>), although lacking validation of the antibody labelling with, for example, FP‐tagged Tsg101. It is therefore conceivable that detection of luminal proteins using our SOP may be possible with additional optimisation of the permeabilization conditions.  While we primarily intended to develop a process for relative rather than absolute quantification of EV subpopulations, the number of EVs unspecifically captured on regular quartz glass surfaces correlated remarkably well with the concentration in solution, at least within two orders of magnitude. We anticipate that either by spiking in internal standards, such as orthogonally labelled EVs, or measuring corresponding standard curves it may even be possible to back calculate from the number of captured EVs to the absolute concentration in solution. While this will require systematic validation for each specific type of EV sample, the ‘TS removal option’ of EVAnalyzer already provides a feature allowing for detection, quantification and subtraction of reference vesicles or beads.</p>
    <p>As a second major application area of EVAnalyzer, we developed specific pipelines for quantifying EV uptake at the single‐cell/single‐vesicle level. Uptake of EVs is often quantified by bulk fluorescence using flow cytometry which provides the required throughput for statistical analysis. Monitoring EV uptake by microscopy allows to reveal additional information such as the number of EVs per cell and their subcellular localisation, however, is primarily used for visualisation rather than quantification due to the need for automation; automated scanning microscopes as well as high throughput quantification tools are routinely used in industrial high throughput screening but often are not available in academic institutions. Addressing the latter, EVAnalyzer enables automated image batch processing required for quantitative imaging‐based cell uptake assays, irrespective of the microscopy platform. Importantly, comparing EV numbers and bulk fluorescence per cell within the same experiment (Figure <xref rid="jev212282-fig-0010" ref-type="fig">10</xref>) revealed that counting EV numbers per cell can be more sensitive than bulk fluorescence, especially for dim EV labels and channels with high autofluorescence. In addition, a colocalisation analysis of individual spots may reveal information that is lost upon bulk fluorescence measurements. EVAnalyzer currently does not include any features for quantifying subcellular EV localisation, which may be subject to future community developments.</p>
    <p>Current capabilities of EVAnalyzer comprise vesicle counts, colocalisation, and vesicle brightness as well as size, but notably the sizing of EVs based on spot analysis is not valid when diffraction limited microscopy is used. With the increasing availability of dSTORM, STED and other super‐resolution technologies, sizing of EVs by fluorescence microscopy is, however, within reach. We therefore tested the analysis of dSTORM super‐resolution images of EVs with single and multiple labels by EVAnalyzer (Supplementary File <xref rid="jev212282-supitem-0008" ref-type="supplementary-material">8</xref>). To use the current version of the plugin, images need to be pre‐processed to artificially bin clusters of blinking fluorophores into single spots. Thereby, EV numbers and colocalization can be quantified, but the size information is currently lost. Nevertheless, we anticipate that future adaptations should be straightforward to extract additional information from super‐resolution images such as cluster size and sub‐cluster numbers. With the source code accessible, EVAnalyzer may thus be a valuable community development platform to complement proprietary software for commercialised super‐resolution technologies.</p>
    <p>Given the robustness and simplicity of the process presented in this manuscript, we believe that further adaptations will enable also relative and absolute EV quantification in more complex samples such as serum, urine or histological sections, or advanced applications such as single vesicle imaging based enzymatic assays, some of which we are already testing. A more routine application of single vesicle imaging for non‐biological, respectively, inorganic nanoparticles may clearly benefit from further optimisation of the experimental conditions. Nonetheless, based on the examples we highlight in this manuscript we conclude that EVAnalyzer can already now be successfully applied to single particle quantification of LNPs or other synthetic nanoparticles, even on suboptimal microscopy images. To date, we have already shared EVAnalyzer as well as our SOP with collaborating labs and beta‐testers where the process has been successfully implemented and is already routinely used. Being now made generally available, we encourage further development of EVAnalyzer by the community, with feedback and post‐publication tracking via GitHub (<ext-link xlink:href="https://github.com/joda01/evanalyzer/issues" ext-link-type="uri">https://github.com/joda01/evanalyzer/issues</ext-link>). In conclusion, EVAnalyzer is a powerful, versatile, and easy‐to‐use tool for routine and widespread use both the EV and nanoparticle fields, as well as an ideal platform for open innovation for single vesicle imaging applications.</p>
