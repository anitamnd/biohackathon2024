      <p>ENDscript 2 is a friendly Web server for extracting and rendering a comprehensive
                    analysis of primary to quaternary protein structure information in an automated
                    way. This major upgrade has been fully re-engineered to enhance speed, accuracy
                    and usability with interactive 3D visualization. It takes advantage of the new
                    version 3 of ESPript, our well-known sequence alignment renderer, improved to
                    handle a large number of data with reduced computation time. From a single PDB
                    entry or file, ENDscript produces high quality figures displaying multiple
                    sequence alignment of proteins homologous to the query, colored according to
                    residue conservation. Furthermore, the experimental secondary structure elements
                    and a detailed set of relevant biophysical and structural data are depicted. All
                    this information and more are now mapped on interactive 3D PyMOL
                    representations. Thanks to its adaptive and rigorous algorithm, beginner to
                    expert users can modify settings to fine-tune ENDscript to their needs.
                    ENDscript has also been upgraded as an open platform for the visualization of
                    multiple biochemical and structural data coming from external biotool Web
                    servers, with both 2D and 3D representations. ENDscript 2 and ESPript 3 are
                    freely available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://endscript.ibcp.fr">http://endscript.ibcp.fr</ext-link>

    <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
    <p>Sequence similarity search and multiple sequence alignment (MSA) are methods of
                choice for solving or interpreting bioinformatics and biological problems (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). They can address many questions and thus are
                the basis of numerous evolutionary and comparative studies, e.g. homology
                identification, protein function, structure and interaction predictions,
                computer-aided mutagenesis, phylogenetic analyses, etc. Over the years, the
                exponential growth of sequence and structure databases content (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>) has raised several challenging issues concerning, e.g.
                data curation, storage, search, accessibility and visualization.</p>
    <p>The Web server ENDscript 1 (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>) was created in 2002 to facilitate the generation of
                figures containing a large amount of protein sequences and secondary structure
                information. Since then, similar programs have been released with extended
                functionalities (e.g. STRAP (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>), Aline (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>), Jalview 2 (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>) or PROMALS3D (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>)). ENDscript is
                derived from our well-known ESPript program that renders sequence similarities and
                secondary structure elements from aligned sequences with numerous options to
                optimize and enhance their depiction. ESPript version 1 (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>) and 2 (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>) belong
                to a family of programs developed for non-interactive MSAs representation (e.g.
                Alscript (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>), BoxShade or PRALINE (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>)). To date, several biotool Web servers are
                interfaced with ESPript: connections are available from T-Coffee (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>), NPS@ (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>),
                MultAlin (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>) (each performing sequence
                analyses and similarity searches) and from the protein domain database ProDom (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>).</p>
    <p>Here, we present ENDscript 2, a friendly Web server for extracting and rendering a
                comprehensive analysis of primary to quaternary protein structure information in an
                automated way. The new ENDscript 2 server (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://endscript.ibcp.fr">http://endscript.ibcp.fr</ext-link>) is a
                major upgrade of ENDscript 1.x, which has been entirely re-engineered to be faster
                and to process information from thousand of sequences and structures thanks to a
                parallel programming. It can now generate, with a few mouse clicks and without
                queuing, high quality figures with the new version 3 of ESPript (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://espript.ibcp.fr">http://espript.ibcp.fr</ext-link>) as well as interactive 3D representations
                with a novel automated PyMOL script generator. </p>
  </sec>
  <sec id="SEC2">
    <title>INPUT AND OUTPUTS</title>
    <p>ENDscript uses as query either a four-digit Protein Data Bank (PDB) identifier (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>) or an uploaded coordinate file conforming
                to the PDB format (nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), crystallographic structures and
                protein models are supported). From this query, ENDscript generates four distinct
                downloadable illustrations.</p>
    <p>The first one is a flat figure presenting the amino acid sequence of the PDB query
                adorned with secondary structure elements, solvent accessibility and hydropathy
                scales per residue (see an example in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). In addition and if applicable, non-crystallographic and
                crystallographic protein:ligand and protein:protein contacts as well as disulfide
                bridges are highlighted by specific markers. Several common hetero-compounds are
                automatically kept and are subsequently depicted by given symbols on the figure. The
                user can manually keep non-recognized hetero-compounds or monatomic elements
                contained in his PDB query.</p>

      <caption>
        <p>Sample of ENDscript representations obtained from the PDB entry 2CAH.
                            (<bold>A</bold>) Flat figure showing the sequence of 2CAH with secondary
                        structure elements presented on top (helices with squiggles,
                        β-strands with arrows and turns with TT letters). Solvent
                        accessibility is rendered by a first bar below the sequence (blue is
                        accessible, cyan is intermediate, white is buried) and hydropathy by a
                        second bar below (pink is hydrophobic, white is neutral, cyan is
                        hydrophilic). Bottom letters and symbols depict crystallographic,
                        protein:protein and protein:ligand contacts (see ‘Case
                        study’). (<bold>B</bold>) Excerpt from the second ENDscript flat
                        figure, showing the MSA of the 20 most homologous proteins to 2CAH (obtained
                        with a BLAST+ search against the PDBAA database). Known secondary structure
                        elements are displayed for all aligned sequences. Alternate residues are
                        highlighted by gray stars. Identical and similar residues are boxed in red
                        and yellow, respectively. (<bold>C</bold>) The ‘Sausage’
                        PyMOL representation showing a tube depiction of 2CAH, whose radius is
                        proportional to the mean rms deviation per residue between Cα pairs.
                        The tube is colored according to the level of sequence conservation, from
                        white (low score) to red (identity). The heme cofactor and bound NADPH are
                        presented in cyan ball-and-stick. Their contacting residues are presented in
                        light green ball-and-stick. (<bold>D</bold>) Screen capture of a PyMOL
                        session showing the biological tetrameric assembly of 2CAH. One monomer is
                        presented by its solvent accessible surface with the same color ramping and
                        orientation as in panel (C). The Cα traces of the three other
                        monomers are presented. On the right, the PyMOL control panel with preset
                        buttons allows to show and hide structural features compiled by
                        ENDscript.</p>
      </caption>
      <graphic xlink:href="gku316fig1"/>
    </fig>
    <p>The second illustration is also a flat figure showing, in addition to the previous
                information, an MSA of proteins homologous to the query and colored according to
                residue conservation (see an excerpt in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). The experimental secondary structure elements of each identified
                homologous protein are depicted at the top of the sequence block if their 3D
                structures are known.</p>
    <p>The third and fourth illustrations consist in two interactive 3D representations of
                the PDB query. To take advantage of these latter, the program PyMOL (The PyMOL
                Molecular Graphics System, Schrödinger LLC, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.pymol.org">http://www.pymol.org</ext-link>) has to be
                installed on the user's computer.</p>
    <p>The first PyMOL representation is named ‘Cartoon’: this is a ribbon
                depiction of the PDB query colored as a function of similarity scores calculated
                from the preceding MSA. The color ramping from white (low score) to red (identity)
                allows to quickly locate areas of weak and strong sequence conservation on the query
                structure. The second PyMOL representation is titled ‘Sausage’: it
                shows a variable tube depiction of the Cα trace of the query (see an example
                in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). For this representation, all
                homologous protein structures were superimposed on the PDB query and the radius of
                the tube is proportional to the mean rms deviation per residue between Cα
                pairs. The same white to red color ramping is used to visualize possible
                substitutions in sequence. Hence, the user can identify areas of weak and strong
                structural conservation and correlate this result with sequence conservation.</p>
    <p>For these two PyMOL representations, a solvent-accessible surface mapped with the
                same coloring code can be switched on or off via the PyMOL control panel (see an
                example in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>). If applicable, the user
                can also display an assortment of supplementary information compiled by ENDscript:
                biological assembly and multiple NMR models; disulfide bridges; nucleic acids,
                ligands or monatomic elements and their contacting residues; strictly conserved
                residues; PDB SITES markers.</p>
    <p>All these features are editable thanks to the PyMOL graphical user interface, and
                publication-quality pictures can rapidly be obtained with its built-in ray-tracing
                function. Depending on his skill in PyMOL usage, the user has the choice to download
                an all-in-one and ready-to-use PyMOL .pse session file, or a .zip archive file
                containing a PyMOL .pml script and associated required files to manually edit them
                to his need. Therefore, the user has full flexibility to customize these
                representations automatically produced by ENDscript.</p>
    <p>In addition, an MSA file with secondary structure elements in Stockholm format is
                generated by ENDscript and can be examined (and modified) online with the
                JalviewLite viewer (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Finally, hypertext
                links to the PDB record of each identified protein of known structure similar to the
                query are presented. The user can download a .zip file containing all these latter
                individually superimposed on the PDB query.</p>

    <title>NEW FEATURES AND IMPROVEMENTS</title>
    <sec id="SEC3-1">
      <title>Changes and new features in ESPript program and Web server</title>
      <p>The ENDscript Web server uses the core Fortran program ESPript in its backend.
                    The new version 3 of ESPript has been deeply modified to fulfill two key
                    requirements driven by ENDscript 2: minimizing its execution time and handling a
                    large number of data.</p>
      <p>For this purpose, OpenMP parallelization directives have been added to the
                    PostScript rendering core routines of ESPript in order to take advantage of
                    multicore and multiprocessor architectures. Hence, the resulting MSA PostScript
                    files are no more rendered line-by-line but in parallel by using as many
                    cores/processors the machine has. As a result, the execution time bottleneck
                    constituted by the rendering process has been drastically reduced, this
                    permitting the rapid depiction without queuing of up to 2500 aligned sequences
                    decorated with their secondary structure elements on 4500 columns.</p>
      <p>In addition, ESPript 3 now runs on an x86_64 platform, allowing the program to
                    address memory in a more efficient way and to handle very large tables. The
                    program was compiled with gfortran, part of the GNU Compiler Collection, with
                    the <italic>-mcmodel = medium</italic> flag to allocate tables exceeding 2GB.
                    This choice was essential as the data that ESPript is led to manage is growing
                    proportionally to the number of sequences and structures in databases
                    implemented in ENDscript.</p>
      <p>The ESPript graphical interface has been considerably revamped in order to better
                    meet the needs of the users who are now guided through the whole process by
                    tooltips, detailed help topics and a new tutorial accessible at any time. New
                    coloring schemes and markers have been implemented as well as output and paper
                    size formats: ESPript renders publication-quality illustrations in most common
                    file formats (PostScript, PDF, PNG, TIFF) and sizes (US letter, A4, A3, A0 and
                    the ‘Tapestry’ format—0.8 × 3.3
                    m—ideally fitted for depicting huge MSAs).</p>

      <title>New features and enhancements in ENDscript Web server</title>
      <p>Even if the general process scheme remains unchanged between version 1 and 2 of
                    ENDscript, we considerably re-engineered the initial code to enhance speed,
                    accuracy and usability.</p>
      <p>In this goal, the new ESPript 3 program, described above, was of primary
                    importance. In addition, helper programs, part of the ENDscript pipeline, were
                    chosen for their efficiency and their ability to use multicore machines. Hence,
                    we replaced the programs BLAST and ClustalW2 by their latest revisions (BLAST+
                        (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>) and Clustal Omega (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>), respectively) to gain in scalability,
                    accuracy and performance. In the same goal, two MSA programs were added to the
                    ENDscript pipeline, namely MAFFT (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>) and
                    MSAProbs (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>).</p>
      <p>In the previous version of ENDscript, only two sequence databases were available
                    (UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot and PDBAA, the sequence database derived from the PDB). In
                    ENDscript 2, we added 12 complete genome databases, the UniProtKB/TrEMBL as well
                    as the PDBAA95, PDBAA90, PDBAA70 and PDBAA50 containing the results of the
                    clustering of protein chains in the PDB at 95%, 90%, 70% and 50% sequence
                    identity, respectively (see Supplementary Table S1).</p>
      <p>As for the ESPript Web server, the ENDscript graphical user interface was utterly
                    remodeled for improved usability with tooltips, detailed help topics and
                    tutorial. The results, separated in hierarchical sections, are now presented in
                    a clearer manner. Finally, we opted for the molecular visualization program
                    PyMOL as default viewer for the interactive 3D representations as it is
                    multi-platform and widely adopted by biologists and structural biologists.
                    ENDscript takes full advantage of the convenient PyMOL control panel, notably of
                    its ability to show and hide information or objects with a single click, this
                    facilitating the analysis of the results. In consequence, the
                        <italic>PyMOL-ScriptMaker</italic> subroutine now supersedes the previous
                    MolScript/Bobscript scripting feature of ENDscript 1.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="SEC3-3">
      <title>ENDscript is open to external bioinformatics services</title>
      <p>In addition to the above-mentioned enhancements and new features, we designed
                    ENDscript 2 as an open platform for the visualization of multiple biochemical
                    and structural information. Indeed, ENDscript has the ability, for its primary
                    to quaternary structure representations, to depict a large range of
                    supplementary data coming from external sources. Hence, any biotool Web server
                    calculating or predicting structure-related properties can use ENDscript for an
                    effective display. This implies that ENDscript is supplied with a modified PDB
                    file conforming to some simple annotation conventions and modifications. In
                    practice, the property to be displayed by ENDscript must be numerically
                    expressed per residue or per atom in order to replace the B-factor or occupancy
                    values. A REMARK record in the PDB file header must specify a keyword associated
                    to the interfaced service as well as the minimal and maximal values of the
                    property—this allowing ENDscript to normalize the data. In concrete
                    terms, colored bars or special characters in the flat representations can
                    present this supplementary information. It can also be displayed in 3D with
                    PyMOL by highlighting the appropriate residues or atoms with specific coloring
                    scheme and/or by any other means (spheres, dots, meshes, surfaces, etc.).</p>
      <p>A proof of concept of this new ENDscript feature is presented in Supplementary
                    Data 1. Biotool Web server administrators interested in interfacing their
                    service with ENDscript can contact the authors to obtain the annotation rules
                    and the connection protocol.</p>

    <title>CASE STUDY</title>
    <p>Catalases are tetrameric heminic enzymes that decompose hydrogen peroxide into water
                and oxygen. They serve to protect cells from the toxic effects of hydrogen peroxide.
                As a case study, we used ENDscript to decipher features in the crystal structure of
                    <italic>Proteus mirabilis</italic> catalase (PDB entry 2CAH) (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>).</p>
    <p>The two fundamental residues of the heme-iron catalytic site are a distal histidine
                and a proximal tyrosine. A unique methionine sulfone is observed in the distal site
                of <italic>P. mirabilis</italic> catalase. Another peculiarity of this bacterial
                catalase is its ability to bind nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH)
                for the prevention of inactivation by hydrogen peroxide (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>).</p>
    <p>The first flat figure clearly shows that the catalase structure has an
                α+β topology (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref> and
                Supplementary Data 2). Moreover, the N-terminal region is involved in extensive
                protein:protein crystallographic contacts as shown by italic A letters below the
                sequence block. A red letter identifies a contact &lt; 3.2 Å while a
                black letter identifies a contact between 3.2 and 5 Å. Leu31 is positioned
                along a 2-fold crystallographic axis as shown by an italic hash symbol. Leu40 and
                Asp44 are in contact with the heme group of a symmetric monomer as shown by an
                italic colon. Asp44 is also involved in a protein:protein crystallographic contact
                as shown by a blue frame. Arg51 binds the heme group of the monomer as shown by a
                normal colon on a light yellow background. The non-standard residue in position 53
                (labeled X) is the methionine sulfone of the distal site. Phe140 may be a critical
                residue: it has close contacts with the heme group as shown by the red colon. It is
                also involved in protein:protein contacts as shown by the blue frame. Finally, it is
                involved both in crystallographic and non-crystallographic contacts as shown by the
                orange background. His173 binds tightly NADPH as shown by a red caret. The second
                flat figure (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref> and Supplementary Data
                3) reveals that secondary structure elements are well conserved in catalases
                deposited in the PDB.</p>
    <p>The 3D ‘Sausage’ representation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref> and Supplementary File 1) allows for emphasizing the Cα trace
                of the C-terminal region that varies between catalases (the tube radius is
                proportional to the mean rms deviation between 2CAH and homologous catalases). In
                agreement, the C-terminal region is poorly conserved in sequence and is mainly
                colored in white (color ramping from white, low conservation, to red, identity). By
                contrast the N-terminal region, which protrudes out of the protein core, is
                surprisingly well conserved. In fact, this region is deeply buried in the biological
                tetramer, this being visible by displaying the biological assembly (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref> and Supplementary File 1) automatically
                incorporated by ENDscript in the PyMOL session file. Finally, thanks to a preset
                button on its control panel, PyMOL can display the protein solvent accessible
                surface colored according to the level of sequence conservation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>).</p>

    <title>CONCLUSION</title>
    <p>ENDscript 2 is a major update of our joint ESPript/ENDscript Web service, which has
                benefited over the past decade of a mean of 1500 unique visitors a month from more
                than 25 countries submitting over 14 000 jobs monthly. It takes advantage of the new
                version 3 of ESPript, which previous releases total more than 2000 combined
                cross-citations in ‘Web of Science’ and are supported by the SBGrid
                Consortium (Harvard Medical School, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.sbgrid.org">http://www.sbgrid.org</ext-link>).</p>
    <p>The new ENDscript Web server has been conceived to be fast and convenient. Thanks to
                its automated pipeline and a parallel programming, ENDscript can deliver most
                results within 1 min. No particular knowledge in bioinformatics is needed to obtain
                comprehensive and relevant illustrations. However, demanding or expert users can
                modify settings to fine-tune ENDscript to their needs.</p>
    <p>For all these reasons, ENDscript is a tool of choice for biologists and structural
                biologists, which allows for generating with a few mouse clicks a set of detailed
                high quality figures and interactive 3D representations of their proteins of
                interest. With its simplified interface and its ability to quickly render the key
                features of any protein structure, ENDscript is also an effective educational tool,
                which can be used during courses or practical work sessions in structural
                biology.</p>

      <p>ENDscript 2 is a friendly Web server for extracting and rendering a comprehensive
                    analysis of primary to quaternary protein structure information in an automated
                    way. This major upgrade has been fully re-engineered to enhance speed, accuracy
                    and usability with interactive 3D visualization. It takes advantage of the new
                    version 3 of ESPript, our well-known sequence alignment renderer, improved to
                    handle a large number of data with reduced computation time. From a single PDB
                    entry or file, ENDscript produces high quality figures displaying multiple
                    sequence alignment of proteins homologous to the query, colored according to
                    residue conservation. Furthermore, the experimental secondary structure elements
                    and a detailed set of relevant biophysical and structural data are depicted. All
                    this information and more are now mapped on interactive 3D PyMOL
                    representations. Thanks to its adaptive and rigorous algorithm, beginner to
                    expert users can modify settings to fine-tune ENDscript to their needs.
                    ENDscript has also been upgraded as an open platform for the visualization of
                    multiple biochemical and structural data coming from external biotool Web
                    servers, with both 2D and 3D representations. ENDscript 2 and ESPript 3 are
                    freely available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://endscript.ibcp.fr">http://endscript.ibcp.fr</ext-link>

    <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
    <p>Sequence similarity search and multiple sequence alignment (MSA) are methods of
                choice for solving or interpreting bioinformatics and biological problems (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). They can address many questions and thus are
                the basis of numerous evolutionary and comparative studies, e.g. homology
                identification, protein function, structure and interaction predictions,
                computer-aided mutagenesis, phylogenetic analyses, etc. Over the years, the
                exponential growth of sequence and structure databases content (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>) has raised several challenging issues concerning, e.g.
                data curation, storage, search, accessibility and visualization.</p>
    <p>The Web server ENDscript 1 (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>) was created in 2002 to facilitate the generation of
                figures containing a large amount of protein sequences and secondary structure
                information. Since then, similar programs have been released with extended
                functionalities (e.g. STRAP (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>), Aline (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>), Jalview 2 (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>) or PROMALS3D (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>)). ENDscript is
                derived from our well-known ESPript program that renders sequence similarities and
                secondary structure elements from aligned sequences with numerous options to
                optimize and enhance their depiction. ESPript version 1 (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>) and 2 (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>) belong
                to a family of programs developed for non-interactive MSAs representation (e.g.
                Alscript (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>), BoxShade or PRALINE (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>)). To date, several biotool Web servers are
                interfaced with ESPript: connections are available from T-Coffee (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>), NPS@ (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>),
                MultAlin (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>) (each performing sequence
                analyses and similarity searches) and from the protein domain database ProDom (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>).</p>
    <p>Here, we present ENDscript 2, a friendly Web server for extracting and rendering a
                comprehensive analysis of primary to quaternary protein structure information in an
                automated way. The new ENDscript 2 server (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://endscript.ibcp.fr">http://endscript.ibcp.fr</ext-link>) is a
                major upgrade of ENDscript 1.x, which has been entirely re-engineered to be faster
                and to process information from thousand of sequences and structures thanks to a
                parallel programming. It can now generate, with a few mouse clicks and without
                queuing, high quality figures with the new version 3 of ESPript (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://espript.ibcp.fr">http://espript.ibcp.fr</ext-link>) as well as interactive 3D representations
                with a novel automated PyMOL script generator. </p>

  <sec id="SEC2">
    <title>INPUT AND OUTPUTS</title>
    <p>ENDscript uses as query either a four-digit Protein Data Bank (PDB) identifier (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>) or an uploaded coordinate file conforming
                to the PDB format (nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), crystallographic structures and
                protein models are supported). From this query, ENDscript generates four distinct
                downloadable illustrations.</p>
    <p>The first one is a flat figure presenting the amino acid sequence of the PDB query
                adorned with secondary structure elements, solvent accessibility and hydropathy
                scales per residue (see an example in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). In addition and if applicable, non-crystallographic and
                crystallographic protein:ligand and protein:protein contacts as well as disulfide
                bridges are highlighted by specific markers. Several common hetero-compounds are
                automatically kept and are subsequently depicted by given symbols on the figure. The
                user can manually keep non-recognized hetero-compounds or monatomic elements
                contained in his PDB query.</p>

      <caption>
        <p>Sample of ENDscript representations obtained from the PDB entry 2CAH.
                            (<bold>A</bold>) Flat figure showing the sequence of 2CAH with secondary
                        structure elements presented on top (helices with squiggles,
                        β-strands with arrows and turns with TT letters). Solvent
                        accessibility is rendered by a first bar below the sequence (blue is
                        accessible, cyan is intermediate, white is buried) and hydropathy by a
                        second bar below (pink is hydrophobic, white is neutral, cyan is
                        hydrophilic). Bottom letters and symbols depict crystallographic,
                        protein:protein and protein:ligand contacts (see ‘Case
                        study’). (<bold>B</bold>) Excerpt from the second ENDscript flat
                        figure, showing the MSA of the 20 most homologous proteins to 2CAH (obtained
                        with a BLAST+ search against the PDBAA database). Known secondary structure
                        elements are displayed for all aligned sequences. Alternate residues are
                        highlighted by gray stars. Identical and similar residues are boxed in red
                        and yellow, respectively. (<bold>C</bold>) The ‘Sausage’
                        PyMOL representation showing a tube depiction of 2CAH, whose radius is
                        proportional to the mean rms deviation per residue between Cα pairs.
                        The tube is colored according to the level of sequence conservation, from
                        white (low score) to red (identity). The heme cofactor and bound NADPH are
                        presented in cyan ball-and-stick. Their contacting residues are presented in
                        light green ball-and-stick. (<bold>D</bold>) Screen capture of a PyMOL
                        session showing the biological tetrameric assembly of 2CAH. One monomer is
                        presented by its solvent accessible surface with the same color ramping and
                        orientation as in panel (C). The Cα traces of the three other
                        monomers are presented. On the right, the PyMOL control panel with preset
                        buttons allows to show and hide structural features compiled by
                        ENDscript.</p>
      </caption>
      <graphic xlink:href="gku316fig1"/>
    </fig>
    <p>The second illustration is also a flat figure showing, in addition to the previous
                information, an MSA of proteins homologous to the query and colored according to
                residue conservation (see an excerpt in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). The experimental secondary structure elements of each identified
                homologous protein are depicted at the top of the sequence block if their 3D
                structures are known.</p>
    <p>The third and fourth illustrations consist in two interactive 3D representations of
                the PDB query. To take advantage of these latter, the program PyMOL (The PyMOL
                Molecular Graphics System, Schrödinger LLC, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.pymol.org">http://www.pymol.org</ext-link>) has to be
                installed on the user's computer.</p>
    <p>The first PyMOL representation is named ‘Cartoon’: this is a ribbon
                depiction of the PDB query colored as a function of similarity scores calculated
                from the preceding MSA. The color ramping from white (low score) to red (identity)
                allows to quickly locate areas of weak and strong sequence conservation on the query
                structure. The second PyMOL representation is titled ‘Sausage’: it
                shows a variable tube depiction of the Cα trace of the query (see an example
                in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). For this representation, all
                homologous protein structures were superimposed on the PDB query and the radius of
                the tube is proportional to the mean rms deviation per residue between Cα
                pairs. The same white to red color ramping is used to visualize possible
                substitutions in sequence. Hence, the user can identify areas of weak and strong
                structural conservation and correlate this result with sequence conservation.</p>
    <p>For these two PyMOL representations, a solvent-accessible surface mapped with the
                same coloring code can be switched on or off via the PyMOL control panel (see an
                example in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>). If applicable, the user
                can also display an assortment of supplementary information compiled by ENDscript:
                biological assembly and multiple NMR models; disulfide bridges; nucleic acids,
                ligands or monatomic elements and their contacting residues; strictly conserved
                residues; PDB SITES markers.</p>
    <p>All these features are editable thanks to the PyMOL graphical user interface, and
                publication-quality pictures can rapidly be obtained with its built-in ray-tracing
                function. Depending on his skill in PyMOL usage, the user has the choice to download
                an all-in-one and ready-to-use PyMOL .pse session file, or a .zip archive file
                containing a PyMOL .pml script and associated required files to manually edit them
                to his need. Therefore, the user has full flexibility to customize these
                representations automatically produced by ENDscript.</p>
    <p>In addition, an MSA file with secondary structure elements in Stockholm format is
                generated by ENDscript and can be examined (and modified) online with the
                JalviewLite viewer (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Finally, hypertext
                links to the PDB record of each identified protein of known structure similar to the
                query are presented. The user can download a .zip file containing all these latter
                individually superimposed on the PDB query.</p>

    <title>NEW FEATURES AND IMPROVEMENTS</title>
    <sec id="SEC3-1">
      <title>Changes and new features in ESPript program and Web server</title>
      <p>The ENDscript Web server uses the core Fortran program ESPript in its backend.
                    The new version 3 of ESPript has been deeply modified to fulfill two key
                    requirements driven by ENDscript 2: minimizing its execution time and handling a
                    large number of data.</p>
      <p>For this purpose, OpenMP parallelization directives have been added to the
                    PostScript rendering core routines of ESPript in order to take advantage of
                    multicore and multiprocessor architectures. Hence, the resulting MSA PostScript
                    files are no more rendered line-by-line but in parallel by using as many
                    cores/processors the machine has. As a result, the execution time bottleneck
                    constituted by the rendering process has been drastically reduced, this
                    permitting the rapid depiction without queuing of up to 2500 aligned sequences
                    decorated with their secondary structure elements on 4500 columns.</p>
      <p>In addition, ESPript 3 now runs on an x86_64 platform, allowing the program to
                    address memory in a more efficient way and to handle very large tables. The
                    program was compiled with gfortran, part of the GNU Compiler Collection, with
                    the <italic>-mcmodel = medium</italic> flag to allocate tables exceeding 2GB.
                    This choice was essential as the data that ESPript is led to manage is growing
                    proportionally to the number of sequences and structures in databases
                    implemented in ENDscript.</p>
      <p>The ESPript graphical interface has been considerably revamped in order to better
                    meet the needs of the users who are now guided through the whole process by
                    tooltips, detailed help topics and a new tutorial accessible at any time. New
                    coloring schemes and markers have been implemented as well as output and paper
                    size formats: ESPript renders publication-quality illustrations in most common
                    file formats (PostScript, PDF, PNG, TIFF) and sizes (US letter, A4, A3, A0 and
                    the ‘Tapestry’ format—0.8 × 3.3
                    m—ideally fitted for depicting huge MSAs).</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="SEC3-2">
      <title>New features and enhancements in ENDscript Web server</title>
      <p>Even if the general process scheme remains unchanged between version 1 and 2 of
                    ENDscript, we considerably re-engineered the initial code to enhance speed,
                    accuracy and usability.</p>
      <p>In this goal, the new ESPript 3 program, described above, was of primary
                    importance. In addition, helper programs, part of the ENDscript pipeline, were
                    chosen for their efficiency and their ability to use multicore machines. Hence,
                    we replaced the programs BLAST and ClustalW2 by their latest revisions (BLAST+
                        (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>) and Clustal Omega (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>), respectively) to gain in scalability,
                    accuracy and performance. In the same goal, two MSA programs were added to the
                    ENDscript pipeline, namely MAFFT (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>) and
                    MSAProbs (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>).</p>
      <p>In the previous version of ENDscript, only two sequence databases were available
                    (UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot and PDBAA, the sequence database derived from the PDB). In
                    ENDscript 2, we added 12 complete genome databases, the UniProtKB/TrEMBL as well
                    as the PDBAA95, PDBAA90, PDBAA70 and PDBAA50 containing the results of the
                    clustering of protein chains in the PDB at 95%, 90%, 70% and 50% sequence
                    identity, respectively (see Supplementary Table S1).</p>
      <p>As for the ESPript Web server, the ENDscript graphical user interface was utterly
                    remodeled for improved usability with tooltips, detailed help topics and
                    tutorial. The results, separated in hierarchical sections, are now presented in
                    a clearer manner. Finally, we opted for the molecular visualization program
                    PyMOL as default viewer for the interactive 3D representations as it is
                    multi-platform and widely adopted by biologists and structural biologists.
                    ENDscript takes full advantage of the convenient PyMOL control panel, notably of
                    its ability to show and hide information or objects with a single click, this
                    facilitating the analysis of the results. In consequence, the
                        <italic>PyMOL-ScriptMaker</italic> subroutine now supersedes the previous
                    MolScript/Bobscript scripting feature of ENDscript 1.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="SEC3-3">
      <title>ENDscript is open to external bioinformatics services</title>
      <p>In addition to the above-mentioned enhancements and new features, we designed
                    ENDscript 2 as an open platform for the visualization of multiple biochemical
                    and structural information. Indeed, ENDscript has the ability, for its primary
                    to quaternary structure representations, to depict a large range of
                    supplementary data coming from external sources. Hence, any biotool Web server
                    calculating or predicting structure-related properties can use ENDscript for an
                    effective display. This implies that ENDscript is supplied with a modified PDB
                    file conforming to some simple annotation conventions and modifications. In
                    practice, the property to be displayed by ENDscript must be numerically
                    expressed per residue or per atom in order to replace the B-factor or occupancy
                    values. A REMARK record in the PDB file header must specify a keyword associated
                    to the interfaced service as well as the minimal and maximal values of the
                    property—this allowing ENDscript to normalize the data. In concrete
                    terms, colored bars or special characters in the flat representations can
                    present this supplementary information. It can also be displayed in 3D with
                    PyMOL by highlighting the appropriate residues or atoms with specific coloring
                    scheme and/or by any other means (spheres, dots, meshes, surfaces, etc.).</p>
      <p>A proof of concept of this new ENDscript feature is presented in Supplementary
                    Data 1. Biotool Web server administrators interested in interfacing their
                    service with ENDscript can contact the authors to obtain the annotation rules
                    and the connection protocol.</p>

    <title>CASE STUDY</title>
    <p>Catalases are tetrameric heminic enzymes that decompose hydrogen peroxide into water
                and oxygen. They serve to protect cells from the toxic effects of hydrogen peroxide.
                As a case study, we used ENDscript to decipher features in the crystal structure of
                    <italic>Proteus mirabilis</italic> catalase (PDB entry 2CAH) (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>).</p>
    <p>The two fundamental residues of the heme-iron catalytic site are a distal histidine
                and a proximal tyrosine. A unique methionine sulfone is observed in the distal site
                of <italic>P. mirabilis</italic> catalase. Another peculiarity of this bacterial
                catalase is its ability to bind nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH)
                for the prevention of inactivation by hydrogen peroxide (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>).</p>
    <p>The first flat figure clearly shows that the catalase structure has an
                α+β topology (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref> and
                Supplementary Data 2). Moreover, the N-terminal region is involved in extensive
                protein:protein crystallographic contacts as shown by italic A letters below the
                sequence block. A red letter identifies a contact &lt; 3.2 Å while a
                black letter identifies a contact between 3.2 and 5 Å. Leu31 is positioned
                along a 2-fold crystallographic axis as shown by an italic hash symbol. Leu40 and
                Asp44 are in contact with the heme group of a symmetric monomer as shown by an
                italic colon. Asp44 is also involved in a protein:protein crystallographic contact
                as shown by a blue frame. Arg51 binds the heme group of the monomer as shown by a
                normal colon on a light yellow background. The non-standard residue in position 53
                (labeled X) is the methionine sulfone of the distal site. Phe140 may be a critical
                residue: it has close contacts with the heme group as shown by the red colon. It is
                also involved in protein:protein contacts as shown by the blue frame. Finally, it is
                involved both in crystallographic and non-crystallographic contacts as shown by the
                orange background. His173 binds tightly NADPH as shown by a red caret. The second
                flat figure (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref> and Supplementary Data
                3) reveals that secondary structure elements are well conserved in catalases
                deposited in the PDB.</p>
    <p>The 3D ‘Sausage’ representation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref> and Supplementary File 1) allows for emphasizing the Cα trace
                of the C-terminal region that varies between catalases (the tube radius is
                proportional to the mean rms deviation between 2CAH and homologous catalases). In
                agreement, the C-terminal region is poorly conserved in sequence and is mainly
                colored in white (color ramping from white, low conservation, to red, identity). By
                contrast the N-terminal region, which protrudes out of the protein core, is
                surprisingly well conserved. In fact, this region is deeply buried in the biological
                tetramer, this being visible by displaying the biological assembly (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref> and Supplementary File 1) automatically
                incorporated by ENDscript in the PyMOL session file. Finally, thanks to a preset
                button on its control panel, PyMOL can display the protein solvent accessible
                surface colored according to the level of sequence conservation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>).</p>

    <title>CONCLUSION</title>
    <p>ENDscript 2 is a major update of our joint ESPript/ENDscript Web service, which has
                benefited over the past decade of a mean of 1500 unique visitors a month from more
                than 25 countries submitting over 14 000 jobs monthly. It takes advantage of the new
                version 3 of ESPript, which previous releases total more than 2000 combined
                cross-citations in ‘Web of Science’ and are supported by the SBGrid
                Consortium (Harvard Medical School, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.sbgrid.org">http://www.sbgrid.org</ext-link>).</p>
    <p>The new ENDscript Web server has been conceived to be fast and convenient. Thanks to
                its automated pipeline and a parallel programming, ENDscript can deliver most
                results within 1 min. No particular knowledge in bioinformatics is needed to obtain
                comprehensive and relevant illustrations. However, demanding or expert users can
                modify settings to fine-tune ENDscript to their needs.</p>
    <p>For all these reasons, ENDscript is a tool of choice for biologists and structural
                biologists, which allows for generating with a few mouse clicks a set of detailed
                high quality figures and interactive 3D representations of their proteins of
                interest. With its simplified interface and its ability to quickly render the key
                features of any protein structure, ENDscript is also an effective educational tool,
                which can be used during courses or practical work sessions in structural
                biology.</p>

      <p>ENDscript 2 is a friendly Web server for extracting and rendering a comprehensive
                    analysis of primary to quaternary protein structure information in an automated
                    way. This major upgrade has been fully re-engineered to enhance speed, accuracy
                    and usability with interactive 3D visualization. It takes advantage of the new
                    version 3 of ESPript, our well-known sequence alignment renderer, improved to
                    handle a large number of data with reduced computation time. From a single PDB
                    entry or file, ENDscript produces high quality figures displaying multiple
                    sequence alignment of proteins homologous to the query, colored according to
                    residue conservation. Furthermore, the experimental secondary structure elements
                    and a detailed set of relevant biophysical and structural data are depicted. All
                    this information and more are now mapped on interactive 3D PyMOL
                    representations. Thanks to its adaptive and rigorous algorithm, beginner to
                    expert users can modify settings to fine-tune ENDscript to their needs.
                    ENDscript has also been upgraded as an open platform for the visualization of
                    multiple biochemical and structural data coming from external biotool Web
                    servers, with both 2D and 3D representations. ENDscript 2 and ESPript 3 are
                    freely available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://endscript.ibcp.fr">http://endscript.ibcp.fr</ext-link>

    <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
    <p>Sequence similarity search and multiple sequence alignment (MSA) are methods of
                choice for solving or interpreting bioinformatics and biological problems (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). They can address many questions and thus are
                the basis of numerous evolutionary and comparative studies, e.g. homology
                identification, protein function, structure and interaction predictions,
                computer-aided mutagenesis, phylogenetic analyses, etc. Over the years, the
                exponential growth of sequence and structure databases content (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>) has raised several challenging issues concerning, e.g.
                data curation, storage, search, accessibility and visualization.</p>
    <p>The Web server ENDscript 1 (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>) was created in 2002 to facilitate the generation of
                figures containing a large amount of protein sequences and secondary structure
                information. Since then, similar programs have been released with extended
                functionalities (e.g. STRAP (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>), Aline (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>), Jalview 2 (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>) or PROMALS3D (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>)). ENDscript is
                derived from our well-known ESPript program that renders sequence similarities and
                secondary structure elements from aligned sequences with numerous options to
                optimize and enhance their depiction. ESPript version 1 (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>) and 2 (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>) belong
                to a family of programs developed for non-interactive MSAs representation (e.g.
                Alscript (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>), BoxShade or PRALINE (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>)). To date, several biotool Web servers are
                interfaced with ESPript: connections are available from T-Coffee (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>), NPS@ (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>),
                MultAlin (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>) (each performing sequence
                analyses and similarity searches) and from the protein domain database ProDom (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>).</p>
    <p>Here, we present ENDscript 2, a friendly Web server for extracting and rendering a
                comprehensive analysis of primary to quaternary protein structure information in an
                automated way. The new ENDscript 2 server (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://endscript.ibcp.fr">http://endscript.ibcp.fr</ext-link>) is a
                major upgrade of ENDscript 1.x, which has been entirely re-engineered to be faster
                and to process information from thousand of sequences and structures thanks to a
                parallel programming. It can now generate, with a few mouse clicks and without
                queuing, high quality figures with the new version 3 of ESPript (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://espript.ibcp.fr">http://espript.ibcp.fr</ext-link>) as well as interactive 3D representations
                with a novel automated PyMOL script generator. </p>

  <sec id="SEC2">
    <title>INPUT AND OUTPUTS</title>
    <p>ENDscript uses as query either a four-digit Protein Data Bank (PDB) identifier (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>) or an uploaded coordinate file conforming
                to the PDB format (nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), crystallographic structures and
                protein models are supported). From this query, ENDscript generates four distinct
                downloadable illustrations.</p>
    <p>The first one is a flat figure presenting the amino acid sequence of the PDB query
                adorned with secondary structure elements, solvent accessibility and hydropathy
                scales per residue (see an example in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). In addition and if applicable, non-crystallographic and
                crystallographic protein:ligand and protein:protein contacts as well as disulfide
                bridges are highlighted by specific markers. Several common hetero-compounds are
                automatically kept and are subsequently depicted by given symbols on the figure. The
                user can manually keep non-recognized hetero-compounds or monatomic elements
                contained in his PDB query.</p>

        <p>Sample of ENDscript representations obtained from the PDB entry 2CAH.
                            (<bold>A</bold>) Flat figure showing the sequence of 2CAH with secondary
                        structure elements presented on top (helices with squiggles,
                        β-strands with arrows and turns with TT letters). Solvent
                        accessibility is rendered by a first bar below the sequence (blue is
                        accessible, cyan is intermediate, white is buried) and hydropathy by a
                        second bar below (pink is hydrophobic, white is neutral, cyan is
                        hydrophilic). Bottom letters and symbols depict crystallographic,
                        protein:protein and protein:ligand contacts (see ‘Case
                        study’). (<bold>B</bold>) Excerpt from the second ENDscript flat
                        figure, showing the MSA of the 20 most homologous proteins to 2CAH (obtained
                        with a BLAST+ search against the PDBAA database). Known secondary structure
                        elements are displayed for all aligned sequences. Alternate residues are
                        highlighted by gray stars. Identical and similar residues are boxed in red
                        and yellow, respectively. (<bold>C</bold>) The ‘Sausage’
                        PyMOL representation showing a tube depiction of 2CAH, whose radius is
                        proportional to the mean rms deviation per residue between Cα pairs.
                        The tube is colored according to the level of sequence conservation, from
                        white (low score) to red (identity). The heme cofactor and bound NADPH are
                        presented in cyan ball-and-stick. Their contacting residues are presented in
                        light green ball-and-stick. (<bold>D</bold>) Screen capture of a PyMOL
                        session showing the biological tetrameric assembly of 2CAH. One monomer is
                        presented by its solvent accessible surface with the same color ramping and
                        orientation as in panel (C). The Cα traces of the three other
                        monomers are presented. On the right, the PyMOL control panel with preset
                        buttons allows to show and hide structural features compiled by
                        ENDscript.</p>

                information, an MSA of proteins homologous to the query and colored according to
                residue conservation (see an excerpt in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). The experimental secondary structure elements of each identified
                homologous protein are depicted at the top of the sequence block if their 3D
                structures are known.</p>
    <p>The third and fourth illustrations consist in two interactive 3D representations of
                the PDB query. To take advantage of these latter, the program PyMOL (The PyMOL
                Molecular Graphics System, Schrödinger LLC, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.pymol.org">http://www.pymol.org</ext-link>) has to be
                installed on the user's computer.</p>
    <p>The first PyMOL representation is named ‘Cartoon’: this is a ribbon
                depiction of the PDB query colored as a function of similarity scores calculated
                from the preceding MSA. The color ramping from white (low score) to red (identity)
                allows to quickly locate areas of weak and strong sequence conservation on the query
                structure. The second PyMOL representation is titled ‘Sausage’: it
                shows a variable tube depiction of the Cα trace of the query (see an example
                in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). For this representation, all
                homologous protein structures were superimposed on the PDB query and the radius of
                the tube is proportional to the mean rms deviation per residue between Cα
                pairs. The same white to red color ramping is used to visualize possible
                substitutions in sequence. Hence, the user can identify areas of weak and strong
                structural conservation and correlate this result with sequence conservation.</p>
    <p>For these two PyMOL representations, a solvent-accessible surface mapped with the
                same coloring code can be switched on or off via the PyMOL control panel (see an
                example in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>). If applicable, the user
                can also display an assortment of supplementary information compiled by ENDscript:
                biological assembly and multiple NMR models; disulfide bridges; nucleic acids,
                ligands or monatomic elements and their contacting residues; strictly conserved
                residues; PDB SITES markers.</p>
    <p>All these features are editable thanks to the PyMOL graphical user interface, and
                publication-quality pictures can rapidly be obtained with its built-in ray-tracing
                function. Depending on his skill in PyMOL usage, the user has the choice to download
                an all-in-one and ready-to-use PyMOL .pse session file, or a .zip archive file
                containing a PyMOL .pml script and associated required files to manually edit them
                to his need. Therefore, the user has full flexibility to customize these
                representations automatically produced by ENDscript.</p>
    <p>In addition, an MSA file with secondary structure elements in Stockholm format is
                generated by ENDscript and can be examined (and modified) online with the
                JalviewLite viewer (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Finally, hypertext
                links to the PDB record of each identified protein of known structure similar to the
                query are presented. The user can download a .zip file containing all these latter
                individually superimposed on the PDB query.</p>

    <title>NEW FEATURES AND IMPROVEMENTS</title>
    <sec id="SEC3-1">
      <title>Changes and new features in ESPript program and Web server</title>
      <p>The ENDscript Web server uses the core Fortran program ESPript in its backend.
                    The new version 3 of ESPript has been deeply modified to fulfill two key
                    requirements driven by ENDscript 2: minimizing its execution time and handling a
                    large number of data.</p>
      <p>For this purpose, OpenMP parallelization directives have been added to the
                    PostScript rendering core routines of ESPript in order to take advantage of
                    multicore and multiprocessor architectures. Hence, the resulting MSA PostScript
                    files are no more rendered line-by-line but in parallel by using as many
                    cores/processors the machine has. As a result, the execution time bottleneck
                    constituted by the rendering process has been drastically reduced, this
                    permitting the rapid depiction without queuing of up to 2500 aligned sequences
                    decorated with their secondary structure elements on 4500 columns.</p>
      <p>In addition, ESPript 3 now runs on an x86_64 platform, allowing the program to
                    address memory in a more efficient way and to handle very large tables. The
                    program was compiled with gfortran, part of the GNU Compiler Collection, with
                    the <italic>-mcmodel = medium</italic> flag to allocate tables exceeding 2GB.
                    This choice was essential as the data that ESPript is led to manage is growing
                    proportionally to the number of sequences and structures in databases
                    implemented in ENDscript.</p>
      <p>The ESPript graphical interface has been considerably revamped in order to better
                    meet the needs of the users who are now guided through the whole process by
                    tooltips, detailed help topics and a new tutorial accessible at any time. New
                    coloring schemes and markers have been implemented as well as output and paper
                    size formats: ESPript renders publication-quality illustrations in most common
                    file formats (PostScript, PDF, PNG, TIFF) and sizes (US letter, A4, A3, A0 and
                    the ‘Tapestry’ format—0.8 × 3.3
                    m—ideally fitted for depicting huge MSAs).</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="SEC3-2">
      <title>New features and enhancements in ENDscript Web server</title>
      <p>Even if the general process scheme remains unchanged between version 1 and 2 of
                    ENDscript, we considerably re-engineered the initial code to enhance speed,
                    accuracy and usability.</p>
      <p>In this goal, the new ESPript 3 program, described above, was of primary
                    importance. In addition, helper programs, part of the ENDscript pipeline, were
                    chosen for their efficiency and their ability to use multicore machines. Hence,
                    we replaced the programs BLAST and ClustalW2 by their latest revisions (BLAST+
                        (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>) and Clustal Omega (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>), respectively) to gain in scalability,
                    accuracy and performance. In the same goal, two MSA programs were added to the
                    ENDscript pipeline, namely MAFFT (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>) and
                    MSAProbs (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>).</p>
      <p>In the previous version of ENDscript, only two sequence databases were available
                    (UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot and PDBAA, the sequence database derived from the PDB). In
                    ENDscript 2, we added 12 complete genome databases, the UniProtKB/TrEMBL as well
                    as the PDBAA95, PDBAA90, PDBAA70 and PDBAA50 containing the results of the
                    clustering of protein chains in the PDB at 95%, 90%, 70% and 50% sequence
                    identity, respectively (see Supplementary Table S1).</p>
      <p>As for the ESPript Web server, the ENDscript graphical user interface was utterly
                    remodeled for improved usability with tooltips, detailed help topics and
                    tutorial. The results, separated in hierarchical sections, are now presented in
                    a clearer manner. Finally, we opted for the molecular visualization program
                    PyMOL as default viewer for the interactive 3D representations as it is
                    multi-platform and widely adopted by biologists and structural biologists.
                    ENDscript takes full advantage of the convenient PyMOL control panel, notably of
                    its ability to show and hide information or objects with a single click, this
                    facilitating the analysis of the results. In consequence, the
                        <italic>PyMOL-ScriptMaker</italic> subroutine now supersedes the previous
                    MolScript/Bobscript scripting feature of ENDscript 1.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="SEC3-3">
      <title>ENDscript is open to external bioinformatics services</title>
      <p>In addition to the above-mentioned enhancements and new features, we designed
                    ENDscript 2 as an open platform for the visualization of multiple biochemical
                    and structural information. Indeed, ENDscript has the ability, for its primary
                    to quaternary structure representations, to depict a large range of
                    supplementary data coming from external sources. Hence, any biotool Web server
                    calculating or predicting structure-related properties can use ENDscript for an
                    effective display. This implies that ENDscript is supplied with a modified PDB
                    file conforming to some simple annotation conventions and modifications. In
                    practice, the property to be displayed by ENDscript must be numerically
                    expressed per residue or per atom in order to replace the B-factor or occupancy
                    values. A REMARK record in the PDB file header must specify a keyword associated
                    to the interfaced service as well as the minimal and maximal values of the
                    property—this allowing ENDscript to normalize the data. In concrete
                    terms, colored bars or special characters in the flat representations can
                    present this supplementary information. It can also be displayed in 3D with
                    PyMOL by highlighting the appropriate residues or atoms with specific coloring
                    scheme and/or by any other means (spheres, dots, meshes, surfaces, etc.).</p>
      <p>A proof of concept of this new ENDscript feature is presented in Supplementary
                    Data 1. Biotool Web server administrators interested in interfacing their
                    service with ENDscript can contact the authors to obtain the annotation rules
                    and the connection protocol.</p>

    <title>CASE STUDY</title>
    <p>Catalases are tetrameric heminic enzymes that decompose hydrogen peroxide into water
                and oxygen. They serve to protect cells from the toxic effects of hydrogen peroxide.
                As a case study, we used ENDscript to decipher features in the crystal structure of
                    <italic>Proteus mirabilis</italic> catalase (PDB entry 2CAH) (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>).</p>
    <p>The two fundamental residues of the heme-iron catalytic site are a distal histidine
                and a proximal tyrosine. A unique methionine sulfone is observed in the distal site
                of <italic>P. mirabilis</italic> catalase. Another peculiarity of this bacterial
                catalase is its ability to bind nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH)
                for the prevention of inactivation by hydrogen peroxide (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>).</p>
    <p>The first flat figure clearly shows that the catalase structure has an
                α+β topology (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref> and
                Supplementary Data 2). Moreover, the N-terminal region is involved in extensive
                protein:protein crystallographic contacts as shown by italic A letters below the
                sequence block. A red letter identifies a contact &lt; 3.2 Å while a
                black letter identifies a contact between 3.2 and 5 Å. Leu31 is positioned
                along a 2-fold crystallographic axis as shown by an italic hash symbol. Leu40 and
                Asp44 are in contact with the heme group of a symmetric monomer as shown by an
                italic colon. Asp44 is also involved in a protein:protein crystallographic contact
                as shown by a blue frame. Arg51 binds the heme group of the monomer as shown by a
                normal colon on a light yellow background. The non-standard residue in position 53
                (labeled X) is the methionine sulfone of the distal site. Phe140 may be a critical
                residue: it has close contacts with the heme group as shown by the red colon. It is
                also involved in protein:protein contacts as shown by the blue frame. Finally, it is
                involved both in crystallographic and non-crystallographic contacts as shown by the
                orange background. His173 binds tightly NADPH as shown by a red caret. The second
                flat figure (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref> and Supplementary Data
                3) reveals that secondary structure elements are well conserved in catalases
                deposited in the PDB.</p>
    <p>The 3D ‘Sausage’ representation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref> and Supplementary File 1) allows for emphasizing the Cα trace
                of the C-terminal region that varies between catalases (the tube radius is
                proportional to the mean rms deviation between 2CAH and homologous catalases). In
                agreement, the C-terminal region is poorly conserved in sequence and is mainly
                colored in white (color ramping from white, low conservation, to red, identity). By
                contrast the N-terminal region, which protrudes out of the protein core, is
                surprisingly well conserved. In fact, this region is deeply buried in the biological
                tetramer, this being visible by displaying the biological assembly (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref> and Supplementary File 1) automatically
                incorporated by ENDscript in the PyMOL session file. Finally, thanks to a preset
                button on its control panel, PyMOL can display the protein solvent accessible
                surface colored according to the level of sequence conservation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>).</p>

    <title>CONCLUSION</title>
    <p>ENDscript 2 is a major update of our joint ESPript/ENDscript Web service, which has
                benefited over the past decade of a mean of 1500 unique visitors a month from more
                than 25 countries submitting over 14 000 jobs monthly. It takes advantage of the new
                version 3 of ESPript, which previous releases total more than 2000 combined
                cross-citations in ‘Web of Science’ and are supported by the SBGrid
                Consortium (Harvard Medical School, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.sbgrid.org">http://www.sbgrid.org</ext-link>).</p>
    <p>The new ENDscript Web server has been conceived to be fast and convenient. Thanks to
                its automated pipeline and a parallel programming, ENDscript can deliver most
                results within 1 min. No particular knowledge in bioinformatics is needed to obtain
                comprehensive and relevant illustrations. However, demanding or expert users can
                modify settings to fine-tune ENDscript to their needs.</p>
    <p>For all these reasons, ENDscript is a tool of choice for biologists and structural
                biologists, which allows for generating with a few mouse clicks a set of detailed
                high quality figures and interactive 3D representations of their proteins of
                interest. With its simplified interface and its ability to quickly render the key
                features of any protein structure, ENDscript is also an effective educational tool,
                which can be used during courses or practical work sessions in structural
                biology.</p>
