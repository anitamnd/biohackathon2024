        <title>Motivation</title>
        <p>Recent advancements in long-read RNA sequencing have enabled the examination of full-length isoforms, previously uncaptured by short-read sequencing methods. An alternative powerful method for studying isoforms is through the use of barcoded short-read RNA reads, for which a barcode indicates whether two short-reads arise from the same molecule or not. Such techniques included the 10x Genomics linked-read based SParse Isoform Sequencing (SPIso-seq), as well as Loop-Seq, or Tell-Seq. Some applications, such as novel-isoform discovery, require very high coverage. Obtaining high coverage using long reads can be difficult, making barcoded RNA-seq data a valuable alternative for this task. However, most annotation pipelines are not able to work with a set of short reads instead of a single transcript, also not able to work with coverage gaps within a molecule if any. In order to overcome this challenge, we present an RNA-seq assembler that allows the determination of the expressed isoform per barcode.</p>

    <title>1 Introduction</title>
    <p>The emergence of long-read sequencing technologies, such as PacBio and Oxford Nanopore (ONT), have made it possible to perform transcriptome analysis at the isoform level and accurately predict full-length novel transcripts (<xref rid="btad781-B1" ref-type="bibr">Au et al. 2013</xref>, <xref rid="btad781-B18" ref-type="bibr">Sharon <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2013</xref>, <xref rid="btad781-B20" ref-type="bibr">Tilgner <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2014</xref>, <xref rid="btad781-B14" ref-type="bibr">Pertea <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2015</xref>, <xref rid="btad781-B11" ref-type="bibr">Kuo et al. 2020</xref>, <xref rid="btad781-B12" ref-type="bibr">Nip <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2020</xref>, <xref rid="btad781-B19" ref-type="bibr">Tang <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2020</xref>, <xref rid="btad781-B16" ref-type="bibr">Prjibelski et al. 2023</xref>). However, even with the latest advances these technologies may feature an elevated number of sequencing errors or low coverage insufficient to reliably discover low-expressed isoforms.</p>
    <p>Barcoded short-read RNA sequencing, such as SParse Isoform Sequencing (SPIso-seq, <xref rid="btad781-B21" ref-type="bibr">Tilgner <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2018</xref>), Loop-Seq (<xref rid="btad781-B5" ref-type="bibr">Callahan <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2021</xref>), and Tell-Seq (<xref rid="btad781-B6" ref-type="bibr">Chen <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2020</xref>), presents a viable alternative to long-read sequencing, in particular for applications that require high coverage, such as estimating transcript abundance or capturing rare isoforms. While performing conventional bulk RNA sequencing, these technologies also allow to detect barcode sequences, which are identical for all read pairs sequenced from the same mRNA molecule. Considering the vast space of possible barcodes, the probability of identical barcodes being attached to mRNAs transcribed by the same gene is low. Therefore, barcoded RNA sequencing combines high sequencing accuracy with linkage information between distant parts of the molecule, thus providing the opportunity to accurately reconstruct full-length isoforms.</p>
    <p>While pipelines for the reference-based isoform reconstruction from barcoded data were developed in the original studies (Loop-Seq, SPIso-seq), to the best of our knowledge, there is currently no <italic toggle="yes">de novo</italic> RNA assembler specifically designed for barcoded RNA reads. Although Loop-Seq pipeline involves the assembly of individual <italic toggle="yes">read clouds</italic> (reads sharing identical barcode sequence) using the SPAdes assembler (<xref rid="btad781-B15" ref-type="bibr">Prjibelski <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2020</xref>), it can only be applied when the coverage within a cloud is sufficient, which is often not the case, particularly for the SPIso-seq data (<xref rid="btad781-B21" ref-type="bibr">Tilgner <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2018</xref>). Thus, the straightforward assembly of each cloud separately can lead to fragmented assemblies. However, reducing the cost of sequencing is beneficial, since the amount of sequencing per barcode can be efficiently controlled by the user. Therefore, there is a need for an assembler that can effectively operate on lower coverage. Also, currently, existing genome assemblers for barcoded sequencing data (<xref rid="btad781-B3" ref-type="bibr">Bankevich and Pevzner 2016</xref>, <xref rid="btad781-B22" ref-type="bibr">Tolstoganov <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2019</xref>) focus on restoring long DNA fragments rather than isoform sequences with high similarity and thus are not directly applicable to the mentioned types of data.</p>
    <p>In this article, we present <italic toggle="yes">cloudrnaSPAdes</italic>, a novel tool for <italic toggle="yes">de novo</italic> assembly of full-length isoforms from barcoded RNA-seq data. It first constructs a single assembly graph using the entire set of input reads and further derives paths for each read cloud, closing gaps and fixing sequencing errors in the process. Results on simulated and real human data show that <italic toggle="yes">cloudrnaSPAdes</italic> is able to accurately reconstruct full-length transcript sequences from read clouds having coverage as low as 1×, including genes with dozens of different expressed isoforms. As <italic toggle="yes">cloudrnaSPAdes</italic> does not require a reference genome or a gene annotation, it may become a useful tool for research projects studying previously unsequenced species.</p>

    <title>2 Implementation</title>
    <p>The outline of <sc>cloudrna</sc>SP<sc>Ades</sc> is presented in <xref rid="btad781-F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>. First, an assembly graph is constructed from all input reads combined. Once constructed, the graph undergoes a basic simplification procedure (<xref rid="btad781-B2" ref-type="bibr">Bankevich <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2012</xref>, <xref rid="btad781-B13" ref-type="bibr">Nurk <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2013</xref>), which removes only edges with extremely low coverage to prune obvious sequencing errors. Further, <sc>cloudrna</sc>SP<sc>Ades</sc> algorithm attempts to reconstruct transcript sequences for each barcode. For simplicity of explanation, we assume that reads are already grouped by barcode sequences, and the processing is done barcode by barcode.</p>

      <label>Figure 1.</label>
      <caption>
        <p>Outline of <sc>cloudrna</sc>SP<sc>Ades</sc>. Initially, all reads are co-assembled into a single assembly graph. The graph is then simplified by removing low-covered tips and bulges. Subsequently, for each barcode, reads from the corresponding cloud are aligned to the graph and contigs are generated using the obtained alignment information. Similar contigs are clustered together to calculate abundances and are outputted along with their corresponding barcodes.</p>
      </caption>
      <graphic xlink:href="btad781f1" position="float"/>
    </fig>
    <p>The key intuition behind the algorithm is that different isoforms of the same gene are highly unlikely to be assigned an identical barcode. Thus, mapping reads from a read cloud to the assembly graph allows to detect non-overlapping paths corresponding to full-length transcript sequences.</p>
    <p>Once the reads from a read cloud are aligned to the assembly graph, we determine a subgraph formed by the alignments (i.e. a subset of edges that have at least one read mapped). Additionally, we compute barcode-specific coverage of the edges in the subgraph and determine the extreme positions (leftmost and rightmost) of the alignments for each edge in the subgraph.</p>
    <p>Each barcode represents multiple mRNAs, usually however from distinct genes. Thus, in an ideal scenario, the set of edges with alignments would form a subgraph consisting of multiple simple paths, where each path represents a single transcript. However, due to sequencing errors and coverage gaps, this assumption can be compromised. To address these challenges, we employ several simplification algorithms. While SPAdes has a diverse set of implemented algorithms with flexible parameters, we had to implement these algorithms from scratch. There are several reasons for that: (i) we cannot remove edges from the assembly graph itself, because an erroneous edge in one subgraph can be a part of the isoform for another barcode, (ii) we can’t create another graph due to the singleton nature of the assembly graph in SPAdes, (iii) when working with subgraphs, simplification algorithms should work not on edge but sequence of edge level, since a tip in subgraph can be represented like a sequence of edges of the initial assembly graph, and (iv) we need to use barcode-specific coverage:</p>
    <list list-type="bullet">
      <list-item>
        <p><italic toggle="yes">Tip clipping</italic>: This step involves the removal of short tips (dead-end and dead-start edges) and tips with low barcode-specific coverage from the subgraph. Contrary to the classic tip clipping algorithms, we aim to find a simple path in the subgraph, with average low coverage. All internal vertices have a degree of two, the last vertex has a degree of one, and the first vertex has a degree &gt;2 in the subgraph.</p>
      </list-item>
      <list-item>
        <p><italic toggle="yes">Bulge removal</italic>: In this procedure, barcode-specific low-covered alternative paths are eliminated from the subgraph. Contrary to the classic tip clipping algorithms, we aim to find two simple non-branching paths within a subgraph. We compare their average barcode-specific coverage and remove the path with lower coverage.</p>
      </list-item>
      <list-item>
        <p><italic toggle="yes">Gap closing</italic>: Short edges from the assembly graph are added to the subgraph if they can be used to merge two simple paths into one, thereby closing gaps between them.</p>
      </list-item>
    </list>
    <p>In comparison to conventional simplification procedures, cloudrnaSPAdes algorithm processes each read cloud individually and exploits barcode-specific edge coverage, while using the assembly graph constructed from all read clouds combined.</p>
    <p>Once the subgraph is derived and simplified, we traverse this subgraph to extract a set of paths that represent isoforms. To accomplish this, we exploit the exSPAnder algorithm (<xref rid="btad781-B17" ref-type="bibr">Prjibelski <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2014</xref>), which utilizes linkage information from paired and single reads in order to reconstruct paths in the assembly graph. In this work, exSPAnder was extensively modified to enable path construction using only a defined sub-graph and reads from a single cloud. The extracted paths are further clustered based on their sequence content, namely by their edges, as well as the leftmost position of the first edge and the rightmost position of the last edge they traverse.</p>
    <p>Furthermore, we maintain a record of the barcodes associated with each cluster, enabling us to estimate the abundances of the respective isoforms. By storing this information, we can quantify the relative representation of different isoforms within the dataset, providing valuable insights into their prevalence and distribution.</p>
    <p>Previous versions of exSPAnder were able to operate only on the complete assembly graph, were not able to run multiple times in one assembly process, and ignored edges without paired-end information. By utilizing this modified version of the exSPAnder algorithm, we can effectively reconstruct isoforms, even in scenarios where they contain short repetitive regions within their sequences or when different isoforms of the same gene exhibit variations. This solution enables us to accurately restore the underlying structure of the isoforms, enhancing our ability to analyze and interpret complex genomic information.</p>
    <p>The extracted paths are aggregated and organized within a data structure that groups them together based on the specific sequence of edges they traverse, as well as the leftmost position of the first edge and the rightmost position of the last edge they traverse. When introducing a newly extracted path into the data structure, our initial step involves verifying whether the structure already includes entries with an identical edge sequence. If no such entries exist, the path is added into the data structure. However, in cases where matching entries are found, we conduct a secondary check. We examine if there is an existing entry where the disparity between the leftmost position of the first edge and the rightmost position of the final edge is &lt;30 bp in comparison to the new entry. This approach is instrumental in distinguishing between isoforms that differ solely in their initial or final regions.</p>

      <title>3.1 Simulated data</title>
      <p>To test the developed algorithms, we first selected three human genes: <italic toggle="yes">GYPC</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">MAPT</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">BIN1</italic>, which exhibit varying levels of alternative splicing complexity (5, 16, and 15 isoforms, respectively). We visualized assembly and splicing graphs to emphasize the different level of complexity for these genes (see <xref rid="btad781-F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>) using Bandage (<xref rid="btad781-B23" ref-type="bibr">Wick <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2015</xref>) and SpliceGraphs package of Bioconductor (<xref rid="btad781-B7" ref-type="bibr">Gentleman <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2004</xref>). For each gene, we generated simulated reads using InSilicoSeq (<xref rid="btad781-B8" ref-type="bibr">Gourlé <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2019</xref>), ensuring that cloud sizes fit the distribution observed in real SPIso-seq data. We assembled reads for each gene using <sc>cloudrna</sc>SP<sc>Ades</sc>, and then used IsoQuant (<xref rid="btad781-B16" ref-type="bibr">Prjibelski et al. 2023</xref>) to assign each assembled contig to a reference isoform. For each barcode, we compared the assigned isoform with the isoform we used for simulation. As a competitor strategy, we implemented a strategy that assembles read clouds separately and called it “Separate strategy.” The strategy based on the same principles is implemented by LoopSeq (<xref rid="btad781-B5" ref-type="bibr">Callahan <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2021</xref>), which uses SPAdes with unspecified parameters to assemble each cloud separately. LoopSeq pipeline suggests that each read cloud is sequenced around 30×, so we suppose that default parameters were used, but for working with low-coverage data we used “–sc” parameter as the most effective.</p>

      <p><xref rid="btad781-T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> demonstrates that <sc>cloudrna</sc>SP<sc>Ades</sc> is capable of assembling isoforms, more than 98% of which are accurately assigned using IsoQuant. Importantly, we observed no consistent misclassification of any particular isoform. However, we did observe instances where read clouds were ambiguously or incorrectly classified, and the frequency of such occurrences increased for the read clouds with the lower number of reads. Therefore, for such read clouds, the isoform is likely to be split into several parts due to coverage gaps. However, even in real data, we can identify such cases by examining whether the same read cloud produced multiple isoforms for a specific gene. This situation indicates that either the read cloud was not assembled as a single isoform or that two distinct isoforms appeared within the same read cloud. Both types of events are not beneficial for subsequent downstream analysis and can be filtered. The “Fixed recall” column of <xref rid="btad781-T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> shows that after this procedure, the recall goes up for the complex <italic toggle="yes">MAPT</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">BIN1</italic> genes.

      <p>We also assessed the performance of popular short-read RNA assemblers in the case of complex simulated genes. Standard RNA assemblers would assemble the whole dataset ignoring barcode information, and restore transcripts using paired-end information and graph topology. We can’t directly compare these assemblers with cloudrnaSPAdes and Separate pipeline, since they work on a per-barcode basis. However, we can count the number of full-length isoforms in the transcripts produced by various assemblers. We will count the isoform as restored if there is a unique assignment of the contig to the isoform in IsoQuant. For our experiments, we ran the most popular RNA assemblers—Trinity (<xref rid="btad781-B9" ref-type="bibr">Grabherr et al. 2011</xref>), RNA-Bloom (<xref rid="btad781-B12" ref-type="bibr">Nip <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2020</xref>), and rnaSPAdes (<xref rid="btad781-B4" ref-type="bibr">Bushmanova <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2019</xref>). Results can be found in <xref rid="btad781-T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. Note that cloudrnsSPAdes and “Separate” pipeline were able to identify each isoform multiple times, but for the standard short-read RNA assemblers most of the isoforms were undetected. Nevertheless, Trinity performs better than rnaSPAdes on our datasets.</p>

      <title>3.2 Real data</title>
      <p>To demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in detecting full-length isoforms, we conducted an analysis using SPIso-seq sequencing data obtained from a diverse pool of 50 individual human brain cDNA samples (<xref rid="btad781-B21" ref-type="bibr">Tilgner <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2018</xref>). This dataset enabled us to explore a wide range of alternative isoforms and natural variations within genes. We successfully assembled a total of 181.8 million read pairs, corresponding to 584 399 unique barcodes, utilizing our <sc>cloudrna</sc>SP<sc>Ades</sc> tool. The assembly process required ∼74 h and reached a peak memory usage of 205 GB. TRINITY also assembled this dataset within 10 days. Note that this dataset is around 2–3 times larger than standard transcriptomic dataset, so it requires increased computational resources. Nonetheless, considering the anticipated growth in sequencing datasets in the future, our dataset serves as a representative example of this evolving landscape.</p>
      <p>The assembly process yielded a total of 4 518 183 contigs with a length &gt;300 bp. To gain insights into the isoform composition, we utilized IsoQuant in combination with GENCODE v32 annotation and the GRCh38 reference genome. Among these contigs, 1 463 514 exhibited a unique assignment to a specific isoform, while 55 611 contigs had minor differences in their assignments. In contrast, 1 582 720 contigs were assigned ambiguously, 699 042 contigs showed inconsistencies in their assignments, and 998 806 assignments were deemed uninformative.</p>
      <p>The presence of a substantial number of non-unique assignments can be attributed to the inherent noise in real sequencing data. It is important to note that not only full-length isoforms are captured but also fragmented or partially processed RNA products, which can contribute to the ambiguity in assignments. However, since processed isoforms tend to be more stable compared to other RNA states, we can leverage a barcode-based filtering strategy to mitigate this issue.</p>
      <p>By utilizing read clouds, we can filter the contigs based on the number of associated barcodes. This approach is particularly effective in removing contigs that are classified as inconsistent, non-informative, or intergenic. Interestingly, the filtering method demonstrates similar removal rates for both ambiguously and uniquely assigned contigs. This suggests that at least some ambiguously classified contigs are produced by multiple read clouds. Various factors, such as incomplete annotation or unconnected regions in the assembly graph, could contribute to this phenomenon. A comprehensive summary of the filtering results is presented in <xref rid="btad781-T3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>.</p>

            <p><italic toggle="yes">N</italic>-fixed row contain only contigs that received at least <italic toggle="yes">N</italic> barcodes during clustering and there are no contigs with the same barcode and IsoQuant assignment to the same gene.</p>

        </table-wrap-foot>
      </table-wrap>
      <p>To show how barcode information can be used in downstream analysis, we wrote a script that filters contigs, if they have a barcode that was assigned to a single gene multiple times. This script aimed to remove parts of read clouds with low coverage for a specific gene, thereby enhancing the accuracy of the assembly results. The results are presented in <xref rid="btad781-T3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> in “fixed rows.”</p>
      <p>A comparison between the “1” and “1-fixed” rows in the table reveals that ∼15% of the ambiguous assignments can be effectively filtered out. This occurs when a single read cloud produces multiple contigs assigned to the same gene. On the other hand, the unique assignments remain relatively unchanged throughout the filtering procedure. These findings suggest that different strategies for refining and improving the results using barcode information hold promise for future investigations. This part highlights the potential of leveraging barcode-based filtering methods to enhance the accuracy and interpretability of barcoded RNA assembly. By refining the assembly results and reducing the presence of ambiguous assignments, researchers can gain more confidence in their analyses and further explore the complexity of isoform expression in various biological systems.</p>
      <p>To demonstrate the effectiveness of <sc>cloudrna</sc>SP<sc>Ades</sc> in reconstructing different isoforms of a single gene, we selected the <italic toggle="yes">ATP6AP2</italic> gene from chromosome X. This gene plays a crucial role in normal kidney development and function (<xref rid="btad781-B10" ref-type="bibr">Hoffmann and Peters 2021</xref>). As documented in GENCODE v32, it has a total of 34 distinct isoforms, although we do not expect all of them to be expressed in our dataset. Remarkably, according to IsoQuant assignments, <sc>cloudrna</sc>SP<sc>Ades</sc> successfully assembled seven isoforms of <italic toggle="yes">ATP6AP2</italic>, highlighting its ability to capture and reconstruct different variants of a gene.</p>
      <p>In contrast, a conventional <italic toggle="yes">de novo</italic> transcriptome assembler, rnaSPAdes (<xref rid="btad781-B4" ref-type="bibr">Bushmanova <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2019</xref>), failed to restore any isoforms with unique assignments for this particular gene. TRINITY was able to assemble two incomplete isoforms that have unique assignments. RNA-bloom was not able to finish with an error during k-mer counting step. This emphasizes the better performance of <sc>cloudrna</sc>SP<sc>Ades</sc> and the utility of read clouds in general in accurately reconstructing isoforms and obtaining reliable assignments. The alignments of some of the assembled isoforms are depicted in <xref rid="btad781-F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>, illustrating the diversity of isoforms captured by <sc>cloudrna</sc>SP<sc>Ades</sc>.</p>

    <title>4 Discussion</title>
    <p>The rise of long-read technologies, such as PacBio and Oxford Nanopore sequencing, has overshadowed the utility of read clouds in contemporary computational biology. These long-read technologies offer easier data interpretation and yield substantial results, capturing the attention of researchers across various computational biology domains.</p>
    <p>Despite this trend, there remains a niche where read clouds can exhibit comparable performance to long reads and find success in the market. Specifically, in the realm of transcriptome sequencing, the relatively simpler nature of the data allows read clouds to achieve results of similar quality to long reads. Transcriptome analysis often demands extensive sequencing data to uncover rare isoforms, and the substantial input requirements and sequencing costs associated with long reads can make read clouds a compelling alternative.</p>
    <p>Therefore, read clouds can be effectively used for discovering novel isoforms and isoform discovery in non-human species. <sc>cloudrna</sc>SP<sc>Ades</sc> offers an effective way to assemble full-length isoforms from cheap and accurate read cloud data. Uncovering novel isoforms plays a crucial role in advancing our understanding of gene regulation, alternative splicing patterns, and functional diversity across different organisms. By identifying and characterizing isoforms in non-human species, we gain insights into the evolutionary dynamics and adaptation processes specific to those organisms.</p>
    <p>Notably, platforms like Tell-Seq and Loop-Seq continue to thrive in the market, specifically catering to transcriptomic analysis. These platforms recognize the unique advantages offered by read clouds in this particular context and continue to provide valuable solutions to researchers in need of comprehensive transcriptome analysis.</p>

        <title>Motivation</title>
        <p>Recent advancements in long-read RNA sequencing have enabled the examination of full-length isoforms, previously uncaptured by short-read sequencing methods. An alternative powerful method for studying isoforms is through the use of barcoded short-read RNA reads, for which a barcode indicates whether two short-reads arise from the same molecule or not. Such techniques included the 10x Genomics linked-read based SParse Isoform Sequencing (SPIso-seq), as well as Loop-Seq, or Tell-Seq. Some applications, such as novel-isoform discovery, require very high coverage. Obtaining high coverage using long reads can be difficult, making barcoded RNA-seq data a valuable alternative for this task. However, most annotation pipelines are not able to work with a set of short reads instead of a single transcript, also not able to work with coverage gaps within a molecule if any. In order to overcome this challenge, we present an RNA-seq assembler that allows the determination of the expressed isoform per barcode.</p>

    <title>1 Introduction</title>
    <p>The emergence of long-read sequencing technologies, such as PacBio and Oxford Nanopore (ONT), have made it possible to perform transcriptome analysis at the isoform level and accurately predict full-length novel transcripts (<xref rid="btad781-B1" ref-type="bibr">Au et al. 2013</xref>, <xref rid="btad781-B18" ref-type="bibr">Sharon <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2013</xref>, <xref rid="btad781-B20" ref-type="bibr">Tilgner <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2014</xref>, <xref rid="btad781-B14" ref-type="bibr">Pertea <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2015</xref>, <xref rid="btad781-B11" ref-type="bibr">Kuo et al. 2020</xref>, <xref rid="btad781-B12" ref-type="bibr">Nip <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2020</xref>, <xref rid="btad781-B19" ref-type="bibr">Tang <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2020</xref>, <xref rid="btad781-B16" ref-type="bibr">Prjibelski et al. 2023</xref>). However, even with the latest advances these technologies may feature an elevated number of sequencing errors or low coverage insufficient to reliably discover low-expressed isoforms.</p>
    <p>Barcoded short-read RNA sequencing, such as SParse Isoform Sequencing (SPIso-seq, <xref rid="btad781-B21" ref-type="bibr">Tilgner <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2018</xref>), Loop-Seq (<xref rid="btad781-B5" ref-type="bibr">Callahan <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2021</xref>), and Tell-Seq (<xref rid="btad781-B6" ref-type="bibr">Chen <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2020</xref>), presents a viable alternative to long-read sequencing, in particular for applications that require high coverage, such as estimating transcript abundance or capturing rare isoforms. While performing conventional bulk RNA sequencing, these technologies also allow to detect barcode sequences, which are identical for all read pairs sequenced from the same mRNA molecule. Considering the vast space of possible barcodes, the probability of identical barcodes being attached to mRNAs transcribed by the same gene is low. Therefore, barcoded RNA sequencing combines high sequencing accuracy with linkage information between distant parts of the molecule, thus providing the opportunity to accurately reconstruct full-length isoforms.</p>
    <p>While pipelines for the reference-based isoform reconstruction from barcoded data were developed in the original studies (Loop-Seq, SPIso-seq), to the best of our knowledge, there is currently no <italic toggle="yes">de novo</italic> RNA assembler specifically designed for barcoded RNA reads. Although Loop-Seq pipeline involves the assembly of individual <italic toggle="yes">read clouds</italic> (reads sharing identical barcode sequence) using the SPAdes assembler (<xref rid="btad781-B15" ref-type="bibr">Prjibelski <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2020</xref>), it can only be applied when the coverage within a cloud is sufficient, which is often not the case, particularly for the SPIso-seq data (<xref rid="btad781-B21" ref-type="bibr">Tilgner <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2018</xref>). Thus, the straightforward assembly of each cloud separately can lead to fragmented assemblies. However, reducing the cost of sequencing is beneficial, since the amount of sequencing per barcode can be efficiently controlled by the user. Therefore, there is a need for an assembler that can effectively operate on lower coverage. Also, currently, existing genome assemblers for barcoded sequencing data (<xref rid="btad781-B3" ref-type="bibr">Bankevich and Pevzner 2016</xref>, <xref rid="btad781-B22" ref-type="bibr">Tolstoganov <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2019</xref>) focus on restoring long DNA fragments rather than isoform sequences with high similarity and thus are not directly applicable to the mentioned types of data.</p>
    <p>In this article, we present <italic toggle="yes">cloudrnaSPAdes</italic>, a novel tool for <italic toggle="yes">de novo</italic> assembly of full-length isoforms from barcoded RNA-seq data. It first constructs a single assembly graph using the entire set of input reads and further derives paths for each read cloud, closing gaps and fixing sequencing errors in the process. Results on simulated and real human data show that <italic toggle="yes">cloudrnaSPAdes</italic> is able to accurately reconstruct full-length transcript sequences from read clouds having coverage as low as 1×, including genes with dozens of different expressed isoforms. As <italic toggle="yes">cloudrnaSPAdes</italic> does not require a reference genome or a gene annotation, it may become a useful tool for research projects studying previously unsequenced species.</p>

    <title>2 Implementation</title>
    <p>The outline of <sc>cloudrna</sc>SP<sc>Ades</sc> is presented in <xref rid="btad781-F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>. First, an assembly graph is constructed from all input reads combined. Once constructed, the graph undergoes a basic simplification procedure (<xref rid="btad781-B2" ref-type="bibr">Bankevich <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2012</xref>, <xref rid="btad781-B13" ref-type="bibr">Nurk <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2013</xref>), which removes only edges with extremely low coverage to prune obvious sequencing errors. Further, <sc>cloudrna</sc>SP<sc>Ades</sc> algorithm attempts to reconstruct transcript sequences for each barcode. For simplicity of explanation, we assume that reads are already grouped by barcode sequences, and the processing is done barcode by barcode.</p>

      <label>Figure 1.</label>
      <caption>
        <p>Outline of <sc>cloudrna</sc>SP<sc>Ades</sc>. Initially, all reads are co-assembled into a single assembly graph. The graph is then simplified by removing low-covered tips and bulges. Subsequently, for each barcode, reads from the corresponding cloud are aligned to the graph and contigs are generated using the obtained alignment information. Similar contigs are clustered together to calculate abundances and are outputted along with their corresponding barcodes.</p>
      </caption>
      <graphic xlink:href="btad781f1" position="float"/>
    </fig>
    <p>The key intuition behind the algorithm is that different isoforms of the same gene are highly unlikely to be assigned an identical barcode. Thus, mapping reads from a read cloud to the assembly graph allows to detect non-overlapping paths corresponding to full-length transcript sequences.</p>
    <p>Once the reads from a read cloud are aligned to the assembly graph, we determine a subgraph formed by the alignments (i.e. a subset of edges that have at least one read mapped). Additionally, we compute barcode-specific coverage of the edges in the subgraph and determine the extreme positions (leftmost and rightmost) of the alignments for each edge in the subgraph.</p>
    <p>Each barcode represents multiple mRNAs, usually however from distinct genes. Thus, in an ideal scenario, the set of edges with alignments would form a subgraph consisting of multiple simple paths, where each path represents a single transcript. However, due to sequencing errors and coverage gaps, this assumption can be compromised. To address these challenges, we employ several simplification algorithms. While SPAdes has a diverse set of implemented algorithms with flexible parameters, we had to implement these algorithms from scratch. There are several reasons for that: (i) we cannot remove edges from the assembly graph itself, because an erroneous edge in one subgraph can be a part of the isoform for another barcode, (ii) we can’t create another graph due to the singleton nature of the assembly graph in SPAdes, (iii) when working with subgraphs, simplification algorithms should work not on edge but sequence of edge level, since a tip in subgraph can be represented like a sequence of edges of the initial assembly graph, and (iv) we need to use barcode-specific coverage:</p>
    <list list-type="bullet">
      <list-item>
        <p><italic toggle="yes">Tip clipping</italic>: This step involves the removal of short tips (dead-end and dead-start edges) and tips with low barcode-specific coverage from the subgraph. Contrary to the classic tip clipping algorithms, we aim to find a simple path in the subgraph, with average low coverage. All internal vertices have a degree of two, the last vertex has a degree of one, and the first vertex has a degree &gt;2 in the subgraph.</p>
      </list-item>
      <list-item>
        <p><italic toggle="yes">Bulge removal</italic>: In this procedure, barcode-specific low-covered alternative paths are eliminated from the subgraph. Contrary to the classic tip clipping algorithms, we aim to find two simple non-branching paths within a subgraph. We compare their average barcode-specific coverage and remove the path with lower coverage.</p>
      </list-item>
      <list-item>
        <p><italic toggle="yes">Gap closing</italic>: Short edges from the assembly graph are added to the subgraph if they can be used to merge two simple paths into one, thereby closing gaps between them.</p>
      </list-item>
    </list>
    <p>In comparison to conventional simplification procedures, cloudrnaSPAdes algorithm processes each read cloud individually and exploits barcode-specific edge coverage, while using the assembly graph constructed from all read clouds combined.</p>
    <p>Once the subgraph is derived and simplified, we traverse this subgraph to extract a set of paths that represent isoforms. To accomplish this, we exploit the exSPAnder algorithm (<xref rid="btad781-B17" ref-type="bibr">Prjibelski <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2014</xref>), which utilizes linkage information from paired and single reads in order to reconstruct paths in the assembly graph. In this work, exSPAnder was extensively modified to enable path construction using only a defined sub-graph and reads from a single cloud. The extracted paths are further clustered based on their sequence content, namely by their edges, as well as the leftmost position of the first edge and the rightmost position of the last edge they traverse.</p>
    <p>Furthermore, we maintain a record of the barcodes associated with each cluster, enabling us to estimate the abundances of the respective isoforms. By storing this information, we can quantify the relative representation of different isoforms within the dataset, providing valuable insights into their prevalence and distribution.</p>
    <p>Previous versions of exSPAnder were able to operate only on the complete assembly graph, were not able to run multiple times in one assembly process, and ignored edges without paired-end information. By utilizing this modified version of the exSPAnder algorithm, we can effectively reconstruct isoforms, even in scenarios where they contain short repetitive regions within their sequences or when different isoforms of the same gene exhibit variations. This solution enables us to accurately restore the underlying structure of the isoforms, enhancing our ability to analyze and interpret complex genomic information.</p>
    <p>The extracted paths are aggregated and organized within a data structure that groups them together based on the specific sequence of edges they traverse, as well as the leftmost position of the first edge and the rightmost position of the last edge they traverse. When introducing a newly extracted path into the data structure, our initial step involves verifying whether the structure already includes entries with an identical edge sequence. If no such entries exist, the path is added into the data structure. However, in cases where matching entries are found, we conduct a secondary check. We examine if there is an existing entry where the disparity between the leftmost position of the first edge and the rightmost position of the final edge is &lt;30 bp in comparison to the new entry. This approach is instrumental in distinguishing between isoforms that differ solely in their initial or final regions.</p>

      <title>3.1 Simulated data</title>
      <p>To test the developed algorithms, we first selected three human genes: <italic toggle="yes">GYPC</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">MAPT</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">BIN1</italic>, which exhibit varying levels of alternative splicing complexity (5, 16, and 15 isoforms, respectively). We visualized assembly and splicing graphs to emphasize the different level of complexity for these genes (see <xref rid="btad781-F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>) using Bandage (<xref rid="btad781-B23" ref-type="bibr">Wick <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2015</xref>) and SpliceGraphs package of Bioconductor (<xref rid="btad781-B7" ref-type="bibr">Gentleman <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2004</xref>). For each gene, we generated simulated reads using InSilicoSeq (<xref rid="btad781-B8" ref-type="bibr">Gourlé <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2019</xref>), ensuring that cloud sizes fit the distribution observed in real SPIso-seq data. We assembled reads for each gene using <sc>cloudrna</sc>SP<sc>Ades</sc>, and then used IsoQuant (<xref rid="btad781-B16" ref-type="bibr">Prjibelski et al. 2023</xref>) to assign each assembled contig to a reference isoform. For each barcode, we compared the assigned isoform with the isoform we used for simulation. As a competitor strategy, we implemented a strategy that assembles read clouds separately and called it “Separate strategy.” The strategy based on the same principles is implemented by LoopSeq (<xref rid="btad781-B5" ref-type="bibr">Callahan <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2021</xref>), which uses SPAdes with unspecified parameters to assemble each cloud separately. LoopSeq pipeline suggests that each read cloud is sequenced around 30×, so we suppose that default parameters were used, but for working with low-coverage data we used “–sc” parameter as the most effective.</p>

      <p><xref rid="btad781-T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> demonstrates that <sc>cloudrna</sc>SP<sc>Ades</sc> is capable of assembling isoforms, more than 98% of which are accurately assigned using IsoQuant. Importantly, we observed no consistent misclassification of any particular isoform. However, we did observe instances where read clouds were ambiguously or incorrectly classified, and the frequency of such occurrences increased for the read clouds with the lower number of reads. Therefore, for such read clouds, the isoform is likely to be split into several parts due to coverage gaps. However, even in real data, we can identify such cases by examining whether the same read cloud produced multiple isoforms for a specific gene. This situation indicates that either the read cloud was not assembled as a single isoform or that two distinct isoforms appeared within the same read cloud. Both types of events are not beneficial for subsequent downstream analysis and can be filtered. The “Fixed recall” column of <xref rid="btad781-T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> shows that after this procedure, the recall goes up for the complex <italic toggle="yes">MAPT</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">BIN1</italic> genes.

      <p>We also assessed the performance of popular short-read RNA assemblers in the case of complex simulated genes. Standard RNA assemblers would assemble the whole dataset ignoring barcode information, and restore transcripts using paired-end information and graph topology. We can’t directly compare these assemblers with cloudrnaSPAdes and Separate pipeline, since they work on a per-barcode basis. However, we can count the number of full-length isoforms in the transcripts produced by various assemblers. We will count the isoform as restored if there is a unique assignment of the contig to the isoform in IsoQuant. For our experiments, we ran the most popular RNA assemblers—Trinity (<xref rid="btad781-B9" ref-type="bibr">Grabherr et al. 2011</xref>), RNA-Bloom (<xref rid="btad781-B12" ref-type="bibr">Nip <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2020</xref>), and rnaSPAdes (<xref rid="btad781-B4" ref-type="bibr">Bushmanova <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2019</xref>). Results can be found in <xref rid="btad781-T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. Note that cloudrnsSPAdes and “Separate” pipeline were able to identify each isoform multiple times, but for the standard short-read RNA assemblers most of the isoforms were undetected. Nevertheless, Trinity performs better than rnaSPAdes on our datasets.</p>

      <title>3.2 Real data</title>
      <p>To demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in detecting full-length isoforms, we conducted an analysis using SPIso-seq sequencing data obtained from a diverse pool of 50 individual human brain cDNA samples (<xref rid="btad781-B21" ref-type="bibr">Tilgner <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2018</xref>). This dataset enabled us to explore a wide range of alternative isoforms and natural variations within genes. We successfully assembled a total of 181.8 million read pairs, corresponding to 584 399 unique barcodes, utilizing our <sc>cloudrna</sc>SP<sc>Ades</sc> tool. The assembly process required ∼74 h and reached a peak memory usage of 205 GB. TRINITY also assembled this dataset within 10 days. Note that this dataset is around 2–3 times larger than standard transcriptomic dataset, so it requires increased computational resources. Nonetheless, considering the anticipated growth in sequencing datasets in the future, our dataset serves as a representative example of this evolving landscape.</p>
      <p>The assembly process yielded a total of 4 518 183 contigs with a length &gt;300 bp. To gain insights into the isoform composition, we utilized IsoQuant in combination with GENCODE v32 annotation and the GRCh38 reference genome. Among these contigs, 1 463 514 exhibited a unique assignment to a specific isoform, while 55 611 contigs had minor differences in their assignments. In contrast, 1 582 720 contigs were assigned ambiguously, 699 042 contigs showed inconsistencies in their assignments, and 998 806 assignments were deemed uninformative.</p>
      <p>The presence of a substantial number of non-unique assignments can be attributed to the inherent noise in real sequencing data. It is important to note that not only full-length isoforms are captured but also fragmented or partially processed RNA products, which can contribute to the ambiguity in assignments. However, since processed isoforms tend to be more stable compared to other RNA states, we can leverage a barcode-based filtering strategy to mitigate this issue.</p>
      <p>By utilizing read clouds, we can filter the contigs based on the number of associated barcodes. This approach is particularly effective in removing contigs that are classified as inconsistent, non-informative, or intergenic. Interestingly, the filtering method demonstrates similar removal rates for both ambiguously and uniquely assigned contigs. This suggests that at least some ambiguously classified contigs are produced by multiple read clouds. Various factors, such as incomplete annotation or unconnected regions in the assembly graph, could contribute to this phenomenon. A comprehensive summary of the filtering results is presented in <xref rid="btad781-T3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>.</p>

      <p>To show how barcode information can be used in downstream analysis, we wrote a script that filters contigs, if they have a barcode that was assigned to a single gene multiple times. This script aimed to remove parts of read clouds with low coverage for a specific gene, thereby enhancing the accuracy of the assembly results. The results are presented in <xref rid="btad781-T3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> in “fixed rows.”</p>
      <p>A comparison between the “1” and “1-fixed” rows in the table reveals that ∼15% of the ambiguous assignments can be effectively filtered out. This occurs when a single read cloud produces multiple contigs assigned to the same gene. On the other hand, the unique assignments remain relatively unchanged throughout the filtering procedure. These findings suggest that different strategies for refining and improving the results using barcode information hold promise for future investigations. This part highlights the potential of leveraging barcode-based filtering methods to enhance the accuracy and interpretability of barcoded RNA assembly. By refining the assembly results and reducing the presence of ambiguous assignments, researchers can gain more confidence in their analyses and further explore the complexity of isoform expression in various biological systems.</p>

This gene plays a crucial role in normal kidney development and function (<xref rid="btad781-B10" ref-type="bibr">Hoffmann and Peters 2021</xref>). As documented in GENCODE v32, it has a total of 34 distinct isoforms, although we do not expect all of them to be expressed in our dataset. Remarkably, according to IsoQuant assignments, <sc>cloudrna</sc>SP<sc>Ades</sc> successfully assembled seven isoforms of <italic toggle="yes">ATP6AP2</italic>, highlighting its ability to capture and reconstruct different variants of a gene.</p>
      <p>In contrast, a conventional <italic toggle="yes">de novo</italic> transcriptome assembler, rnaSPAdes (<xref rid="btad781-B4" ref-type="bibr">Bushmanova <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2019</xref>), failed to restore any isoforms with unique assignments for this particular gene. TRINITY was able to assemble two incomplete isoforms that have unique assignments. RNA-bloom was not able to finish with an error during k-mer counting step. This emphasizes the better performance of <sc>cloudrna</sc>SP<sc>Ades</sc> and the utility of read clouds in general in accurately reconstructing isoforms and obtaining reliable assignments. The alignments of some of the assembled isoforms are depicted in <xref rid="btad781-F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>, illustrating the diversity of isoforms captured by <sc>cloudrna</sc>SP<sc>Ades</sc>.</p>

Among <sc>cloudrna</sc>SP<sc>Ades</sc> alignments we can see isoforms where the second exon is missing, the fourth exon is missing, both alternative exons are missing, and both exons are present. TRINITY alignments only partially restore gene structure.</p>

    <title>4 Discussion</title>
    <p>The rise of long-read technologies, such as PacBio and Oxford Nanopore sequencing, has overshadowed the utility of read clouds in contemporary computational biology. These long-read technologies offer easier data interpretation and yield substantial results, capturing the attention of researchers across various computational biology domains.</p>
    <p>Despite this trend, there remains a niche where read clouds can exhibit comparable performance to long reads and find success in the market. Specifically, in the realm of transcriptome sequencing, the relatively simpler nature of the data allows read clouds to achieve results of similar quality to long reads. Transcriptome analysis often demands extensive sequencing data to uncover rare isoforms, and the substantial input requirements and sequencing costs associated with long reads can make read clouds a compelling alternative.</p>
    <p>Therefore, read clouds can be effectively used for discovering novel isoforms and isoform discovery in non-human species. <sc>cloudrna</sc>SP<sc>Ades</sc> offers an effective way to assemble full-length isoforms from cheap and accurate read cloud data. Uncovering novel isoforms plays a crucial role in advancing our understanding of gene regulation, alternative splicing patterns, and functional diversity across different organisms. By identifying and characterizing isoforms in non-human species, we gain insights into the evolutionary dynamics and adaptation processes specific to those organisms.</p>
    <p>Notably, platforms like Tell-Seq and Loop-Seq continue to thrive in the market, specifically catering to transcriptomic analysis. These platforms recognize the unique advantages offered by read clouds in this particular context and continue to provide valuable solutions to researchers in need of comprehensive transcriptome analysis.</p>

        <title>Motivation</title>
        <p>Recent advancements in long-read RNA sequencing have enabled the examination of full-length isoforms, previously uncaptured by short-read sequencing methods. An alternative powerful method for studying isoforms is through the use of barcoded short-read RNA reads, for which a barcode indicates whether two short-reads arise from the same molecule or not. Such techniques included the 10x Genomics linked-read based SParse Isoform Sequencing (SPIso-seq), as well as Loop-Seq, or Tell-Seq. Some applications, such as novel-isoform discovery, require very high coverage. Obtaining high coverage using long reads can be difficult, making barcoded RNA-seq data a valuable alternative for this task. However, most annotation pipelines are not able to work with a set of short reads instead of a single transcript, also not able to work with coverage gaps within a molecule if any. In order to overcome this challenge, we present an RNA-seq assembler that allows the determination of the expressed isoform per barcode.</p>

    <title>1 Introduction</title>
    <p>The emergence of long-read sequencing technologies, such as PacBio and Oxford Nanopore (ONT), have made it possible to perform transcriptome analysis at the isoform level and accurately predict full-length novel transcripts (<xref rid="btad781-B1" ref-type="bibr">Au et al. 2013</xref>, <xref rid="btad781-B18" ref-type="bibr">Sharon <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2013</xref>, <xref rid="btad781-B20" ref-type="bibr">Tilgner <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2014</xref>, <xref rid="btad781-B14" ref-type="bibr">Pertea <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2015</xref>, <xref rid="btad781-B11" ref-type="bibr">Kuo et al. 2020</xref>, <xref rid="btad781-B12" ref-type="bibr">Nip <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2020</xref>, <xref rid="btad781-B19" ref-type="bibr">Tang <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2020</xref>, <xref rid="btad781-B16" ref-type="bibr">Prjibelski et al. 2023</xref>). However, even with the latest advances these technologies may feature an elevated number of sequencing errors or low coverage insufficient to reliably discover low-expressed isoforms.</p>
    <p>Barcoded short-read RNA sequencing, such as SParse Isoform Sequencing (SPIso-seq, <xref rid="btad781-B21" ref-type="bibr">Tilgner <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2018</xref>), Loop-Seq (<xref rid="btad781-B5" ref-type="bibr">Callahan <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2021</xref>), and Tell-Seq (<xref rid="btad781-B6" ref-type="bibr">Chen <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2020</xref>), presents a viable alternative to long-read sequencing, in particular for applications that require high coverage, such as estimating transcript abundance or capturing rare isoforms. While performing conventional bulk RNA sequencing, these technologies also allow to detect barcode sequences, which are identical for all read pairs sequenced from the same mRNA molecule. Considering the vast space of possible barcodes, the probability of identical barcodes being attached to mRNAs transcribed by the same gene is low. Therefore, barcoded RNA sequencing combines high sequencing accuracy with linkage information between distant parts of the molecule, thus providing the opportunity to accurately reconstruct full-length isoforms.</p>
    <p>While pipelines for the reference-based isoform reconstruction from barcoded data were developed in the original studies (Loop-Seq, SPIso-seq), to the best of our knowledge, there is currently no <italic toggle="yes">de novo</italic> RNA assembler specifically designed for barcoded RNA reads. Although Loop-Seq pipeline involves the assembly of individual <italic toggle="yes">read clouds</italic> (reads sharing identical barcode sequence) using the SPAdes assembler (<xref rid="btad781-B15" ref-type="bibr">Prjibelski <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2020</xref>), it can only be applied when the coverage within a cloud is sufficient, which is often not the case, particularly for the SPIso-seq data (<xref rid="btad781-B21" ref-type="bibr">Tilgner <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2018</xref>). Thus, the straightforward assembly of each cloud separately can lead to fragmented assemblies. However, reducing the cost of sequencing is beneficial, since the amount of sequencing per barcode can be efficiently controlled by the user. Therefore, there is a need for an assembler that can effectively operate on lower coverage. Also, currently, existing genome assemblers for barcoded sequencing data (<xref rid="btad781-B3" ref-type="bibr">Bankevich and Pevzner 2016</xref>, <xref rid="btad781-B22" ref-type="bibr">Tolstoganov <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2019</xref>) focus on restoring long DNA fragments rather than isoform sequences with high similarity and thus are not directly applicable to the mentioned types of data.</p>
    <p>In this article, we present <italic toggle="yes">cloudrnaSPAdes</italic>, a novel tool for <italic toggle="yes">de novo</italic> assembly of full-length isoforms from barcoded RNA-seq data. It first constructs a single assembly graph using the entire set of input reads and further derives paths for each read cloud, closing gaps and fixing sequencing errors in the process. Results on simulated and real human data show that <italic toggle="yes">cloudrnaSPAdes</italic> is able to accurately reconstruct full-length transcript sequences from read clouds having coverage as low as 1×, including genes with dozens of different expressed isoforms. As <italic toggle="yes">cloudrnaSPAdes</italic> does not require a reference genome or a gene annotation, it may become a useful tool for research projects studying previously unsequenced species.</p>

    <title>2 Implementation</title>
    <p>The outline of <sc>cloudrna</sc>SP<sc>Ades</sc> is presented in <xref rid="btad781-F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>. First, an assembly graph is constructed from all input reads combined. Once constructed, the graph undergoes a basic simplification procedure (<xref rid="btad781-B2" ref-type="bibr">Bankevich <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2012</xref>, <xref rid="btad781-B13" ref-type="bibr">Nurk <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2013</xref>), which removes only edges with extremely low coverage to prune obvious sequencing errors. Further, <sc>cloudrna</sc>SP<sc>Ades</sc> algorithm attempts to reconstruct transcript sequences for each barcode. For simplicity of explanation, we assume that reads are already grouped by barcode sequences, and the processing is done barcode by barcode.</p>

      <label>Figure 1.</label>
      <caption>
        <p>Outline of <sc>cloudrna</sc>SP<sc>Ades</sc>. Initially, all reads are co-assembled into a single assembly graph. The graph is then simplified by removing low-covered tips and bulges. Subsequently, for each barcode, reads from the corresponding cloud are aligned to the graph and contigs are generated using the obtained alignment information. Similar contigs are clustered together to calculate abundances and are outputted along with their corresponding barcodes.</p>
      </caption>
      <graphic xlink:href="btad781f1" position="float"/>
    </fig>
    <p>The key intuition behind the algorithm is that different isoforms of the same gene are highly unlikely to be assigned an identical barcode. Thus, mapping reads from a read cloud to the assembly graph allows to detect non-overlapping paths corresponding to full-length transcript sequences.</p>
    <p>Once the reads from a read cloud are aligned to the assembly graph, we determine a subgraph formed by the alignments (i.e. a subset of edges that have at least one read mapped). Additionally, we compute barcode-specific coverage of the edges in the subgraph and determine the extreme positions (leftmost and rightmost) of the alignments for each edge in the subgraph.</p>
    <p>Each barcode represents multiple mRNAs, usually however from distinct genes. Thus, in an ideal scenario, the set of edges with alignments would form a subgraph consisting of multiple simple paths, where each path represents a single transcript. However, due to sequencing errors and coverage gaps, this assumption can be compromised. To address these challenges, we employ several simplification algorithms. While SPAdes has a diverse set of implemented algorithms with flexible parameters, we had to implement these algorithms from scratch. There are several reasons for that: (i) we cannot remove edges from the assembly graph itself, because an erroneous edge in one subgraph can be a part of the isoform for another barcode, (ii) we can’t create another graph due to the singleton nature of the assembly graph in SPAdes, (iii) when working with subgraphs, simplification algorithms should work not on edge but sequence of edge level, since a tip in subgraph can be represented like a sequence of edges of the initial assembly graph, and (iv) we need to use barcode-specific coverage:</p>
    <list list-type="bullet">
      <list-item>
        <p><italic toggle="yes">Tip clipping</italic>: This step involves the removal of short tips (dead-end and dead-start edges) and tips with low barcode-specific coverage from the subgraph. Contrary to the classic tip clipping algorithms, we aim to find a simple path in the subgraph, with average low coverage. All internal vertices have a degree of two, the last vertex has a degree of one, and the first vertex has a degree &gt;2 in the subgraph.</p>
      </list-item>
      <list-item>
        <p><italic toggle="yes">Bulge removal</italic>: In this procedure, barcode-specific low-covered alternative paths are eliminated from the subgraph. Contrary to the classic tip clipping algorithms, we aim to find two simple non-branching paths within a subgraph. We compare their average barcode-specific coverage and remove the path with lower coverage.</p>
      </list-item>
      <list-item>
        <p><italic toggle="yes">Gap closing</italic>: Short edges from the assembly graph are added to the subgraph if they can be used to merge two simple paths into one, thereby closing gaps between them.</p>
      </list-item>
    </list>
    <p>In comparison to conventional simplification procedures, cloudrnaSPAdes algorithm processes each read cloud individually and exploits barcode-specific edge coverage, while using the assembly graph constructed from all read clouds combined.</p>
    <p>Once the subgraph is derived and simplified, we traverse this subgraph to extract a set of paths that represent isoforms. To accomplish this, we exploit the exSPAnder algorithm (<xref rid="btad781-B17" ref-type="bibr">Prjibelski <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2014</xref>), which utilizes linkage information from paired and single reads in order to reconstruct paths in the assembly graph. In this work, exSPAnder was extensively modified to enable path construction using only a defined sub-graph and reads from a single cloud. The extracted paths are further clustered based on their sequence content, namely by their edges, as well as the leftmost position of the first edge and the rightmost position of the last edge they traverse.</p>
    <p>Furthermore, we maintain a record of the barcodes associated with each cluster, enabling us to estimate the abundances of the respective isoforms. By storing this information, we can quantify the relative representation of different isoforms within the dataset, providing valuable insights into their prevalence and distribution.</p>
    <p>Previous versions of exSPAnder were able to operate only on the complete assembly graph, were not able to run multiple times in one assembly process, and ignored edges without paired-end information. By utilizing this modified version of the exSPAnder algorithm, we can effectively reconstruct isoforms, even in scenarios where they contain short repetitive regions within their sequences or when different isoforms of the same gene exhibit variations. This solution enables us to accurately restore the underlying structure of the isoforms, enhancing our ability to analyze and interpret complex genomic information.</p>
    <p>The extracted paths are aggregated and organized within a data structure that groups them together based on the specific sequence of edges they traverse, as well as the leftmost position of the first edge and the rightmost position of the last edge they traverse. When introducing a newly extracted path into the data structure, our initial step involves verifying whether the structure already includes entries with an identical edge sequence. If no such entries exist, the path is added into the data structure. However, in cases where matching entries are found, we conduct a secondary check. We examine if there is an existing entry where the disparity between the leftmost position of the first edge and the rightmost position of the final edge is &lt;30 bp in comparison to the new entry. This approach is instrumental in distinguishing between isoforms that differ solely in their initial or final regions.</p>

      <title>3.1 Simulated data</title>
      <p>To test the developed algorithms, we first selected three human genes: <italic toggle="yes">GYPC</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">MAPT</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">BIN1</italic>, which exhibit varying levels of alternative splicing complexity (5, 16, and 15 isoforms, respectively). We visualized assembly and splicing graphs to emphasize the different level of complexity for these genes (see <xref rid="btad781-F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>) using Bandage (<xref rid="btad781-B23" ref-type="bibr">Wick <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2015</xref>) and SpliceGraphs package of Bioconductor (<xref rid="btad781-B7" ref-type="bibr">Gentleman <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2004</xref>). For each gene, we generated simulated reads using InSilicoSeq (<xref rid="btad781-B8" ref-type="bibr">Gourlé <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2019</xref>), ensuring that cloud sizes fit the distribution observed in real SPIso-seq data. We assembled reads for each gene using <sc>cloudrna</sc>SP<sc>Ades</sc>, and then used IsoQuant (<xref rid="btad781-B16" ref-type="bibr">Prjibelski et al. 2023</xref>) to assign each assembled contig to a reference isoform. For each barcode, we compared the assigned isoform with the isoform we used for simulation. As a competitor strategy, we implemented a strategy that assembles read clouds separately and called it “Separate strategy.” The strategy based on the same principles is implemented by LoopSeq (<xref rid="btad781-B5" ref-type="bibr">Callahan <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2021</xref>), which uses SPAdes with unspecified parameters to assemble each cloud separately. LoopSeq pipeline suggests that each read cloud is sequenced around 30×, so we suppose that default parameters were used, but for working with low-coverage data we used “–sc” parameter as the most effective.</p>

      <p><xref rid="btad781-T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> demonstrates that <sc>cloudrna</sc>SP<sc>Ades</sc> is capable of assembling isoforms, more than 98% of which are accurately assigned using IsoQuant. Importantly, we observed no consistent misclassification of any particular isoform. However, we did observe instances where read clouds were ambiguously or incorrectly classified, and the frequency of such occurrences increased for the read clouds with the lower number of reads. Therefore, for such read clouds, the isoform is likely to be split into several parts due to coverage gaps. However, even in real data, we can identify such cases by examining whether the same read cloud produced multiple isoforms for a specific gene. This situation indicates that either the read cloud was not assembled as a single isoform or that two distinct isoforms appeared within the same read cloud. Both types of events are not beneficial for subsequent downstream analysis and can be filtered. The “Fixed recall” column of <xref rid="btad781-T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> shows that after this procedure, the recall goes up for the complex <italic toggle="yes">MAPT</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">BIN1</italic> genes.

      <p>We also assessed the performance of popular short-read RNA assemblers in the case of complex simulated genes. Standard RNA assemblers would assemble the whole dataset ignoring barcode information, and restore transcripts using paired-end information and graph topology. We can’t directly compare these assemblers with cloudrnaSPAdes and Separate pipeline, since they work on a per-barcode basis. However, we can count the number of full-length isoforms in the transcripts produced by various assemblers. We will count the isoform as restored if there is a unique assignment of the contig to the isoform in IsoQuant. For our experiments, we ran the most popular RNA assemblers—Trinity (<xref rid="btad781-B9" ref-type="bibr">Grabherr et al. 2011</xref>), RNA-Bloom (<xref rid="btad781-B12" ref-type="bibr">Nip <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2020</xref>), and rnaSPAdes (<xref rid="btad781-B4" ref-type="bibr">Bushmanova <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2019</xref>). Results can be found in <xref rid="btad781-T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. Note that cloudrnsSPAdes and “Separate” pipeline were able to identify each isoform multiple times, but for the standard short-read RNA assemblers most of the isoforms were undetected. Nevertheless, Trinity performs better than rnaSPAdes on our datasets.</p>

      <title>3.2 Real data</title>
      <p>To demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in detecting full-length isoforms, we conducted an analysis using SPIso-seq sequencing data obtained from a diverse pool of 50 individual human brain cDNA samples (<xref rid="btad781-B21" ref-type="bibr">Tilgner <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2018</xref>). This dataset enabled us to explore a wide range of alternative isoforms and natural variations within genes. We successfully assembled a total of 181.8 million read pairs, corresponding to 584 399 unique barcodes, utilizing our <sc>cloudrna</sc>SP<sc>Ades</sc> tool. The assembly process required ∼74 h and reached a peak memory usage of 205 GB. TRINITY also assembled this dataset within 10 days. Note that this dataset is around 2–3 times larger than standard transcriptomic dataset, so it requires increased computational resources. Nonetheless, considering the anticipated growth in sequencing datasets in the future, our dataset serves as a representative example of this evolving landscape.</p>
      <p>The assembly process yielded a total of 4 518 183 contigs with a length &gt;300 bp. To gain insights into the isoform composition, we utilized IsoQuant in combination with GENCODE v32 annotation and the GRCh38 reference genome. Among these contigs, 1 463 514 exhibited a unique assignment to a specific isoform, while 55 611 contigs had minor differences in their assignments. In contrast, 1 582 720 contigs were assigned ambiguously, 699 042 contigs showed inconsistencies in their assignments, and 998 806 assignments were deemed uninformative.</p>
      <p>The presence of a substantial number of non-unique assignments can be attributed to the inherent noise in real sequencing data. It is important to note that not only full-length isoforms are captured but also fragmented or partially processed RNA products, which can contribute to the ambiguity in assignments. However, since processed isoforms tend to be more stable compared to other RNA states, we can leverage a barcode-based filtering strategy to mitigate this issue.</p>
      <p>By utilizing read clouds, we can filter the contigs based on the number of associated barcodes. This approach is particularly effective in removing contigs that are classified as inconsistent, non-informative, or intergenic. Interestingly, the filtering method demonstrates similar removal rates for both ambiguously and uniquely assigned contigs. This suggests that at least some ambiguously classified contigs are produced by multiple read clouds. Various factors, such as incomplete annotation or unconnected regions in the assembly graph, could contribute to this phenomenon. A comprehensive summary of the filtering results is presented in <xref rid="btad781-T3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>.</p>

      </table-wrap>
      <p>To show how barcode information can be used in downstream analysis, we wrote a script that filters contigs, if they have a barcode that was assigned to a single gene multiple times. This script aimed to remove parts of read clouds with low coverage for a specific gene, thereby enhancing the accuracy of the assembly results. The results are presented in <xref rid="btad781-T3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> in “fixed rows.”</p>
      <p>A comparison between the “1” and “1-fixed” rows in the table reveals that ∼15% of the ambiguous assignments can be effectively filtered out. This occurs when a single read cloud produces multiple contigs assigned to the same gene. On the other hand, the unique assignments remain relatively unchanged throughout the filtering procedure. These findings suggest that different strategies for refining and improving the results using barcode information hold promise for future investigations. This part highlights the potential of leveraging barcode-based filtering methods to enhance the accuracy and interpretability of barcoded RNA assembly. By refining the assembly results and reducing the presence of ambiguous assignments, researchers can gain more confidence in their analyses and further explore the complexity of isoform expression in various biological systems.</p>
      <p>To demonstrate the effectiveness of <sc>cloudrna</sc>SP<sc>Ades</sc> in reconstructing different isoforms of a single gene, we selected the <italic toggle="yes">ATP6AP2</italic> gene from chromosome X. This gene plays a crucial role in normal kidney development and function (<xref rid="btad781-B10" ref-type="bibr">Hoffmann and Peters 2021</xref>). As documented in GENCODE v32, it has a total of 34 distinct isoforms, although we do not expect all of them to be expressed in our dataset. Remarkably, according to IsoQuant assignments, <sc>cloudrna</sc>SP<sc>Ades</sc> successfully assembled seven isoforms of <italic toggle="yes">ATP6AP2</italic>, highlighting its ability to capture and reconstruct different variants of a gene.</p>
      <p>In contrast, a conventional <italic toggle="yes">de novo</italic> transcriptome assembler, rnaSPAdes (<xref rid="btad781-B4" ref-type="bibr">Bushmanova <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2019</xref>), failed to restore any isoforms with unique assignments for this particular gene. TRINITY was able to assemble two incomplete isoforms that have unique assignments. RNA-bloom was not able to finish with an error during k-mer counting step. This emphasizes the better performance of <sc>cloudrna</sc>SP<sc>Ades</sc> and the utility of read clouds in general in accurately reconstructing isoforms and obtaining reliable assignments. The alignments of some of the assembled isoforms are depicted in <xref rid="btad781-F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>, illustrating the diversity of isoforms captured by <sc>cloudrna</sc>SP<sc>Ades</sc>.</p>

    <title>4 Discussion</title>
    <p>The rise of long-read technologies, such as PacBio and Oxford Nanopore sequencing, has overshadowed the utility of read clouds in contemporary computational biology. These long-read technologies offer easier data interpretation and yield substantial results, capturing the attention of researchers across various computational biology domains.</p>
    <p>Despite this trend, there remains a niche where read clouds can exhibit comparable performance to long reads and find success in the market. Specifically, in the realm of transcriptome sequencing, the relatively simpler nature of the data allows read clouds to achieve results of similar quality to long reads. Transcriptome analysis often demands extensive sequencing data to uncover rare isoforms, and the substantial input requirements and sequencing costs associated with long reads can make read clouds a compelling alternative.</p>
    <p>Therefore, read clouds can be effectively used for discovering novel isoforms and isoform discovery in non-human species. <sc>cloudrna</sc>SP<sc>Ades</sc> offers an effective way to assemble full-length isoforms from cheap and accurate read cloud data. Uncovering novel isoforms plays a crucial role in advancing our understanding of gene regulation, alternative splicing patterns, and functional diversity across different organisms. By identifying and characterizing isoforms in non-human species, we gain insights into the evolutionary dynamics and adaptation processes specific to those organisms.</p>
    <p>Notably, platforms like Tell-Seq and Loop-Seq continue to thrive in the market, specifically catering to transcriptomic analysis. These platforms recognize the unique advantages offered by read clouds in this particular context and continue to provide valuable solutions to researchers in need of comprehensive transcriptome analysis.</p>
