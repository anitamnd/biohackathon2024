      <title>Abstract</title>
      <p>Identifying the transcription factors (TFs) responsible for observed changes in gene expression is an important step in understanding gene regulatory networks. ChIP-X Enrichment Analysis 3 (ChEA3) is a transcription factor enrichment analysis tool that ranks TFs associated with user-submitted gene sets. The ChEA3 background database contains a collection of gene set libraries generated from multiple sources including TF–gene co-expression from RNA-seq studies, TF–target associations from ChIP-seq experiments, and TF–gene co-occurrence computed from crowd-submitted gene lists. Enrichment results from these distinct sources are integrated to generate a composite rank that improves the prediction of the correct upstream TF compared to ranks produced by individual libraries. We compare ChEA3 with existing TF prediction tools and show that ChEA3 performs better. By integrating the ChEA3 libraries, we illuminate general transcription factor properties such as whether the TF behaves as an activator or a repressor. The ChEA3 web-server is available from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://amp.pharm.mssm.edu/ChEA3">https://amp.pharm.mssm.edu/ChEA3</ext-link>.</p>

    <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
    <p>The set of expressed genes defines cell type, and more transiently, cellular response to endogenous and exogenous perturbations. Human intracellular gene expression programs are controlled mainly by ∼1600 putative site-specific transcription factors (TFs). These factors bind and unbind at specific DNA sequences near coding regions to regulate the transcriptional machinery (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Despite an abundance of gene expression data (e.g. RNA-seq and microarrays), TF–DNA binding data (e.g. ChIP-seq), and TF activity data, we still lack a fundamental global understanding of how observed changes in gene expression are governed by changes in TF activity. This may be due in part to assay-specific limitations, and biases that can limit or confound findings. For example, ChIP-seq assays that target TFs commonly suggest TF localization near many genes that are not functional targets of the TF (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). DNA binding motif analyses also attempt to identify the targets of TF regulation (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>), however, such methods produce high level of false positives (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Some methods use TF–gene co-expression associations to elucidate TF targets and gene regulatory networks (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). However, co-expression associations rely on the mRNA level of TFs, which often do not correlate with TF activity that depends on protein levels, localization, and post-translational modifications. In addition, with co-expression data, it can be difficult to discern the direction of causality. Furthermore, direct effects may be confounded by indirect effects due to cascades of interactions (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>).</p>
    <p>There are several bioinformatics tools developed to prioritize TFs given a gene set, or a gene expression signature, as an input. These tools include: VIPER (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>), DoRothEA (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>), BART (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>), TFEA.ChIP (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>), oPOSSUM (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>) and MAGICACT (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). VIPER compares a gene expression signature against putative TF regulons inferred from tissue-specific gene expression data using the tool ARACNe (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). DoRothEA v2 uses the VIPER tool in conjunction with a set of TF regulons derived from motif data, GTEx data (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>), public ChIP-seq data, and the literature, to predict TFs mostly associated with a gene expression signature (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Binding Analysis for Regulation of Transcription (BART) performs enrichment analysis against published ChIP-seq studies listed in the Cistrome Data Browser (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). BART infers a cis-regulatory profile of a query gene set using the tool MARGE (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). BART then predicts transcription factors associated with the <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements based on publicly available TF ChIP-seq data (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). oPOSSUM (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>) detects over-representation of conserved TF binding-site-combinations given gene sets. MAGICACT (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>) uses TF ChIP-seq data to determine whether the peak signals for a query gene set as a whole are greater than what would be expected by chance for a given TF. Similarly, TFEA.ChIP performs gene set enrichment analysis against published ChIP-seq data using either the Fisher's exact test (FET) or the Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) method (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>).</p>
    <p>In this domain, we previously published ChEA (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>) and ChEA2 (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>), which are ChIP-seq and ChIP-chip TF enrichment analysis tools that utilize gene set libraries from published ChIP data extracted from multiple sources. Similar to ChEA and ChEA2, ChEA3 is a web-server application developed to conduct transcription factor enrichment analysis. ChEA3 integrates data about TF/target–gene associations from multiple assay types and other sources of evidence. TFs are prioritized based on the overlap between user-inputted gene sets and annotated sets of TF targets stored within the ChEA3 database. ChEA3 builds upon the prior versions of ChEA by including many more libraries from various types of omics assays and integrating libraries for improved TF ranking.</p>
    <p>ChEA3 is accessible via a web interface and an API that enable users to submit gene sets for analysis. We systemically evaluated the predictive performance of each of the six primary ChEA3 libraries, and the two integration approaches for their ability to rank the perturbed TFs from gene sets derived from 946 single-TF perturbation followed by expression experiments mined from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18–20</xref>). This single-TF perturbation followed by expression dataset is also used to compare the predictive performance of ChEA3 with other similar tools. For benchmarking against existing tools that require queries from a consistent cell line, we use a dataset generated from 49 TF shRNA knockdowns in a B-cell line (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). We demonstrate that integrating multiple independent omics resources improves TF prioritization, and ChEA3 performs well compared with other tools. By combining TF perturbations followed by expression with other sources of evidence, we infer whether a given TF is generally an activator or a repressor.</p>

    <title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title>
    <sec id="SEC2-1">
      <title>Generating the ChEA3 primary TF-Target gene set libraries</title>
      <p>ChEA3 contains six primary reference gene set libraries created from multiple resources. Below is a brief description of each library and the processing procedure to create the library from each resource. To harmonize gene names across libraries, all gene symbols were mapped to 2019 HGNC-approved gene symbols (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>) using an R package we developed for the project called genesetr (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/MaayanLab/genesetr">https://github.com/MaayanLab/genesetr</ext-link>). Gene symbols that could not be mapped using synonyms or aliases were discarded. The set of 1634 unique HGNC-mappable human site-specific transcription factors that are used were previously defined by Lambert <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>).</p>
      <sec id="SEC2-1-1">
        <title>GTEx co-expression</title>
        <p>All RNA-seq samples at the read counts level with their associated metadata were downloaded from the GTEx portal on 6 January 2018 (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Samples were quantile-normalized. Duplicate genes were removed by retaining the genes with the highest variance. For each TF, the set of putative targets was composed by retaining the 300 genes with the greatest absolute Pearson correlation coefficient between the TF and the putative target gene.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="SEC2-1-2">
        <title>ARCHS4 co-expression</title>
        <p>50,000 samples from human were randomly selected for creating a co-expression matrix from the ARCHS4 resource (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). Read counts and metadata were downloaded from the ARCHS4 website on 27 April 2018. These samples were processed as described above for the GTEx data.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="SEC2-1-3">
        <title>ENCODE ChIP-seq</title>
        <p>The ENCODE (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>) TF–target gene-set library was initially generated for Enrichr (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>) using uniformly reprocessed ENCODE TF ChIP-seq experiments. Peak calling was applied to the aligned files with MACS (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). Peaks were then sorted by distance to the transcription start site (TSS). The top 2000 target genes with the closest peaks to their TSS were retained for each experiment. Each gene set corresponds to a specific ChIP-seq experimental condition. Therefore, there are multiple gene sets corresponding to some of the same TFs.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="SEC2-1-4">
        <title>Gene sets from individual ChIP-seq publications</title>
        <p>The literature-based ChIP-seq TF target library is derived from TF ChIP-seq and ChIP-chip experiments mined from publications found within the biomedical research literature. Previous versions of this library were used in ChEA (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>), ChEA2 (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>), and Enrichr (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). The metadata of the gene set library includes the TF that was profiled, the PubMed ID of the publication from which the experiment originated, as well as the species, the assay type, and the cell- or tissue-type. If only the BED file was provided by the authors of the original study, peaks were mapped to genes using a custom script. Each gene set corresponds to a specific ChIP-seq experimental condition in a specific study. Therefore, there are multiple gene sets corresponding to some of the same TFs.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="SEC2-1-5">
        <title>ReMap ChIP-seq</title>
        <p>BED files from the ReMap resource were batch downloaded to a local server (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). A peak score <italic>s<sub>i,j,k</sub></italic> was generated for each ChIP-seq peak <italic>i</italic> corresponding to a TF <italic>j</italic> within a 50 kb window around the TSS <italic>k</italic> where <italic>s</italic><sub>i,j,k</sub> = 1 – distance<sub>i,k</sub>/50 000. We let the distance<sub>i,k</sub> be the distance of the peak <italic>i</italic> summit from the TSS <italic>k</italic>. For each TSS <italic>k</italic> and TF <italic>j</italic> pair, peak scores were summed to produce a score <italic>t<sub>j,k</sub></italic> to each TSS for each TF. TF targets were then assigned to the top 5% nonzero TSS scores with a cap of 1500 top targets per TF.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="SEC2-1-6">
        <title>Enrichr Queries</title>
        <p>User-submitted lists to the Enrichr tool (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>) were dumped from the Enrichr database on 27 October 2017. The collection of queries totaled 1 097 157 unique lists. Lists used for internal testing, lists with &gt;2000 genes, lists with fewer than two genes, and lists from IP addresses that submitted &gt;1000 lists were discarded. Co-occurrence analysis was performed on the remaining 293 747 lists as follows: For each TF <italic>i</italic>, the probability of co-occurrence of the transcription factor TF<sub>i</sub> with a gene <italic>g</italic><sub><italic>j</italic></sub>, P(TF<sub><italic>i</italic></sub> ∩ <italic>g</italic><sub><italic>j</italic></sub>), was computed for all genes in G. The top 300 co-occurring genes with each TF<sub><italic>i</italic></sub> were used as putative TF<sub><italic>i</italic></sub> targets.</p>
      </sec>
    </sec>
    <sec id="SEC2-2">
      <title>Transcription factor enrichment analysis</title>
      <p>The significance of the overlap between two gene sets is computed using the FET. The background is set to 20 000 genes by default. This value was selected as an estimate to reflect the typical number of genes in most analyses. It also produces a reasonable amount of TFs passing a significant threshold. The background number does not affect the ranks of the results but does have an influence on the <italic>P</italic>-values. ChEA3 only accepts Human Genome Organisation (HUGO) Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC)-approved gene symbols. Therefore, ChEA3 accepts genes from other species that have orthologs with gene symbols that directly map to human gene symbols. False discovery rates are computed with the Benjamini–Hochberg correction method for each library separately. An integer rank is generated for each gene set in a library, where 1 indicates the gene set in the library has the lowest corrected FET <italic>P</italic>-value, and <italic>k</italic> is the rank of the gene set in the library with the highest <italic>P</italic>-value where <italic>k</italic> is the number of unique TFs in the library. Ties are broken by random assignment. For those libraries containing multiple gene sets corresponding to the same TF, the gene set with the lowest <italic>P</italic>-value is used. A scaled rank is computed by dividing each integer rank by <italic>k</italic>. Therefore, for a single query, there is one TF gene set ranking for each gene set library in ChEA3. The six sets of TF gene set rankings are integrated by two methods: MeanRank and TopRank. For MeanRank, the mean rank of each TF across all libraries containing that TF is the score by which a composite list of TFs is re-ranked. For TopRank, the best scaled rank of each TF across all libraries is used as the score by which a composite list of TFs is re-ranked.</p>

    <sec id="SEC2-3">
      <title>Generating the benchmarking datasets</title>
      <p>Single-TF perturbation experiments including knockdowns, knockouts, overexpression, and chemical inhibition followed by genome-wide microarray profiling were manually curated by the crowd for the CREEDS resource (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). The automatically extracted CREEDS signatures were not used in the benchmarking of ChEA3. Full signatures were computed as described in Wang <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>) using the Characteristic Direction method (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). Of the 786 TF LOF/GOF experiments from CREEDS, 283 are from human and 503 are from mouse. These 786 signatures contain 275 unique site-specific TFs. An additional 160 human single-TF perturbation RNA-seq experiments were manually curated from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) by first programmatically searching the ARCHS4 resource metadata for potential studies that contain relevant TF-related signatures. Only studies with at least two perturbation samples and at least two control samples were retained. The uniformly reprocessed GEO samples were downloaded from ARCHS4, quantile normalized and signatures were generated with the Characteristic Direction method (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>).</p>
      <p>We generated three types of benchmarking query gene sets from the 946 signatures created from CREEDS and ARCHS4: (i) gene sets containing the top 600 differentially expressed genes either from CREEDS or ARCHS4 (top 300 upregulated and top 300 downregulated genes), which we term <italic>TFpertGEOupdn</italic>; (ii) gene sets containing only the upregulated genes from <italic>TFpertGEOupdn</italic>, which we call <italic>TFpertGEOup</italic>; and (iii) gene sets containing only the downregulated genes from <italic>TFpertGEOupdn</italic>, which we call <italic>TFpertGEOdn</italic>. Up- and downregulated genes in these sets were determined from the Characteristic Direction method's coefficients. To examine the effect of gene set size on performance, we also generated <italic>TFpertGEO200</italic> and <italic>TFpertGEO1000</italic> in the same manner as <italic>TFpertGEOupdn</italic>, but with gene set sizes of 200 and 1000, respectively. We segregated the <italic>TFpertGEOupdn</italic> benchmarking set into human and mouse benchmarking sets: <italic>hsTFpertGEOupdn</italic> and <italic>mmTFpertGEOupdn</italic>. Finally, we refer to the 443 single-TF LOF/GOF full signatures from human that were used to benchmark other TF prediction tools as <italic>hsTFpertGEOsig</italic>. The <italic>TFpertGEO</italic> benchmarking datasets contain 443 human TF LOF/GOF and 503 mouse TF LOF/GOF experiments.</p>
      <p>In addition to the <italic>TFpertGEO</italic> benchmarking datasets, another benchmarking dataset was derived from Cusanovich <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Of the 59 knockdowns of TFs and chromatin modifiers available in this dataset, 49 were mappable to the set of site-specific TFs within ChEA3. To generate the <italic>Cusanovich</italic> benchmarking dataset, probe-level estimates (log<sub>2</sub>-transformed) from GSE50588 were downloaded from GEO (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Illumina probes were then mapped to HGNC-approved gene symbols using the illuminaHumanv4.db R package. For probes mapping to the same gene, the probe with the highest variance across samples was retained. The data were then quantile-normalized across samples. Forty-nine TF shRNA vs. control signatures were generated by the t-test according to the VIPER R package vignette. This dataset of full gene signatures, which we term <italic>sigCusanovich</italic>, was used to benchmark the published VIPER B-cell regulon available in the viperbcell R package and a B-cell regulon we generated from the GSE50588 expression dataset with ARACNe-AP (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). The top 300 upregulated and the top 300 downregulated genes from each <italic>sigCusanovich</italic> signature were used to generate TF shRNA-associated gene sets for the <italic>setCusanovich</italic> benchmarking dataset, which was used to benchmark ChEA3 for comparison to the VIPER B-cell regulons.</p>

      <title>Benchmarking metrics</title>
      <p>Each gene set from the <italic>TFpertGEOupdn, TFpertGEOup, TFpertGEOdn, hsTFpertGEOupdn, mmTFpertGEO</italic>updn and <italic>setCusanovich</italic> benchmarking datasets was submitted to ChEA3. Transcription factors were ranked within each library according to the returned FET <italic>P</italic>-values. Ranks within each library were then scaled between 1/n and 1, where n is the number of unique TFs in the library, to accommodate different library sizes. The R package PRROC was used to compute the area under the Receiver-Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve and Precision-Recall (PR) curve for each library. The positive class consists of ranks of the perturbed TF. The negative class consists of the ranks of all other TFs that were not perturbed in the experiment. To generate PR curves and ROC curves, we down-sampled the negative class to the same size as the positive class, similarly to the way it is described by Garcia-Alonso <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Each library has a different number of TFs and therefore has a different ‘random classifier’ PR curve. By down-sampling the negative class to the same size as the positive class, a random classifier would have a PR AUC of 0.5. For consistency, we also down-sampled the negative class in the same manner to generate the ROC curves. ROC and PR curves were bootstrapped in this manner 5000 times and then the mean ROC and PR AUCs were reported. The base R function approx() was used to linearly interpolate between all points from the 5000 ROC curves and the 5000 PR curves in order to generate composite ROC and PR curves for each library and tool for visualization. We also employed an additional metric of performance as follows. The set of rank values of the perturbed transcription factors were identified for all gene set queries. We then examined the cumulative distribution function of this set of ranks, <italic>D</italic>(<italic>r</italic>). If the perturbed TFs do not display preferentially low or high ranks, then we expect a uniform distribution <italic>D</italic>(<italic>r</italic>) = <italic>r</italic>. We therefore examine <italic>D</italic>(<italic>r</italic>) – <italic>r</italic> for significant deviations from zero in order to evaluate different libraries and methods. Anderson-Darling tests were used to evaluate the null hypothesis, <italic>D</italic>(<italic>r</italic>) = <italic>r</italic>, and were performed using the goftest R package.</p>

      <title>ChEA3 libraries and web tool</title>
      <p>ChEA3 performs TF target overrepresentation analysis against six TF target set libraries covering 1,632 unique TFs (Table <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Site-specific DNA-binding TFs were included in ChEA3 as defined in the seminal publication by Lambert <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Non-specific transcription factors, cofactors, and chromatin modifiers are excluded. Genes that are highly co-expressed with transcription factors were pulled from the GTEx (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>) RNA-seq data, and from the uniformly reprocessed GEO RNA-seq data from ARCHS4 (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). Uniformly reprocessed publicly available ChIP-seq data were collected from ENCODE (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>) and ReMap (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). ChIP-seq data were also manually mined from the literature by curating target lists from supporting materials of individual TF studies as an expansion of the work done for ChEA and ChEA2 (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Finally, we used a wisdom of the crowd based approach to identify TF targets by mining user-submitted queries to the web tool Enrichr (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>) to identify genes that frequently co-occur in submitted gene list queries with all human TFs. ChEA3 uses the pairwise FET to compare a user-submitted gene set query to each gene set in each ChEA3 library. Results are returned for each library separately as a list of TFs ranked by their FET <italic>P</italic>-value. TFs are given both an integer rank, with 1 corresponding to the most significant matching TF associated gene set, and a scaled rank from 1/<italic>n</italic> to 1 where <italic>n</italic> is the number of unique TFs in the library.</p>

      <p>We hypothesized that integrating TF target overrepresentation results from across libraries to generate a composite ranking of TFs might overcome unique biases associated with each library and improve the predictive performance of ChEA3. To this end, we developed two integration techniques: MeanRank and TopRank. For each of the 1632 TFs covered by ChEA3, we take the mean of the integer ranks across all libraries and re-rank based on this mean to generate a composite ranking that we term MeanRank. For TopRank, we take the maximum scaled rank assigned to each TF across all libraries and re-rank to generate a composite ranking. By benchmarking the quality of the ranking using an independent TF–target dataset, we demonstrate that the MeanRank and TopRank approaches indeed outperform the original six TF–target libraries using the benchmarking strategy described below.</p>

      <title>Benchmarking the ChEA3 libraries</title>
      <p>To benchmark the predictive performance of ChEA3, gene expression signatures were extracted from 946 single-TF loss-of-function (LOF) and gain-of-function (GOF) human and mouse experiments from GEO. Relevant studies were identified, then control and perturbation samples were tagged, and then signatures were extracted using a uniform pipeline. This was first achieved for microarray studies by contributors to a microtask crowdsourcing project (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>) and then for RNA-seq utilizing the ARCHS4 resource (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). We generated up, down, and combined up/down gene sets from these signatures and queried the ChEA3 API with each gene set to determine how well each ChEA3 library recovers the perturbed TF. ROC and PR curves were generated from the rankings of the experimentally perturbed TFs which compose the positive class, and sampled rankings of the unperturbed TFs that compose the negative class (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>-<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">C</xref>). We also looked at the empirical cumulative probability density (ECPD) of the ranks of the positive class <italic>D</italic>(<italic>r</italic>) for each library as compared to the ECPD of a uniform rank distribution <italic>r</italic>, which is <italic>D</italic>(<italic>r</italic>) <italic>– r</italic> (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>). A greater deviation from zero indicates better recovery of the perturbed TFs. Integrating results across libraries yielded improved predictive performance by multiple metrics that assess the global distribution of ranks. By these metrics, the MeanRank approach performs the best. Interestingly, the Enrichr ‘wisdom of the crowd’ library displays the best performance of the six ChEA3 TF target libraries.</p>

      <p>Arguably, a ChEA3 user is interested only in the top-ranked TFs returned by the tool. Therefore, for each rank percentile, we examined the fraction of the benchmarking dataset TF perturbations that are recovered. We computed this fraction in two ways: one where we considered the entire benchmarking dataset, and one where we considered only the subset of the benchmarking dataset where the perturbed TFs are covered by the library (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S1</xref>). When we examined the fraction of the benchmarking subset recovered in the top percentile of the TF ranks, we observed that the integrated libraries perform comparably to the ChIP-seq libraries, but with much greater TF coverage (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S2</xref>).</p>

      <p>In our global assessment of the TF rankings returned by the ChEA3 libraries, the ChIP-seq libraries displayed the lowest performance when assessing the global ranks. In contrast, in the subset of the benchmarking experiments where there is ChIP-seq data for the perturbed TF, the ChIP-seq libraries performed well in recovering the perturbed TFs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). This may reflect that some TF target sets may be more amenable to determination by ChIP-seq analysis than others. This could be due to several factors. Others have reported a high rate of non-functional binding sites (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Further, ‘hyper-ChIPable’ regions of the genome exist near highly expressed genes and these regions show binding of many TFs (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>), possibly further diminishing the specificity of the TF target gene sets in these libraries. Some TFs and their target sets may be more or less tissue- or context-specific than others (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>), and some TFs may regulate their targets more distally (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>).</p>
      <p>In order to assess aspects of a signature that could be contributing to better predictions, the benchmarking dataset was separated into four groups of TF perturbation gene sets. These four groups consist of: (i) upregulated sets of genes from TF GOF experiments (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figures S3A and S4A</xref>); (ii) downregulated sets of genes from TF GOF experiments (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figures S3B and S4B</xref>); (iii) upregulated sets of genes from TF LOF experiments (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figures S3C and S4C</xref>), and (iv) downregulated sets of genes from TF LOF experiments (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figures S3D and S4D</xref>). For queries where the perturbed upstream TF had a loss of function, the ChIP-seq libraries perform best when queried with the downregulated genes. Conversely, for signatures where the upstream TFs were over-expressed, the ChIP-seq libraries perform best when queried with the upregulated genes. This observed behavior aligns with the notion that most transcription factors are activators. The co-expression and co-occurrence libraries recover the upstream TFs comparably well across TF perturbation and query types. We also assessed human and mouse TF LOF/GOF experiment-associated gene sets separately using the human <italic>hsTFpertGEOupdn</italic> and mouse <italic>mmTFpertGEOupdn</italic> datasets and found comparable ChEA3 performance for both species (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figures S5–S8</xref>). Finally, we assessed the effect of input size on predictive performance using the <italic>TFpertGEO200</italic> and <italic>TFpertGEO1000</italic> benchmark sets and found that the performance of ChEA3 is robust to a range of input gene set sizes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figures S9–S14</xref>).</p>

      <title>Comparing ChEA3 with similar TF ranking tools</title>
      <p>There are several existing tools that perform TF prioritization given gene sets or signatures as input (Table <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Since these tools were built with human data, we used the human TF LOF and GOF experiments for benchmarking them. For tools that accept discrete gene sets as input, which include BART, TFEA.ChIP and MAGICACT, we used the 443 single TF GOF and LOF experiments from the <italic>hsTFpertGEOupdn</italic> benchmarking dataset. VIPER and DoRothEA v2 require full gene expression signatures as input. We benchmarked DoRothEA regulons and an ARACNe-AP regulon generated from GTEx data on the 443 full signatures in the <italic>hsTFpertGEOsig</italic> benchmarking dataset. These results were compared to ChEA3 benchmarked on the hsTFpertGEOupdn dataset (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S15</xref>). We show that both ChEA3 integration strategies, MeanRank and TopRank, outperform all the tools we tested when benchmarked against the <italic>hsTFpertGEO</italic> benchmarking datasets and also have greater TF coverage.</p>

We tested two regulatory networks for VIPER: a published B-cell ARACNe regulatory network (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>), and a network we built from all expression data described in the 49 TF shRNA study (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>) using ARACNe-AP (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>).

      <title>Global analysis of ChEA3 libraries to identify activator and repressor TFs</title>
      <p>Integrating libraries of putative TF targets allows for global analyses of transcription factor activity. To understand the general repressing or activating characteristics of the TFs in the ChEA3 libraries, we computed odds ratios (ORs) using gene sets from the <italic>TFpertGEOupdn</italic> benchmarking dataset and the ChEA3 ChIP-seq libraries. For the odds ratio computation, we define the numerator as the number of genes that are both upregulated upon perturbation of the TF and are ChIP-seq targets of the TF divided by the number of upregulated genes that are not ChIP-seq targets. We define the denominator as the number of genes that are both downregulated on perturbation of the TF and are ChIP-seq targets of the TF, divided by the number of downregulated genes that are not ChIP-seq targets. If the numerator is greater, then it can be said that the targets tend to be upregulated and the OR &gt; 1. If the denominator is greater, then it can be said that the targets tend to be downregulated and the OR &lt; 1. We then consider whether the perturbation increased or decreased the activity of the TF. If the TF acts as an activator and the experiment was a GOF perturbation, then we expect the OR &gt; 1. Conversely if the TF acts as an activator and the experiment was a LOF perturbation, then we expect the OR &lt; 1. If the TF acts as a repressor and the experiment was a GOF perturbation, then we expect the OR &lt; 1. Finally, if the TF acts as a repressor and the experiment was a LOF perturbation, then we expect the OR &gt; 1. Therefore, the negative log(OR) was considered for TF LOF experiments, while the positive log(OR) was considered for TF GOF experiments (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>, B). These values will be positive if the TF is an activator and negative if the TF is a repressor. We recover known activators and repressors in this analysis, for example, REST is a known repressor of neuronal genes in non-neuronal cell types. REST is shown to predominately be downregulating its targets. CTCF is predominantly considered an insulator (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>), but also shown to be an activator (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>). In our analysis, CTCF appears to be predominately activating its putative targets. This observation points to a potential role in tethering distant enhancers to their promoters (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>). MYC, while predominately shown to be an activating TF, also has significant ORs that suggest a repressor role in some contexts, which is supported by previous studies (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>). We also compared our analysis to mouse and human TF–target interactions mined from literature in the TRRUST v2 reference database (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6C</xref>) (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>). The TRRUST database contained signed and directed connections mined from the literature. Overall, our automated analysis agreed with the trends observed from TRRUST.</p>

      <title>The ChEA3 web interface</title>
      <p>The ChEA3 landing page contains an input form for users to submit their gene list. Following submission of a gene set, searchable, sortable and exportable results tables appear for each of the six ChEA3 libraries, and for the two integration methods: MeanRank and TopRank. These tables appear in the order of how well the library, or the integration technique, performed in our benchmark. This is implemented to aid users with deciding which table is most relevant for hypotheses generation. We project the results from these tables onto three global edgeless TF co-expression networks, and also generate local TF co-regulatory networks for each library with the top TF results. A clustergram tab shows the overlapping query gene targets among the top library results (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>), and a bar chart shows the contributions of each library to the top TF rankings from the MeanRank integration method. The global co-expression networks serve to provide context for the user about how the most enriched TFs fit within the larger TF co-regulatory network. The local TF co-regulatory networks contain directed and undirected edges to communicate how the top returned TFs may co-regulate one another. The clustergram provides visualization of consensus targets and enriched TFs across libraries. The networks and diagrams are exportable as publication-quality figures in vector graphics format. The ChEA3 landing page also contains information about the methods, benchmarking results, a brief tutorial, and example code for demonstrating how to submit queries through the ChEA3 API. These informational sections are accessible using the navigation bar at the top of the page, or by scrolling.</p>

    <title>SUMMARY</title>
    <p>ChEA3 is a web server application that predicts TFs associated with user-submitted gene sets using data from multiple orthogonal omics sources. Other sources for TF–target association are also available from the ChEA3 site, and this collection is expected to continually grow. We benchmarked the performance of six primary libraries within ChEA3 and show that integrating enrichment analyses from multiple libraries improves the recovery of the ‘correct’ upstream TFs associated with a user gene set. This data integration approach highlights the strength of combining evidence from independent sources. Interestingly, the ‘wisdom-of-the-crowd’ gene set library created from the Enrichr queries outperformed all other libraries in the global analysis of rankings. This passive form of discovery, resulting from the usage of a bioinformatics tool, can be applied to other tasks, for example, gene function prediction.</p>
    <p>We also show that ChEA3 outperformed TF ranking when compared with other existing tools. Such a benchmarking approach should be challenged, tested by others, and used in future studies to compare similar tools. We also demonstrate how integrating data from two assay types, namely ChIP-seq and genome-wide mRNA expression, enables global analysis that can determine whether a TF is mostly an activator or a repressor. Integrating ChIP-seq and genome-wide mRNA expression from TF perturbation studies can be used to construct signed directed networks that can be further analyzed to better understand the topology of the human TF regulatory network. Overall, ChEA3 can guide many future experimental and computational studies that aim to explore gene expression regulatory mechanisms in mammalian cells.</p>
