        <title>Background</title>
        <p>Although many prognostic single-gene (SG) lists have been identified in cancer research, application of these features is hampered due to poor robustness and performance on independent datasets. Pathway-based approaches have thus emerged which embed biological knowledge to yield reproducible features.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>Methods</title>
        <p>Pathifier estimates pathways deregulation score (PDS) to represent the extent of pathway deregulation based on expression data, and most of its applications treat pathways as independent without addressing the effect of gene overlap between pathway pairs which we refer to as <italic>crosstalk</italic>. Here, we propose a novel procedure based on Pathifier methodology, which for the first time has been utilized with crosstalk accommodated to identify disease-specific features to predict prognosis in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>Findings</title>
        <p>With the cohort (N = 355) of HCC patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), cross validation (CV) revealed that PDSs identified were more robust and accurate than the SG features by deep learning (DL)-based approach. When validated on external HCC datasets, these features outperformed the SGs consistently.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>Interpretation</title>
        <p>On average, we provide 10.2% improvement of prediction accuracy. Importantly, governing genes in these features provide valuable insight into the cancer hallmarks of HCC. We develop an R package PATHcrosstalk (available from GitHub <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/fabotao/PATHcrosstalk" id="ir0005">https://github.com/fabotao/PATHcrosstalk</ext-link>) with which users can discover pathways of interest with crosstalk effect considered.</p>

        <title>Evidence before this study</title>
        <p id="p0010">Deep learning-based approaches have provided inspiring prediction performance in cancer research. However, a recent study employing autoencoder, a deep learning framework, to obtain mRNA features for risk stratification in hepatocellular carcinoma, reported prediction accuracy around 0.7 in multiple datasets. This moderate performance can be largely attributed to the high heterogeneity of hepatocellular even using the competent deep learning framework. Pathifier, a pathway-based methodology, derives pathway deregulation score, a robust feature of interpretability, using mRNA expression data. This approach is promising for noisy expression data and has not been used in hepatocellular carcinoma.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="s0010">
        <title>Added value of this study</title>
        <p id="p0015">We found that the association between pathway deregulation and prognosis in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma could be affected by gene overlap between pathway pairs, developed and validated a risk stratification model. This model is based on the pathway deregulation score of 13 pathways/sub-pathways by Pathifier that differentiate patients into moderate or aggressive risk subtypes with significantly survival difference in both the training and validation datasets. Our study provides substantial improvement of prediction accuracy compared with the deep learning-based study, using the same training cohort (N = 355) as well as other three validation cohorts (N = 231, 221, 41). Our results suggest that pathway deregulation score-based approach is more accurate than deep leaning based method in risk classification. We also provided a nomogram to predict prognosis of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, which was based on 13 identified pathways/sub-pathways.</p>

      <sec id="s0015">
        <title>Implications of all available evidence</title>
        <p id="p0020">For the first time, we identified prognosis associated pathways with removal of gene overlap between pathway pairs and validated a risk stratification model based on deregulation score of 13 pathways/sub-pathways. This model can provide more accurate and robust prediction than the counterpart by deep learning-based approach, with strong potential in future clinical application. Moreover, the dominant genes in these pathways/sub-pathways could provide more focused insights for therapeutic targets discovery of hepatocellular carcinoma. This study has obtained high prediction accuracy in hepatocellular carcinoma which is highly heterogenous and caused by intricate etiologic factors, and can thus be applied to other tumor types with promising findings.</p>

    <title>Introduction</title>
    <p id="p0025">High-throughput expression data in combination with machine learning is a widely adopted strategy to identify prognostic genes with which cancer patients can be stratified into risk subgroups with distinct outcomes. With the hope that the proposed gene-lists can aid the clinicians in therapy decision in cancer [<xref rid="bb0005" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], several commercialized gene-signatures for risk prediction have been approved in clinical practice, especially for breast cancer [<xref rid="bb0010" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="bb0015" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. In spite of relative success in prognosis prediction, it was demonstrated that the prognostic gene-lists were highly unstable in prediction performance and biomarkers identified were greatly influenced by the selection of samples in the training datasets [<xref rid="bb0020" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Due to inherent noise of expression data and tumor heterogeneity, poor feature robustness and prediction performance have been observed in multiple studies [<xref rid="bb0020" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="bb0025" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In addition, small sample size which is not nearly comparable to the number of features (genes) for each sample can lead to a technical hurdle termed “curse of dimensionality”.</p>
    <p id="p0030">Attempts to decode cancer have thus brought about systematic approaches which borrow information from molecular mechanisms among individual genes, proteins or metabolites such as predefined pathways from biological databases e.g. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) [<xref rid="bb0030" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], Reactome [<xref rid="bb0035" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] to extract more stable and interpretable features for risk prediction. Among the pathway-based approaches, most of them estimate a pathway's activity for whole samples without information on its deregulation in a particular sample [<xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], and some others aim to discover novel molecular mechanisms other than established pathways [<xref rid="bb0045" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], the few exceptions are PARADIGM and Pathifier [<xref rid="bb0050" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="bb0055" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. PARADIGM approach determines a score for each pathway and sample utilizing verified connection information and functional assembly of this pathway, which can be inappropriate to complex or incomplete pathways due to its demanding input of pathway mechanism, while Pathifier algorithm only calls for expression data of genes belong to each pathway to estimate coarse-grained scores which represent the extent of pathways' deregulation, by determining the deviation of diseased sample from normal counterpart on the basis of expression data. Several studies have applied Pathifier to tumor subtyping and prognosis prediction successfully [<xref rid="bb0060" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="bb0065" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p>
    <p id="p0035">However, most existing pathways used are general rather than disease-specific and disease progression can only affect them partially. For pathway pairs with many genes in common which we refer to as crosstalk, taking into consideration the impact of the overlapping genes on the PDS quantification of the two pathways can contribute to the identification of disease-associated features, which may become significant when we eliminate the effect of the common part on the significance of the pathways. Although it is intuitive that pathways can influence each other, especially when they share genes, the presence of this phenomenon has not been studied in PDS estimation, which is obtained on the basis of expression variation of genes in each pathway. For two pathways with shared genes: if expression levels of these genes govern the deviation from normal samples in both pathways, the sub-pathway consisting of these common dominant genes should be more related to disease progression; if the expression variations of shared genes provide minimal contribution to the aberration of each pathway, the two remaining sub-pathways after the removal of shared genes can be more disease relevant. In similar manner, crosstalk could have effect on the significance of PDS in associated with survival. To the best of our knowledge, PDS has never been used in complex diseases such as cancer with crosstalk accommodated among existing pathways to discover disease-specific sub-pathways for prognosis prediction.</p>
    <p id="p0040">Due to inherent heterogeneity, cancers are stratified into subtypes with distinct clinical outcome for personalized therapy. One instance is found in HCC, where molecular subtypes have been identified to show distinct differences in terms of survival [<xref rid="bb0070" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="bb0075" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].The prognosis of HCC varies across different subtypes and stages, with an average 5-year survival rate of 18% [<xref rid="bb0080" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The first line treatment (Sorafenib) shows modest effect on prognosis improvement [<xref rid="bb0085" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. High heterogeneity in HCC, as well as intricate etiologic factors such as HBV, HCV and alcohol, poses challenges for accurate and robust prediction of prognosis in HCC patients. To fill this gap, considerable efforts have been made to identify subtypes to delineate the heterogeneity of HCC using mRNA expression data [<xref rid="bb0090" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0095" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0100" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0105" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>]. A recent study based on deep learning (DL) framework has embedded survival information as part of the procedure to obtain SGs in prediction of two subtypes with significant survival differences [<xref rid="bb0075" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], and concluded that moderate prediction accuracy by DL-based approach is caused by heterogeneous nature of HCC due to various risk factor. We have thus turn to more robust PDS rather than mRNAs from noisy expression data, hoping for a more accurate prediction for HCC prognosis.</p>
    <p id="p0045">In this study, we discovered pathway-level features for accurate subtype prediction in HCC based on Pathifier, as opposed to previous studies which derived features without crosstalk effect under consideration. We obtained PDSs from three relatively large HCC cohorts (The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) [<xref rid="bb0110" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], LIRI-JP [<xref rid="bb0115" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] and NCI [<xref rid="bb0120" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]), applied crosstalk correction and discovered survival associated pathways respectively. Afterwards, we identified 76 common pathways shared by these three cohorts, rather than use top features arbitrarily from one cohort of them. Unsurprisingly, survival significant sub-pathways from 8 pathways were discovered after correction, while the 8 predefined pathways were not. We merged and reduced these 76 pathways to 13 non-redundant features, which we believed to be HCC survival specific. Performance was evaluated using CV within the HCC dataset (N = 355) from TCGA cohort, and demonstrated that discovered PDS features provided higher accuracy and stability in classifying survival-risk subgroups than the SGs from the DL-based study [<xref rid="bb0075" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Subsequently, we evaluated this learned model from TCGA data on three external HCC datasets and showed that these features could predict risk subgroups in HCC with elevated accuracy than the SGs by DL-based approach consistently. Notably, the prediction accuracy and robustness of these PDS features also outperformed that of the SGs from the three-omics DL-based design in TCGA cohort, which derived SG features from not only expression profile but also methylation data as well as microRNA expression data. In short, we developed the PDS-based approach for HCC which could improve the prediction accuracy substantially compared to DL-based approach; additionally, we evaluated the removal of crosstalk on PDS between pathway pairs.</p>
    <p id="p0050">In addition to discrete risk classification for HCC, the PDS features were applied to characterize gradual progression of survival-risk using an independent unsupervised sorting algorithm SPIN (Sorting Points Into Neighbourhoods; ref. [<xref rid="bb0125" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]) for above four HCC cohorts, the ranking profiles of which were not only able to characterize risk progression continuously and provide individualized risk prediction in HCC samples, but reproduced the survival-risk distinction of subtypes classified aforementioned. Finally, we found that the dominant genes in discovered pathways consisted of multiple HCC therapeutic targets identified in previous studies and novel biological markers for further investigation.</p>

      <title>Outline of the prediction pipeline</title>
      <p id="p0055">We summarized the overall workflow (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>) and the motivation behind the pipeline design in each step. Given a series of expression profiles, the beginning stage focused on extracting HCC-risk specific pathways whose PDS were used to build prediction model (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>a). To eliminate false positive features as much as possible, we only adopted the survival-associated PDSs shared by the three large HCC cohorts (TCGA, LIRI-JP, NCI) rather than use features from any one of them. We estimated PDS for each pathway and sample utilizing Pathifier algorithm, which quantified the extent of pathway deregulation by quantifying the deviation of the diseased sample from the normal in terms of expression profile of genes in this pathway. This PDS measurement ranged from 0 to 1 and was able to characterize pathway deregulation of HCC samples from normal state continuously during cancer initiation and progression. Subsequently, we kept the top survival-correlated features utilizing Sure Independence Screening (SIS) method with the cutoff threshold of 100 which was much larger than the default n/log(n) for each cohort, where n is the sample size [<xref rid="bb0130" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].<fig id="f0005"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Overall workflow. The workflow includes two steps: (a) obtaining survival-associated features; (b) building model and predicting labels for external cohorts. (a) Expression data from the 3 cohorts is transformed to Pathways Deregulation Scores (PDS) using Pathifier; then, 100 survival-correlated pathways screened with Sure Independence Screening (SIS) for each cohort as well as the screened pathways only shared by the other two cohorts are subject to crosstalk correction; then the common corrected pathways shared by the three cohorts are identified; then the redundant features are filtered out, leaving 13 pathways. (b) K-mean clustering is applied to samples represented by these features in TCGA cohort to identify survival-risk groups. Then the features as well as the survival-risk labels are used to build an SVM model(s) to predict the survival-risk labels of new datasets.</p></caption><alt-text id="al0005">Fig. 1</alt-text><graphic xlink:href="gr1"/></fig></p>
      <p id="p0060">With the 100 survival-correlated pathways from each cohort, we explored the crosstalk effect on the significance of these pathways as well as the common ones between the other two cohorts. With the hypothesis that crosstalk was mainly attributed to gene-overlap between pathways, then strong correlations of PDS between pathway pairs with many common genes were expected. To demonstrate it, we calculated Jaccard similarity index and PDS correlation for each pathway pair with &gt;3 genes in common. Furthermore, we evaluated the effect of crosstalk removal on survival-significance shift of pathways: for each pathway pair [<italic>i</italic>, <italic>j</italic>] with over 3 overlapping genes, the notation <italic>P</italic><sub><italic>i\j</italic></sub> was defined as the set of elements in pathway <italic>P</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> excluding the intersection with <italic>P</italic><sub><italic>j</italic></sub>; similarly, with the notations <italic>P</italic><sub><italic>j\i</italic></sub> we denoted the genes that were in pathway <italic>P</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> but not in pathway <italic>P</italic><sub><italic>j</italic></sub>; additionally, with the notation <italic>P</italic><sub><italic>i∩j</italic></sub> we defined the overlap between pathway <italic>P</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> and <italic>P</italic><sub><italic>j</italic></sub>. Then we calculated the p-values of these sub-pathways in univariate Cox-PH model built with survival information and each PDS as the predictor. After crosstalk correction, significant (FDR p-value &lt; 0.01) pathways/sub-pathways were identified for the three cohorts separately, with the common ones as candidate features for prediction. Within these features, we noticed that multiple sub-pathways from the same existing pathways were identified as significant features and showed considerable correlation of PDSs, among which we chose the representative sub-pathway with lowest mean and SD in p-values in all three cohorts. Finally, 13 pathway/sub-pathways were selected to build classifier for HCC risk.</p>
      <p id="p0065">To compare with SGs from the DL-based study, we employed the same procedure to build and validate models. First of all, K-means clustering using the features obtained was applied to get labels for HCC samples in TCGA cohort with the same cluster number of two. With these labels, we built a classifier using Support Vector Machine (SVM) framework (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). To predict TCGA held-out test data in CV, we built an SVM classifier where the 355 TCGA samples were split into 10 folds for model training and test with a 6/4 ratio rather than 10-fold CV to keep enough test samples for survival analysis. To predict the other three HCC cohorts, we trained the classification model using whole TCGA samples. To avoid any unfair comparisons, we have used the three same metrics (C-index, Brier score and Log-rank p-value) to evaluate performance [<xref rid="bb0135" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="bb0140" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p>

      <title>Crosstalk affects pathway deregulation on survival significance</title>
      <p id="p0175">Crosstalk effect was discussed in classical over-representation studies [<xref rid="bb0190" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], but never addressed for Pathifier methodology. We came up with the hypothesis that strong correlations of PDS between pathway pairs could be expected if the expression levels of common genes between them governed the deregulation of these two pathways. To validate it, we computed the Jaccard similarity index [<xref rid="bb0195" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] of each pair of survival-correlated pathways with at least 3 common genes, and the Pearson correlation coefficient between their PDSs. The Jaccard similarity index <italic>JS</italic> was defined as follows:<disp-formula id="fo0005"><mml:math id="M1" altimg="si1.gif" overflow="scroll"><mml:mi mathvariant="italic">JS</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mo>∣</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo>∩</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mi>j</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo>∣</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>∣</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo>∪</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mi>j</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo>∣</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac><mml:mo>,</mml:mo></mml:math></disp-formula>where ∣<italic>P</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> ∩ <italic>P</italic><sub><italic>j</italic></sub>∣ represented number of genes in both pathway <italic>P</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> and <italic>P</italic><sub><italic>j</italic></sub>, and ∣<italic>P</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> ∪ <italic>P</italic><sub><italic>j</italic></sub>∣ denoted the size of gene set from the union of pathway <italic>P</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> and <italic>P</italic><sub><italic>j</italic></sub>. Pathway pairs with high Jaccard index showed considerable correlation in PDSs of all three cohorts (<xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>), implying the presence of crosstalk in prescreened PDS features [<xref rid="bb0200" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>].<fig id="f0010"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Crosstalk effect on PDS correlation and example of crosstalk matrix.

      <p id="p0180">Furthermore, to demonstrate the effect of removing common genes on the significance of the pathways, we applied crosstalk correction for those survival-correlated features. Among the pathways including the 100 pathways screened by SIS for each cohort, and the common ones only discovered from the other two cohorts, we calculated the crosstalk matrix as illustrated in the Materials and Methods section to show the significance shifts of these pathways after crosstalk correction for each cohort. The matrices illustrated the effect of the common genes removed on the p-values of pathways in different cases (Fig. S1). <xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>d gave an heatmap example of crosstalk matrix, where negative log transformation of original p-values of pathway <italic>i</italic> were placed in the diagonal cell [<italic>i,i</italic>] and recalculated negative log p-values after removing overlap part with pathway <italic>j</italic> were shown in cell [<italic>i,j</italic>]. After crosstalk correction, high significance (bright red in cell [<xref rid="bb0010" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]) of pathway 2 disappeared (deep blue in cell [<xref rid="bb0010" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="bb0030" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]) when the crosstalk due to pathway 6 eliminated, while pathway <italic>k</italic> (firebrick in cell [<italic>k</italic>,<italic>k</italic>]) became more significant (bright red in cell [<italic>k</italic>,1]) when the crosstalk due to pathway 1 eliminated. The heatmaps in Supplementary Fig. S1 gave more detailed representations of cross matrices for three cohorts (TCGA, LIRI-JP and NCI). For simplicity, we represented the pathways with the KEGG map IDs in the heatmaps. These findings implied that overlapping gene sets could affect considerably to the significance of related pathways.</p>

Due to the stochastic gradient descent algorithm in optimization process, we repeated the training process for 100 times using autoencoder and chose the optimal split with similar ratio of 103/252 (vs. 105/255 by Chaudhary et al.) and drastic survival difference between the split subgroups (log-rank p-value = 8.37e-7). Then group labels were utilized to build an SVM classification model using CV, where the 355 TCGA samples were split into 10 folds and used for training and test with a 6/4 ratio. We assessed the prediction accuracy with C-index as well, which measured the proportion of all patient pairs whose risk prediction were consistent with observed survival outcomes [<xref rid="bb0205" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>].

Moreover, only 16 genes out of the 100 features proposed by Chaudhary et al. were identified by us, implying the instability of the SG features by DL-based procedure. It could be argued that the comparison was unfair due to 5 less HCC samples in TCGA dataset we used, however, validations in other three datasets with no more than one-unit difference in sample size between Chaudhary et al. and us showed that the PDS-based approach still outperformed the DL-based method (<xref rid="t0010" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>).</p>

Thus, in TCGA cohort and E-TABM-36 cohort, the improvement was mostly due to the PDS-pathway analysis instead of the crosstalk removal. Put the PDS-based approach with crosstalk removal, the PDS-based approach without crosstalk removal, the DL-based approach together for comparison in three validation cohorts: in LIRI-JP cohort, the three approaches performed similarly (C-index: 0.83, 0.80, 0.84) (Supplementary Table S2); for the NCI cohort, the PDS with crosstalk removal, without crosstalk removal, and the DL-based method obtained C-indexes of 0.76, 0.65 and 0.62; for the E-TABM-36 cohort, the three methods produced C-indexes of 0.80, 0.79, and 0.73. The improvement derived from both the PDS-based method and the crosstalk removal, and the relative magnitudes varied among cohorts, and the PDS-based approach with crosstalk correction performs more robustly in all three validation cohorts. Thus, the crosstalk correction procedure is necessary for accurate prediction. Moreover, even without crosstalk correction, our results still outperform the counterpart by deep learning-based approach.</p>

      <title>Validation on independent HCC datasets</title>
      <p id="p0210">To demonstrate that the conclusion would robustly hold for external datasets, we validated the model trained from TCGA dataset on the other three cohorts of HCC, which had expression data from RNA-Seq and microarray platforms. For the LIRI-JP dataset (n = 231), we obtained decent results which were comparable to the counterpart by DL-based approach we applied (<xref rid="t0010" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>), including high C-index (0.83 vs. 0.84), low Brier score (0.15 vs. 0.15) and more significant log-rank p-value (1.69e-9 vs. 1.07e-7) between the survival subgroups (<xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>b). However, the DL-based approach could not offer competent performance in other two datasets. In the NCI cohort (n = 221), the two subgroups identified by our method showed a much higher C-index (0.76 vs. 0.62), low Brier error rate (0.17 vs. 0.19) and more significant log-rank p-value (1.46e-7 vs. 7.653e-2), compared with the results by the SGs from the DL-based approach (<xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>c). In addition, we applied this model to a small validation dataset of E-TABM-36 (n = 41) and also obtained preferable results including a higher C-index (0.80 vs. 0.73), a lower Brier score (0.18 vs. 0.19) and a more significant log-rank p-value (0.0157 vs. 0.0776) (<xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>d). As to the E-TABM-36 cohort, the DL-based model did not differentiate the survival-risk subgroups significantly; in contrast, we obtained higher C-index and more significant log-rank p-value (<xref rid="t0010" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>), implying superior survival-risk stratification. When compared with the results analysed by Chaudhary et al., our method provided more considerable improvement in prediction accuracy as well as risk-stratification for all validation datasets (<xref rid="t0010" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>).<fig id="f0015"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>Significant survival differences for four cohorts.

In CV, SVM classifier on TCGA dataset produced higher C-index (0.81 ± 0.03), lower Brier score (0.20 ± 0.02), and significant log-rank p-value (4.16e-6) than our pathway-based model did (Supplementary Table S3).

      <title>Characterization of survival risk progression and individualized prediction</title>
      <p id="p0235">The survival risk of tumor samples is characterized by inherently gradual progression, rather than by clear, abrupt changes between discrete subgroups. For such case supervised classification algorithms, which try to split the samples into distinct groups, thus fails to depict the gradual nature of the phenomenon. In this study, we have utilized SPIN, an unsupervised sorting method, to characterize the gradual changes of survival risk in HCC samples.</p>
      <p id="p0240">Of all samples from four datasets, the ranking profiles by SPIN were not only able to characterize risk progression continuously in HCC samples, but reproduced the stratification of survival-risk subtypes predicted by SVM model aforementioned (<xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> a-d). The deep blue end represented samples which had minimal pathway deregulation from normal liver tissue, while the samples adjacent to the bright red side were far away from the normal tissue in pathway functionality, implying higher risk compared with the samples in the opposite end. To demonstrate it quantitatively, a Cox-PH model built with the ranking and survival outcome was used to infer survival risk for each individual. Similarly, we used C-index to evaluate the fraction of patient pairs whose risk prediction by SPIN ranking were correctly ordered (<xref rid="t0015" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Of note, this metric here was more aggressive than before because it treated these samples as continuous individuals rather than discrete groups, thus more pairs would be evaluated. To compare with the SG features by the DL-based approach, we applied same procedure to these features to predict individualized risk in the same four cohorts. Consistently, we obtained higher accuracy in terms of C-index for all cohorts compared with the SGs (<xref rid="t0015" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). According to the order by SPIN, we plotted the expression profile of 2439 differential expression genes mentioned earlier between risk subgroups in TCGA dataset (<xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>e), which characterized the progression of HCC in gene expression level.<fig id="f0020"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><p>PDS and expression heatmap with samples ranking by SPIN for four cohorts.

      <title>Construction of a nomogram using PDS-based features</title>
      <p id="p0250">To make risk prediction more intuitive for clinicians, we constructed a color-based nomogram from the SVM classifier above using the 13 features (Supplementary Fig. S2). The whole samples of TCGA cohort were used, aiming to build a more accurate nomogram, thus, no clinical covariate was embedded due to high missing rate. Moreover, evidence shows that classifier with clinical information integrated produced no improvement compared with the counterpart without clinical covariates in the study of Chaudhary et al., which was also observed in our exploration. To obtain a risk estimate for a patient with this nomogram, the color corresponding to the feature's value needs to be determined using the color bar specific to each feature. This color is transformed to a value with the color legend at the right. Repeating this for each feature and summing the resulting values, yields the score. This score is then converted into the risk estimate by means of the bottom color bar. The importance of the features is represented by means of the brightness of the color: variables with a higher intensity in yellow have a larger impact on the risk prediction. Of note, this nomogram is actually not easy to use as the counterpart based on linear models, because the color-value conversion is not straightforward and accurate by sight. More powerful tools for nomogram construction are desired for nonlinear models like SVM.</p>

    <title>Discussion</title>
    <p id="p0255">Molecular signatures by statistical models like machine learning trained with high-throughput expression data have long been appreciated and discussed for precision medicine in cancer. However, poor stability and prediction accuracy of SG features have been observed in multiple studies and pose challenges to clinical application. Categories of pathway-based approaches have thus emerged with robust features which are extracted on the basis of molecular mechanisms such as predefined pathways. Pathifier algorithm quantifies pathway deregulation and produces continuous features which can be used to characterize pathway functionality during disease progression. This approach has been utilized in subtypes classification of multiple cancer types with remarkable outcomes, where crosstalk between pathways has never been discussed. A recent procedure filtering SG features with DL framework was applied to prognosis prediction in HCC, a cancer type of high heterogeneity. To demonstrate whether PDS features could outperform these SGs by DL-based approach, we proposed a novel pipeline based on Pathifier with crosstalk accommodated to predict prognosis in the same four HCC datasets. Our pathway-level features led to a substantially better performance of prediction than the SG features by DL-based methodology not only in terms of accuracy but also survival difference between subtypes.</p>
    <p id="p0260">One major advantage of our PDS-based features was in survival risk stratification. Compared with the DL-based approach [<xref rid="bb0075" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], we found that statistically significant survival difference between aggressive subgroup (S1) and moderate subgroup (S2) was more pronounced in the TCGA cohort of HCC patients in CV. This finding also held in other three HCC datasets (LIRI-JP, NCI and E-TABM-36), especially for the small cohort of E-TABM-36 where the DL-based model could not obtain statistically significant outcome. Furthermore, we also evaluated subtype distinction in terms of other clinical criterions. More importantly, more decent performance in all four HCC cohorts showed the robustness of our methodology (<xref rid="t0010" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>), whereas the DL-based approach could not offer comparable results in other three datasets than LIRI-JP cohort.</p>
    <p id="p0265">The robustness and accuracy of our classifier is supported not only by the inherent stability of pathway-level features but also by eliminating false positive features as possible. The general philosophy of Pathifier algorithm is to extract coarse-grained variables from expression space of genes belong to each pathway to represent the extent of deregulation from normal behavior [<xref rid="bb0025" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. With coarse-grained PDS which is less sensitive to noise, we can thus construct simple models with less features that capture the essential aspects of the problem. On the other hand, to avoid false positive features which may dampen performance of validation on independent datasets, we have adopted the survival-significant pathways/sub-pathways only shared by the three large datasets (TCGA, LIRI-JP and NCI) as HCC-specific features, rather than use significant features from one arbitrary dataset.</p>
    <p id="p0270">More importantly, in addition to classification of survival subtypes, the ranking profiles of HCC samples generated by these features can not only characterize tumor progression continuously among patients, but also provide individualized risk prediction as well as pathway deregulation details for each patient. Governing genes identified in these pathways provides important biological insight in selecting treatment strategies for HCC patients. For example, repeated overexpression of the mammalian transcription factor Forkhead Box M1 (<italic>FOXM1</italic>) has been implicated in all major hallmarks of cancer [<xref rid="bb0245" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Findings such as these have generated interest in the development of targeted inhibitors, in this case for <italic>FOXM1</italic> [<xref rid="bb0250" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>,<xref rid="bb0255" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>].</p>
    <p id="p0275">Though we have developed a pipeline for robust stratification of survival subtypes and accurate prognosis prediction in hepatocellular carcinoma, it has a few limitations. First, similar to Chaudhary et al., we obtain class label of the TCGA HCC samples using whole TCGA dataset. Therefore, when we implement CV on TCGA dataset using SVM model, the C-statistics can be inflated; however, validations on other external datasets produce more unbiased C-statistics. Another limitation is that the sample size of one of the three validation datasets (E-TABM-36) is only 41, which may introduce bias into validation. However, validations on the other two large datasets (LIRI-JP, NCI) with sample size of 232, 221 indicate that our model is generally predictive; in addition, we have applied our approach to a relatively large HCC dataset from GSE54236 (N = 78) [<xref rid="bb0260" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>], and still obtained very good prediction accuracy (C-index = 0.88) as well as drastically different risk subgroups of HCC (log-rank p-value = 1.54e-8). An additional hurdle is that a certain number of normal samples are required to estimate PDS more accurately. Hopefully, we have gained improved result in E-TABM-36 cohort with the aid of normal samples from NCI cohort after batch effect adjustment. In terms of prediction accuracy, it may be argued that the sample size differences contribute to improvements in our prediction model in comparison with the results by Chaudhary et al. Though we have used 5 less samples (355 vs. 360) from TCGA cohort in CV than the DL-based study, validations on the other three datasets with very close sample size (LIRI-JP: 231 vs. 230, NCI: 221 vs. 221, E-TABM: 41 vs.40) to the DL-based study still provide better performance consistently. Furthermore, we have also implemented the DL-based approach with our curated datasets and obtained similar outcomes, indicating the higher accuracy and robustness of our approach.</p>
    <p id="p0280">In summary, the PDS-based features derived from Pathifier with crosstalk accommodated provides an accurate and robust stratification of HCC patients with prognostic significance, with the promise to improve precision therapy with subtype-specific efficacy. The dominant genes identified were well consistent with therapeutic targets of HCC from other independent studies. We also expect that our procedure is applicable to other cancer types with good performance. Validations on other cancer types with large sample size are desired for future research.</p>
