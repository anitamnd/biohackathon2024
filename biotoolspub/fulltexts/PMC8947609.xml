      <p>Shotgun metagenomics is a powerful tool to identify antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes in microbiomes but has the limitation that extrachromosomal DNA, such as plasmids, cannot be linked with the host bacterial chromosome. Here we present a comprehensive laboratory and bioinformatics pipeline HAM-ART (Hi-C Assisted Metagenomics for Antimicrobial Resistance Tracking) optimised for the generation of metagenome-assembled genomes including both chromosomal and extrachromosomal AMR genes. We demonstrate the performance of the pipeline in a study comparing 100 pig faecal microbiomes from low- and high-antimicrobial use pig farms (organic and conventional farms). We found significant differences in the distribution of AMR genes between low- and high-antimicrobial use farms including a plasmid-borne lincosamide resistance gene exclusive to high-antimicrobial use farms in three species of <italic toggle="yes">Lactobacilli</italic>. The bioinformatics pipeline code is available at <ext-link xlink:href="https://github.com/lkalmar/HAM-ART" ext-link-type="uri">https://github.com/lkalmar/HAM-ART</ext-link>.</p>

      <title>Author summary</title>
      <p>Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is one of the biggest global health threats humanity is facing. Understanding the emergence and spread of AMR between different bacterial species is crucial for the development of effective countermeasures. In this paper we describe a user-friendly, affordable and comprehensive (laboratory and bioinformatics) workflow that can identify, associate and track AMR genes in bacteria. We demonstrate the efficiency and reliability of the method by comparing 50 faecal microbiomes from pig farms with high-antibiotic use (conventional farms), and 50 faecal microbiomes from pig farms with low-antibiotic use (organic farms). Our method provides a novel approach to resistance gene tracking, that also leads to the generation of high quality metagenomic assembled genomes that includes genes on mobile genetic elements, such as plasmids, that would not otherwise be included in these assembled genomes.</p>

    <title>Introduction</title>
    <p>The emergence of resistance to antimicrobials in bacteria can occur by spontaneous mutation or by the acquisition of mobile genetic elements carrying antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes [<xref rid="pgen.1009776.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] (for example, plasmids <italic toggle="yes">via</italic> natural transformation or conjugation, or bacteriophages <italic toggle="yes">via</italic> transduction [<xref rid="pgen.1009776.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]). Over the last decade, metagenomic studies have revealed that bacterial communities comprising gut flora or soil microbiota possess a diverse arsenal of AMR genes, termed the resistome [<xref rid="pgen.1009776.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], some of which can be transferred between related or unrelated species. A limitation of next-generation sequencing metagenomics is the identification of species harbouring a particular AMR gene when that gene is present in extra-chromosomal DNA. Alternative approaches based on traditional culture of bacteria have provided direct experimental evidence of plasmid-mediated AMR gene transfer from enteric pathogens to commensal <italic toggle="yes">Escherichia coli</italic> in rodents [<xref rid="pgen.1009776.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1009776.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], chickens [<xref rid="pgen.1009776.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] and humans [<xref rid="pgen.1009776.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. <italic toggle="yes">Salmonella</italic>-inflicted enteropathy has been shown to elicit parallel blooms of the pathogen and of resident commensal <italic toggle="yes">E</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">coli</italic>. These blooms boosted horizontal gene transfer (HGT) in general, and specifically, the transfer of a conjugative colicin-plasmid p2 from an introduced <italic toggle="yes">Salmonella enterica</italic> serovar Typhimurium to commensal <italic toggle="yes">E</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">coli</italic> [<xref rid="pgen.1009776.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. It has been shown that the use of in-feed antimicrobials leads to a bloom in AMR genes in the bacteriophage metagenome recovered from treated pigs [<xref rid="pgen.1009776.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], although it is unclear what the sources or destinations of these genes are. These observations suggest that HGT between pathogenic and commensal bacteria is a common occurrence in humans and animals and is likely to contribute to the persistence and spread of AMR. Moreover, many previous studies on the spread of AMR from animal sources have focused on AMR of pathogens, with less emphasis on genes within indigenous microbiota that may also pass to humans from animals (and vice versa) but be difficult to culture.</p>
    <p>To overcome the inability of next-generation metagenomic sequencing to identify where extra-chromosomal genes of interest reside, several chromosome conformation technologies (such as 3C, Hi-C), originally designed for the study of three-dimensional genome structure in eukaryotes, have been used [<xref rid="pgen.1009776.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>–<xref rid="pgen.1009776.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. These techniques exploit the ability to create artificial connections between strands of co-localised DNA by cutting and re-ligating the strands. The techniques differ in their manner of detection, and the scope of interactions they can probe. Marbouty <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>. describe the application of robust statistical methodology to 3C sequence data (meta3C) derived from a river sediment microbiome [<xref rid="pgen.1009776.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Hi-C, a technical improvement on the 3C method has been shown to successfully disambiguate eukaryotes and prokaryotes [<xref rid="pgen.1009776.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], and to differentiate closely related <italic toggle="yes">E</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">coli</italic> strains from microbiomes [<xref rid="pgen.1009776.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Both these techniques offer great potential to define the dynamics of an introduced AMR gene (both chromosomal and extra-chromosomal), in particular the nature and frequency of transfer events, including into microbiota constituents that are not readily detectable by culture in the laboratory. We showcase the performance of an adapted laboratory method using a novel bioinformatic pipeline (HAM-ART), optimised for tracking AMR genes, in a study comparing 100 faecal microbiomes from UK conventional and organic pig farms.</p>
  </sec>
  <sec sec-type="results" id="sec002">
    <title>Results</title>
    <p>We adapted exisitng laboratory methodology and developed a bioinformatics pipeline (HAM-ART) that: (i) bins bacterial genomes with high reliability; (ii) associates mobile genetic elements to the host genome; and (iii) annotates and associates AMR genes with high specificity and sensitivity. As HAM-ART is built on traditional metagenomics sequencing methodology, combined with Hi-C sequencing from the same bacterial pellet, it could be applied to any complex microbial community. HAM-ART utilises a widely used sequencing platform, Illumina paired-end sequencing, with standard library sizes and affordable amounts of sequencing per sample. The bioinformatics pipeline was designed to be user friendly, and in addition to generating a set of final metagenomics assembled genomes (MAGs) it outputs results tables reporting assembly quality, taxonomy and AMR gene association.</p>
    <sec id="sec003">
      <title>Proof-of-concept study undertaken to validate HAM-ART</title>
      <p>The HAM-ART methodology was tested in a study comparing AMR in two groups of farms: 5 organic (OG1-5) pig farms, farming to organic certification standards with low antibiotic use, and 5 conventional (CV1-5) pig farms, with higher antibiotic use. Ten faecal samples were taken from each farm for metagenomic analysis as described in the methods section. The organic farms had lower population corrected use (PCU) of antibiotics (average 3.0 mg/PCU, range 0–9.8 mg/PCU) over the year prior to sampling compared to conventional farms (average 85.7 mg/PCU, range 3.9–170.1 mg/PCU). Similarly, the number of different classes of antibiotics used on each farm ranged from 0–4 for organic farms and 4–9 for conventional farms. The results of metagenomic analyses are described below.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec004">
      <title>Generation of MAGs using the HAM-ART pipeline</title>
      <p>The pipeline produced <italic toggle="yes">de novo</italic> assemblies using approximately 500k contigs from each faecal sample, coupled with 0.2–3.4M informative binary connections from the Hi-C pairs. A Hi-C connection is informative if it connects two different contigs as opposed to a connection within the same contig. The initial products of HAM-ART are the consensus clusters (CCs); a collection of contigs that are clustered together during the network resolution step, solely based on Hi-C contacts, that approximate to a genome of a constituent bacterial species. The total number of CCs for each sample varied between 6k-54k. Of these, we focussed on CCs comprising &gt;250kb (representing about 1/10<sup>th</sup> of an average prokaryotic genome) for further pipeline processing. After the splitting and extension of the large CCs (as described in the methods section) the number of MAGs varied between 5 and 131 (mean: 62, median: 60) per faecal sample.</p>
      <p>A total of 6184 MAGs were identified from the 100 samples which were distributed into 1555 clades based on pairwise genetic distance, indicating groups of MAGs which were likely to represent the same species or genus. The number of members for each clade varied between 1 and 79 (mean: 3.97, median: 2). All clades were subjected to clade refinement that resulted in 553 clades with at least one MAG over 500kb in size. After the clade refinement we ended up with 6164 best quality MAGs.</p>

      <p>This shows that although reads were present in most shotgun libraries, it was only when there were ≥50k <italic toggle="yes">E</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">coli</italic> reads that a MAG could be created. This observation suggests that 60-80k reads (representing about 9–12 Mbp), approximating to 2x coverage of an <italic toggle="yes">E</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">coli</italic> genome are required in order to generate a MAG. In this study, which generated approximately 35M reads (5.25 x10<sup>9</sup> bp) for each sample, an individual species would need to represent ~0.2% of the total bacterial community in order to generate a MAG. We believe that the main reason behind the observed sensitivity threshold is the amount of shotgun metagenomics sequencing as we used pooled (and later shared) Hi-C libraries to resolve binning, and the same number of Hi-C contacts were not enough to assemble <italic toggle="yes">E</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">coli</italic> MAGs if the genome wasn’t represented with sufficient coverage.</p>

    <title>Discussion</title>
    <p>Conventional shotgun metagenomics sequencing can generate lists of AMR genes and lists of species contained in a microbiome but is not capable of consistently identifying which bacteria carry which plasmid. The application of Hi-C metagenomics in this study demonstrates that this technique can place AMR genes carried on plasmids with their host genomes. The HAM-ART pipeline was tested using a challenging experimental design involving 100 faeces samples from 10 different farms. The results from this study show that it is possible to obtain high resolution, good quality results by performing relatively modest amounts of sequencing on samples of varying quality. While there are other pipelines capable of analysing combined chromosome-capture based assembly and AMR gene association [<xref rid="pgen.1009776.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>–<xref rid="pgen.1009776.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], during the development of HAM-ART we aimed to design a tool capable of coping with large sample numbers, using the most common Illumina based sequencing platform and delivering results from affordable amounts of sequencing depth.</p>
    <p>Unsurprisingly this study shows that farms with lower use of antimicrobials (typically organic farms, who are members of an assurance scheme that strongly regulates the amount of antimicrobials to which the animals are exposed) are associated with smaller numbers and lower diversity of AMR genes, as has been shown in previous studies [<xref rid="pgen.1009776.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1009776.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The statistically significant correlation between the amount of antimicrobial used, and the number of different AMR genes detected for each farm clearly demonstrates this relationship and supports this as a driver of AMR. In future studies collection of further metadata (e.g., main food component ratios, animal density on farms, hygiene rating), may contribute to a more accurate model in predicting the emergence of AMR genes and consequently identify the main factors to increase/decrease. The use of Hi-C metagenomics allows a deeper investigation of the relationship between the use of antimicrobials, AMR genes and the bacteria that harbour those genes.</p>
    <p>Of note from this study, is the demonstration of a particular AMR gene, <italic toggle="yes">lnu</italic>(<italic toggle="yes">A</italic>) that was only found in samples from conventional farms. Within conventional farms we found this gene to be harboured in three different species of <italic toggle="yes">Lactobacillus</italic>. All three species of <italic toggle="yes">Lactobacillus</italic> (<italic toggle="yes">L</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">amylovorus</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">L</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">Johnsonii</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">L</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">reuteri</italic>) were also found in organic farms and the distance tree would suggest that similar levels of diversity are present for each species, whether present in an organic or a conventional farm. There is good evidence that the <italic toggle="yes">lnu</italic>(<italic toggle="yes">A</italic>) gene is carried on the same plasmid for all three <italic toggle="yes">Lactobacillus</italic> species, suggesting that any selection pressure selects for the mobile plasmid rather than the host bacteria. The small number of farms, and potential confounders such as geographical bias may have influenced the observed distribution and so this result needs to be confirmed. Nonetheless, the detection of AMR genes, carried on a plasmid, in multiple species without culture could only be performed using chromosome conformation metagenomics techniques such as Hi-C.</p>
    <p>A direct assessment of the quality of a Hi-C MAG was afforded by the parallel culture and sequencing of an <italic toggle="yes">E</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">coli</italic> isolate from the same sample. The homologous Hi-C MAG contained the same MLST and AMR genes as the assembly obtained from conventional culture and sequencing, including AMR genes likely present on a plasmid.</p>
    <p>Taxonomic identification of shotgun metagenome assemblies is widely recognised as problematic. We used GTDB-Tk [<xref rid="pgen.1009776.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], a method using significantly larger genome set than previous algorithms, but were still not able to resolve the taxonomy of many large clades of interest beyond the class level. The chromosome conformation methodology has the potential to generate better quality MAGs by generating links between contigs to improve binning, assembly or even scaffolding. Greater use of Hi-C metagenomics will enable the production of better-quality MAGs for rare or difficult to culture bacteria. Use of the HAM-ART pipeline should also give a lower likelihood of generating mixed or contaminated MAGs.</p>
    <p>We performed further investigations to confirm that the use of pooled Hi-C libraries (2 per farm) did not lead to artefactual assembly of MAGs from all 5 of the shotgun libraries that used the same pooled Hi-C library to identify connection pairs. The use of pooled Hi-C libraries reduced costs considerably in terms of staff time, reagents and cost. It is clear from an examination of the distribution of taxa among the samples that there are numerous examples of clades/taxa which we only found in a single sample from a set of 5 sharing the same Hi-C library. Out of our total of 6164 MAGs we would have expected equal distribution between organic and conventional farms but only 2176 came from organic farms and 3988 from conventional farms. While this may have occurred due to a lower species diversity present in the organic farms, it is likely to be a consequence of the larger number of lower yielding Hi-C libraries generated from the organic farms.</p>
    <p>The sensitivity threshold for the creation of a MAG from a species contained within a microbiome using Hi-C metagenomic sequencing will be affected by three things. Firstly, the size of the genome of the species of interest (which is likely to be a minor effect); secondly, the amount of sequencing undertaken; and thirdly, the relative abundance of the species of interest, which is probably the most significant influence. The relative abundance of a particular bacterial species may limit the power of the technique when a species of interest may only be present in low numbers. It is likely that there will be some species harbouring AMR genes of interest that are present below a threshold of 1:500 (that we estimate as our theoretical threshold from the <italic toggle="yes">E</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">coli</italic> content comparison). We used ARIBA to independently assemble AMR genes from our short-read sequencing data and did not find any significant discrepancy between the genes assembled with this method and those found in the MAGs. Indicating that where a gene can be assembled, the Hi-C technique is able to place it in a MAG. We are also aware that Louvain algorithm is not perfect and has its limitations that may introduce slight bias in the HAM-ART pipeline. However, this is one of the most widely accepted network resolution methods in 3C and Hi-C metagenomics. With more raw data available from Hi-C metagenomics studies, the benchmarking and implementation of other clustering algorithms is likely to be easier in the future. We were unable to perform a direct comparison of different chromosome conformation metagenomics methodology. It is reasonable to observe that our Hi-C libraries in this study do not appear to encode more 3D signal compared to a classical 3C library. The resource costs of performing 3C are lower and for some research questions this approach will be preferable.</p>
    <p>In summary, we successfully adapted an existing laboratory method and implemented a bioinformatics Hi-C metagenomics pipeline, HAM-ART, and used it to address a research question using a set of 100 separate samples. We optimised HAM-ART to deal with mixed MAGs, to exploit reference MAGs from within the experimental data set, and to assign AMR genes to the correct MAGs with maximum sensitivity and specificity. While the pipeline focusses on AMR gene tracking for this study, it could be used on other dedicated gene sets (for example a library of virulence-associated genes) to associate these to the host genome. Moreover, it provides a cost-effective strategy to assess the dynamics of AMR transfer longitudinally following treatment with specific antibiotics or doses and following experimental infection. We validated our assembly quality and AMR gene associations by comparing a MAG to one obtained from a cultured <italic toggle="yes">E</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">coli</italic> from the same faecal sample. We have also shown that the method is robust and affordable when processing large number of samples and provide data illustrating the operational characteristics of both the wet laboratory and bioinformatic protocols involved.</p>

We sampled five conventional pig farms and five organic pig farms that were members of the Soil Association farm assurance scheme, which stipulates strict controls on the use of antimicrobials. Ten fresh faecal droppings per farm were collected from different groups of fattening pigs aged between 4–20 weeks, transported on ice/cold packs and stored at –80°C within 6 h of collection. Information on the use of antimicrobials in the one-year period prior to sampling was collected by questionnaire informed by the farm records. The annual use of antimicrobials in mg/number of Population Correction Unit (PCU) was calculated by dividing the total amount of each antibiotic used over the course of a year by the total average liveweight of the animals on the farm considering the numbers of pigs and their ages.</p>

      <p>The isolated bacterial fractions from faeces (described in the previous section) were mixed with 2.5% (v/v) formaldehyde (16% methanol-free formaldehyde, Sigma) and incubated at room temperature (RT) for 30 min followed by 30 min at 4°C to facilitate cross-linking of DNA within each bacterial cell. Formaldehyde was quenched with 0.25 M glycine (Merck) for 5 min at RT followed by 15 min at 4°C. Fixed cells were collected by centrifugation (10 mins, 10000 rpm, 4°C) and stored at −80°C until further use. We pooled bacterial pellets of five samples from the same farm to generate Hi-C libraries, thereby obtaining two Hi-C libraries per farm.</p>

      <title>Generation of Hi-C libraries</title>
      <p>The method for the construction of bacterial Hi-C libraries was adapted from Burton <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pgen.1009776.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Briefly, DNA from the fixed cells was isolated by lysing bacterial pellets in lysozyme (Illumina) followed by mechanical disruption using a Precellys Evolution bead beater (Bertin Technologies, France). Isolated chromatin was split into four aliquots and digested for 3 h at 37°C using <italic toggle="yes">HpyCH4</italic>IV restriction enzyme (New England Biolabs). Restriction fragment overhangs were filled with biotinylated dCTP (Thermo Scientific) and Klenow (New England Biolabs) as described by van Berkum <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pgen.1009776.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Biotin labelled digested chromatin was diluted in 8 ml of ligation buffer (New England Biolabs, T4 ligase kit) and proximity ligation was performed at 16°C for 4 h. De-cross-linking was performed at 65°C overnight (o/n) with 250 μg/ml proteinase K (QIAGEN). DNA was recovered upon precipitation with 50% (v/v) isopropanol (Fischer Scientific) in the presence of 5% (v/v) 3M sodium acetate (pH 5.2) (Merck) and then treated with RNase A (QIAGEN). Finally, DNA from each sample was recovered in 50 μl TE buffer (Merck) upon phenol-chloroform (Merck) extraction. For Hi-C libraries, biotin from the un-ligated DNA ends was removed by T4 Polymerase (New England Biolabs). DNA was purified using the Monarch PCR and DNA Clean-up Kit (New England Biolabs).</p>

      <p>Illumina sequencing libraries were constructed from purified DNA obtained after Hi-C library preparations using NEBNext Ultra II DNA library prep kit (New England Biolabs). Approximately, 100 ng of DNA of Hi-C libraries was sheared to 400 bp using a Covaris M220 (duty cycle 20%, 200 cycles per burst, peak incident power 50W, treatment time 40 s; Covaris Ltd., UK). Ends of the sheared fragments were repaired, adaptors ligated, and samples were indexed as described in manufacturer’s protocols. Before the indexing, we performed semi-quantitative PCR to determine the optimal cycle range for indexing.</p>

      <title>Bioinformatics pipeline–pre-processing and de-novo assembly</title>
      <p>Next generation sequencing raw data files were pre-processed in different ways according to the sequencing library they were derived from. Shotgun metagenomics sequencing data passed through two filtering / quality control steps: (i) optical and PCR duplication removal by using clumpify.sh script from the BBMap software package (<ext-link xlink:href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/bbmap/" ext-link-type="uri">https://sourceforge.net/projects/bbmap/</ext-link>); (ii) removal of read pairs matching with the host genome using Bowtie2 [<xref rid="pgen.1009776.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] and the pig reference genome (Sscrofa11.1: GCA_000003025.6). As we performed bacterial cell enrichment during the Hi-C library preparation, we only filtered the raw reads for optical and PCR duplications by using the above-mentioned method. Both raw datasets passed through a merging step, where overlapping (at least 30 nucleotide) reads were merged to one single read, using FLASH software [<xref rid="pgen.1009776.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. After merging, metagenomic sequencing reads were passed to the assembly step as paired-end (un-merged) or single-end (merged) reads. All Hi-C sequencing reads were processed further by a Perl script that detected the modified restriction site (in our case A|CGT is modified to ACGCGT) and re-fragmented reads accordingly. This step ensured that hybrid DNA fragments were not used in the assembly step. Re-fragmented Hi-C reads were used in the <italic toggle="yes">de novo</italic> assembly step as single-end reads to increase genome coverages. The pre-processed sequence reads from both libraries were used in <italic toggle="yes">de novo</italic> metagenomic assembly to build-up contigs from overlapping reads by using metaSPAdes [<xref rid="pgen.1009776.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. To avoid the introduction of any biases towards known species, we did not use any reference sequence-based assembly method.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec019">
      <title>Bioinformatics pipeline–post-processing</title>
      <p>Re-fragmented and unmerged Hi-C reads were realigned to the contigs from the assembly by Bowtie2[<xref rid="pgen.1009776.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] to extract the binary contact information between DNA fragments. The complete list of binary contacts was then transformed to a weighted list and fed into the Louvain algorithm (<ext-link xlink:href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/louvain/" ext-link-type="uri">https://sourceforge.net/projects/louvain/</ext-link>) for 100 iterations of network resolution. Contigs that were clustered together in all 100 iterations were put in the same consensus cluster (CC).</p>
      <p>This network resolution method means that a contig can only be assigned to one cluster which may have two unwanted consequences. Firstly, contigs from two or more closely related species may be assigned to the same CC due to sequence homology. The separation of mixed CCs is first addressed using a coverage distribution-based separation algorithm for each CC which splits the CC if the distribution of sequencing coverage was clearly multimodal. In this step we are aiming to extract the core contigs (the longest contig groups with the least variability in coverage) from the mixed CCs, representing potentially most of the genomic DNA. This may easily result in the exclusion of shorter contigs with higher coverage (<italic toggle="yes">e</italic>.<italic toggle="yes">g</italic>., multi-copy plasmids) from the CC, but this does not affect the final assembly content. During the next iterative extension step, the potentially connected accessory fragments will be associated again with the CC. The second consequence is that contigs that are shared may not be correctly assigned to all the CCs that should contain copies (<italic toggle="yes">e</italic>.<italic toggle="yes">g</italic>., a plasmid possessed by two or more species as a result of HGT). An iterative CC extension step was built into the pipeline at this point to extend clusters based on the Hi-C inter-contig contacts and cautiously identify contigs that should be allocated to multiple CCs. The detailed workflow of the iterative extension step is summarised in <xref rid="pgen.1009776.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Fig</xref>.</p>
      <p>Final MAGs were annotated for AMR genes using BLAST [<xref rid="pgen.1009776.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] using the ResFinder database [<xref rid="pgen.1009776.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] and taxonomically profiled by GTDB-Tk [<xref rid="pgen.1009776.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. AMR genes were also identified from the raw metagenomics sequence reads using ARIBA [<xref rid="pgen.1009776.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] and compared to the MAG assembly AMR associations to identify the absence of any AMR genes in the final MAGs.</p>
      <p>A further clade refinement step in the pipeline exploits the availability of data from multiple samples of the same type (<italic toggle="yes">e</italic>.<italic toggle="yes">g</italic>., the other faeces samples from the same study).</p>

    <sec id="sec020">
      <title>Bioinformatics pipeline–clade refinement</title>
      <p>This part of the pipeline undertakes a new assembly iteration using reference genomes from the previous assembly attempt. The main steps of this process were: (i) performing pairwise sequence comparisons between all MAGs (from all samples) by using MASH [<xref rid="pgen.1009776.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1009776.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]; (ii) using the UPGMA (unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean) algorithm on pairwise distance data to form clades of closely related MAGs (distance threshold in UPGMA for clade definition: 0.12); (iii) select an exemplar MAG in the clade to use as a within-clade reference sequence; (iv) use the exemplar reference sequence to extract highly similar contigs (using BLAST [<xref rid="pgen.1009776.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]) from the original full contig collection of the <italic toggle="yes">de novo</italic> assembly for each of the other samples; (v) use Hi-C contact data to refine the collection of contigs extracted by reference search and exclude contigs with no Hi-C contact to other contigs within the MAG; (vi) use Hi-C contacts to extend MAGs with AMR gene containing contigs; (vii) perform a final extension on the MAGs (with the same method as used in the post-processing). We found that the most crucial step during the refinement was the selection of the clade exemplar in the clade that potentially had the most complete genome with minimal contamination. After several attempts of using physical parameters (<italic toggle="yes">e</italic>.<italic toggle="yes">g</italic>., using the largest, the median size, the most unimodal coverage distribution) we found that mixed MAGs (mixture of more than one closely related genomes) were also selected as exemplars many times. Therefore, instead of using the above mentioned parameters alone or in combination, we used the core single copy gene set of the GTDB-Tk [<xref rid="pgen.1009776.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] by running the toolkit “identify” module and looking for: (i) the MAG with the highest number of unique single copy genes (maximum completeness); and (ii) the MAG with the highest unique single copy genes / multiple single copy genes ratio (minimum contamination).</p>

      <title>Bioinformatics pipeline—analysis of MAG sequence data</title>
      <p>A set of custom scripts were written to perform AMR gene searches, undertake taxonomic identification, identify closely related reference genomes, and generate paired distance trees for the clades. AMR gene searching was performed using a local installation of BLAST [<xref rid="pgen.1009776.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] using the ResFinder database [<xref rid="pgen.1009776.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. AMR genes were defined as being present where &gt;60% of the length of the target gene was present with an identity of &gt;80%. For AMR gene grouped analysis: (i) the aminoglycoside modifying enzymes were grouped by the modifying group which was attached (aminoglycoside nucleotidyl transferases were grouped together, as were phosphotransferases, acetyltransferases and adenyltransferases); (ii) due to increasing interest in the role ESBL plays in disease, beta-lactamases were grouped by homology; (iii) gene families which were represented by different alleles were considered one gene type; (iv) the dihydrofolate reductase genes <italic toggle="yes">dfrA12</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">dfrA14</italic> are considered as <italic toggle="yes">dfrA</italic>; (v) nitrofuratonin reducing genes were grouped together into the <italic toggle="yes">nim</italic> group; (vi) sulfonamide resistance genes <italic toggle="yes">sul1</italic>-<italic toggle="yes">sul3</italic> were grouped as <italic toggle="yes">sul</italic>; (vii) tetracycline resistance genes were grouped by function and sequence homology, with homologous genes combined into groups; and (viii) vancomycin resistance clusters <italic toggle="yes">vanGXY</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">vanG2XY</italic> were considered as one group. Taxonomic identification and the search for closely related reference genomes was performed using GTDB-Tk [<xref rid="pgen.1009776.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Pairwise distances between clade member MAGs and other genomes were determined using MASH [<xref rid="pgen.1009776.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1009776.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], and the distance tree generated by the UPGMA algorithm. The Newick formatted tree files were annotated using iTOL [<xref rid="pgen.1009776.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Summary text files were automatically created for all clade members with taxonomic identifications and AMR gene associations. A summarised output with all MAGs and AMR gene associations was generated together with a filtered version where incomplete MAGs (filtered out by the default settings of GTDB-Tk [<xref rid="pgen.1009776.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]) were excluded.

      <title>Bioinformatics pipeline—quality control</title>
      <p>We created custom scripts to extract quality information from almost every step during the pipeline: (i) ratio of duplicated raw reads (detecting low concentration libraries); (ii) ratio of merged raw read pairs (verifying library sizes); (iii) ratio of merged Hi-C reads without detectable ligation site (pointing to problems with Hi-C library preparation); (iv) number of contigs in the <italic toggle="yes">de novo</italic> assembly; (v) Hi-C reads alignment ratio; (vi) number and ratio of informative Hi-C read pairs (a Hi-C read pair is informative if it connects two different contigs); (vii) average modularity during the Louvain network resolution; (viii) single copy gene ratios during clade refinement; (ix) final CheckM-like MAG parameters analysed by GTDB-tk [<xref rid="pgen.1009776.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] (MAG size, contig number, N50, average coverage, GC-content, taxonomy, completeness).

While we generally got a higher number of final MAGs from the HAM-ART pipeline (average number of final MAGs 29.5 vs 50.1), due to a few potentially lower quality Hi-C libraries, we had higher variation among the HAM-ART final sets (standard deviation of the mean 13.9 vs 41.2).

    <p>Reviewer #1: Title: HAM-ART: An optimised culture-free Hi-C metagenomics pipeline for tracking antimicrobial resistance genes in complex microbial communities.</p>
    <p>Summary:</p>
    <p>This is a particularly well prepared and easy to read manuscript. As a consequence, I have zero minor errors to report. As the authors have discussed, their application of Hi-C to generate MAGs and link AMRs containing sequences is not novel per se. However, their approach to Hi-C MAG refinement that leverages external information sources such as GTDBtk determined single-copy genes, is innovative. At the risk of sounding pompous, I would like to commend them for their determination in pursuing the best possible outcome from their data.</p>
    <p>That said, there is sufficient new ground being tread within the work that much more explicit methodological detail is required for each stage (from determining consensus-cluster, splitting and refining). Further, and although I realise this is a tall-order, this reviewer would recommend that a section comprising in-silico validation (possibly against a simulated ground-truth) be added. Lastly, I did find any mention of a code repository for this pipeline, which I would regard as mandatory even at the stage of initial submission. This would have been of great assistance and access to the code would remove part of the burden of describing the method. Altogether, this leaves me with concerns for reproducibility.</p>
    <p>Comment:</p>
    <p>page 17 line 218: The authors may have found that a read-based approach, which targetted resistance genes, would have had greater sensitivity. This would then modify the following discussion contrasting OG/CV presence/absence. Granted, this would not enable any subsequent gene-context analysis. Note: I see this is briefly addressed at line 370.</p>
    <p>page 23 line 313: Although this statement is not in hot dispute for this reviewer, I would have liked there to be a wider consideration of available exogenous variables -- that is to say a more complex regression model. I see that there are some words to this effect further down (line 327) mentioning limitations.</p>
    <p>page 24 line 341: Although it provides a taxonomic hint as a side-effect of its validation analysis, the authors of checkM would probably be the first to say that it has never been meant for taxonomic assignment. I would consider revising this sentence.</p>
    <p>page 31 line 498: Did the authors consider using or did they trial the use an existing Hi-C metagenomic binning software? Modularity based clustering algorithms (such as Louvain) suffer from a resolution limit which may have impacted the authors</p>
    <p>capacity to extract less abundant genomes.</p>
    <p>page 31 line 507: This is potentially of interest to the tool developers within Hi-C metagenomics community. As such, more detail is required to describe this method. In particular how do the authors reconcile the variation in coverage that will be seen between core and accessory fragments when splitting?</p>
    <p>page 31 line 512: As with my previous comment, this step requires greater detail.</p>
    <p>page 32 line 526: The detailed description found in this section, along with the brief descriptions of previous steps, highlights the novelty of the author's approach to refine MAGs. Altogether from splitting to this step, there are a number of methodological points at which things could have gone awry. As such, algorithm validation against a ground-truth would have been greatly appreciated by this reviewer.</p>
    <p>Reviewer #2: The manuscript by Kalmar et al. entitled “HAM-ART: An optimized culture-free Hi-C metagenomics pipeline for tracking antimicrobial resistance genes in complex microbial communities” describes a laboratory and a computational pipeline using Hi-C data applied to metagenomic samples. Proximity ligation-based methods (3C, Hi-C) applied to environmental samples is a relatively new field with high potential notably to study mobile genetic elements in microbial communities. In the last years several methods and pipelines have been published in this field demonstrating the increasing interest in this technology. The present manuscript takes advantage of the Hi-C data to study AMR genes and their associated MAGs in a longitudinal cohort of pigs. Not surprisingly, the authors found that a higher antibiotics usage is correlated with a higher AMR genes presence. They also develop and propose a new pipeline to analyze Hi-C data ranging from metagenomic samples.</p>
    <p>Even if the field will benefit from new pipelines, the manuscript suffers from various problems that will need to be address before publication.</p>
    <p>Major comments:</p>
    <p>1 - First, the authors say in the abstract that their pipeline is also a laboratory one but I cannot determine the novelty in the preparation of the libraries compare to previous protocols. Moreover, there is no data to illustrate that their Hi-C data are of good quality in terms of 3D signal. Several tools or calculations exist to check the quality of Hi-C data (3D ratio, q3C) and it will be of great importance to know the quality of their data and to compare them to previous published datasets. Moreover, the authors say that they have implemented several quality controls in their computational pipeline (line 581) but they do not provide them for their libraries.</p>
    <p>2- The authors describe succinctly a new computational pipeline but the description and the content will need modifications, descriptions as well as comparison with available ones. First, the authors apply an iterative partitioning procedure using the Louvain algorithm, a procedure and a software already used in previous publications and pipeline. Then they keep group of contigs that cluster together during 100 iterations of the algorithm and they call them Consensus Clusters (CCs); a term very close from the Core Communities (CCs) used in a previous publication and in an available pipeline – MetaTOR (Marbouty et al, 2017, Baudry et al. 2019).</p>
    <p>Line 507: “The separation of mixed CCs is first addressed using a coverage distribution-based separation algorithm for each CC which splits the CC if the distribution of sequencing coverage was clearly multimodal.” The authors must provide the algorithm used at this step.</p>
    <p>Line 512 :” An iterative CC extension step was built into the pipeline at this point to extend clusters based on the Hi-C inter-contig contacts and cautiously identify contigs that should be allocated to multiple CCs.” Same as previously, details are needed here</p>
    <p>If the authors want to publish a new pipeline as they claim it [line 305: “ HAM-ART is the first method that is designed to cope with large sample numbers, using the most common Illumina based sequencing platform and delivering results from affordable amounts of sequencing depth.”], they must provide their code to the community and benchmark their approach with already published pipeline (bin3C, MetaTOR, HicZin …) and other datasets.</p>
    <p>3- The paper will be easier to understand if the authors provide a summary table with libraries constructed, assemblies generated, binning statistics … for each sample. Moreover, it will be of great interest for the community to have access to the different assemblies as they can reproduce some of the outputs.</p>
    <p>4- The analysis on the lnu(A) gene is interesting but lack several controls and need further analysis. Are the contigs detected as plasmids by state of the art tools like PlasFlow or PlasmidFinder ? Can the authors check the topology of the corresponding contigs by using their Hi-C data ? If the contigs are circular, they should be able to detect the 3D signal in the corresponding contact matrices.</p>
    <p>Same remark concerning the E. coli analysis and the possible plasmid.</p>
    <p>Minor Comments:</p>
    <p>- Line 102 : I would replace “assembles” by “bin” as the pipeline do not assemble the genomes but regroup contigs together.</p>
    <p>- In general, there is some problems with the terms “assembled”, “scaffolded” and binned and it is difficult to understand, for instance for the E. coli example, the limits of the method. Is it a problem of assembly (shotgun sequencing) ? a problem of binning (not enough Hi-C reads) ?</p>
    <p>- MLST is not defined.</p>
    <p>- I have problem to understand exactly how the different assemblies were performed. Do the different Hi-C and Shotgun libraries have been mixed to perform them ? or only the shotgun ones ?</p>

      <bold>Please note here if the review is uploaded as an attachment.</bold>
    </p>
    <p>Reviewer #1: This reviewer agrees with authors in regards to the on-going difficulty in properly validating new methods in Hi-C metagenomics and I accept that they have tried to address this by sequencing targetted isolates.</p>
    <p>Besides this frustration with validation, to which I assign ~no~ blame to the authors, I am satisfied with how the authors have addressed my remarks and appreciate their care in doing so.</p>
    <p>Reviewer #2: The revised manuscript by Kalmar appears better than the previous version. Codes and data are now available and would help scientists to reproduce their results. Precisions about their computational pipeline have been also added and their approaches appear promising. The manuscript still need minor modifications / precisions:</p>
    <p>1- The authors have provided important statistics about their HiC libraries but never discussed about them. It could of great importance as their HiC libraries do not seem to encode more 3D signal compared to a classical 3C library. Is there a real gain in performing HiC that is more expensive than 3C ?</p>
    <p>2- I would really appreciate that the authors submit their assemblies to the NCBI or other databases as it will allow others scientist to reproduce their results without this time-consuming assembly step. It is really easy to do and will help the whole community.</p>
