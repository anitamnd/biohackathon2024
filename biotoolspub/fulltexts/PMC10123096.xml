      <title>Abstract</title>
      <p>The nucleotide sequences of 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes have been used to inform the taxonomic placement of prokaryotes for several decades. Whole-genome approaches can better resolve evolutionary relationships of organisms, but these analyses often require computational proficiencies that are uncommon among microbiologists. PHANTASM is a new tool capable of automating these workflows. This tool was designed to work for a wide range of prokaryotes and is the first example of an automated reconciliation of NCBI’s Taxonomy database with that of the List of Prokaryotic names with Standing in Nomenclature (LPSN). In this study, we describe the workflow of PHANTASM and provide several examples of results generated by it. The source code is freely-available on GitHub. In order to facilitate the ease-of-access for researchers, PHANTASM is also available as a Docker image. While other tools exist to facilitate starting points for these analyses, PHANTASM provides users with a greater degree of control and produces outputs that can be used to make publication-quality figures.</p>

      <title>16S ribosomal RNA genes in prokaryotic taxonomy</title>
      <p>The nucleotide sequences of 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes have been used to inform the taxonomic placement of prokaryotes for several decades. Research has demonstrated that whole-genome approaches can better resolve evolutionary relationships of organisms, especially when the genetic distances are quite low (e.g. strains of the same species) (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1–5</xref>). However, the vast number of publicly available 16S rRNA gene sequences make this gene useful for obtaining a rough estimate of the phylogenetic position of a given taxon. Because of this, many studies rely on 16S rRNA gene sequences to determine which reference taxa to include when reconstructing the phylogeny of a group with the goal of justifying the taxonomic placement of an organism. Unfortunately, the unreliability of 16S rRNA as a phylogenetic marker can cause closely-related organisms to be omitted.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="SEC1-2">
      <title>Existing tools for conducting phylogenomic analyses for taxonomic purposes</title>
      <p>Three existing tools that aim to assist researchers with the taxonomic placement of novel isolates are available: the Microbial Genome Atlas (MiGA) (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>), the Type strain Genome Server (TYGS) (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>), and the Genome Taxonomy Database Toolkit (GTDB-Tk) (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). MiGA (<ext-link xlink:href="http://microbial-genomes.org/" ext-link-type="uri">http://microbial-genomes.org/</ext-link>) identifies the closest relative of the query genome by leveraging the average amino acid identities (AAI) and average nucleotide identities (ANI) calculated for the query against a set of representative genomes. Once the closest-related representative genome is identified, it compares the query genome to the cluster of genomes which was represented by the best-matching representative genome (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). This method works well, however, it relies on the NCBI Taxonomy database (see below). Because of this discrepancy, MiGA may inadvertently omit genomes that should be included or include genomes that may not be useful.</p>
      <p>The Type strain Genome Server (TYGS) is another tool developed with the purpose of facilitating taxonomic analyses based on whole-genome sequences and is owned by the DSMZ (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). This web-tool works by using 16S rRNA gene sequences as a proxy for taxonomic placement, and then performs phylogenomic analyses based on this initial placement. This workflow is attractive, but there are major drawbacks to TYGS revolving around the lack of free access. The code base is not open-source nor provided in a way that would allow offline use. This means that all genomes must be run through their online portal either directly or via a remote connection on the command line. Second, TYGS relies on a proprietary database of curated genome sequences, and this database cannot be examined in any meaningful way. Third, TYGS does not calculate common metrics such as average amino acid identity (AAI) and instead uses the DSMZ’s proprietary <italic toggle="yes">in silico</italic> approaches such as digital DNA-DNA hybridization (dDDH), genome-to-genome distance calculator (GGDC), and genome blast distance phylogeny (GBDP).</p>
      <p>The Genome Taxonomy Database Toolkit, or GTDB-Tk, is another tool designed to help classify microbes using genomic data (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). This tool works by leveraging 120 bacterial or 122 archaeal marker genes. Using alignments of these genes, the input genome(s) is assigned to a domain and placed into a precalculated, domain-specific reference tree. GTDB-Tk then refines its classification using relative evolutionary divergence (RED) values (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>) and ANI values to reference genomes. This method works well and its curated reference data helps promote accurate taxonomic assignments. However, the developers of GTDB-Tk v2 discourage people from using the trees produced by their workflow in publications and suggest inferring a tree using marker genes and methods suitable for the user's data (personal communication).</p>
      <p>GTDB-Tk v2 is designed to run on a server with multiple CPUs and ≥55GB of RAM. Obtaining and maintaining such devices is not trivial as servers are expensive, need dedicated infrastructure for their upkeep and maintenance, and require expertise in administrating Linux systems. While GTDB-Tk can calculate ANI values for close relatives of the input genome(s), it does not offer a way of calculating AAI values. In addition, this program requires downloading more than 66 GB of reference data before the software can run. Taken together, this program is suited for identifying related genomes to serve as a starting point of phylogenomic analyses. Ultimately, GTDB-Tk has many merits but it was not designed for microbiologists with little to no computational experience.</p>
      <p>These shortcomings, namely the potential for inaccurate taxonomic information used by MiGA, the non-open-source nature of TYGS, and the computational proficiencies required to use GTDB-Tk need to be addressed in any future tools developed for automating the taxonomic placement of prokaryotes.</p>

      <title>NCBI taxonomy</title>
      <p>NCBI Taxonomy is one of the best, free-to-use, publicly-available, taxonomic databases due to its sophisticated tools for automated queries and the fact that its entries are linked to NCBI’s other databases, such as the Assembly database, which houses thousands of high-quality, whole-genome assemblies. The taxonomy provided by NCBI is roughly accurate, but the NCBI Taxonomy database contains erroneous entries, especially when it comes to the accurate designation of type material (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12–14</xref>). This is due, in part, to the fluid nature of taxonomy as a whole. While NCBI has steps in place to prevent the inaccurate classification of new additions to its Taxonomy database, it does not have automated ways for resolving conflicts that arose from the reclassification of existing species. In particular, NCBI lacks the ability to maintain accurate type material designations in its database, especially when dealing with changes to existing taxa such as one species being reclassified as two or more distinct species (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). These incongruencies of the NCBI Taxonomy database with the current state of the literature mean that NCBI Taxonomy is not an authoritative source of taxonomic information for <italic toggle="yes">Archaea</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">Bacteria</italic>.</p>

      <title>The list of prokaryotic names with standing in nomenclature (LPSN) as an authoritative taxonomic database</title>
      <p>Since its establishment in 1997 by Professor Jean Euzéby, the List of Prokaryotic names with Standing in Nomenclature (LPSN) has served the microbiological community by providing a centralized resource containing the most up-to-date taxonomic information for both <italic toggle="yes">Archaea</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">Bacteria</italic> (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15–18</xref>). This website has been invaluable to microbial taxonomists and its content is accessed millions of times a year by researchers across the globe (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Originally, this database was self-funded, but in recent years it has become part of the DSMZ (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Importantly, this database is regularly updated and its taxonomic data is considered to be the most congruent with the official taxonomy recognized by the International Committee on Systematics of Prokaryotes. Since its acquisition by the DSMZ, a copyright agreement explicitly prohibits automated downloads of any data on its website without prior approval (<ext-link xlink:href="https://lpsn.dsmz.de/text/copyright" ext-link-type="uri">https://lpsn.dsmz.de/text/copyright</ext-link>). Only a single text file that contains data for a subset of the validly published species and genera is provided for download (<ext-link xlink:href="https://lpsn.dsmz.de/downloads" ext-link-type="uri">https://lpsn.dsmz.de/downloads</ext-link>), and there is no such resource for higher taxonomic ranks (i.e. family, order, class, phylum, and domain). While the LPSN is in the process of developing an API, at the time of writing this tool is in its infancy as it takes hours to process large queries and does not provide access to any data that are not already available in the text file available for download.</p>

      <title>The importance of sequence selection for phylogenomic analyses</title>
      <p>The conclusions of any phylogeny-based approach are dependent on the selection of reference sequences used for the analyses. Omitting close-relatives can lead to inaccurate classifications and the proposals of novel taxa that should instead be classified under previously described taxa. Because of this, it is important for phylogenomic analyses to make an effort to include a robust set of reference taxa in their phylogenetic reconstructions.</p>
      <p>Wirth and Whitman resolved this issue by employing a novel technique to identify phylogenetic markers whose evolution was highly correlated with the inferred phylogeny of a group of <italic toggle="yes">Rhodobacteraceae</italic> (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). In that study, 16S rRNA gene sequences were used to initially determine which taxa to include in the analysis. However, this gene was poorly correlated with the phylogeny of this group. To address this problem, the researchers built a phylogenetic tree based on the core genes and then examined how well correlated each of the core genes were with the resulting phylogeny (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). This method identified an alternative phylogenetic marker, RpoC, as being highly correlated with the evolution of this group. Wirth and Whitman used RpoC sequence similarities to identify genomes that were closely-related to the taxa in their analysis but had not been detected by traditional 16S rRNA gene sequence similarities. This allowed for the inclusion of taxa that otherwise would have been omitted due to the poor resolution 16S rRNA gene sequences afforded in this group. Furthermore, this method prevented what would have been the erroneous proposals of several novel genera and instead facilitated the transfer of taxa to pre-existing genera (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). This methodology has proven useful for assessing the taxonomic positions of other taxonomic groups, such as the <italic toggle="yes">Staphylococcaceae</italic> (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>) and the <italic toggle="yes">Sphingomonadaceae</italic> (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>), and can be applied to a wide range of microbial taxa as it allows phylogenetic markers to be evaluated in a clade-specific manner.</p>
      <p>In the present study, a new tool for automating this workflow is described: <underline>PH</underline>ylogenomic <underline>AN</underline>alyses for the <underline>TA</underline>xonomy and <underline>S</underline>ystematics of <underline>M</underline>icrobes (PHANTASM). This tool offers several improvements to the existing tools discussed above. It addresses the taxonomic inconsistencies found in NCBI Taxonomy by reconciling it with the taxonomy provided by the LPSN. It also applies the methodology of Wirth and Whitman to refine the genome selection via clade-specific phylogenetic markers (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). Furthermore, both the data used and code base are freely accessible (<ext-link xlink:href="https://github.com/dr-joe-wirth/phantasm" ext-link-type="uri">https://github.com/dr-joe-wirth/phantasm</ext-link>) which enables transparent analyses that are easily repeated and/or expanded upon. It does not require large downloads and can be run with the default settings on devices with as little as 8GB of RAM. In order to facilitate ease-of-access for microbiologists, this software is also available as a Docker image on DockerHub (<ext-link xlink:href="https://hub.docker.com/r/jwirth/phantasm" ext-link-type="uri">https://hub.docker.com/r/jwirth/phantasm</ext-link>). The Docker image contains all of the dependencies pre-installed, and needs only to be mounted as a container on a user's machine. This means that Docker (<ext-link xlink:href="https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop" ext-link-type="uri">https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop</ext-link>) is the only software that must be installed on a user's machine.</p>

      <title>Obtaining taxonomic data from the LPSN</title>
      <p>Data found on the List of Prokaryotic names with Standing in Nomenclature (LPSN) (<ext-link xlink:href="https://lpsn.dsmz.de/" ext-link-type="uri">https://lpsn.dsmz.de/</ext-link>) (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>) website was critical for building an accurate taxonomy. Because DSMZ’s API was of limited usefulness (only provided access to a subset of the genera and species and was computationally inefficient on large queries), it was necessary to download the data as a csv file directly from the LPSN website (<ext-link xlink:href="https://lpsn.dsmz.de/downloads" ext-link-type="uri">https://lpsn.dsmz.de/downloads</ext-link>).</p>
      <p>The genus and species data were downloaded as a csv on 5 January 2023. Because the LPSN specifically prohibits automated downloads, the webpages for each parental genus, family, order, class, and phylum were manually visited between 5 January 2023 and 8 January 2023 and saved locally as html files. Custom python scripts were then used to scrape the relevant data from these html files in order to build the necessary data structures required for PHANTASM to function. <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table S2</xref> provides a complete list of all the webpages accessed during this time.

      <title>Description of PHANTASM’s workflow</title>
      <p>Because phylogenetic markers often vary in a clade-specific manner, it was important for PHANTASM to identify markers that could ensure a suitable set of genomes was selected for phylogenomic analyses. To this end, PHANTASM employs the following strategy (Figure <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). First, the 16S rRNA gene sequences are extracted from the user's input genome(s) and are used to query the NCBI targeted loci database (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>) in order to identify the taxonomic orders with hits to the input's 16S rRNA gene sequences. Alternatively, the user may provide a list of NCBI Taxonomy IDs indicating which families, genera, and/or species the input genome(s) are most closely related to. This can be particularly useful for genome assemblies whose 16S rRNA gene sequences were not recruited and annotated. Next, the taxonomic data for these orders are downloaded from NCBI Taxonomy and stored in a custom data structure. This taxonomic structure is then reconciled with that of the List of Prokaryotic names with Standing in Nomenclature (LPSN) in an effort to minimize the use of inaccurate and/or redundant names (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16–18</xref>). Once reconciled, the records are linked to NCBI Assembly which contains the relevant data for publicly-available whole-genome sequences.</p>

        <caption>
          <p>Workflow to identify a suitable phylogenomic marker for the input genome. One or more annotated genomes in GenBank format are provided to PHANTASM as input. The 16S rRNA gene sequences from these genomes are used to identify a taxonomic space (eg. a taxonomic order). If 16S rRNA gene sequences are unavailable, the user may specify a list of NCBI Taxonomy IDs of related taxa instead. The taxonomic data is initially built from the NCBI Taxonomy database and is reconciled with the taxonomic structure of the List of Prokaryotic names with Standing in Nomenclature (LPSN). PHANTASM downloads whole genome sequences (WGS) to maximize the taxonomic breadth represented. It uses these genomes to calculate the core genes shared between all genomes. An individual gene tree is constructed for each core gene, the alignments are concatenated, and the concatenated alignment is used to reconstruct a phylogenomic tree. Finally, a correlation coefficient of the cophenetic distances is calculated for each core gene tree as it compares to the species tree. These cophenetic correlation coefficients are then used to rank each of the core genes for their suitability as a phylogenetic marker. This step can be skipped if the user has already identified a phylogenetic marker(s) and/or a set of reference genomes.</p>
        </caption>
        <graphic xlink:href="gkad196fig1" position="float"/>
      </fig>
      <p>Next, an ingroup and outgroup are identified based on both taxonomic data and sequence homology. This strategy allows PHANTASM to maximize the breadth of taxonomic space represented which helps to counteract any biases present in the 16S rRNA gene sequences. Once a set of suitable genomes is identified, PHANTASM automatically downloads them from NCBI’s Assembly database.</p>
      <p>Using these genomes, a core genome is calculated (see below). These core genes are individually aligned using MUSCLE v5.1 (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>), the alignments are concatenated, and the concatenated alignment is used to construct a species tree using FastTree v2.1.11 (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). Each core gene alignment is also used to create individual gene trees using FastTree v2.1.11. A Pearson correlation coefficient for each core gene is calculated by comparing the cophenetic distances of its gene tree to the cophenetic distances of the species tree (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). These cophenetic correlation coefficients are then used to rank the core genes for their suitability as a phylogenetic marker for the genomes of interest, and the results are saved to a text file for the user to examine. This step can be skipped if the user has already identified one or more suitable phylogenetic markers for their input genome(s). Additionally, users can choose to exclude specific taxa from their analysis.</p>
      <p>After ranking the core genes, a user must select one or more core genes to be used as phylogenetic markers. Using this gene(s), PHANTASM refines the taxa included in its phylogeny (Figure <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). The protein sequence(s) for the selected gene(s) in the input genome(s) is used to query the non-redundant protein database on NCBI. If this query is too computationally expensive, then it will instead query the RefSeq Protein database on NCBI. Based on these results, PHANTASM automatically selects genomes in order to maximize the relevant taxonomic space. To do this, the following criteria are used: one genome (preferably the type strain) for each species from the most closely-related genus is added to the set of genomes, and the minimum bitscore of this genus is saved. Any genus containing one or more species whose bitscores are higher than the aforementioned minimum bitscore also have a single genome for each of their children species added to the set of genomes. For all other genera identified in the blast results, only a single species is selected with a preference for the type strain of the type species where possible. Finally, an outgroup is selected from outside the targeted taxonomic space. This step can be skipped if the user has already identified a suitable set of reference genomes.</p>

          <p>Workflow to refine the phylogeny and perform phylogenomic analyses. Using one or more phylogenetic markers identified by the user, PHANTASM performs a BLASTp against the non-redundant protein database (nr) and uses the results to identify a suitable set of genomes in an effort maximize the relevant taxonomic space. These genomes are downloaded, and the core genes are calculated based on BLASTp scores. The core genes are aligned and concatenated, and this concatenated alignment is used to construct a species tree. The overall genome related indices (OGRIs), specifically average amino acid identity (AAI) and average nucleotide identity (ANI) matrices, are calculated and used to build heatmaps of the AAI and ANI values. If a suitable set of reference genomes are already known, users can skip reference genome selection and instead run only the analyses starting at the ‘revised WGS’ step. *: If a BLASTp against the non-redundant protein database (nr) is too computationally expensive, then PHANTASM will query the RefSeq Protein database instead.</p>

      <p>After identifying a suitable set of reference genomes informed by sequence homology of a given phylogenetic marker(s), PHANTASM downloads the selected genomes from NCBI’s Assembly database and constructs a species tree from a concatenated alignment of the core genes as described above. Users are given the option of generating bootstrapped trees. This setting is off by default due to the significant increase in run times. If users elect to produce bootstrapped trees, then PHANTASM employs IQTree with automatic model selection (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). In addition, PHANTASM calculates the average amino acid identity (AAI) and the average nucleotide identity (ANI) (see below) and generates heatmaps based on the values. Together, this provides the user with much of the information necessary to taxonomically assign their microbe(s) of interest. Because all of the resulting data are freely available, the user can choose to perform additional analyses using the genomes identified by PHANTASM.</p>

      <p>Core genes are calculated using xenoGI as previously described (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). Briefly, an all-vs-all BLASTp is performed for all pairwise combinations of genomes. The resulting BLAST tables are then used to identify orthologs with exactly one copy in each genome using the all-around best reciprocal hit method. Core genes are also required to have an evalue of at least 10<sup>−8</sup>, a percent identity of at least 35%, and a query alignment coverage of at least 65%. Users can opt to reduce the number of core genes used to construct the ‘species tree’ by excluding proteins whose alignments contain &gt;5% gaps for one or more taxa (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19–21</xref>,<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>).</p>

Briefly, cophenetic distance matrices are obtained from each of the gene trees as well as from the species tree. The cophenetic distance matrix of each gene tree is compared to that of the species tree and a Pearson correlation coefficient is calculated. These coefficients range from 0 to 1 and are used to rank genes as putative phylogenetic markers. Higher correlation coefficients are indicative of genes whose phylogenetic reconstructions are better correlated with the inferred phylogeny based on the concatenated alignment of all core genes. Such genes may constitute good phylogenetic markers, but ultimately the user must decide which gene(s) should be employed as a phylogenetic marker(s).</p>

    <sec id="SEC3-1">
      <title>Using <italic toggle="yes">Ruegeria pomeroyi</italic> as a test case</title>
      <p>Because the <italic toggle="yes">Alphaproteobacteria</italic> have undergone several major taxonomic revisions in recent years (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32–34</xref>), a genome from this group was a good example for demonstrating PHANTASM’s functionality. To this end, the whole genome sequence for <italic toggle="yes">Ruegeria pomeroyi</italic> DSS-3<sup>T</sup> (GCF_000011965.2) was used as input to PHANTASM. The initial phylogeny that was reconstructed by PHANTASM is shown in Figure <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>. As can be seen, PHANTASM accurately identified the input genome as a member of the order <italic toggle="yes">Rhodobacterales</italic>, and attempted to maximize the taxonomic breadth of the taxonomic space by including a diverse set of genomes within the <italic toggle="yes">Alphaproteobacteria</italic>. PHANTASM identified several suitable phylogenetic markers in these organisms (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table S3</xref>), including <italic toggle="yes">rpoC</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">gyrB</italic>, both of which had cophenetic correlation coefficients of 0.98. Using <italic toggle="yes">rpoC</italic> (SPO_RS17765) and <italic toggle="yes">gyrB</italic> (SPO_RS00795), phylogenetic refinement was performed followed by phylogenomic analyses (Figures <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> and <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). PHANTASM accurately identified <italic toggle="yes">Ruegeria</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Phaeobacter</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Leisingera</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">Tritonibacter</italic> as the most closely-related genera to the input, and fully populated the species for these genera. In addition, PHANTASM included a single genome for several other closely-related genera. The AAI (Figure <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>) and ANI (Figure <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>) heatmaps also show that the input genome is identical to that of <italic toggle="yes">Ruegeria pomeroyi</italic> DSS-3<sup>T</sup>, which was expected. Figures <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> and <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">5</xref> are not the raw outputs from PHANTASM, but were generated by combining the species tree in Newick format with a pdf of the AAI and ANI heatmaps, respectively.

      <title>Comparing phylogenetic marker calling by PHANTASM and the GET_HOMOLOGUES + GET_PHYLOMARKERS pipeline</title>
      <p>The phylogenetic markers automatically identified for the <italic toggle="yes">Ruegeria pomeroyi</italic> test case were in agreement with the GET_HOMOLOGUES v 16092021 and GET_PHYLOMARKERS v 2.4.6_20nov2022 pipeline (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). These tools can be used to identify a core genome and suitable phylogenetic markers, respectively. For this test case, GET_HOMOLOGUES found 121 of the 125 core genes identified by PHANTASM, and PHANTASM found 121 of the 182 core genes identified by GET_HOMOLOGUES. Using the default parameters, GET_PHYLOMARKERS identified 60 phylogenetic markers. 47 of these 60 markers were also identified as core genes by PHANTASM. However, the runtime for GET_PHYLOMARKERS was significantly longer than for PHANTASM. The GET_HOMOLOGUES + GET_PHYLOMARKERS pipeline took over 9 hours to run on a Linux machine with 50 CPUs while PHANTASM took less than half the time to accomplish this task on the same machine.</p>
      <p>GET_PHYLOMARKERS scores individual genes for their suitability as phylogenetic markers using the mean branch support from phylogenetic gene trees (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). In order to compare the markers identified by GET_PHYLOMARKERS to those identified by PHANTASM, these genes were manually scored using the same method employed by PHANTASM. PHANTASM identified 40 of the 43 core genes with cophenetic correlation coefficients greater than or equal to 0.95, while GET_PHYLOMARKERS only found 21 of these genes (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table S3</xref>). Additionally, PHANTASM identified 89 of the 95 core genes with cophenetic correlation coefficients greater than or equal to 0.90 (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table S3</xref>). Of the six genes that were missed by PHANTASM, only <italic toggle="yes">dnaJ</italic> has been previously published as a suitable phylogenetic marker for the <italic toggle="yes">Alphaproteobacteria</italic> (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). GET_PHYLOMARKERS also identified 18 genes whose cophenetic correlation coefficients were below 0.90, including <italic toggle="yes">fumC</italic>, a gene with a very low cophenetic correlation coefficient (0.42). While PHANTASM calculated the cophenetic correlation coefficient for all the core genes it identified, the documentation specifically discourages the use of genes whose values are below 0.90. Taken together, these results suggest that automated phylogenetic marker calling in PHANTASM is functioning properly.</p>

      <title>PHANTASM produces results that are congruent with existing tools</title>
      <p>The results generated by PHANTASM for <italic toggle="yes">Ruegeria pomeroyi</italic> are congruent with those obtained from existing software. The phylogeny generated by TYGS (Figure <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>) is in agreement with that generated by PHANTASM. However, the results generated by PHANTASM have several advantages: 1) the tree has more phylogenomic context by including a wider distribution of genera, 2) the tree does not have redundant strains, 3) the number of tips in the tree can be adjusted by the user, 4) all data are freely available including the accession numbers for the reference genomes and 5) the AAI and ANI matrices are automatically calculated.</p>

      </fig>
      <p>Similarly, the results generated by PHANTASM agree with those generated by MiGA, although some values differ due to the estimated AAI method employed by MiGA (data available online; see below). However, both PHANTASM and MiGA accurately identified the input genome as an existing strain of <italic toggle="yes">Ruegeria pomeroyi</italic> and MiGA indicated that the input had 100% average nucleotide identity (ANI) with <italic toggle="yes">Ruegeria pomeroyi</italic> DSS-3<sup>T</sup> as was expected. MiGA did not offer a way to export figures, but the data can be accessed directly (<ext-link xlink:href="http://microbial-genomes.org/query_datasets/M:SZJ_XNS" ext-link-type="uri">http://microbial-genomes.org/query_datasets/M:SZJ_XNS</ext-link>) by logging in with the username ‘user@example.com’ and using the password ‘password’. MiGA did not produce a phylogenomic tree, and the AAI values were less accurate than those produced by PHANTASM due to the utilization of the ‘heuristic AAI’ method used by MiGA (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>).</p>
      <p>PHANTASM also generated results that were congruent with GTDB-Tk v2 (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). The summary file output by this program accurately assigned the genome to <italic toggle="yes">Ruegeria pomeroyi</italic> and provided the accession number for the reference sequence of the type strain's whole genome. However, interpreting the phylogenetic tree produced by GTDB-Tk v2 was quite difficult as this tree had 10527 tips. In addition, the tree produced by GTDB-Tk v2 had no taxonomic names and instead listed only the accession numbers for the RefSeq (RS) and GenBank (GB) whole genome sequences (Figure <xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). GTDB-Tk v2 indicated that the input genome shared 100% ANI with <italic toggle="yes">Ruegeria pomeroyi</italic> DSS-3 but did not output any additional ANI values. In contrast, PHANTASM produces trees with taxonomic names as well as the accession numbers of the genomes. PHANTASM also calculates AAI and ANI for each pairwise combination of genomes.</p>

PHANTASM also works with <italic toggle="yes">Cyanobacteria</italic> (data not shown). However, reliance on the text files available for download at the LPSN has significantly reduced the ability of PHANTASM to accurately work with cyanobacterial genomes as the cyanobacterial nomenclature is largely omitted from the file. While most of the genomes used to test PHANTASM are complete (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table S1</xref>), this is not a requirement for PHANTASM to work. In fact, one genome tested had 196 contigs. The only requirement for PHANTASM to run successfully is that the coding sequences are annotated.
