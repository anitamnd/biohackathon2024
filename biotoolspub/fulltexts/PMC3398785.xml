    <abstract>
      <p>MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short endogenous non-coding RNA molecules that regulate protein coding gene expression in animals,
plants, fungi, algae and viruses through the RNA interference pathway. By virtue of their base complementarity, mature miRNAs
stop the process of translation, thus acting as one of the important molecules in vivo. Attempts to predict precursor-miRNAs and
mature miRNAs have been achieved in a significant number of model organisms but development of prediction models aiming at
relatively less studied organisms are rare. In this work, we provide a suite of standalone softwares called RAmiRNA
(RAdicalmiRNA detector), to solve the problem of custom development of prediction models for mature miRNAs using support
vector machine (SVM) learning. RAmiRNA could be used to develop SVM based model for prediction of mature miRNAs in an
organism or a group of organisms in a UNIX based local machine. Additionally RAmiRNA generates training accuracy for a quick
estimation of prediction ability of generated model.</p>

    <title>Background</title>
    <p>MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are post-transcriptional regulators that
bind to complementary sequences on target messenger RNA
transcripts (mRNAs), usually resulting in translational
repression and gene silencing. By affecting gene regulation,
miRNAs are likely to be involved in most biological processes,
some as critical as insulin secretion, hematopoietic lineage
differentiation and lipid metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R01">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R03">3</xref>]. Since experimental
cloning methods for searching new miRNAs are less efficient,
time consuming and very expensive, computational approaches
are becoming more and more popular to choose miRNA
candidates for further experimental validation. Thus, most
computational methods utilize pre-miRNA sequences and/or
their secondary structures to detect miRNAs or pre-miRNAs
using support vector machines, random forest models and <italic>ab
initio</italic> prediction models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R04">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R06">6</xref>].</p>
    <p>miRNAs arise from a precursor structure (pre-miRNA), a stemloop
structure having 80 nucleotides in its body, on average.
This pre-miRNA is in turn derived out of a primary miRNA
(pri-miRNA) which is a transcript of a miRNA gene. The
different strategies successfully developed by few researchers
for the prediction of pre-miRNAs are categorized largely as
filter-based, machine learning, homology-based and target
centered approaches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R07">7</xref>].</p>
    <p>Here, we develop RAmiRNA - a toolbox for easy development
of dynamic prediction models using support vector machine
(SVM) learning. RAmiRNA uses an ordered pipeline of PERL
scripts to extract and modify mature miRNA sequences from
the miRBase database [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R08">8</xref>] and subsequently compute features
for classification and prediction. RAmiRNA provides a straight
and easy to use platform for making SVM-based models which
can predict mature miRNAs.</p>
  </sec>
  <sec sec-type="methods" id="s2">
    <title>Methodology</title>
    <p>RAmiRNA suite approaches the problem of mature miRNA
prediction by using a sliding window protocol. Generally, in a
sliding window approach to sequence analysis a virtual
window of a particular length is placed over a linear sequence
(of nucleotides/amino acids) from which meaningful score (or
scores; number of nucleotides, for instance) is then calculated.
In the next step, sliding window is shifted (we use the term
‘jump’ to denote this shift) by a few nucleotides and the score is
calculated again. This procedure is repeated exhaustively.</p>
    <p>RAmiRNA suite utilizes this protocol to implement a sliding
window over secondary structures (stem loops) of pre-miRNAs
to calculate a set of features. This is then fed into an SVM
classifier. RAmiRNA suite builds the SVM based classifier on
the basis of differentiation between the regions containing
mature miRNA, with the region falling away from it.</p>
    <p>RAmiRNA suite consists of four main tools: RAmiRNA-<italic>ρ</italic>
generates positive set data which corresponds to the region of
mature miRNA. RAmiRNA-n is used for negative set
preparation which corresponds to region falling away from
actual mature miRNA. RAmiRNA-<italic>t</italic> takes the two sets
generated by RAmiRNA-<italic>ρ</italic>, and RAmiRNA-<italic>n</italic>, and combines
these two sets into one (for details, see additional information
provided in the supplementary). It then feeds this dataset into
an efficient, publicly available support vector machine tool
called LibSVM-train [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R09">9</xref>], which trains this dataset and generates
the SVM prediction model. Finally, for actual testing of the premiRNAs,
RAmiRNA-g generates test set and feeds it to
LibSVM-predict, ultimately generating predictions in the form
of graphical output showing mature miRNA regions. Work
flow of RAmiRNA suite is illustrated in (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). RAmiRNA-<italic>ρ</italic>
&amp; RAmiRNA-n automatically labels the positive and negative
entries respectively into typical LibSVM format. LibSVM tries to
form a definite boundary between the two sets which ultimately
serves as the basis of prediction for RAmiRNA-g.</p>
  </sec>
  <sec id="s3">
    <title>Encoding features</title>
    <p>RAmiRNA utilizes some of the most basic, yet powerful
features which broadly fall into two categories: sequence based
features and structure based features. It encodes a set of fortysix
useful features which are then selected on the basis of their
statistically significant contribution towards training accuracy
of the prediction model. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>) illustrates the significance of
features used in RAmiRNA (see supplementary information for
complete list of features).</p>
  </sec>
  <sec id="s4">
    <title>Input &amp; Output</title>
    <p>In order to construct a classification model, RAmiRNA requires
several inputs to be supplied. a) The complete miRBase
database in the form of a downloadable text file (miRNA.str, see
supplementary information for details); b) miRBase ID. For
example, if a user wants to build a prediction model for viruses,
then the ids to be supplied are ebv, hiv, bkv, rlcv etc.
RAmiRNA-<italic>ρ</italic> and RAmiRNA-<italic>n</italic> utilize these inputs in a slightly
different manner from each other. RAmiRNA-p extracts out the
mature miRNA region from the pre-miRNA structures and
encodes these structural entities into numerical values labeling
them as +1. On the other hand, RAmiRNA-n traverses the stem
of pre-miRNA structures by sliding a window of user defined
length, avoiding the area containing mature miRNA, to encode
numerical values which are labeled as -1. Consequently,
RAmiRNA-<italic>n</italic> requires two more inputs: c) a window length, ‘<italic>w</italic>’;
d) the jumps ‘<italic>j</italic>’ that the window is expected to take upon the
stem of pre-miRNA structures. Inputs to RAmiRNA-<italic>t</italic> are the
outputs of RAmiRNA-<italic>ρ</italic> (Positive dataset) and RAmiRNA-<italic>n</italic>
(Negative dataset). RAmiRNA-<italic>t</italic> generates a classification model
as a result of training of the dataset. RAmiRNA-<italic>t</italic> also provides
users with a training accuracy. This accuracy reflects the
prediction reliability of the generated model. RAmiRNA-<italic>g</italic>
needs this model as an input along with the window length and
jump size same as those supplied to RAmiRNA-<italic>n</italic>. The tools
that are included in RAmiRNA toolkit are an ordered set (or a
pipeline) of Perl programming codes.</p>
  </sec>
  <sec id="s5">
    <title>Caveat and future development</title>
    <p>Since RAmiRNA is dependent on number of miRNAs in
miRBase database, some of the prediction models it generates
are less accurate (for instance models for organisms having very
few known miRNAs). Such models would become more
reliable with the growth of miRBase in future. Some other
classification features (such as enzyme recognition sites) would
also be considered in future updates of RAmiRNA.</p>
