    <abstract>
      <p>Fluorescence flow cytometry is increasingly being used to quantify single-cell expression distributions in bacteria in high-throughput. However, there has been no systematic investigation into the best practices for quantitative analysis of such data, what systematic biases exist, and what accuracy and sensitivity can be obtained. We investigate these issues by measuring the same <italic>E. coli</italic> strains carrying fluorescent reporters using both flow cytometry and microscopic setups and systematically comparing the resulting single-cell expression distributions. Using these results, we develop methods for rigorous quantitative inference of single-cell expression distributions from fluorescence flow cytometry data. First, we present a Bayesian mixture model to separate debris from viable cells using all scattering signals. Second, we show that cytometry measurements of fluorescence are substantially affected by autofluorescence and shot noise, which can be mistaken for intrinsic noise in gene expression, and present methods to correct for these using calibration measurements. Finally, we show that because forward- and side-scatter signals scale non-linearly with cell size, and are also affected by a substantial shot noise component that cannot be easily calibrated unless independent measurements of cell size are available, it is not possible to accurately estimate the variability in the sizes of individual cells using flow cytometry measurements alone. To aid other researchers with quantitative analysis of flow cytometry expression data in bacteria, we distribute <italic>E-Flow</italic>, an open-source R package that implements our methods for filtering debris and for estimating true biological expression means and variances from the fluorescence signal. The package is available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/vanNimwegenLab/E-Flow">https://github.com/vanNimwegenLab/E-Flow</ext-link>.</p>

    <title>Introduction</title>
    <p>It is has become well recognized that, due to the intrinsic stochasticity of the gene expression process, even isogenic populations of microbial cells growing in homogeneous environments exhibit significant heterogeneity in their gene expression, e.g. [<xref rid="pone.0240233.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0240233.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Therefore, the traditional studies at the population level, by smoothing out this heterogeneity, tend to hide crucial information [<xref rid="pone.0240233.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0240233.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] that is required to correctly understand and interpret the observed behavior of microbes [<xref rid="pone.0240233.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p>
    <p>Although most studies of single-cell gene expression in bacteria use fluorescent reporters in combination with microscopy to quantify gene expression in single cells, fluorescence flow cytometry (FCM) is also an attractive alternative methodology for single-cell gene expression studies in bacteria. In particular, given that flow cytometers can quantify the fluorescence of thousands of cells per second, flow cytometry allows for high-throughput characterization of the single-cell expression distributions of a large number of fluorescent reporters [<xref rid="pone.0240233.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0240233.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Indeed, in recent years there has been a large number of studies in which standard commercially available flow cytometers were used in combination with fluorescent reporters to measure gene expression at the single-cell level in bacteria [<xref rid="pone.0240233.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0240233.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], as well as in single-celled eukaryotes [<xref rid="pone.0240233.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0240233.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>].</p>
    <p>However, so far there has been little systematic investigation into the accuracy of flow cytometry in quantifying gene expression in single cells, or a systematic comparison with the results from microscopy measurements. Here we aim at filling this gap by systematically comparing flow cytometry measurements with measurements from a microscopy setup. In particular, there are several technical challenges in analyzing fluorescence flow cytometry data of individual bacterial cells:
<list list-type="order"><list-item><p><italic>Differentiating cells from debris</italic>. Bacterial cells are typically one thousandth the volume of mammalian cells, which places them near the edge of instrument detection. At this size it can be challenging to differentiate viable cells from debris of similar size [<xref rid="pone.0240233.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0240233.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0240233.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>].

Because most genes are expressed at low levels in bacteria (roughly one per cell cycle or less for half of the genome [<xref rid="pone.0240233.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]), the relative fluorescence produced by fluorescent proteins compared to autofluorescent compounds is very low for many reporters [<xref rid="pone.0240233.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>].

Although forward- and side-scatter signals can be used to distinguish the average size of populations of cells of sufficiently different shapes and sizes [<xref rid="pone.0240233.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0240233.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], it is substantially more challenging to accurately quantify the relatively small cell-to-cell variations in cell volume for populations of isogenic bacteria growing in a homogeneous environment. In line with previous works [<xref rid="pone.0240233.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0240233.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0240233.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] we find that, because forward- and side-scattering measurements depend on cell volume in a complex non-linear manner and contain a substantial amount of shot noise that cannot be easily calibrated, it is impossible to accurately quantify the sizes of individual cells. Consequently, it is not possible to directly estimate the distribution of GFP concentrations from flow cytometry measurements. However, we show that because GFP concentrations and cell sizes fluctuate approximately independently, it is still possible to obtain reasonably accurate quantifications of the <italic>relative</italic> amounts of GFP concentration fluctuations for different genes.</p></list-item></list></p>
    <p>Although the precise flow cytometer used will of course affect the precise values of the measurements and calibrations, the methods for separating true cells from debris, estimating and correcting for autofluorescence, and correcting for measurement shot noise, are general and should be applicable to data from most flow cytometers.

      <title>Strains and growth conditions</title>
      <p>We measured the fluorescence distributions for a number of different <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> MG1655 strains carrying fluorescent transcriptional reporters (a GFP gene downstream of a given promoter, either on a low-copy number plasmid, or integrated into the chromosome) both using flow cytometry of batch cultures and time lapse microscopy in a microfluidic device (Mother Machine). We considered a number of different promoters, that have different means and variances of expression levels.</p>
      <p>In particular, we considered <italic>E. coli</italic> strains with a lacZ-GFP fusion integrated in the chromosome [<xref rid="pone.0240233.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>], and a set of <italic>E. coli</italic> strains that carry a transcriptional reporter expressed from a low copy number plasmid [<xref rid="pone.0240233.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. These reporters included known target promoters of the LexA transcription factor (dinB, ftsK, lexA, polB, recA, ruvA, or uvrD) [<xref rid="pone.0240233.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] and two synthetic promoters that were obtained by experimental evolution and express at levels corresponding to the median and the 97<sup>th</sup> percentile of all native <italic>E. coli</italic> promoters [<xref rid="pone.0240233.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Throughout the paper, we refer to these two synthetic promoters as high and medium expressers.</p>
      <p>To estimate autofluorescence in both the FCM and microfluidic experiments, we used two strains that carry plasmids where the GFP sequence is downstream of a random sequence (pUA66 and pUA139) [<xref rid="pone.0240233.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>] and hence do not express GFP [<xref rid="pone.0240233.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p>
      <p>In the microfluidic experiments, cells carrying a lacZ-GFP fusion were tracked using time-lapse microscopy while growing in a microfluidic device in M9 minimal media supplemented with 0.2% lactose (which leads to full induction of the lac operon), taking measurements every 3 minutes [<xref rid="pone.0240233.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Detailed experimental procedures are available in the corresponding publication [<xref rid="pone.0240233.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Microfluidic experiments with strains carrying a transcriptional reporter expressed from a plasmid were performed following the same procedure, using M9 + 0.4% glucose (supplemented with 50<italic>μg</italic> / mL of kanamycin during the overnight preculture only) and acquiring data over 4 hours.</p>
      <p>To obtain comparable measurements with flow cytometry (FCM), the same strains were grown in the same conditions as for the microfluidic measurements. Practically, strains expressing from a plasmid were inoculated from frozen glycerol stocks and grown overnight in 200<italic>μL</italic> of M9 + 0.4% glucose supplemented with 50<italic>μg</italic>/mL of kanamycin. After 100× dilution in fresh medium without kanamycin, strains were grown to saturation again, and re-diluted 100× to fresh medium without kanamycin. For the lacZ-GFP strain, we used 200<italic>μL</italic> of M9 + 0.2% lactose with only one overnight culture. For all strains, expression was measured in mid-exponential phase (typically after 4h), adjusting the cell concentration with PBS if necessary. All cultures used for FCM measurements were incubated in 96-well plates at 37°C with shaking at 600-650 rpm.</p>
      <p>To study the accuracy of the scatter signal for estimating cell size, we used the data acquired for a previous project in the lab [<xref rid="pone.0240233.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] where both flow cytometry measurements and microscopy measurements of cell size distributions have been obtained in four different media characterized by different size distributions: M9 supplemented with either 0.2% glucose (w/v), 0.2% glycerol (v/v) or 0.2% lactose (w/v); a MOPS based synthetic rich media (Teknova, M2105) supplemented with 0.2% glucose.

      <title>Signals reported by the cytometer</title>
      <p>In flow cytometry, a beam of light is used to illuminate cells that flow one by one through a channel; a series of detectors is able to record the light scattered by the single cells at right angles or in the forward direction and the cell fluorescence stimulated by the incident light beam. Most flow cytometers, including the BD Canto II used here, report for each measured ‘event’ (typically corresponding to a single measured cell) a forward-scatter signal, a side-scatter signal, and a fluorescence signal. Each of these signals is in turn represented by 3 statistics of the electrical impulse, namely height, area, and width of the impulse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0240233.g001">Fig 1</xref>). The height corresponds to the maximal value of the impulse, the area to the area under the curve and the width is its time duration [<xref rid="pone.0240233.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>] (see Section 1.1 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0240233.s001">S1 File</xref>).</p>

          <title>The signals reported by the cytometer.</title>
          <p>As a particle enters the laser beam, an electric signal (pulse) is generated which reaches its maximum when the particle is in the middle of the beam and trails off as the particle leaves the beam. Each pulse with height over a certain threshold is recorded and three quantities are reported: height, area, and width of the pulse.</p>
        </caption>
        <graphic xlink:href="pone.0240233.g001"/>
      </fig>
      <p>We noticed that these statistics are not all independent. In particular, for all three signals, the area is always directly proportional to the product of height and width (S1 Fig and Section 1.2 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0240233.s001">S1 File</xref>). Moreover, while height and width vary approximately independently across events, the area correlates significantly with both (S2 Fig in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0240233.s001">S1 File</xref>). Therefore, we only use height and width for the subsequent analysis of the forward- and side-scatter signals.</p>
      <p>For the fluorescence signal we were unable to find any systematic dependence between the width of the fluorescence signal and any biological signal, such as cell size or total fluorescence. In addition, for the calibration beads there is clearly no information in the width of the fluorescence signal (S3 Fig and Section 1.3 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0240233.s001">S1 File</xref>). Therefore, for the fluorescence signal we will only use the height statistic as a proxy for the total fluorescence of the cells. While we believe that all these considerations apply generally to flow cytometers, we also observed anomalous behavior of the signal at very low fluorescence levels that may be specific to the BD machine used here (see Section 1.4 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0240233.s001">S1 File</xref>). Due to this anomalous behavior, quantitative analysis is restricted to constructs for which the GFP fluorescence is at least as high as the autofluorescence of the cells (see S4 Fig in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0240233.s001">S1 File</xref>).</p>

      <title>Filtering events based on their forward- and side-scatter</title>
      <p>In comparison to eukaryotic cells, bacterial cell produce only relatively weak scattering signals, and we used permissive settings of the device to call events. This increases the likelihood of having spurious observations that correspond to non-viable cells and other debris. Consequently, we needed a strategy for using the measured forward- and side-scatter of the events to separate viable cell measurements from debris. As explained above, the scatter of each event is characterized by 4 statistics, namely the height and width of both the forward- and side-scatter. Thus, the measured scatter of each event can be represented by a point in a 4-dimensional space, and a given dataset corresponds to a distribution of points in this 4-dimensional space. To separate viable cells from debris we fit this distribution with a mixture of a multivariate Gaussian distribution and a uniform distribution, as detailed in the Section 2 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0240233.s001">S1 File</xref>. The rationale behind this mixture modeling is that most of the data represents good cells and should cluster in this 4-dimensional space, whereas the outliers are relatively rare and more widely distributed. In this model, the Gaussian part of the mixture captures the cluster of good cells, while the uniform component takes care of outliers, i.e. fragments of dead cells and other debris.</p>

Besides the scatter of measurements, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0240233.g002">Fig 2</xref> also shows the multivariate Gaussian fitted to the data, showing that this Gaussian indeed captures the bulk of the measured events.</p>

        <graphic xlink:href="pone.0240233.g002"/>
      </fig>
      <p>Once the mixture model has been fitted to a dataset, a posterior probability <italic>p</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> is calculated for each measured event <italic>i</italic> to correspond to a viable cell, i.e. the probability that the observation derives from the multivariate Gaussian component of the mixture as opposed to deriving from the uniform distribution. By default the <italic>E-flow</italic> software retains all events with posterior probability <italic>p</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> ≥ 0.5 and discards as outliers events with <italic>p</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> &lt; 0.5, but the user can change this threshold probability if desired. S5 Fig in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0240233.s001">S1 File</xref> shows the same scatter of measured events as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0240233.g002">Fig 2</xref>, but now with selected events in red and events that were filtered out in black when using the default threshold of <italic>p</italic> = 0.5.</p>
      <p>As the forward- and side-scatter should reflect the size, shape and composition of the objects measured in each event, one may wonder to what extent filtering out events based on their forward- and side-scatter may bias measurements towards cells of a certain size. Indeed, in previous work, e.g. [<xref rid="pone.0240233.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], researchers have attempted to select subsets of cells with similar shapes and size by very strictly gating on forward- and side-scatter, retaining only those cells that lie near the center of the Gaussian distribution. To check the viability of such an approach, we compared the distribution of measured fluorescence levels with two extreme filtering strategies: one very lenient in which all events with <italic>p</italic> &gt; <italic>e</italic><sup>−10</sup> are retained and one very strict in which only cells with <italic>p</italic> &gt; 1 − <italic>e</italic><sup>−10</sup> are retained. As shown in S6 Fig in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0240233.s001">S1 File</xref>, there is virtually no difference in the observed distribution of fluorescence levels between the very lenient and very strict filtering. Given that we expect total fluorescence to scale with cell size, this observation suggests that strict filtering on forward- and side-scatter is not effective for selecting out a subset of cells with similar size.</p>

      <title>Flow cytometer measurements are affected by substantial measurement noise</title>
      <p>When using the flow cytometer to estimate single-cell gene expression, we aim to quantify the variation in gene expression across a population of isogenic cells growing in a homogeneous environment. In such conditions, bacteria at different stages of their cell cycle vary by roughly two-fold in size, and their total fluorescence is typically proportional to cell size.</p>
      <p>In a previous work we have established that time-lapse microscopy measurements of cells growing in microfluidic devices can measure cell size with an accuracy of around 3% error and GFP copy-number <italic>G</italic> with an error of about <inline-formula id="pone.0240233.e001"><alternatives><graphic xlink:href="pone.0240233.e001.jpg" id="pone.0240233.e001g" mimetype="image" position="anchor" orientation="portrait"/><mml:math id="M1"><mml:msqrt><mml:mi>G</mml:mi></mml:msqrt></mml:math></alternatives></inline-formula> [<xref rid="pone.0240233.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Using such microscopy measurements on <italic>E. coli</italic> cells carrying a lacZ-GFP fusion gene in its native locus while growing in M9 minimal media with lactose, we find a high correlation between lacZ-GFP levels and cell size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0240233.g003">Fig 3</xref>, top panels). That is, because lacZ-GFP concentrations fluctuate only moderately from cell to cell, and both size and GFP level measurements have high accuracy, the measured cell length explains around 70% of the variance in total fluorescence.</p>

      <p>We calculated the analogous correlation between size and total fluorescence in the flow cytometer for the same strain growing in the same environment, using the scatter signals as representing the cell size.

      <p>The lack of correlation between size and fluorescence measurements in the cytometer strongly suggests that either the fluorescence measurements, the size measurements, or both are much more heavily affected by measurement noise than in the microfluidic experiments.

      <title>Estimating the mean and variance of the fluorescence distribution</title>
      <p>As has been observed by others [<xref rid="pone.0240233.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], we observed that for virtually all <italic>E. coli</italic> promoters, the distribution of fluorescence levels is fitted very well by a log-normal distribution [<xref rid="pone.0240233.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], i.e. the log-fluorescence follows a Gaussian distribution. Our <italic>E-Flow</italic> package fits a Gaussian distribution to the measured log-fluorescence levels of single cells, estimating a mean <italic>μ</italic> and variance <italic>v</italic> for a given population of cells. However, we noticed that, even after filtering events on forward- and side-scatter as explained above, there are still clear outlying events, i.e. with fluorescence levels that lie far outside the range observed for almost all other events. To separate these outliers from valid measurements we modeled the distribution of log-fluorescence levels as a mixture of a Gaussian and a uniform distribution, fitting its parameters using expectation maximization (see Section 3 of <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0240233.s001">S1 File</xref> for details).

In addition, transforming from log-fluorescence back to fluorescence in linear scale, the package also calculates mean and variance of the distribution of fluorescence levels, together with error bars (Section 3 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0240233.s001">S1 File</xref>).</p>

      <title>Autofluorescence estimation</title>
      <p>It is well known that the laser used to excite the GFP can also excite other cellular components of the cell, resulting in an “autofluorescence” signal that also occurs in cells without GFP molecules. In addition, the fluorescence signal may also contain a background fluorescence component coming from sources other than the cell’s autofluorescence.

      <p>Thus, in order to correct for autofluorescence, it suffices to estimate both its mean 〈<italic>A</italic>〉 and variance var(<italic>A</italic>).

      <p>Although commercial flow cytometers have been designed to ensure a linear relationship between GFP content and fluorescence measurements over a wide range and previous gene expression studies studies using FCM have operated under this assumption, we here tested this assumption by comparing estimated mean fluorescence levels of different promoters between FCM and microscopy measurements.

      <p>Since the growth conditions in the FCM and the microfluidic setup were kept as close as possible, the true <italic>CV</italic><sup>2</sup> of the distribution of total GFP levels should be highly similar, so that the difference between the measured <italic>CV</italic><sup>2</sup> must derive from measurement noise. Indeed, one source of noise whose contribution to <italic>CV</italic><sup>2</sup> is expected to scale inversely with mean intensity is shot noise from the photomultiplier tube, whose <italic>CV</italic><sup>2</sup> scales as 1/mean [<xref rid="pone.0240233.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>].

and we can infer both the strength <italic>δ</italic> and the offset <italic>O</italic> by fitting <italic>Y</italic> as a simple linear function of <italic>X</italic>. This simple approach leads to an inferred value of <italic>δ</italic> = 13.4 and <italic>O</italic> = 128. In the Section 5 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0240233.s001">S1 File</xref> we also present a more sophisticated Bayesian mixture model approach to inferring these quantities, which does not ignore the true variability of the beads, but assumes that the <italic>CV</italic><sup>2</sup> of the true intensities <italic>I</italic><sub><italic>T</italic></sub> is the same for all three types of beads. Using this more rigorous procedure, the resulting strength and offset are: <italic>δ</italic> = 12.7 ± 0.6, <italic>O</italic> = 97 ± 29 (S7 Fig in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0240233.s001">S1 File</xref>), which are close to the values we would have obtained with the more simple linear model of <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pone.0240233.e008">Eq (4)</xref>. Using this result we can now fit the observed <italic>CV</italic><sup>2</sup> that we expect to see; the fit describes well the observed data, as shown in the bottom panel of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0240233.g006">Fig 6</xref> (and in the top left panel of S7 Fig in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0240233.s001">S1 File</xref>).</p>
      <p>Finally, Section 6 of the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0240233.s001">S1 File</xref> investigates two more subtle technical points that one might think could affect the direct comparison of FCM measurements and microscopy measurement from growth in the microfluidic device. First, one could argue that the age-distributions of the population of cells in the microfluidic device and in a population that is growing exponentially (i.e. as used in the FCM) are different. That is, since in the microfluidic device some newborn daughters are constantly washed out of the growth channels, there are relatively fewer cells close to birth and more cells close to division in the microfluidic device than in a population undergoing exponential growth in bulk (S8 Fig in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0240233.s001">S1 File</xref>). Since total fluorescence correlates with cell size, which again correlates well with time since birth, the access of ‘old’ cells could in principle effect the distribution of total fluorescence one observes. However, as shown in Section 6.1 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0240233.s001">S1 File</xref>, we derive theoretically that the effects of the altered age-distribution are small enough to be neglected (S9 Fig in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0240233.s001">S1 File</xref>). Second, since in the microfluidic setup we measure the fluorescence of a cell multiple times during its cell cycle, there are clearly substantial correlations between different measurements and one might wonder whether this could significantly affect the observed statistics. In Section 6.2 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0240233.s001">S1 File</xref> we show that this effect is also negligible (S9 Fig in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0240233.s001">S1 File</xref>).</p>

      <title>Estimating mean and variance of GFP concentration</title>
      <p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0240233.g003">Fig 3</xref>, microscopy measurements show a strong correlation between the size of the cells and total GFP of the cells, indicating that cell size variations are responsible for a large fraction of the variation in total GFP, and that GFP <italic>concentration</italic> fluctuates significantly less than total GFP. It would thus be desirable to be able to estimate the mean and variance of GFP concentrations from the FCM measurements as well. However, the fact there is a much weaker correlation between raw fluorescence and scatter measurements in FCM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0240233.g003">Fig 3</xref>) suggests that it may be difficult to accurately estimate GFP concentrations for single cells. In particular, to estimate the GFP concentration of a single cell, we need to not only take the autofluorescence and shot noise of the fluorescence measurement into account, we also need to quantify how the cell’s volume relates to the forward- and side-scatter measurement, which is known to be very challenging.</p>
      <sec id="sec018">
        <title>Scattering signals are non-linear functions of cell size</title>
        <p>The extent to which forward- and side-scatter measurements of FCMs can be used to estimate the size of the measured object is a topic of considerable debate in the flow cytometry literature. It is generally assumed that forward scatter mostly reflects cell size, and that side scatter reflects surface properties such as granularity [<xref rid="pone.0240233.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Several previous studies have established that FCM can be successfully used to distinguish bacteria of different shapes and sizes [<xref rid="pone.0240233.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0240233.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], i.e. the average scattering of a population of cells reflects the average size of the cells in the population.</p>
        <p>To confirm that, also within our setup, the average size of a population of cells can be inferred from averages of scatter measurements, we made use of flow cytometry measurements from a recent study from our lab in which <italic>E. coli</italic> cells were grown in a number of different conditions and cell sizes were measured using microscopy in each condition [<xref rid="pone.0240233.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Notably, the growth-rate of the cells varied considerably across these conditions and <italic>E. coli</italic> cells are known to increase size with growth-rate. For each condition, we calculated both the average cell size from the microscopy measurements as well as the average height and width of both forward- and side-scatter.</p>
        <p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0240233.g009">Fig 9</xref>, we found a very good correlation between forward-scatter and cell size in each condition, confirming results from previous studies that average scatter can indeed be used to estimate average cell size. However, it should be noted that the observed relationship between cell size and scatter is highly non-linear. That is, whereas the height of the forward-scatter grows approximately quadratically with cell area, the width of the forward-scatter grows approximately as area to the power 1/3. Previous studies indicate that the mathematical relationship between cell size and scattering signal can be highly dependent on the specific experimental setup and is often at odds with predictions of mathematical theories of light scattering [<xref rid="pone.0240233.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0240233.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0240233.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. In [<xref rid="pone.0240233.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>] it is further shown that even if a particular non-linear relation between scattering and single-cell size can be established in a given setting, this relationship is not universal and it can vary even for bacteria of similar sizes and geometric properties. Thus, although we could here make use of the microscopy cell size measurements to calibrate the non-linear relationship between forward-scatter and cell size, it is highly doubtful that this relationship would apply in other settings.</p>

        <title>Scattering signals contain a substantial shot noise component</title>
        <p>Moreover, in order to be able to estimate GFP concentrations in individual cells, we have to go beyond relating population averages of scatter and size, and estimate sizes of individual cells from the scattering measurements. Several previous studies have reported that it is difficult to use individual scattering measurements to measure variations of the sizes of single cells in a homogeneous population [<xref rid="pone.0240233.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0240233.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0240233.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. To investigate this within our setup we focused on height of the forward scattering, since based on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0240233.g009">Fig 9</xref> this signal most strongly correlates with cell size, calculated the <italic>CV</italic><sup>2</sup> of the scattering as a function of the average scatter, and compared this with the <italic>CV</italic><sup>2</sup> in cell area as a function of average cell area, as measured by microscope (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0240233.g010">Fig 10</xref>).</p>

        <p>We see that, whereas the microscopy measurements indicate that the <italic>CV</italic><sup>2</sup> in cell size is roughly equal in all conditions, the FCM measurements show a clear decrease of <italic>CV</italic><sup>2</sup> with mean, similarly to what was observed for the fluorescence signal. As the scatter signal is generated by converting a light signal into an electrical impulse, it is to be expected that scattering measurements are also affected by shot noise, and the results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0240233.g010">Fig 10</xref> confirm that this is the case. Thus, in order to estimate the variation in cell sizes from the forward-scatter signals, we not only have to take into account the non-linear relationship between scattering and size, but also the shot noise on the scattering measurements. However, in contrast to the situation with the fluorescence measurements, where we used the calibration beads to estimate the shot noise, we cannot use these beads for estimating the shot noise on the scattering measurements since these are strongly influenced by the geometry and material of the particles. Therefore, the relationship between size and scatter will likely be very different for the beads than for living cells.</p>
        <p>In summary, both the complex non-linear relationship between scattering measurements and size, and the absence of a general procedure for estimating the size of the shot noise in the scattering measurements, make it very difficult to estimate the true variability of cell sizes using FCM measurements only. Consequently, we currently do not see a simple way for using FCM measurements to directly measure the GFP concentrations in individual cells.</p>

        <title>FCM measurements can be used to quantify the relative sizes of variation in GFP concentrations of different genes</title>
        <p>Although we do not believe that, absent of calibration with an independent measurement technology such as microscopy, it is possible to reliably estimate the true sizes of single cells using forward- and side-scattering measurements, FCM measurements can still be used to learn a great deal about the relative noise levels of different genes. Indeed, as confirmed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0240233.g007">Fig 7</xref>, provided that autofluorescence and shot noise are taken into account, the <italic>CV</italic><sup>2</sup> of total fluorescence levels of different promoters can be estimated reasonably accurately from FCM fluorescence measurements. Given that each of these fluorescent promoter reporter constructs are embedded in identical cells growing in the same environment, these cells will all exhibit the <italic>same</italic> variation in cell sizes, so that the differences in <italic>CV</italic><sup>2</sup> in total fluorescence must reflect differences in the <italic>CV</italic><sup>2</sup> of the GFP concentrations for these reporter constructs.</p>
        <p>Without loss of generality, the total GFP intensity <italic>I</italic> of a cell can be written as the product <italic>I</italic> = <italic>C</italic> ⋅ <italic>V</italic> of GFP concentration <italic>C</italic> and cell volume <italic>V</italic>, and we can additionally write <italic>C</italic> as the average concentration 〈<italic>C</italic>〉 plus a deviation <italic>δ</italic><sub><italic>C</italic></sub>, and similarly for volume:

There seems to be little agreement in the literature as to when to use forward-scatter or side-scatter and whether to use height, width or area. We showed that only width and height provide independent measurements and developed a Bayesian mixture model for separating viable cell measurements from debris and other outliers using the full 4-dimensional distribution of forward- and side-scatter measurements. In general the filter we developed is much broader than the very strict gating strategies that are sometimes used and typically only a small fraction of the events are discarded.</p>
    <p>We next developed a Bayesian mixture model to estimate the mean and variance in single-cell fluorescences of a population of cells carrying a fluorescent reporter. However, by comparing of the means and variances estimated by FCM with the means and variances estimated from microscopy measurements of the same strains growing in the same conditions, we observed systematic differences because of two effects. First, the amount of autofluorescence per cell differs systematically between FCM and microscopy and we developed methods for estimating and removing the autofluorescence from the FCM measurements. We show that, after correcting for autofluorescence, there is a perfect agreement between the means of different reporters as estimated by FCM and microscopy, over the entire range of expression levels. However, FCM measurements systematically overestimate the variation in fluorescence levels due to shot noise in the FCM measurement. We developed a method to correct for the contribution of shot noise to the estimated variation that uses calibration beads to estimate the size of the FCM shot noise. We showed that, only after correcting for shot noise do gene expression noise measurements from the FCM converge to those obtained from microscopy measurements. Although the precise size of the shot noise and autofluorescence will likely vary between different flow cytometers, the methods we presented here are general, can be applied to data from any flow cytometer, and provide a step-by-step procedure for both estimating the size of autofluorescence and shot noise, and correcting for these components.</p>
    <p>Finally, we investigated whether FCM can be used to directly measure the distribution of GFP concentration across cells by using forward- and side-scatter measurements to estimate the volumes of individual cells. In line with previous work, we show that because scattering measurements depend on cell size in a complex non-linear manner and contain a shot noise component that is difficult to calibrate, it is not possible to accurately estimate the fluctuations in volumes of single cells from scattering measurements. However, because GFP concentration and cell size fluctuate independently across cells, we showed that the relative sizes of GFP fluctuations for different reporter constructs can still be estimated from the variation of total GFP with reasonable accuracy.</p>

(Please upload your review as an attachment if it exceeds 20,000 characters)</p>
    <p>Reviewer #1: Galbusera et al, presented a study on the analysis and use of fluorescence flow cytometry data, to study single-cell of bacteria that express a reporter gene at different concentrations. The work is complete and data are sufficient for pubblication. The authors also provide a tool for the measuremnts of atutofluorescence and shot noise of the instrument. However, these results highlight the fact that this technique is not very efficient in the single cell study but rather for the evaluation of the fluorescence signals of an entire bacterial population. The title may mislead the reader who expects to find a single cell analysis approach. I suggest to clarify this point in the title or in the main text.</p>
    <p>Reviewer #2: Despite the fact that flow cytometry has been used to quantify gene expression variability in bacteria for almost 20 years now, very little work has been done to systematically analyze the measurement errors in cell size and fluorescence that flow cytometers introduce. It is nice to see that the work presented in this manuscript aims to cover this important gap in our knowledge.</p>
    <p>Measuring size and fluorescence of bacteria is no mean feat, as bacterial cells are typically at the limit of detection for flow cytometers. The authors present a plethora of tests and comparisons between flow cytometry and microscopy-based measurements to discover 1) how to interpret flow cytometry signals related to cell size and fluorescence and 2) how to correct them for biases and measurement noise (whenever possible). Below is a list of the main topics addressed by the authors and my comments about them:</p>
    <p>1. Choice of signal parameters to monitor: pulse width is typically used to discriminate single particles from doublets. I am therefore not surprised that this parameter is not particularly informative for fluorescence quantification. It is reassuring that the area is proportional to the product of pulse height and width for the calibration beads. Does a similar connection hold for bacterial cells as well?</p>
    <p>2. Gating events based on the scatter measurements: in various ways, this is routinely done by several groups that practice flow cytometry, either in a manual or semi-automatic manner. Does the approach proposed by the authors have any significant advantages?</p>
    <p>3. Correlation of FSC and SSC with mean cell size: here, the authors are missing an important citation (Volkmer &amp; Heinemann, PLoS ONE, 2011). That work also made a comparison between mean FSC/SSC and cell volume, with very similar conclusions to the ones made here.</p>
    <p>4. Use of FSC/SSC to measure individual cell sizes: the authors conclude that FSC/SSC signals do not carry enough information to measure cell size distributions in an E. coli population. Though I would tend to agree with this conclusion, I do not fully agree with the arguments provided. The authors apply equations (1) and (2) both to microscopy and flow cytometry data. While it is clear to me that (1) and (2) are perfectly adequate for size measurements based on microscopy, I am not sure that they apply just as easily in the case of flow cytometry. Specifically, eq. (1) could perhaps look like x_m = f(x_t)+epsilon, i.e. the relationship between measured and actual sizes could be nonlinear at worst, or linear (perhaps with an offset) at best. In either case, the variance of x_m for flow cytometry will not obey (2), even in the simplest scenario of linear scaling without offset.</p>
    <p>I think that, before attempting to decompose the measured variance of the flow cytometry signals, the authors should first infer the relationship between x_m and x_t in the case of flow cytometry, for example by using calibration beads of different sizes. Then, using variance propagation they could estimate var(x_t) based on var(x_m) and determine how much information the FSC/SSC signals carry about the size of single cells.</p>
    <p>Another point regarding the analysis of this section is that one should probably also suspect the noise in GFP measurements as another source of error. As the authors show later on, the GFP signal requires some significant corrections to correctly report the variability of the cell population. On the other hand, it seems to me that the GFP signals used in Fig. 4 were not corrected for shot noise and autofluorescence. It is therefore plausible that the lack of correlation between GFP and FSC/SSC can be partially attributed to the GFP noise.</p>
    <p>5. Gating the fluorescence data &amp; 6. Estimating autofluorescence: the authors perform an analysis which is typically carried out in one or another way by practioners of flow cytometry. However, their approach looks quite principled and systematic (e.g. in the averaging of authofluorescence measurements from different dates).</p>
    <p>7. Calibration of fluorescence signal to remove shot noise and autofluorescence: here, the authors perform a nice analysis to remove the additional variability introduced by flow cytometry using calibration beads (an approach similar to what I suggested above for the FSC/SCC analysis), and are eventually able to achieve relatively good agreement between microscopy and flow cytometry measurements. I would have preferred to also see the relative, besides the absolute error in the CV’s, to better understand over which range of GFP concentrations the flow cytometry measurements can provide a reliable estimate of the GFP variability.</p>
    <p>Overall, I think that the authors should try to clarify a bit more which steps of their calibration pipeline differ or improve upon procedures carried out by other groups. For example, the fitting of mixture models is also doable with commercially available flow cytometry software, as well as with user-generated code. I would recommend that they revisit the analysis of FSC/SSC and individual cell size.</p>
    <p>Some further minor points and questions:</p>
    <p>- Strains and growth conditions section (M&amp;M) needs some streamlining to better organize the information. Growth media, precultures and dilutions are a bit mixed up for flow cytometry and microscopy experiments, and a bit hard to follow.</p>
    <p>- Fig. 3: would it be possible that the authors repeat some of the information of ref. 31 about the medium conditions? For example, what does “salt” mean? How are cells grown in these different media? (is growth balanced, for example?)</p>
    <p>- Fig. 4: what are the units of the horizontal axis in the second and third rows? The scattering units used here are different from those of other figures where scatters are displayed.</p>
    <p>- Fig. 5: is it correct that the two strains mentioned here are simply the same background strain carrying two different plasmids?</p>
    <p>- Fig. S6: I do not understand the x-axis title (mean log (GFP.H)).</p>

    <p>4. Have the authors made all data underlying the findings in their manuscript fully available?</p>
    <p>The <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.plosone.org/static/policies.action#sharing">PLOS Data policy</ext-link> requires authors to make all data underlying the findings described in their manuscript fully available without restriction, with rare exception (please refer to the Data Availability Statement in the manuscript PDF file). The data should be provided as part of the manuscript or its supporting information, or deposited to a public repository. For example, in addition to summary statistics, the data points behind means, medians and variance measures should be available. If there are restrictions on publicly sharing data—e.g. participant privacy or use of data from a third party—those must be specified.</p>
