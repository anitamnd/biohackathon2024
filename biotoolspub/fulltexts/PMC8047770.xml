      <p>Liquid chromatography
tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS) and other
mass spectrometric technologies have been widely applied for triacylglycerol
profiling. One challenge for targeted identification of fatty acyl
moieties that constitute triacylglycerol species in biological samples
is the numerous combinations of 3 fatty acyl groups that can form
a triacylglycerol molecule. Manual determination of triacylglycerol
structures based on peak intensities and retention time can be highly
inefficient and error-prone. To resolve this, we have developed TAILOR-MS,
a Python (programming language) package that aims at assisting: (1)
the generation of targeted LC/MS methods for triacylglycerol detection
and (2) automating triacylglycerol structural determination and prediction.
To assess the performance of TAILOR-MS, we conducted LC/MS triacylglycerol
profiling of bovine milk and two infant formulas. Our results confirmed
dissimilarities between bovine milk and infant formula triacylglycerol
composition. Furthermore, we identified 247 triacylglycerol species
and predicted the possible existence of another 317 in the bovine
milk sample, representing one of the most comprehensive reports on
the triacylglycerol composition of bovine milk thus far. Likewise,
we presented here a complete infant formula triacylglycerol profile
and reported &gt;200 triacylglycerol species. TAILOR-MS dramatically
shortened the time required for triacylglycerol structural identification
from hours to seconds and performed decent structural predictions
in the absence of some triacylglycerol constituent peaks. Taken together,
TAILOR-MS is a valuable tool that can greatly save time and improve
accuracy for targeted LC/MS triacylglycerol profiling.</p>

    <title>Introduction</title>
    <p>Triacylglycerol (TG)
is one of the most common lipid classes and
possesses several biological functions from being a highly efficient
energy storage material to a regulator of cell signaling.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref></sup> TG profiling of biological samples and agricultural and food products
has constantly drawn the interest of lipid scientists. Studies regarding
TG profiles of various biological samples, such as milk from different
mammals and oil from various plant sources, have been widely reported,
which often serve important nutritional and quality-control purposes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>−<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref></sup> As a major lipid class, TG is also frequently featured in modern
“lipidomics” studies,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref></sup></p>
    <p>One of the inherent challenges for TG identification
is its complex
fatty acyl (FA) composition. TG structurally comprises a glycerol
backbone and three FA groups. Therefore, <italic>n</italic> number
of FAs can theoretically give rise to (<italic>n</italic><sup>3</sup> + 3<italic>n</italic><sup>2</sup> + 2<italic>n</italic>)/6 TG species
(not considering regio- and stereoisomers); that is, up to 220 combinations
can be generated from merely 10 FAs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref></sup> A
widely used approach to identify FA chains constituting TG species
is mass spectrometry, which typically involves targeted detection
of unique precursor/product ion pairs (MS/MS mode) that are indicative
of TG species and their FA groups. Furthermore, chromatographic separation
of TG species based on physicochemical properties (e.g., polarity)
is often applied prior to mass spectrometric analysis to provide further
retention time (RT) information.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref></sup> For example,
Li et al. detailed the identification of TG species in soybean seeds
by measuring TG ammonium adducts and their multiple neutral losses
of FA moieties under positive ion mode with an ESI triple quadrupole
mass spectrometer.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref></sup> Similar approaches
have also been implemented to identify bovine milk and infant formula
TG composition in numerous other reports using different types of
chromatography coupled mass spectrometers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>−<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref></sup> Because one product ion peak only reveals the identity of an FA
(with [diacylglycerol]<sup>+</sup>) from the selected TG, matching
the detected product ion peaks based on their abundances and RT is
necessary in order to decipher TG structures. When conducted manually,
this entire process can be laborious, time-consuming, and prone to
errors, especially when the sample of interest has a complex TG composition,
e.g., bovine milk.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref></sup></p>
    <p>Attempts have been made
to automate TG structural prediction with
input FA information (i.e., species and abundances) using different
computational algorithms. However, this type of approach relied heavily
on statistical distributions with little biological relevance, and
the results were not always accurate.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref></sup> Here, we took
an alternative approach and developed TAILOR-MS (acronym for Triacylglycerol
Identifier for Low Resolution Mass Spectrometry), a Python package
that is capable of automating TG structural identification with input
targeted LC/MS data. To evaluate its performance, TAILOR-MS has been
applied to characterize TG species in bovine milk and infant formulas.
TAILOR-MS exhibited superior TG identification and prediction capabilities
compared to manual analysis. With the aid of TAILOR-MS, we generated
comprehensive TG profiles of bovine milk and infant formulas containing
more detailed composition than most previous reports, which demonstrated
the high levels of complexity of the two types of biological samples
in terms of TG composition.</p>

      <title>TAILOR-MS</title>
      <p>TAILOR-MS is designed to automate identifications
of three FA chains that constitute TG species using input targeted
LC/MS data. The package was written with Python (v.3.6.6) and relied
heavily on Pandas (v. 0.25.1) and Numpy (v. 1.17.2). TAILOR-MS consists
of two independent scripts, MRM List Generator and Identifier; both
were designed following similar concepts (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref></xref>).</p>

triacylglycerol
structure determination. TAILOR-MS aims at expediting LC/MS-based
targeted TG species detection and identification process with an extra
high accuracy. The package consists of two parts: MRM List Generator
and Identifier. The former assists LC-MS acquisition method development,
and the latter assists the identification and prediction of TG structures
with different FA combinations. The two scripts follow similar general
steps: (1) Generate a comprehensive list of (<italic>n</italic>3 +
3<italic>n</italic>2 + 2<italic>n</italic>)/6 TG species based on
the combinations of input FA chains. (2) Remove TG species based on
selection algorithms; for the MRM List Generator, this is the set
“reappearance” rule; for Identifier, peak retention
time spans and their relative abundances must meet the set thresholds.
(3) Finally, TAILOR-MS MRM List Generator creates an MRM list and
a TG structure list which can be used to set up LC/MS acquisition
methods for TG detection. For TAILOR-MS Identifier, the exported file
is a list containing identified and predicted TG structures from input
LC/MS peaks.</p>

      <p>MRM List Generator creates a comprehensive
list of multiple reaction
monitoring (MRM) transitions ([M + NH<sub>4</sub>]<sup>+</sup>/[M

the combination of TG species based on the FA groups listed by users.
It also simultaneously generates a list of TG structures that can
be identified with the above MRM transitions.</p>
      <p>TAILOR-MS Identifier
uses processed (peak identification and deconvolution)
peak information including names, brutto level (the sum compositional
level of identification of TG where the lipid class is followed by
the total number of carbons and double bonds across all the constituent
FA chains<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref></sup>), TG (Q1), FA neutral losses (Q3), alphabetic
peak IDs which distinguish peaks with the same Q1/Q3 but separated
chromatographically, left and right borders of peak RTs, and intensities
(can be areas under curves, heights, or concentrations). Two thresholds
can be set by the user. The first is % relative abundance, which cuts
off TG species that have % relative abundances (vs intensity of the
maximal peak among all peaks that share the same Q1, script calculated)
below set values. The other is % overlapped retention time, which
excludes TG species that do not overlap (based on peak RTs) to the
extent above the set values when comparing chromatograms. The rule
is the three (or two for prediction) peaks must overlap and the calculated
overlapped time segment (of the three or two) must also overlap to
or above the set % with the peak of lowest abundance among the three
(or two; known as ID peak and indicated by capitalization) that comprise
the proposed TG structure. TAILOR-MS Identifier starts by generating
a full list of combinations of possible TG structures containing FA
information, based on input data. It then identifies TG structures
that exist by taking brutto level FA carbon and double bond numbers
and then subtracting them with the carbon and double bond numbers
of the acquired three or two FA neutral losses. When three neutral
losses are present, both numbers post subtraction must be 0. When
only two FA neutral losses are provided, TAILOR-MS predicts the third
FA and hence full TG structure with the user-defined FA list. The
script subsequently drops TG structures for which the three (or two)
peaks do not overlap and then excludes TG structures with calculated
% relative abundance and % retention time overlap spans below the
set thresholds and eventually returns a list of identified and predicted
TG species with FA chain information (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref></xref> and <xref rid="notes-1" ref-type="notes">Supporting Information
Databases 1, 2, and 3</xref>). <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref> demonstrates how TAILOR-MS determines the structures

          <p>TG structure determination by TAILOR-MS Identifier: an example.
The TG structure determination process of infant formula 2 TG(48:3)
is presented here to demonstrate how TAILOR-MS works on experimental
data. Based on input peak intensity (here AUC), retention time, and
peak ID (a, b, and c) information, TAILOR-MS calculates %abundances
of the peaks (the most abundant peak as 100%, here TG(48 × 3)_12
× 0), which can be used to exclude low abundance peaks. To confirm
the existence of a TG structure, TAILOR-MS checks if a structure is
found in a list of <italic>in silico</italic> generated TG structures
based on the brutto level and input FA list, as well as peak retention
time spans overlap. Furthermore, the script also predicts TG structures
based on the difference in TG brutto level and the sum of two in fatty
acyl chains that exist in input data (i.e., predicting the third FA
chain, # denoted). In this example, TAILOR-MS identifies TG(12:0_18:1_18:2)
(aAa), TG(14:0_16:0_18:3) (aaA), TG(14:0_16:0_18:3) (bbB), and TG(14:0_16:0_18:3)
(cCc). It also predicts the existence of TG(12:0_14:0_22:3) (aA#),
TG(12:0_16:0_20:3) (aA#), TG(14:0_14:0_20:3) (AA#), TG(14:0_14:0_20:3)
(BB#), TG(14:0_14:0_20:3) (CC#), and TG(14:0_16:1_18:2) (A#a).</p>

      <title>TAILOR-MS MRM List Generator</title>
      <p>TAILOR-MS is capable of
generating a comprehensive MRM list that detects Q1/Q3 ammonium adducts
of a TG species and its FA neutral loss fragments, a well-established
ESI-LC/MS TG detection method.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref></sup> Here we
first tested this function with 18 most abundant FA groups found in
bovine milk and infant formulas TG pools. It is noteworthy that the
abundances of these selected FA groups still varied dramatically and
that 14:0, 16:0, 16:1, 18:0, 18:1, and 18:2 were among the most abundant
(&gt;5%) FA species.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref></sup> To reduce the number
of MRM transitions included in our LC/MS acquisition method and improve
mass spectrometric detection quality (by having fewer transitions
at a time point), only the above FA groups were allowed to reappear
more than once in a TG structure, which could be set with a user defined
parameter in input data for the TAILOR-MS MRM List Generator. By doing
this, the number of MRM transitions reduced from 1764 to a palatable
size of 504, which could determine 308 TG structures without considering
regioisomers.</p>

    <sec id="sec3.3">
      <title>TAILOR-MS Identifier</title>
      <p>To test the
second function of
TAILOR-MS, we took unpublished bovine milk and infant formula LC/MS
data that were initially used to develop LC/MS lipid profiling methods
in one of our earlier publications.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref></sup> These
data sets were generated prior to the development of TAILOR-MS. However,
similar procedures were followed when we manually created LC/MS acquisition
methods. In total, data with 373 different MRM transitions were recorded,
which contained information on 544 peaks. With these input data, TAILOR-MS
generated 564 possible TG species with FA structural details in bovine
milk (settings: 0% relative abundance; 75% retention time span; 33
FA groups in FA list; same for infant formulas below). Among them,
247 identified TG species had all their 3 FA peaks detected by our
targeted method, whereas the other 317 TG structures were predicted
based on 2 detected FA peaks, with the third FA filled from the input
FA list. The numbers of TG species being identified in infant formulas
were similar and both fewer than that of bovine milk. In total, 473
TG species were found in infant formula 1; 209 were identified by
3 FA peaks; 264 were predicted based on 2 detected FA peaks. For infant
formula 2, the numbers were 486, 206, and 280, respectively. The similarities
of these samples were visualized with a heatmap plot (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref></xref>). Heatmap patterns indicated
that the TG composition of bovine milk was less similar to either
of the infant formulas than between the two infant formulas themselves,
and TG species with shorter chains were more abundant in bovine milk
than in infant formulas (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref></xref>). The bovine milk and infant formula TG composition
obtained here was also compared to bovine milk TG composition reported
earlier,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref></sup> which showed a greater resemblance
to our bovine milk TG profile but was less similar to the infant formulas

process, and this has been demonstrated by the calculated average
script run time with input bovine milk and infant formula data. As
shown in <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="other">Table <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="other">2</xref></xref>, the
script run time was typically around or less than 30 s, which appeared

these TG species using the same input data, which took several hours

      <p>The predication function of TAILOR-MS Identifier was likewise examined,
using a subset-taking approach conceptually similar to cross validation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref></sup> 5% or 10% input peak data were randomly removed
from the bovine milk and infant formula data sets. The remaining subsets
containing 95% and 90% of the original input peak data were run through
TAILOR-MS Identifier, and then the outcomes were compared to those
generated from their respective full lists of data. Unsurprisingly,
fewer TG species were identified in the subset outcomes. Some of these
missing TG species nonetheless were captured by the prediction function
of TAILOR-MS. Percentage predicted TG species (vs all missing TG species
in subset results) were subsequently calculated. The process was repeated
using 10 different randomly generated subsets for each data set, and
the results are shown as <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref></xref>. Overall, TAILOR-MS predicted the existence of approximately
25–40% of all the missing TG species (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref></xref>A). Notably, 16:0, 18:0, and 18:1 FAs were
the top 3 abundant FA groups in all the samples tested here.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref></sup> In fact, 16- and 18-carbon FA groups are often
the major TG constituents in many biological samples.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">33</xref></sup> It is unlikely to miss them when setting up a targeted acquisition
method. Therefore, we conducted another test similar to the above,
except this time we always retained the 16:0, 18:0, and 18:1 FA groups.
By doing so, the prediction performance appeared to improve by approximately
10% for bovine milk and infant formula 1 results, but only resulted
in slight improvement to the prediction performance for infant formula
2 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref></xref>B). The
effects of manipulating input data settings on the numbers of TG structures

      <title>Importance
of the Study</title>
      <p>TG structure identification
can be a time-consuming and arduous task if carried out manually.
Our study has demonstrated that TAILOR-MS could tremendously simplify
and expedite this process and minimize human errors. With input LC/MS
data, TAILOR-MS successfully generated lists of TG structures that
existed in bovine milk, which is known to have very complex TG composition.
In comparison, the TG composition of two infant formulas was also
determined by TAILOR-MS. Although this work focuses on using these
systems for validation purposes, the identification of 247 TG species
makes it one of the most complete and detailed single reports of bovine
milk TG composition to date, with the previous bovine milk TG studies
totaling around 300.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34">34</xref></sup> Only one very recent
study identified substantially more TG species in bovine milk, in
which the authors used a semiautomatic approach for TG identification
with the aid of a proprietary lipid database.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref></sup> TAILOR-MS also has predicted the presence of a large number of novel
TG species that possibly constituted the bovine milk TG lipidome,
which we believe could be a useful source for identifying new bovine
milk TG in the future.</p>
      <p>As was the case for bovine milk TG profiling,
we have also presented here comprehensive TG profiles for infant formulas.
Several earlier infant formula TG composition studies have been examined,
and none of them reported more than 100 TG species.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>−<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref></sup> Our study, by contrast, identified at least 200 TG species in each
infant formula tested, which possibly makes it the most complex infant
formula TG profile presented in the literature to date. Both our bovine
milk and infant formula TG profiles resemble earlier reports in several
aspects, which again confirms the performance of TAILOR-MS.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec4.2">
      <title>Advantages
of TAILOR-MS</title>
      <p>Our results not only verify
the validity of TAILOR-MS but also demonstrate several advantages
of the scripts we have developed. First, it is easy to use and can
potentially save the user hours when setting up targeted LC/MS acquisition
methods and performing TG structural identification with input LC/MS
data. It also enables the user to set up % relative abundances, %
retention time spans, and the numbers of FA groups to use for prediction.
Manipulating these parameters is useful under several circumstances
such as when the user is only interested in the more abundant TG species
and wants to reduce the complexity of their data sets (increase %
relative abundances). Alternatively, when the chromatographical separation
of peaks is incomplete, which quite often happens due to structural
isomer peaks, the % retention time span may also be a useful parameter
to control the TG species returned (increase or decrease % overlapped
time spans, see <xref rid="sec4.3" ref-type="other">Limitations and Caveats</xref> section).
Another novel feature is its ability to predict TG species that are
likely to exist based on the user-provided FA list, which enables
the user to explore TG species that potentially exist even when some
FA chains are missing in the acquisition method. Finally, when coupled
with chromatographic separation of TG regioisomers, TAILOR-MS can
identify and assign different suffixes to them and therefore name
them differently, which assists the process of distinguishing between
different structural isomers.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec4.3">
      <title>Limitations and Caveats</title>
      <p>While TAILOR-MS provides a
simple and rapid solution to TG identification in complex biological
samples, there are nevertheless some caveats when using this package.
First, TAILOR-MS is designed for targeted mass spectrometric analysis;
that is, the inclusion of a list that contains FA of interest is required
both for setting up an acquisition method and for TG structural determination.
Just like any targeted work, TAILOR-MS does not predict structures
(even if they may exist in the sample) if the constituent FA chains
are completely absent. Hence some prior anticipation of FA species
likely to be present in the matrix is required.</p>
      <p>When conducting
TG structure prediction, TAILOR-MS is inclusive rather than exclusive
and this may create some ambiguity that needs to be examined by the
user. One example is infant formula TG(16:0_16:0_20:3) (AA#). As the
neutral loss of 20:3 FA was not recorded in the acquisition method,
structural prediction of this TG species by TAILOR-MS was based solely
on 16:0 FA, which is one of the most abundant FA chains found in our
samples. While TG(16:0_16:0_20:3) (AA#) is a possible structure, the
actual abundance of this TG species is likely to be much lower, as
the abundance of 20:3 FA in the TG pool is very low.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref></sup> The observed high TG(52:3)_16:0 neutral loss signal more
likely comes from TG(16:0_18:1_18:2) (aaA), as 18:1 and 18:2 FA neutral
loss signals were both detected and of similar levels to 16:0 FA (<xref rid="notes-1" ref-type="notes">Supporting Figure 1A and Supporting Database 2 and 3</xref>). Rerunning the sample and including the missing neutral losses
(here 20:3 FA) may be necessary to confirm the existence and obtain
more accurate abundances of TG species predicted only by 2 FA chains.
% relative abundance and intensity values generated by TAILOR-MS are
based on the ID peak of the identified TG species, which indicate
the highest possible abundance and intensity a TG species can have.
When an FA chain forms multiple TG structures, abundances of these
TG species can only reflect the sum of them, such as the TG mixtures
found in TG(36:0) and TG(38:0). In such cases, the user may consider
listing all possible TG structures that share the same ID peak in
ways similar to previous reports.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref></sup></p>
      <p>Good
chromatographic separation of peaks is also key to accurate
TG structural identification and prediction. Theoretically, if a TG
species comprises three FA chains, the neutral loss peaks arising
from these three FA moieties should overlap entirely. However, for
samples having complex TG composition such as bovine milk, it is difficult
to fully separate all peaks even with long run time and a gradient
solvent system.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref></sup> Some possible scenarios
include partially merged adjacent peaks (reduced retention time spans
of both peaks; <xref rid="notes-1" ref-type="notes">Supporting Figure 1B</xref>), two
or more merged peaks regarded as one peak (possibly increased retention
time span; <xref rid="notes-1" ref-type="notes">Supporting Figure 1C</xref>), and peak
tailing due to issues with chromatographic separation (increased retention
time span). TAILOR-MS does not consider these situations and matches
overlapped peaks only based on input retention time values. To avoid
missing these species, the user can take a more inclusive approach
by setting up a lower retention time threshold so that fewer TG structures
are removed due to unmatched retention time spans.</p>
      <p>Finally,
it is noteworthy that TG <italic>sn</italic> positions
are not determined by TAILOR-MS. Although TAILOR-MS can distinguish
and label TG regioisomers that have been chromatographically separated,
it does not suggest positions of the 3 FA chains on the TG glycerol
backbone. Nor does it indicate branched and double bond positions
on FA chains. Several enzymatic, chromatographic, and mass spectrometric
solutions may be implemented to obtain more detailed isomeric TG information.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref36">36</xref></sup></p>

    <title>Conclusions</title>
    <p>TAILOR-MS is a novel Python-based package
aiming at automating
the FA chain identification and prediction tasks for TG profiling
with input LC/MS (or mass spectrometry in general) data. It provides
a simple, efficient and accurate solution to a time-consuming and
arduous task, which works particularly well on biological and food
samples with complex TG composition. By applying TAILOR-MS, we are
able to present some of the most comprehensive TG profiles of bovine
milk and infant formulas, which further confirms the capability and
reliability of this package. We believe the introduction of TAILOR-MS
will tremendously expedite the progress of TG profiling in various
biological samples with complex TG composition in the future.</p>
