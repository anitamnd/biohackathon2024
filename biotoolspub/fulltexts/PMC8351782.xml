      <p id="P4">Camelid Nbs are characterized by small size, excellent pharmacological properties and high flexibility in bioengineering for therapeutic development. However, Nbs are “xeno” antibodies, which require “humanization” to improve their translational potential. Currently, there is a lack of systematic investigation of Nbs to rationally guide humanization. No dedicated software has been developed for this purpose.

    <title>Introduction</title>
    <p id="P6">V<sub>H</sub>H antibodies or nanobodies (Nbs) are small antigen-binding fragments that are derived from camelid (e.g., llama, alpaca, dromedary, and camel) heavy-chain antibodies (<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Nbs are composed of four conserved framework regions (FRs) that fold into β-sandwich core structures (<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Three hypervariable loops, or complementarity-determining regions (CDRs), are supported by robust scaffolds to provide antigen-binding specificity. It has been shown that Nbs may preferentially target concave epitopes to efficiently interact with target antigens. In many cases, the binding is markedly different from heterodimeric immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies, where the epitopes are generally more flat or convex (<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>–<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>).</p>
    <p id="P7">The small size (~ 15 kDa), robust fold, and lack of glycosylation enable rapid production of Nbs in microbes at low costs. Affinity matured Nbs are characterized by excellent physicochemical properties including high solubility and stability, which are critical for drug development, production, transportation, and storage. While Nbs are monomeric, they can be easily bioengineered into bispecific and multivalent modalities to achieve avidity binding, which may resist the mutational escape of the target (e.g., virus and cancer antigen) under selection pressure, and/or incorporate additional new functionalities (<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>–<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Because of their small size, Nbs can bind compact molecular structures and may penetrate tissues more efficiently than large IgG antibodies, thus facilitating molecular and diagnostic imaging applications (<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>).</p>
    <p id="P8">In response to the COVID-19 (Coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic, thousands of highly potent and neutralizing Nbs have recently been identified by using <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> affinity maturation coupled to a robust Nb drug discovery pipeline (<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). These multi-epitope Nbs specifically target the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein with high affinity, and are cost-effective antiviral agents for the evolving virus(<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). The outstanding preclinical efficacy of an inhalable construct has been recently demonstrated for inhalation therapy of SARS-CoV-2 infection by small Nb aerosols (<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). At an ultra-low dose, this innovative therapy has been shown to reduce lung viral titers by 6-logs to minimize lung pathology and prevent viral pneumonia (<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Moreover, high-resolution structural analyses have facilitated epitope mapping and classification of potent neutralizing Nbs into three main classes, which are characterized by distinct antiviral mechanisms. Systematic structural studies have provided insights into how Nbs uniquely target the spike to achieve ultrahigh-affinity binding and broadly neutralizing activities against SARS-CoV-2 and its circulating variants (<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>).</p>
    <p id="P9">Owing to these unique properties, Nbs have emerged as a compelling class of biologics (<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). The first Nb drug (Cablivi) has recently been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) (<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>); more candidates are undergoing clinical trials (<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). While these efforts have greatly inspired the innovative medical uses of Nbs and antibody fragments, there are remaining challenges for safe and effective applications to diseases in humans. In particular, anti-drug antibody (ADA) responses can reduce drug efficacy and, in rare cases, cause exacerbated inflammatory responses and toxicity (<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). The underlying mechanism of ADA remains to be fully understood, however, several factors including, critically, the use of non-human antibodies may contribute to the side effects (<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). The consensus is that the humanization of xeno-species antibodies is necessary for drug development. Here “humanization” refers to increasing the similarity of antibodies of non-human origins to human antibodies. Thus far, efforts to humanize non-human antibodies has been exemplified by the clinical benefits of humanizing murine antibodies (<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Humanized and fully human IgGs now dominate clinical development of biologicals (<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>).</p>
    <p id="P10">Similar to the humanization of murine antibodies, strategies for Nb humanization are based on CDR grafting or FR resurfacing. One strategy involves 1) grafting antigen-specific CDRs to a specific human heavy chain variable domain (VH<sub>human</sub>) framework, which often is a universal Nb framework (<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). While this method has been successfully applied to some Nbs, using a single framework as the scaffold template may undermine the structural compatibility with many CDRs. While generally conserved, antibody frameworks nevertheless show substantial sequence and structural diversity to support infinite CDR loop conformations for antigen recognition. Such high scaffold diversity can not be fully represented by a small number of germline sequences. Another strategy centers around 2) resurfacing solvent-exposed frameworks without changing buried residues with the guidance of available structures or structural models. Resurfacing is based on the assumption that solvent-exposed, non-human residues are less likely to contribute to the structural integrity and/or antigen engagement. In addition, unique CDR properties of Nbs, which remain to be fully investigated, may also contribute to the development of ADA. Overall, there is a lack of systematic and structural investigations into Nb humanization, which is critical for moving therapeutic Nbs into clinical trials.</p>
    <p id="P11">In this study, we have leveraged antibody/Nb next-generation sequencing (NGS) datasets and high-resolution structural information from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) to systematically analyze and compare Nbs, and mammalian (specifically, human and murine) IgGs. Our analysis reveals unique sequence and structural properties of Nbs and provides insights into Nb humanization. Guided by the large-scale analysis, we have developed <italic toggle="yes">Llamanade-</italic> an open-source software to facilitate Nb humanization. <italic toggle="yes">Llamanade</italic> can rapidly optimize the solution and provide quantitative measurement of the extent of humanization. Finally, we applied <italic toggle="yes">Llamanade</italic> to humanize a set of structurally diverse and ultrapotent SARS-CoV-2 Nbs. These humanized antiviral Nbs closely resemble VH<sub>human</sub> frameworks and have demonstrated excellent solubility and bioactivities comparable to the non-humanized precursor Nbs.</p>

      <title>Systematic and quantitative analysis of Nbs and IgG antibodies</title>
      <p id="P12">We compiled a high-quality Nb sequence library by randomly selecting 49,686 distinct, natural Nb sequences derived from previously generated NGS databases (<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). Non-redundant human and murine IgG sequences (22,450 and 10,696, respectively) from the EMBL-Ig database were also selected to generate IgG sequence libraries (<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). The variable region of antibody sequences and Nbs were numbered, and their CDRs and FRs were annotated using the Martin numbering scheme (<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). To quantify the “humanness” level of Nbs, we used the T20 score which has been shown to distinguish VH<sub>human</sub> and VH<sub>mouse</sub> with high specificity (<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). In addition, the T20 score may positively correlate with decreased immunogenicity of therapeutic antibodies to potentially inform clinical studies (<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). An input Nb will be searched against our curated human IgG library to obtain the top 20 matched VH<sub>human</sub>s based on sequence identity. The percentage identity of the top 20 matches will be averaged to obtain the T20 score (<xref rid="S8" ref-type="sec">Method</xref>). We calculated the T20 scores for the framework region (T20<sub>FR</sub>) of all the Nbs, VH<sub>mouse</sub>, and VH<sub>human</sub> in the respective libraries to generate the distribution plots (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S1</xref>). As expected, the scores of different antibody species largely follow normal distributions with VH<sub>human</sub> slightly skewed towards the lower end. Compared to VH<sub>mouse</sub>, Nbs are significantly more similar to VH<sub>human</sub>, which is consistent with the previous analysis using a limited number of sequences(<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). Notably, a substantial fraction of the Nbs is indistinguishable from VH<sub>human</sub> based on overlapping T20 scores. The average T20<sub>FR</sub> for Nbs and VH<sub>mouse</sub>, are 79.7 and 72.1, respectively (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). High similarity between Nbs and VH<sub>human</sub> sequences is primarily attributed to FR1, FR3, and FR4 among the four FRs (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">1D</xref>, <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">1E</xref>). In contrast, the FR2s of Nbs are markedly different from their human counterparts (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). Moreover, while framework sequences are generally conserved, substantial variations are also evident (σ<sub>human VH</sub> = 4.55, σ<sub>mouse VH</sub> = 4.22, σ<sub>Nb</sub>= 3.73). These structural variations underlie the potential challenges of using a single scaffold template to humanize a large repertoire of highly structurally diverse Nbs.</p>
      <p id="P13">Identifying framework sequences that differ between Nbs and the top matched VH<sub>human</sub> is likely critical to inform humanization strategies. Nbs and the corresponding VH<sub>human</sub> were aligned and the resulting sequence logo profiles are presented in <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>–<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">D</xref> (<xref rid="S8" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref>). The average percentages of residue substitution are 10%, 12.8%, 28.6% and 4% for the respective four FRs (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>). Hotspot residue substitutions (from Nbs to VH<sub>human</sub>) were identified including FR1 residues: A14P, R27F; FR2 residues: F/Y37V, E44G, R45L, F/L47W; FR3 residues: V75L, K83R, P84A, A94R/K; and FR4 residue: Q108L. While the substitutions on three FRs share similar physicochemical properties, FR2 substitutions, especially F/Y37, E44, and R45, may reduce local hydrophilicity of Nbs. Large-scale sequence analysis reveals key differences between Nbs and VH<sub>human</sub> which may be modified to achieve higher similarity to human antibodies.</p>

      <title>Large-scale structural analysis reveals residue interactions specific to Nbs</title>
      <p id="P14">Given the structural differences of Nbs from VH<sub>human</sub>, indiscriminate substitution of camelid Nb residues for human VH<sub>human</sub> residues may result in perturbations to the overall Nb structure. In addition, surface exposed residues are more likely to be recognized by the host immune response and are thus of particular interest for humanization. To minimize immunogenicity without perturbing the overall structure, we systematically analyzed high-resolution structures of antigen-antibody interactions to gain insights into the crucial, unique structural properties of Nbs. We assessed the structures of 190 distinct Nbs and 621 human IgGs from the AbBank (<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). This structural information was used to differentiate buried residues from surface-exposed residues, which may elicit immunogenicity and therefore require humanization. Here, a residue is considered “buried” if the projecting side chain is 3 Å or more below the antibody surface (<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>) (<xref rid="S8" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref>). As expected, a small fraction of antibody FR residues are buried while the majority are solvent-exposed. Moreover, compared to VH<sub>human</sub> (average 73%, σ=6.2%), significantly more Nb FR residues (average 76.9%, σ = 6.3%) are solvent-exposed (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3B</xref>). The major differences occur in the FR2, where R45 and F/L47 (Nbs) are fully exposed while the corresponding human residues are buried (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>, <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3D</xref>). These solvent exposed residues in FR2 are likely to be important for the high solubility of Nbs and are not recommended for humanization.</p>
      <p id="P15">Large-scale structural analysis also reveals two types of intramolecular interactions that may contribute to structural integrity. The first is between FR2 and FR4. Here, W103 (FR4) can associate with R45 (FR2) by a conserved cation-π interaction, which is replaced by hydrophobic interaction of L45: W103 in VH<sub>human</sub>. In addition, W103 can also interact with F/Y37 using a π-π interaction, which is absent in the IgG VH domains. To substantiate these observations, we measured the distances and angles of the charged atoms of R45 with respect to the centroids of aromatic rings from W103. We also measured those between F/Y37 and W103 (<xref rid="S8" ref-type="sec">Method</xref>). The average distance/angle of the R45:W103 and F/Y37:W103 interactions are 3.9 Å/65.7°, and 4.1 Å/31°, supporting the respective bond formations (cation-π and π-π interactions) (<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). These interactions should be conserved as they may be critical to support the robust scaffold and excellent physicochemical properties of Nbs.</p>
      <p id="P16">The second important intramolecular interaction specific to Nbs is between the FR2 and CDR3 (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>). The frequency of this bond positively correlates with CDR3 length. Over 80% of long CDR3s (&gt; 15 residues) were found to have this interaction (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>). In addition, most long CDR3’s contain a small helix structure (typically 3–4 amino acids in length) that was rarely identified on VH<sub>human</sub> (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>, <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">4G</xref>). Analysis reveals that long CDR3 loops of Nbs can fold back to interact with two specific FR2 residues (positions 37 and 47, <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>), where the corresponding VH<sub>human</sub> residues use to interact with the light chains (VLs) (<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>) (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S2A</xref>). This FR2: CDR3 interaction may impact Nb humanization in two ways: 1) the long CDR3 may shield potentially immunogenic residues on FR2, which are otherwise solvent-exposed. 2) The helix associated with long CDR3 loops may potentially enhance immunogenicity and the development of ADA in clinical applications (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4G</xref>). Nevertheless, these FR2 residues unique to Nbs must be conserved, as resurfacing these residues may alter CDR3 conformations and compromise antigen binding.</p>
      <p id="P17">Moreover, specific intramolecular disulfide bonds (between CDR3 and CDR1/2) were identified in approximately 10% of Nbs that we have analyzed but were absent in VH<sub>human</sub> (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S3B</xref>). The disulfide bridges (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S2B</xref>) are exclusively buried for folding and the corresponding residues are not considered for humanization in our software.</p>
      <p id="P18">Finally, intermolecular contact analysis reveals direct involvement of specific FR2 residues (44,45 and 47) for antigen binding. Based on the antigen: Nb structures, approximately 20% of Nbs use these FR2 residues for antigen binding. In addition, it appears <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> affinity matured Nbs use them less extensively for binding compared to <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> selected Nbs (<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Without detailed structure information of antigen: Nb interactions, these FR2 residues should be ideally excluded for humanization to better preserve structural integrity.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="S5">
      <title>Development of an open-source to facilitate rational Nb humanization</title>
      <p id="P19">Based on big data analysis, we developed an open-source software to facilitate automated, structure-guided, and robust Nb humanization. Llamanade is composed of five main modules (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>): 1) Nb structural modeling, 2) sequence annotation, 3) sequence analysis, 4) structural analysis, 5) humanization score. The input is a Nb sequence in a simple fasta format. The structural model is generated by Modeller (<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). Alternatively, the input can be high-resolution structures of Nbs or antigen: Nb complexes. Nb sequence will be annotated using the Martin scheme to define FRs and CDRs. To select the best VH<sub>human</sub> templates for Nb humanization, we first use Nb sequences (from the NGS database) to fetch the top-20 VH<sub>human</sub> in our human IgG library that are highly similar to Nbs based on T20<sub>F</sub> score (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>, <xref rid="S8" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref>). 6,070 VHs were obtained after this analysis. The sequences are aligned to calculate the amino acid frequency at each position to generate a position-dependent residue frequency matrix. Annotated input Nbs will be compared to this matrix to select framework residues for humanization. Candidate residues will be selected for humanization if their occurrences are sufficiently low (&lt; 10%) at the corresponding position of VH<sub>human</sub>. Substitution of these residues may result in incompatibility of these rare VH<sub>human</sub> frameworks with specific CDR loop conformations that compromise the structural and physicochemical properties of the Nbs after humanization.</p>
      <p id="P20">In parallel, our software will perform structural analysis to determine if the candidate Nb residues are solvent-exposed or not. Only solvent-exposed residues that do not participate in backbone intramolecular interactions (structural integrity), and do not impact antigen: Nb interactions (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>) will be humanized. In particular, specific FR2 residues at positions 37, 45, and 47 are not recommended to change because of their involvement in either backbone interactions or antigen-binding (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>, <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). A humanization score will be calculated based on T20<sub>F</sub> to quantify the humanness level of Nbs (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). The output files include the annotated humanized Nb sequence, modeled structure, and the humanization score. <italic toggle="yes">Llamanade</italic> is user-friendly and the full analysis takes less than 1 minute/Nb to complete on a local device. In addition, the service will be deployed to a webserver to provide better accessibility and visualization to the community.</p>

These Nbs target the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the virus spike and are structurally diverse falling into three main epitope classes (<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>) (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref>). Class I Nbs include Nb 21 and presumably Nb64. They can directly block the ACE2 receptor binding sites of RBD to potently neutralize SARS-CoV-2 at as low as below 0.1 ng/ml, which is unprecedented for antiviral antibody fragments (<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Class II Nbs (34, 95, 105, and presumably 93) strongly bind conserved RBD epitopes and neutralize the virus at 30 ng/ml. Class III Nbs (17, 36, and presumably 9) recognize relatively conserved sites including cryptic neutralizing epitopes where large human antibodies may not be able to access. Here robust humanization will help preclinical and clinical development of antiviral Nbs.</p>
      <p id="P22">Using Nb sequence data as input, these RBD Nbs were humanized by <italic toggle="yes">Llamanade</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">Llamanade</italic> significantly improved the humanness level of Nb frameworks. The median T20 score of Nbs increased from 82.8 (before humanization) to 92.4 (after humanization), which corresponds to the humanization of seven Nb FR residues (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B</xref>, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S3</xref>). The median framework identity of these highly humanized Nbs to the top matched VH<sub>human</sub> sequence ranges between 90%– 95% (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S4</xref>).</p>
      <p id="P23">After humanization, Nbs were back translated into DNA sequences, which were synthesized <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> and cloned into an expression vector (pET-21b) for recombinant protein productions in <italic toggle="yes">E.coli</italic> (<xref rid="S8" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref>). 8/9 humanized Nbs were readily expressed in the whole-cell lysis (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7C</xref>) comparable to their native forms (<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). They were one-step purified by His-cobalt resin with excellent solubility and yield (<xref rid="S8" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref>, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S5</xref>). The only exception was Nb36. While hNb36 can still be purified from the soluble cell lysis (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S5</xref>), the majority of the humanized Nb was found in the inclusion body and was excluded for analysis due to potentially inferior solubility. To assess the bioactivities of these humanized Nbs, we performed the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and confirmed the comparably high activities (± 4 fold) to the non-humanized precursors (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7D</xref>, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S6</xref>). These highly humanized ultrapotent SARS-CoV-2 Nbs recapitulated robust physicochemical and structural properties that are critical for inexpensive manufacturing towards clinical development.</p>

    <title>Discussion</title>
    <p id="P24">Nbs are characterized by small size, high solubility and stability for advanced biomedical uses. Technology advancement has recently enabled rapid discovery and characterization of tens of thousands of high-affinity and multi-epitope Nbs for specific antigen binding, which opens exciting possibilities for drug development (<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). Recently, ultrapotent Nbs have shown great promise as cost-effective antiviral agents to help curve the pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2. Stable and ultrapotent Nbs can be inhale delivered by aerosolization with high bioavailability to treat pulmonary infections efficiently (<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>).</p>
    <p id="P25">Humanization has been considered as a key step for therapeutic development of xeno-species antibodies including Nbs of camelid origin. However, systematic investigations into Nb humanization based on large-scale sequence and structural analyses remain unavailable. To our knowledge, there is no dedicated software available for Nb humanization. To fill this gap, we have developed an open-source <italic toggle="yes">Llamanade</italic> to facilitate robust and fast Nb humanization. Using <italic toggle="yes">Llamanade</italic>, we quickly humanized a cohort of structurally diverse and ultrapotent SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing Nbs. Critically, these highly humanized Nbs demonstrated robust physicochemical and structural properties and high bioactivities comparable to the natural, affinity matured presusors.</p>
    <p id="P26">The underlying mechanisms of ADA remain to be investigated. However, we note that multiple factors, beyond the use of non-human antibodies, may contribute to the ADA responses. These include: 1) impurity of antibodies, 2) the route and dose of administration, and 3) solubility of antibody or antigen-antibody complex. Inspired by the FDA approval of the first Nb therapy(<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>), a number of preclinical and clinical programs have been initiated providing critical insights into the safety profiles, dosing regime and efficacy of therapeutic Nbs. For example, recent studies based on dozens of preclinical results found that ADA responses were minor, and were generally non-neutralizing to compromise efficacy (<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). Clinical trials have further revealed limited safety issues of Nbs (mostly humanized Nbs) in both patients and healthy volunteers. Nevertheless, ADA has been detected in both preclinical and clinical development. For example, a humanized bivalent anti-cancer Nb targeting human cytokine receptor (hIL-6R) was associated with adverse effects during clinical trials and was terminated prematurely (<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). Potential immunogenicity and adverse effects of a non-humanized HER2 Nb were also detected in phase I trial, which showed moderate increase over the course of the trial (<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). These studies underscore the requirement of comprehensive evaluations of ADA and toxicology studies before moving Nbs into clinical trials. Here, the development of robust humanization methods will help improve the translational potentials of therapeutic Nbs.</p>
    <p id="P27">In summary, we have developed a robust, fast, and user-friendly tool to facilitate automated Nb humanization. <italic toggle="yes">Llamanade</italic> is the first dedicated software for Nb humanization. It is freely accessible and can be extended for the analysis of other VH-like scaffolds such as shark single-domain antibodies (V<sub>NAR</sub>) (<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). In a parallel effort, Tomer et al. developed AI-enabled software to accurately model Nb structures. These tools will be integrated to further advance Nb-based biomedical research and therapeutic development.</p>

      <p id="P30">The T20 scorer was implemented according to the method described in (<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). 22,450 non-redundant human VH sequences were used to build the blast reference database. To obtain the T20 score of a given VH/V<sub>H</sub>H sequence, the query sequence will be searched against the reference database by blastp. For an input VH<sub>human</sub>, the top 20 matched sequences will be retrieved and corresponding sequence identities will be averaged to calculate the T20 score. For a VH sequence from any other species, the top 20 matched sequences will be retrieved and used to calculate T20 score. In addition to a full sequence-based T20 scorer, we also implemented a FR based T20 scorer. More specifically, framework sequences of human VHs were extracted to construct the reference database and the framework of query sequence would be used to search. In this study, we implemented several T20 scorers for each individual framework region (FR/FR1/FR2/FR3/FR4).</p>

      <p id="P38">Antigens (RBD) were coated onto 96-well ELISA plates, with 150 ng of protein per well in the coating buffer (15 mM sodium carbonate, 35mM Sodium Bicarbonate, pH 9.6) at 4°C overnight. The plates were decanted, washed with a buffer (1x PBS, 0.05% Tween 20), and blocked for 2 hours at room temperature (1x PBS, 0.05% Tween 20, 5% milk powder). Nanobodies were serially diluted by 5 fold in blocking buffers. Anti-T7 tag HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies were diluted at 1:5000 and incubated at room temperature for 1 hour. Upon washing, samples were further incubated in the dark for 10 minutes with freshly prepared 3,3’,5,5’-Tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) substrate. Upon quenching the reaction with a STOP solution, the plates were measured at wavelengths of 450 nm with background subtraction at 550 nm. The raw data were processed and fitted into the 4PL curve using the Prism Graphpad 9.0. IC50s were calculated and fold changes of binding affinity were calculated to generate the heatmap.</p>

The input is Nb sequence information in a fasta format. Provided availability, additional structural input can be uploaded to facilitate the analysis. Nb sequences and structures will be first annotated by <italic toggle="yes">Llamanade</italic> to define CDRs and FRs. The sequence analysis module then selects candidate residues for humanization by comparing the sequence to the VH<sub>human</sub> residue frequency matrix. The structural analysis including degree of burial, intra- and intermolecular interactions will be performed to evaluate the feasibility of humanization for candidate residues. The outputs are the humanized Nb sequence, structure and humanization score.</p>
