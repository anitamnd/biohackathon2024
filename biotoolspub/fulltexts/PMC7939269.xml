    <abstract>
      <p>Over a decade ago, we introduced Anne O’Tate, a free, public web-based tool <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://arrowsmith.psych.uic.edu/cgi-bin/arrowsmith_uic/AnneOTate.cgi">http://arrowsmith.psych.uic.edu/cgi-bin/arrowsmith_uic/AnneOTate.cgi</ext-link> to support user-driven summarization, drill-down and mining of search results from PubMed, the leading search engine for biomedical literature. A set of hotlinked buttons allows the user to sort and rank retrieved articles according to important words in titles and abstracts; topics; author names; affiliations; journal names; publication year; and clustered by topic. Any result can be further mined by choosing any other button, and small search results can be expanded to include related articles. It has been deployed continuously, serving a wide range of biomedical users and needs, and over time has also served as a platform to support the creation of new tools that address additional needs. Here we describe the current, greatly expanded implementation of Anne O’Tate, which has added additional buttons to provide new functionalities: We now allow users to sort and rank search results by important phrases contained in titles and abstracts; the number of authors listed on the article; and pairs of topics that co-occur significantly more than chance. We also display articles according to NLM-indexed publication types, as well as according to 50 different publication types and study designs as predicted by a novel machine learning-based model. Furthermore, users can import search results into two new tools: e) Mine the Gap!, which identifies pairs of topics that are under-represented within set of the search results, and f) Citation Cloud, which for any given article, allows users to visualize the set of articles that cite it; that are cited by it; that are co-cited with it; and that are bibliographically coupled to it. We invite the scientific community to explore how Anne O’Tate can assist in analyzing biomedical literature, in a variety of use cases.</p>

    <title>Introduction</title>
    <p>PubMed is the most used, and arguably most advanced search engine, for retrieving biomedical literature [<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/</ext-link>, accessed May 15, 2020]. It has sophisticated automated features such as mapping queries to topics (Medical Subject Heading terms (MeSH)), imputing articles written by the same individual, spelling correction, and other tools that assist a wide variety of users who range from physicians and bench scientists to patients and their relatives. Despite this advanced user-focused engineering, the output of a PubMed query is a simple list of articles, and users have few options for summarizing or mining this output further.</p>
    <p>We developed Anne O’Tate to be an integrated, generic tool for summarization, drill-down and browsing of PubMed search results that accommodates a wide range of biomedical users and needs [<xref rid="pone.0248335.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Briefly, Anne O’Tate allows the user to carry out a PubMed query. After displaying the list of retrieved articles, the user can choose to visualize multiple aspects of the articles to the user, according to pre-defined categories such as the "most important" words found in titles or abstracts; topics; journals; authors; publication years; and affiliations. Clicking on a given item opens a new tab that displays all papers that contain that item. One can navigate by drilling down through the categories progressively, e.g., one can first restrict the articles according to author name and then restrict that subset by affiliation. Alternatively, one can expand small sets of articles to display the articles that are most closely related to the set as a whole.</p>
    <p>Over the past two decades, about 20 web-based tools have been created to assist in biomedical retrieval and mining (reviewed in [<xref rid="pone.0248335.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0248335.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]), many of which have ceased to be maintained or to be offered as free services. Some of these tools, e.g., PubReMiner [<xref rid="pone.0248335.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], allow users to sort articles by journal, author name, topic, etc., as does Anne O’Tate, and some, like Chilibot [<xref rid="pone.0248335.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], offer specialized functionalities such as specific relationships between proteins, genes, or keywords.</p>
    <p>However, Anne O’Tate remains unique both in supporting progressive drill-down, and in its range of advanced mining options. To date, the original Anne O’Tate paper [<xref rid="pone.0248335.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] has been cited 57 times according to Google Scholar (excluding self-citations) and 16 times in PubMed Central. In 2017, Engwall reviewed Anne O’Tate from the standpoint of users, especially librarians [<xref rid="pone.0248335.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. He critiqued its slow performance for large queries (which we have since fixed by moving to a different server and adding memory) and its bare-bones interface (which we deliberately prefer as a design choice), but concluded that “Anne O’Tate provides an excellent tool set for searching PubMed. Its data mining tools provide a variety of dynamic content analysis that can be of great use in identifying relevant search terms and bibliometrics.” [<xref rid="pone.0248335.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p>
    <p>As new user needs have become apparent, and as our own text-mining research programs have progressed, we have added a number of new facets to Anne O’Tate for summarizing and drilling-down the results of queries. We have also used Anne O’Tate as a platform to allow users to link PubMed queries to new, more specialized and advanced text processing programs. In this report, we describe the modifications and new functionalities that have been made since the initial report [<xref rid="pone.0248335.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], and give use cases to demonstrate its broad usefulness to the biomedical community.</p>

    <title>Results</title>
    <p>Suppose we enter the query [Alzheimer AND treatment] into the Anne O’Tate query interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0248335.g001">Fig 1</xref>). The query box is simplified compared to the PubMed home page but retains hotlinks so that the user can specify query Limits, and see and edit the exact query Details as processed by PubMed. The query is passed to PubMed, which processes the query and returns a list of the most recent 25,000 articles in reverse chronological order (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0248335.g002">Fig 2</xref>), querying PubMed [<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/</ext-link>, accessed November 17, 2020]. Each user session is given a unique job ID and is saved in the webserver for approximately six months; the user can return to the most recent processed query by entering the Job ID into a separate query box on the homepage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0248335.g001">Fig 1</xref>).</p>

      <title>Buttons for focused summarization, drill-down and analysis</title>
      <p>On the left side of the page displaying the list of articles, there are 12 hotlinked facets or “buttons” that the user can choose to mine the set of retrieved articles further (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0248335.g002">Fig 2</xref>). Those buttons which are <bold>new**</bold> or have been <bold>modified*</bold> since the previous report on Anne O’Tate are marked with asterisks respectively in the following paragraphs. Each button opens up a new tab that displays a processed result. This can be viewed or processed further. We will discuss each button in turn:</p>
      <sec id="sec004">
        <title>Important words*</title>
        <p>This computes the words that are significantly over-represented in the retrieval set (here, 42,500 articles on Alzheimer AND treatment) compared to all articles contained in the MEDLINE database. (Note that MEDLINE contains over 26 million publications curated from high-quality journals [<xref rid="pone.0248335.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], representing the majority of articles covered by the PubMed search engine.) They are ranked in order of their “importance”, i.e., the degree to which the word is over-represented [<xref rid="pone.0248335.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0248335.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The list can be further filtered using a button to restrict the terms to one or more semantic categories (taken from the UMLS [<xref rid="pone.0248335.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] as described in [<xref rid="pone.0248335.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]). Clicking on any one initiates a new query restricted to articles that mention that word in any field of the article’s PubMed metadata (title, abstract, or other metadata field). The important words are displayed in stemmed form [<xref rid="pone.0248335.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]–for example, the listed word “amyloid” in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0248335.g003">Fig 3</xref> comprises mentions of both “amyloid” and “amyloids”. Accordingly, clicking on the hotlinked term “amyloid” initiates a new, more restricted PubMed query: [Alzheimer AND treatment AND (amyloid [all fields] OR amyloids [all fields])], and the resulting list of 13,858 articles is displayed in a new tab (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0248335.g004">Fig 4</xref>). The list of Important Words together with their Importance scores [<xref rid="pone.0248335.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0248335.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] can also be exported as a CSV file for use in text mining.</p>

For the [Alzheimer AND treatment] query, we see phrases such as “Alzheimer disease”, “cognitive function”, and “oxidative stress” (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0248335.g005">Fig 5</xref>). Clicking on any phrase initiates a new restricted query [Alzheimer AND treatment AND “exact phrase” [tiab]] whose results are shown in a new tab. Note that, unlike Important Words, Important Phrases are not stemmed and they are mined only from titles and abstracts, not all fields of the PubMed record. The list of Important Phrases can also be exported as a CSV file for use in text mining.</p>

        <title>Authors</title>
        <p>This lists author names (defined as lastname, firstinitial) ranked by order of document frequency within the set of retrieved articles. This allows the user to rapidly filter the set of articles for those having a given name as co-author. No attempt is made here to disambiguate different individuals sharing the same name. However, we have disambiguated each author name on each PubMed article in a separate project, Author-ity [<xref rid="pone.0248335.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0248335.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The Author-ity 2009 release is linked to Anne O’Tate: Each author name on each article in the displayed list is hotlinked, and clicking on it opens a new tab which displays the predicted individual if that article is present in the Author-ity 2009 dataset. The most recent Author-ity beta release contains articles through 2019, and is available upon request, but has not yet been disseminated in final form publicly nor linked to Anne O’Tate.</p>

        <title>Author count**</title>
        <p>This button allows the user to choose articles that have a specified number or range of authors. One simply cannot query PubMed by author count, so this is a uniquely valuable feature that allows one to choose, for example, only those articles that are sole-authored, or those having more than five co-authors. Since prominent, senior investigators are the ones most likely to write reviews and editorials as sole-authored papers, a possible use case would be to identify likely senior scientists in a given field by carrying out a PubMed query on a given topic, then filtering first for sole-author articles, then for publication types Editorial and Review, and finally listing their author names ranked by frequency. Note that the Author Count simply counts the number of authors on each single paper, NOT the author names. If a paper is written by “John Smith and John Smith”, the author count on that paper is 2.</p>

      <sec id="sec009">
        <title>Affiliations</title>
        <p>This button displays chunks of text that are delimited by commas or periods in the Affiliation field of the PubMed record. For example, “University of Illinois” or “Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory” or “USA” are typical chunks that correspond to institutions, cities, or countries. Of all of the buttons employed in Anne O’Tate, this feature seems to confuse users the most [<xref rid="pone.0248335.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], since the chunks are displayed in order of document frequency, rather than in a hierarchy (e.g., institution–city–state–country). Because of the simple text processing that is carried out, different chunks may be semantically redundant (e.g., NY and New York are treated separately), and an entity followed by a comma is displayed separately than the same entity followed by a period. In short, the Affiliations chunks give a somewhat “Cubist” representation of the nonstandard ways that different articles may fill out the Affiliation field. Nevertheless, instead of employing high-powered Natural Language Processing to reorganize the display output, we have decided not to revise this button, because our colleague Vetle Torvik has already developed an elegant tool, MapAffil, that maps articles rather precisely to their geographical locations [<xref rid="pone.0248335.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0248335.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p>

The publication types are grouped into categories: <bold>Problematic</bold> publication types include Retracted Publication, Published Erratum, Retraction of Publication, and Corrected and Republished Article. <bold>Clinical Trials</bold> comprises 10 different types of articles that include the word “trial” (e.g., Pragmatic Clinical Trial) as well as Multicenter Study. <bold>Clinical Studies</bold> extends the list of Publication Types to include certain clinically important study designs (that are indexed by MeSH terms), such as cohort studies, case-control studies, cross-over studies, prospective and retrospective studies, etc. <bold>Article Types</bold> list all other articles (e.g., review, case report, practice guideline, etc.) in descending order of document frequency.

        <p>For the publication types and study designs shown in <xref rid="pone.0248335.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, we have implemented a probabilistic machine-learning based model that, given an article, will predict the probability that the article satisfies the criteria to be indexed as one of the multiple publication types and clinically important study designs. If an article is predicted to belong to one of these Publication Types but is not displayed in the left column, it is displayed on the right under “Additional Predicted” articles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0248335.g006">Fig 6</xref>).

        <p>The model will be described in detail in upcoming publications (Aaron Cohen et al, in preparation). Briefly, positive training sets were collected for each of 50 publication types or study designs by taking a random sample of PubMed articles that were indexed with that category (publication type [Publication Type] or study design [MeSH term: no expansion]). We represented each article as a multi-dimensional vector of features taken from title, abstract, and metadata; among the features were unigrams and bigrams and several text similarity representations (paragraph2vec [<xref rid="pone.0248335.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] and our own implicit text similarity representation [<xref rid="pone.0248335.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]). Then, each publication type or study design was summarized as a single vector by averaging the vectors of the individual articles in that category. The vector distances of a given PubMed article to each of the category vectors was used to predict the probability p that it belongs to one or more of the categories. To implement the model in the Publication Types button in Anne O’Tate, we set a different threshold value of p for each category (i.e., set at the threshold having a precision of 0.8 on a test set; if no threshold exhibits that precision, then it is set at the threshold having the highest F1 performance) and display articles under “Additional Predicted” if their predictive score p is over threshold but they lack NLM indexing for that category.</p>
        <p>In this fashion, we will supplement the current indexing of PubMed, allowing us to a) classify the most recently published articles which have not been indexed yet, b) articles which are not included in MEDLINE and so lack PT and MH indexing, and c) articles which failed to be indexed by MEDLINE indexers, perhaps because of their constraints (e.g., if an article can be indexed at more than one level of the MeSH hierarchy, manual indexers only apply the most specific MeSH term, whereas our model would classify the article as belonging to more than one level).</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec013">
        <title>Clustered by topic</title>
        <p>This runs an algorithm which partitions the set of retrieved articles into 12 different topical categories, as evenly as possible in terms of the number of articles in each category [<xref rid="pone.0248335.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. This can be useful in surveying the range of topics that are covered in the set, without being unduly influenced by the most common or the most rare.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec014">
        <title>Important MeSH pairs**</title>
        <p>This considers pairs of MeSH terms that co-occur on individual articles within the set of retrieved articles. For those pairs which co-occur on at least four articles within the set, it displays and ranks those pairs according to the odds ratio (i.e., the frequency within the set divided by frequency within MEDLINE as a whole). Important MeSH pairs often represent either frank relations (e.g., “Melatonin” is secreted by the “Pineal Gland”), semantically related MeSH terms (“Prion Diseases” vs. “Prions”), or implicit relationships (e.g., “Polysomnography” is used to diagnose “Sleep Apnea, Obstructive”). This may help to characterize the kinds of relations studied within a set of retrieved articles, and to drill down more precisely than if one were choosing individual topics.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec015">
        <title>Mine the gap!**</title>
        <p>This button runs a tool that identifies “gaps” within the set of retrieved articles, i.e., pairs of MeSH terms that do NOT co-occur on any article within the set, even though the individual MeSH terms occur in more than 10% of the set, such that &gt; 10 articles would be predicted to co-occur just by chance [<xref rid="pone.0248335.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Finding gaps in a literature may help to predict which new lines of research may be undertaken in the future. Generally, one only finds gaps satisfying those criteria in sets that contain at least several hundred articles. Clicking on the Mine the Gap! button starts a program that identifies and displays gaps, along with some of their features [<xref rid="pone.0248335.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. An optional button carries out Arrowsmith two-node searches [<xref rid="pone.0248335.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0248335.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] on each gap. This allows the user to view and analyze terms that may bridge the gap [<xref rid="pone.0248335.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], and calculates the pR ratio for each gap—this is a measure of the amount of implicit information shared by the pair of MeSH terms [<xref rid="pone.0248335.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], and (all other factors equal) gaps that share a lot of implicit information are more likely to be worth studying further. Because the tool and its underlying model are rather specialized and have been described elsewhere in detail, the reader is directed to its original publication for use cases [<xref rid="pone.0248335.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p>

      <title>Drill down and expansion of queries</title>
      <p>An important architectural feature of Anne O’Tate is that any new tab displaying a list of articles can be further processed according to any of the 12 buttons on the left side, facilitating easy, progressive, multi-faceted “drill-down” and “slice-and-dice” of the retrieval set as desired. For example, if one would like to find authors who have written recent review articles, one can do the topical query, then click on the Publication Types button, then choose the Review button, then click on the Year button, then choose a given year, and then click on the Authors button to display the list of author names whose articles satisfy all the chosen criteria.</p>
      <p>Conversely, any list of displayed articles which is smaller than 50 can be expanded to add new articles that are highly related to multiple articles in the original set. Clicking on the “expand” button at the top of the page runs an algorithm that employs the PubMed related articles algorithm [<xref rid="pone.0248335.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] in batch mode [<xref rid="pone.0248335.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] and adds related articles to the original set.</p>

      <title>The citation cloud**</title>
      <p>This tool provides a service that is not achieved directly through PubMed or any other public service, and should greatly enable the study of citations by the scientific community. Clicking on “Citations” next to any displayed article opens a new tab that allows the user to visualize the “citation cloud” around that article: That is, the set of articles cited by it; those which cite it; those which are co-cited with it; and those which are bibliographically coupled to it (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0248335.g007">Fig 7</xref>).</p>

      <p>To say that article A and B are co-cited means that A and B are both cited by one or more articles C<sub>i</sub> [<xref rid="pone.0248335.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Co-citation is a measure of similarity that is not based on textual or topical similarity. Note that the co-citation relationship is not fixed but can vary over time depending on how many newer articles cite both A and B. In contrast, bibliographically coupled (BC) articles cite some of the same articles in their reference lists [<xref rid="pone.0248335.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Bibliographic coupling provides another measure of similarity that is not directly based on textual or topical similarity, and has the distinct advantage that the BC relationship can be calculated for any two articles regardless of when they are published. As well, the BC relationship is stable and will not change over time. Citation, co-citation, and bibliographic coupling networks have been studied extensively, alone or combined with text-based similarity measures, for classifying articles and for large-scale mapping of science fields [<xref rid="pone.0248335.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].</p>
      <p>Clicking on any box (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0248335.g007">Fig 7</xref>) opens a new tab that displays the list of articles in the box. The Citation Cloud tool employs a large dataset of open citations, including iCite [<xref rid="pone.0248335.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] as well as other sources. The tool, and some of its typical use cases, are described in detail in a separate publication [<xref rid="pone.0248335.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].</p>

    <title>Discussion</title>
    <p>A plethora of tools have been developed to assist in searching the biomedical literature (reviewed in [<xref rid="pone.0248335.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0248335.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]), though few have been maintained as a free, public service continuously to the present. Although some of these tools do provide faceted summarization (e.g., listing author and journal names for a set of retrieved article) [<xref rid="pone.0248335.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], no other tool offers the unique architecture of Anne O’Tate to drill-down progressively according to any of a dozen dimensions, or to expand up again. Nor do any other search web servers serve as open platforms for adding new tools that greatly enhance the ability of users to analyze literature in a sophisticated manner, e.g., Mine the Gap! which identifies research gaps in the set of retrieved articles [<xref rid="pone.0248335.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], and the Citation Cloud which displays the entire local network of citations surrounding any given article [<xref rid="pone.0248335.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. We can offer tools that may be too specialized for the government to host, and can add or change functionalities in a more nimble fashion.</p>
    <p>Use cases for Anne O’Tate arise on a daily basis. For example, to find suggested reviewers for a given manuscript or proposal, one can enter a topical query (e.g., keywords taken from the title of the manuscript) and examine the list of authors who have published PubMed articles on that topic, especially those who have authored review articles. Similarly, to help decide which journal is best for submitting your own manuscript, one can enter a short description as a query and examine the list of journals which have published similar work. The Important Words and Important Phrases buttons may help to suggest new keywords for refining queries during high recall retrieval projects, such as accumulating evidence for a systematic review. Using the Publication Types button allows a user to track articles in a given set that have been retracted, and the Citation Cloud to trace articles that have subsequently cited them anyway [<xref rid="pone.0248335.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0248335.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Using the Year button, one can immediately see the trend of growth over time of a given topic. Using the Important MeSH Pairs, one can identify relationships that are specifically studied in the set of retrieved articles. Conversely, to identify relationships that have surprisingly NOT been studied at all [<xref rid="pone.0248335.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], one can use the Mine the Gap! button.</p>
    <p>We envision Anne O’Tate as a value-added layer on top of the PubMed search engine, but it worth emphasizing that many of its features are unique and allow users to perform queries that simply cannot be carried out in PubMed: a) For example, those studying biomedical innovation and discovery [e.g., <xref rid="pone.0248335.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] may wish to retrieve just those articles which have been authored by a single individual, or which have been authored by a large team, which can be readily found using our Author Count button but which is not possible to specify in PubMed. b) Those seeking to find articles that are topically relevant to a given article (e.g., in a high recall literature search as may be conducted in preparing a systematic review, in carrying out due diligence, or in properly citing related research when writing a scientific article) may not be satisfied with examining the PubMed related article list. They may also wish to retrieve the articles that are co-cited and bibliographically coupled to the given article. Again, this is not possible in PubMed but is readily found using our Citation Cloud button. c) The manual indexing of PubMed articles is limited by the fact that articles may not receive indexing for several months after publication, and that certain metadata such as publication types and MeSH terms are only assigned to the subset of articles indexed in MEDLINE. The Publication Types button classifies the list of retrieved articles according to 50 predicted publication types and study designs that goes a long way to overcoming these limitations. Other analytical features that are unique to Anne include Important Words, Important Phrases, clustered by topic, important MeSH pairs, and “Mine the Gap!”.</p>
    <p>It should be noted that a few months ago, PubMed changed its user interface and back end processing so that it is designed primarily for biomedical users of limited searching experience rather than librarians and data-literate searchers. In contrast, Anne O’Tate was designed to align with the previous version of PubMed. Entering a search into the new PubMed query box will give the same displayed results as a search into the Anne O’Tate query box, when visualizing the retrieved articles in reverse chronological order, though newly added PubMed options (e.g., showing Best Match) may cause a discrepancy in how the articles are ranked between the two tools.</p>
    <p>We expect that Anne O’Tate will continue to evolve over time. For example, the new updated Author-ity author name disambiguation dataset (through 2019) has not yet been officially released; when it has, we expect to link it to the articles retrieved through Anne O’Tate so that any author name on any article can be disambiguated. As well, note that Anne O’Tate currently only processes the most recent 25,000 articles from any query (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0248335.g001">Fig 1</xref>). In part, this is to avoid slow-downs that may be caused from users entering huge, poorly formed, or malicious queries, but another reason is that some downstream functions involve sending lists of PMIDs to PubMed and there is a limit to the number of PMIDs that can be entered as a query. If power users of Anne O’Tate require larger queries, we are willing to work with them to increase these limits. Future changes will be driven by our own ongoing research, and by suggestions and feedback from the biomedical and informatics communities.</p>

  <sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec019">
    <title>Materials and methods</title>
    <p>Many of the methods were discussed in detail in the original publications [<xref rid="pone.0248335.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0248335.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0248335.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. As one of the reviewers of Anne O’Tate pointed out [<xref rid="pone.0248335.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], in the past Anne O’Tate tended to be slow in processing large queries. We therefore devoted considerable effort to optimizing the data retrieval techniques used for passing information between entities Anne O’Tate and PubMed. PubMed only allows a certain number of articles to be fetched in a single request, even when using an API key (to validate us as a known user) and functions optimally on numbers less than that maximum.</p>
    <p>PubMed also only allows a certain number of PMIDs (as a list) to be sent within a single query dictated also by maximum HTTP request size. Internally within our server, the SQL database that holds an internal parsed representation of all PubMed records also has a practical limit within queries. To overcome these limits, batch processing was used when necessary, operating within each component’s limits within each batch yet still operating on the complete data set in whole, so that queries were processed smoothly by all components of the system. On two of the new buttons–- Year and Publication Types—the user-facing client-side uses AJAX requests which allow for the long running processes to be more elegantly and efficiently returned to the end user. The end user in these cases sees immediate results to the screen in real time, as the data are pulled from PubMed and/or collected locally. The previous version used timed browser refreshes, which check with the server at each refresh to see if the server-side function has completed. These refreshes sometimes appeared to ‘hang’ when the server-side processes died inadvertently, leaving the client to refresh infinitely. The errors causing server-side processes to die were fixed, resolving the ‘hanging’ problem.</p>
    <p>Some other changes made to the original implementation of Anne O’Tate were the elimination of the system-level kill commands being issued on the background Perl daemon processes, and more granular batch processing of the data pipeline (as mentioned above). These made user jobs more stable, faster and less likely to hang and resulted in fewer server crashes. The Architecture supporting Anne O’Tate is comprised of LINUX Ubuntu Server 18.04 LTS, Perl 5 version 26, Python 2.7 and 3.6 and MySql 5.7.</p>

    <p>Reviewer #1: The authors present the recent functional updates of Anne O’Tate, a web tool that enhances PubMed search engine to provide users with several additional functions to analyze the search results. This manuscript if published will help publicize the tool and serve as a tutorial for users. I only have a couple minor comments:</p>
    <p>1. Adding an introduction to MEDLINE and MeSH terms will help readers who are not familiar with these terms to understand better on the methodologies and output of the tool.</p>
    <p>2. Is the ranking of retrieved results taken into consideration (weighted differently) in summarizing on Topics, Authors, Affiliations etc.?</p>
    <p>Reviewer #2: The authors present a nice overview of their Anne O’Tate tool for querying the PubMed/Medline database. All functions were described with details, as well as the methods behind them. However, it is still not clear which functions are actually new and I miss good examples (use cases) for many of the functions proposed in the tool.</p>
    <p>Major review:</p>
    <p>- The authors implemented many functions in the tool, but I miss a real use case which could demonstrate that some (interesting) insights could only have been learned by using some of the proposed function and not with Pubmed itself or other available tool.</p>
    <p>- Indeed, I miss short discussion of other available tool, since many tools are indeed available, and how these compared to Anne O’Tate.</p>
    <p>Minor review:</p>
    <p>- The abstract does not mention what is new in the tool in comparison to its older versions.</p>
    <p>- The introduction does not cite how many visits (e.g., per day, or in total) the tool has had in the last years, nor whether it has been helpful to support the research from others (e.g., publications that cited Anne O'Tate). I also miss a short overview of what are the new features that will be describe in this new publication.</p>
    <p>- I am not sure whether some of functions are indeed helpful. For instance, by using raw frequency, the most popular surnames will always be on the top of the author list. It was also not clear to me whether the author count could be indeed helpful. I miss examples or use cases on how these functions might help the search.</p>
    <p>- Further, for the affiliation function, it is indeed confusing, since it is a mix of countries, cities, departments and universities. Further, “USA” appeared twice: “USA” and “USA.”</p>
    <p>- I found that the example of an earthquake in Puerto Rico was not suitable (off topic) since the manuscript so far had been showing the use case of treatment for Alzheimer disease.</p>
    <p>- “Mine the Gap!” is indeed a creative function, but top results were pairs that probably do not make sense together, e.g. “Caregivers::Mice, Transgenic”, even though some might be interesting, e.g., “Mice, Transgenic::Surveys and Questionnaires”. Again, a good use case showing its utility would help.</p>
    <p>Reviewer #3: This study presents the recent updates of Anne O’Tate, a web server provides additional analytics to PubMed query results. It introduces primary features such as important words, important phrases, topic clustering and many others. Altogether it provides rich information over the retrieved pmids. Please find my comments below.</p>
    <p>I evaluated the system using the query “covid-19 diabetes” and found a few issues:</p>
    <p>(1) The relevance of top k pmids is of concern. The top 5 retrieved PMIDs were 32634827, 32634717, 32634716, 32634459, 32633728. They do have the term ‘diabetes’, but diabetes is not the main topic, so I am not sure why they are ranked at the top. Comparatively, the top 5 pmids from both PubMed and LitCovid are much more relevant – the content is directly on diabetes. The paper claims that it passes the query to PubMed, but the retrieved results are significantly different. And this is not because of publication dates (the study uses the PubMed data up to May) as some of the top retrieved pmids from PubMed were published before May. The retrieved pmids are critical since all the features are based on them. I suspect there are some issues for query expansion and translation, before passing to PubMed.</p>
    <p>(2) The results of ‘Affiliations’ for this query is confusing. The top affiliations are a mixed of countries (e.g., China), cities (e.g., Milan), universities (e.g., Huazhong University of Science and Technology), and departments (e.g., Department of Medicine). So what exactly is an affiliation? Huazhong University of Science and Technology is a university in China. Why showing them separately? It would be much better to represent in a hierarchical manner. Post-processing the Affiliation field of PubMed records is essential. The current results are confusing and not informative.</p>
    <p>(3) The results of ‘Clustered by topic’ also have problems. When clicking the “Most recent articles” cluster, it shows an error message “Request-URI Too Long”. Also, the topic “AMP-Activated Protein Kinases” has only 1 pmid, why this is considered as a topic?</p>
    <p>(4) For the results of ‘important words’, somehow ‘PubMed’ is listed as an important word.</p>
    <p>In addition, while it introduces many features, there is no evaluation detailed in the paper. Some of the adopted methods were published a while ago; also the study cited a few methods that are in preparation without giving details. The effectiveness of these methods is unclear. The study should provide a substantial evaluation of the methods and compares with existing methods as baselines.</p>
    <p>Minor comments:</p>
    <p>(1) Please provide an API which supports batch processing.</p>
    <p>(2) What is the usage of the system, and how often does the system update?</p>
    <p>(3) For line 207-209, the font is different.</p>
    <p>Reviewer #4: This paper is a brief introduction to Anne O'Tate, which adds additional functionalities to PubMed and intends to help PubMed users.</p>
    <p>Although some interesting gadgets are proposed and implemented, this paper fails to show its effectiveness. PLOS One audience would like to read about how the new features would help them, both qualitatively and quantitatively compared with PubMed. Some features are truly unavailable on PubMed or other literature search engine, the authors did not quantify how the features can create results which are not available elsewhere.</p>
    <p>This paper could have been more persuasive with more evidences and statistics.</p>
    <p>Specifically I'd like to see the following additional information:</p>
    <p>1. Experiments on important words/phrases: from Anne O'tate web log, find some examples and show how Important scores make sense in determining importance of words/phrases.</p>
    <p>2. Due to no disambiguation on author names, how much of Author count is accurate.</p>
    <p>3. How effective 'Mine the Gap!' can find gaps and predict future research lines.</p>
    <p>4. In Citation Cloud, bibliographically coupled articles may include some cases which are not based on similarity, how often such cases happened and how to minimize their damage to the results.</p>

    <p>Response to Reviewers </p>
    <p>Reviewer #1: The authors present the recent functional updates of Anne O’Tate, a web tool that enhances PubMed search engine to provide users with several additional functions to analyze the search results. This manuscript if published will help publicize the tool and serve as a tutorial for users. I only have a couple minor comments:</p>
    <p>1. Adding an introduction to MEDLINE and MeSH terms will help readers who are not familiar with these terms to understand better on the methodologies and output of the tool.</p>
    <p> We have now added more information about what MeSH terms are and what MEDLINE is, including a reference. </p>
    <p>2. Is the ranking of retrieved results taken into consideration (weighted differently) in summarizing on Topics, Authors, Affiliations etc.?</p>
    <p> We have stated that in the initial query results, articles are displayed in reverse chronological order, not by predicted relevance. We also state for each button how articles are ranked – sometimes by frequency, sometimes by importance scores which have been defined in our previous publication. </p>
    <p>Reviewer #2: The authors present a nice overview of their Anne O’Tate tool for querying the PubMed/Medline database. All functions were described with details, as well as the methods behind them. However, it is still not clear which functions are actually new and I miss good examples (use cases) for many of the functions proposed in the tool.</p>
    <p>We have now added use cases to the paper and discussed them in some detail. Also, we have now clarified in Results that we have added one asterisk to indicate buttons that have been modified substantially since our previous publication, and two asterisks to indicate entirely new buttons. </p>
    <p>Major review:</p>
    <p>- The authors implemented many functions in the tool, but I miss a real use case which could demonstrate that some (interesting) insights could only have been learned by using some of the proposed function and not with Pubmed itself or other available tool.</p>
    <p>Done. </p>
    <p>- Indeed, I miss short discussion of other available tool, since many tools are indeed available, and how these compared to Anne O’Tate.</p>
    <p>In the Discussion we cite several reviews that have discussed similar tools in detail, including a comparison to Anne O’tate. </p>
    <p>Minor review:</p>
    <p>- The abstract does not mention what is new in the tool in comparison to its older versions.</p>
    <p>We have now extensively rewritten the abstract to include the original set of buttons and to emphasize specific new buttons that have been added. </p>
    <p>- The introduction does not cite how many visits (e.g., per day, or in total) the tool has had in the last years, nor whether it has been helpful to support the research from others (e.g., publications that cited Anne O'Tate). I also miss a short overview of what are the new features that will be describe in this new publication.</p>
    <p>We have now added text in the Introduction pointing out several groups who have reviewed Anne’s performance (before the recent improvements) and compared it to other existing tools. The added text to the abstract should provide the requested overview of new features up front. </p>
    <p>- I am not sure whether some of functions are indeed helpful. For instance, by using raw frequency, the most popular surnames will always be on the top of the author list. It was also not clear to me whether the author count could be indeed helpful. I miss examples or use cases on how these functions might help the search.</p>
    <p>We have now added a use case for the Author Count function, and added more description of the Author Names and how to use them. We are now displaying Authors by lastname firstinitial rather than simply by lastname, which will help with disambiguation somewhat. We also alert the reader that we have disambiguated authors on papers in a separate project which is being released publicly through 2019 (even if the most recent papers are not yet linked directly to Anne yet). </p>
    <p>- Further, for the affiliation function, it is indeed confusing, since it is a mix of countries, cities, departments and universities. Further, “USA” appeared twice: “USA” and “USA.”</p>
    <p>We have now added further text to describe how to use the Affiliation chunks. </p>
    <p>- I found that the example of an earthquake in Puerto Rico was not suitable (off topic) since the manuscript so far had been showing the use case of treatment for Alzheimer disease.</p>
    <p>We have now changed the example to be consistent. </p>
    <p>- “Mine the Gap!” is indeed a creative function, but top results were pairs that probably do not make sense together, e.g. “Caregivers::Mice, Transgenic”, even though some might be interesting, e.g., “Mice, Transgenic::Surveys and Questionnaires”. Again, a good use case showing its utility would help.</p>
    <p>We have now added more description and a use case here (although this tool is fully described in detail in a separate publication that is now a few years old).</p>
    <p>Reviewer #3: This study presents the recent updates of Anne O’Tate, a web server provides additional analytics to PubMed query results. It introduces primary features such as important words, important phrases, topic clustering and many others. Altogether it provides rich information over the retrieved pmids. Please find my comments below.</p>
    <p>I evaluated the system using the query “covid-19 diabetes” and found a few issues:</p>
    <p>(1) The relevance of top k pmids is of concern. The top 5 retrieved PMIDs were 32634827, 32634717, 32634716, 32634459, 32633728. They do have the term ‘diabetes’, but diabetes is not the main topic, so I am not sure why they are ranked at the top. Comparatively, the top 5 pmids from both PubMed and LitCovid are much more relevant – the content is directly on diabetes. The paper claims that it passes the query to PubMed, but the retrieved results are significantly different. And this is not because of publication dates (the study uses the PubMed data up to May) as some of the top retrieved pmids from PubMed were published before May. The retrieved pmids are critical since all the features are based on them. I suspect there are some issues for query expansion and translation, before passing to PubMed.</p>
    <p> As mentioned above and stated in the paper, the retrieved articles are listed in reverse chronological order, NOT in predicted relevance. But beyond that, it is important to note that PubMed changed their public interface in a very major way this spring, rather suddenly, so that their new interface works very differently than it had for many years. We built our tool to be compatible with the old PubMed interface, and our tool is not altered at all – however, it does not always coincide with the way that PubMed displays results, depending on user settings. We have now added text to the Discussion to alert users to the possible discrepancy – which does not affect the utility of our tool in any way. </p>
    <p>(2) The results of ‘Affiliations’ for this query is confusing. The top affiliations are a mixed of countries (e.g., China), cities (e.g., Milan), universities (e.g., Huazhong University of Science and Technology), and departments (e.g., Department of Medicine). So what exactly is an affiliation? Huazhong University of Science and Technology is a university in China. Why showing them separately? It would be much better to represent in a hierarchical manner. Post-processing the Affiliation field of PubMed records is essential. The current results are confusing and not informative.</p>
    <p> As mentioned above, we have now clarified that the method of displaying Affiliations by chunks may be initially confusing and give hints how to use the results. We also now cite the work of Torvik who has developed a geographical mapping tool for PubMed articles, which may be used as an alternative to our Affiliations button. </p>
    <p>(3) The results of ‘Clustered by topic’ also have problems. When clicking the “Most recent articles” cluster, it shows an error message “Request-URI Too Long”. Also, the topic “AMP-Activated Protein Kinases” has only 1 pmid, why this is considered as a topic?</p>
    <p> The reviewer chose a very unusual query – covid-19 is an extremely new topic so almost all of the papers lack MeSH terms which are employed for clustering. The set of papers actually clustered is thus quite small, and we always divide the set into 12 partitions, which explains why AMP-activated protein kinases was included. Normally, the bulk of retrieved articles are not extremely new, so the bulk of articles are clustered. As for the URI-error, this is a limitation of entering PMIDs into the PubMed query box, which we discussed in the Methods section, and we have now addressed the issue by fetching the records another way. </p>
    <p>(4) For the results of ‘important words’, somehow ‘PubMed’ is listed as an important word.</p>
    <p> This is not a bug. PubMed IS mentioned in many covid-19 articles, e.g., systematic reviews where they say that they searched PubMed for relevant articles. </p>
    <p>In addition, while it introduces many features, there is no evaluation detailed in the paper. Some of the adopted methods were published a while ago; also the study cited a few methods that are in preparation without giving details. The effectiveness of these methods is unclear. The study should provide a substantial evaluation of the methods and compares with existing methods as baselines.</p>
    <p> We have now given several additional use cases which should be persuasive that the tool has value for biomedical users. The algorithmic aspects are described and evaluated in detail in previous publications, and the newest ones (e.g. predicted publication types) will be described in detail in separate publications. We are confident that the results that we give are “correct” and transparent. However, the value of Anne O’Tate is not so much the uniqueness of the algorithms but the fact that they are packaged together into one seamless integrated platform. There is no comparable tool. </p>
    <p>Minor comments:</p>
    <p>(1) Please provide an API which supports batch processing.</p>
    <p> The reviewer is asking for us to build an extensive option which is not part of the system, and which no one has ever asked us to build before. I don’t think that we can do this as a condition of revising the paper, although if there is serious user interest we would consider it. </p>
    <p>(2) What is the usage of the system, and how often does the system update?</p>
    <p> We have not kept track of recent usage since we moved the web server to a new server machine and expanded memory. In any case, we do not expect that user load will be a significant factor in performance, even if the user base expands after this paper is published. The Anne “system” is a set of web-based tools and does not have a formal release (unlike software). The updates to the system are described in this paper, so you could think of this paper as describing Anne 2.0. </p>
    <p>(3) For line 207-209, the font is different.</p>
    <p> Fixed. </p>
    <p>Reviewer #4: This paper is a brief introduction to Anne O'Tate, which adds additional functionalities to PubMed and intends to help PubMed users.</p>
    <p>Although some interesting gadgets are proposed and implemented, this paper fails to show its effectiveness. PLOS One audience would like to read about how the new features would help them, both qualitatively and quantitatively compared with PubMed. Some features are truly unavailable on PubMed or other literature search engine, the authors did not quantify how the features can create results which are not available elsewhere.</p>
    <p>This paper could have been more persuasive with more evidences and statistics.</p>
    <p>Specifically I'd like to see the following additional information:</p>
    <p>1. Experiments on important words/phrases: from Anne O'tate web log, find some examples and show how Important scores make sense in determining importance of words/phrases.</p>
    <p> We have previously described Important Words in two papers and it is not one of the new functionalities emphasized in the current paper (although we have updated its display to a minor extent). Important words and phrases is shown in figures 4 and 5 for a specific search (Alzheimer and treatment) where the sense of the displayed words and phrases is hopefully self-evident. </p>
    <p>2. Due to no disambiguation on author names, how much of Author count is accurate.</p>
    <p> We have now clarified that the Author Count simply counts the number of authors on each single paper, NOT the author names. If a paper is written by “John Smith and John Smith”, the author count on that paper is 2. </p>
    <p>3. How effective 'Mine the Gap!' can find gaps and predict future research lines.</p>
    <p> This is cited in our previous publication and discussed there. </p>
    <p>4. In Citation Cloud, bibliographically coupled articles may include some cases which are not based on similarity, how often such cases happened and how to minimize their damage to the results.</p>
    <p> We have now clarified that bibliographically coupled (BC) articles are related in respect to partially shared reference lists , and very well may not be textually similar. This is actually a good thing, since BC and text similarity are two complementary types of similarity. We have now added citations to people who have discussed and studied this before.</p>

You may also include additional comments for the author, including concerns about dual publication, research ethics, or publication ethics. (Please upload your review as an attachment if it exceeds 20,000 characters)</p>
    <p>Reviewer #1: The authors have addressed my concerns from the initial review. I recommend acceptance of the manuscript.</p>
    <p>Reviewer #2: One of the items in the major review was not addressed properly. The authors did not provide a proper use case in the discussion, but just hypotetical examples of how the tool could potentially be used in this or that situation. I meant a proper biomedical use case, e.g., looking for a treatment for disease X, and the various steps of how the searching was done in the tool and new knowledge has been found, etc. And that when doing such search in a similar way in PubMed, proving that no similar results could be obtained.</p>
    <p>Reviewer #3: My comments have been addressed properly. Thanks to the authors for the efforts. Having an API would be useful for potential users to retrieve results systematically.</p>
    <p>Reviewer #4: This version provides numerous additional information. A user case is added to help understand how to use this web site and interpret the results. An impressive addition to the publication types certainly increases the value of the service.</p>
    <p>The following are some issues with the draft:</p>
    <p>1. The draft mentioned machine-learning based model to predict publication type. Please provide some details about the model.</p>
    <p>2. As pointed by other reviewers, when affiliation button was tested, most results showed similar mixture of country, city, institution, department names. A user of this button expects to see a list of entities at the same level, for example, a list of countries or a list of universities or institutions. For the query ‘Alzheimer AND treatment’, affiliation button retrieves more than 1, 000 pages of results. Without a search function, it is hard for the users to find the one they are interested in. Current design confused users and it needs more work to be useful.</p>
    <p>3. Topic button simply uses MeSH terms to represent topic classification. Although a unified topic system is convenient and consistent, it is very small granularity. As a result, the same Alzheimer query returns more than 490 pages of results. Again, without a search function, the results are simply overwhelming for users.</p>
    <p>4. Figure 2 displays some unicode characters incorrectly, although the website shows them correctly. Please update this figure.</p>

    <p>Reviewer #2: One of the items in the major review was not addressed properly. The authors did not provide a proper use case in the discussion, but just hypotetical examples of how the tool could potentially be used in this or that situation. I meant a proper biomedical use case, e.g., looking for a treatment for disease X, and the various steps of how the searching was done in the tool and new knowledge has been found, etc. And that when doing such search in a similar way in PubMed, proving that no similar results could be obtained.</p>
    <p> Thank you for this comment. In the revised version, we now added text to the Discussion to indicate more clearly three practical use cases that would be easy in Anne but impossible in PubMed. Anne O’Tate is designed to be extremely broad in adding value for a wide range of use cases; many of our features do not exist in PubMed and could not be conducted via PubMed searches. For example, our progressive drill-down architecture, our expand button, Important Words, Important Phrases, author count, predicted publication types, clustered by topic, important MeSH pairs, Mine the Gap! and Citation Cloud are all unique to Anne. We already indicated how these would be used and why, in the Results section. </p>
    <p>Reviewer #4: This version provides numerous additional information. A user case is added to help understand how to use this web site and interpret the results. An impressive addition to the publication types certainly increases the value of the service.</p>
    <p>The following are some issues with the draft:</p>
    <p>1. The draft mentioned machine-learning based model to predict publication type. Please provide some details about the model.</p>
    <p> In the revised version, we have now added the following description of the model: Briefly, positive training sets were collected for each of 50 publication types or study designs by taking a random sample of PubMed articles that were indexed with that category (publication type [Publication Type] or study design [MeSH term: no expansion]). We represented each article as a multi-dimensional vector of features taken from title, abstract, and metadata; among the features were unigrams and bigrams and several text similarity representations (paragraph2vec and our own implicit text similarity representation). Then, each publication type or study design was summarized as a single vector by averaging the vectors of the individual articles in that category. The vector distances of a given PubMed article to each of the category vectors was used to predict the probability p that it belongs to one or more of the categories. To implement the model in the Publication Types button in Anne O’Tate, we set a different threshold value of p for each category (having the highest F1 performance on a test set) and display articles under “Additional Predicted” if their predictive score p is over threshold but they lack NLM indexing for that category. </p>
    <p>2. As pointed by other reviewers, when affiliation button was tested, most results showed similar mixture of country, city, institution, department names. A user of this button expects to see a list of entities at the same level, for example, a list of countries or a list of universities or institutions. For the query ‘Alzheimer AND treatment’, affiliation button retrieves more than 1, 000 pages of results. Without a search function, it is hard for the users to find the one they are interested in. Current design confused users and it needs more work to be useful.</p>
    <p> We understand that the reviewer would like to see an entirely different architecture for the Affiliations button. However, this button is not newly described in the present paper. Rather, it has been implemented for 12 or so years and was described in our previous paper. We have neither had any user complaints nor have encountered use cases where we needed to re-engineer this button. We will take the reviewer’s advice to heart for future evolution of the system, but we do not feel that changing the Affiliations button should be a precondition for publishing the present paper.</p>
    <p>3. Topic button simply uses MeSH terms to represent topic classification. Although a unified topic system is convenient and consistent, it is very small granularity. As a result, the same Alzheimer query returns more than 490 pages of results. Again, without a search function, the results are simply overwhelming for users.</p>
    <p> In the revised version, we have now clarified that because the MeSH terms are listed in order of document frequency, and because the top twenty terms are found on the first page, the most prevalent terms are immediately visible to the user, though one can scroll to later pages to view the less prevalent terms if desired. Most of the 490 pages represents a long tail of MeSH terms found in only one article, hence are not very important at all. </p>
    <p>4. Figure 2 displays some unicode characters incorrectly, although the website shows them correctly. Please update this figure.</p>
    <p> The reviewer has sharp eyes! We now made a new figure 2 that does not show incorrect Unicode characters. (By the way, the Unicode mapping is a rather subtle issue. The retrieval of articles from PubMed does handle Unicode characters, but a few of the downstream functions involve mapping author names to normalized ascii formats (i.e., in the Authors button and in links out to the Author-ity tool) and so ascii is still displayed in a few places deep within Anne O’Tate. Users can manually replace the ascii characters with Unicode but that is not necessary for proper functioning.)</p>

    <p>Reviewer #1: The authors have addressed my concerns. I don’t have further concerns/comments about the revised manuscript.</p>
    <p>Reviewer #2: Regarding my request for a proper use case, it hasn't been addressed by the authors. They simply listed three hypothetical, high-level situations, but they did not design a proper use case. The tool has been available since more than 10 years, but they could not prove, by citing a reference, that it has been used by other research groups to support solving any particular task. This was a request from me that the authors did not address. Therefore, I think that propely describing a use case which (somehow) prove the utility of the the tool is crucial to be sure that this new version is really necessary and that the task could not be solved using other existing tools.</p>
    <p>Reviewer #3: My primary comments have been addressed. Thanks for the dedicated efforts. I do not have further comments.</p>
    <p>Reviewer #4: Most issues have been addressed or explained.</p>
    <p>I will make a small recommendation to the topic classification functionality. Currently the articles from different topics are displayed without the number of articles, while other buttons (Journals, pub types) display number of articles. It's good information for the user to know when they search.</p>
    <p>I understand it may take time to implement but I really like to have this feature as a user.</p>

    <p>Dear Dr. Islamaj,</p>
    <p>Thank you for allowing me to revise the paper a third time. I hope that you will be able to make a decision without returning it for further reviews. I have made a good faith effort to satisfy the concerns of both reviewers. </p>
    <p>Reviewer #4: Most issues have been addressed or explained.</p>
    <p>I will make a small recommendation to the topic classification functionality. Currently the articles from different topics are displayed without the number of articles, while other buttons (Journals, pub types) display number of articles. It's good information for the user to know when they search.</p>
    <p>I understand it may take time to implement but I really like to have this feature as a user.</p>
    <p> Thank you for your suggestion. We have now implemented this functionality as requested by the reviewer. </p>
    <p>Reviewer #2: Regarding my request for a proper use case, it hasn't been addressed by the authors. They simply listed three hypothetical, high-level situations, but they did not design a proper use case. The tool has been available since more than 10 years, but they could not prove, by citing a reference, that it has been used by other research groups to support solving any particular task. This was a request from me that the authors did not address. Therefore, I think that properly describing a use case which (somehow) prove the utility of the tool is crucial to be sure that this new version is really necessary and that the task could not be solved using other existing tools.</p>
    <p> As much as we would like to satisfy the reviewer, I think there is some misunderstandings that need to be clarified. </p>
    <p>The second reviewer feels, in this and the previous review, that we should prove that Anne O’Tate can find biomedical information which cannot be found directly through PubMed searches alone (e.g. new treatments for a given disease) -- and that other biomedical researchers have used and cited Anne as having found such unique information. However, the original Anne O’Tate paper never made such claims, nor is that the intent of the original tool. The original tool was aimed at summarization, drill-down and mining of sets of articles retrieved from PubMed. It is NOT a literature-based discovery tool like Arrowsmith. Therefore, the type of documentation that the reviewer is asking for is not appropriate. </p>
    <p>In the new version of Anne O’Tate that we present in the submitted manuscript, we do indeed introduce several NEW kinds of functionalities, that do find information that cannot be retrieved directly through PubMed searches (for example, author count, predicted publication types, and co-citations and bibliographically coupled articles in the citation cloud). Each of these is described and documented with specific examples. However, since these are brand-new and just now being reported, one cannot expect that these new functions have yet been used or cited by other research groups. Also, since these new functions are retrieving bibliographic rather than biomedical information, they are not likely to produce new knowledge such as new suggested treatments. (Though millions of people use search engines such as PubMed or Google Scholar to assist them, I do not believe that anyone has cited the use of these search engines in their research papers.)</p>
    <p>In the final version of this ms., we DID cite references to show that others have reviewed and inspected Anne O’Tate, both from the technical as well as user points of view, and found it to have value for people carrying out literature searches: </p>
    <p>“However, Anne O’Tate remains unique both in supporting progressive drill-down, and in its range of advanced mining options. To date, the original Anne O’Tate paper [1] has been cited 57 times according to Google Scholar (excluding self-citations) and 16 times in PubMed Central. In 2017, Engwall reviewed Anne O’Tate from the standpoint of users, especially librarians [8]. He critiqued its slow performance for large queries (which we have since fixed by moving to a different server and adding memory) and its bare-bones interface (which we deliberately prefer as a design choice), but concluded that “Anne O’Tate provides an excellent tool set for searching PubMed. Its data mining tools provide a variety of dynamic content analysis that can be of great use in identifying relevant search terms and bibliometrics.” [8]. </p>
    <p>I hope that this good-faith effort will suffice for publishing this manuscript.</p>
