    <abstract id="Abs1">
      <p id="Par1">Seroprevalence studies provide useful information about the proportion of the population either vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2, previously infected with the virus, or both. Numerous studies have been conducted in the United States, but differ substantially by dates of enrollment, target population, geographic location, age distribution, and assays used. This can make it challenging to identify and synthesize available seroprevalence data by geographic region or to compare infection-induced versus combined infection- and vaccination-induced seroprevalence. To facilitate public access and understanding, the National Institutes of Health and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention developed the COVID-19 Seroprevalence Studies Hub (COVID-19 SeroHub, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://covid19serohub.nih.gov/">https://covid19serohub.nih.gov/</ext-link>), a data repository in which seroprevalence studies are systematically identified, extracted using a standard format, and summarized through an interactive interface. Within COVID-19 SeroHub, users can explore and download data from 178 studies as of September 1, 2022. Tools allow users to filter results and visualize trends over time, geography, population, age, and antigen target. Because COVID-19 remains an ongoing pandemic, we will continue to identify and include future studies.</p>

    <title>Background &amp; Summary</title>
    <p id="Par3">Policymakers, researchers, and the general public must be able to track the proportion of the population infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup> and the proportion vaccinated. Seroprevalence studies that detect the presence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in people’s sera<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup> provide estimates of the proportion of the population previously infected, vaccinated, or both and may also help to project the proportion of the U.S. population susceptible to the virus.</p>
    <p id="Par4">In response to this need, researchers have conducted numerous SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence studies. However, such studies vary widely in design. Some national studies used residual clinical laboratory specimens<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup> or blood donor specimens<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup> and performed serial measurements over many months. Other studies had a single sample collection period and recruited from specific populations such as health care workers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup> or residents of specific geographic areas such as states or counties<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Some studies used convenience sampling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>, whereas more representative studies used defined sampling frames<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Likewise, a wide variety of serology assays were used, detecting a range of antibody isotypes and antigen targets (<italic>e.g</italic>., spike or nucleocapsid)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Some studies release their results as part of a single pre-print or peer-reviewed publication. Others<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup> release data serially on publicly available websites that can be accessed using Application Programming Interfaces (API).</p>
    <p id="Par5">Several prior efforts have aimed to summarize the SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence literature, including traditional meta-analysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. However, the fast pace of data release in an ongoing pandemic means that real-time updates are needed to complement traditional meta-analyses. One effort, Serotracker.com<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup> tracks seroprevalence studies conducted around the world and presents results in an online dashboard. However, these efforts do not allow users to easily visualize how seroprevalence varies by antigen target, calendar time, or geography. Within the United States, infection and vaccination rates substantially differ by geographic region, and it is important to allow users to examine these differences by displaying results at state and local levels.</p>
    <p id="Par6">To meet this need, the US National Cancer Institute (NCI), the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) (both part of the National Institutes of Health), and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) developed the COVID-19 Seroprevalence Studies Hub data repository, or COVID-19 SeroHub (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://covid19serohub.nih.gov/">https://covid19serohub.nih.gov/</ext-link>). The COVID-19 SeroHub team systematically identifies published and ongoing SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence studies in the United States (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) and extracts a standardized set of data elements from identified studies. Seroprevalence results from each extracted study are then presented as points on a scatter plot (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) allowing users to visualize US seroprevalence estimates over time, geography, age, sampled population, serology test characteristics, age, sex, race/ethnicity, and other variables. Users can also find studies conducted in specific states on a map (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>), and each study has an individual page with more detailed information and a live reference link (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). As of September 1, 2022, COVID-19 SeroHub includes 35,823 seroprevalence results from 178 extracted studies. Extracted data can also be downloaded as a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet via the Seroprevalence Data tab or can be assessed by API. COVID-19 SeroHub has a digital object identifier (DOI) of (10.17917/3pz5-5m44)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. To help users keep track of the data posted on SeroHub, data available for download is tagged with a version number (currently 3.1.0) and posting date.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Flow chart indicating how studies were identified for inclusion in COVID-19 SeroHub.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="41597_2022_1830_Fig1_HTML" id="d32e468"/></fig><fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Screenshot of the Interactive Seroprevalence Tool in COVID-19 SeroHub that allows users to view seroprevalence results by calendar time, geography, antigen target, and other factors.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="41597_2022_1830_Fig2_HTML" id="d32e477"/></fig><fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>Screenshot of the Studies Map tool in COVID-19 SeroHub that allows users to view the geographic location of US seroprevalence studies.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="41597_2022_1830_Fig3_HTML" id="d32e486"/></fig><fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><p>Screenshot of a sample individual study page in COVID-19 SeroHub.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="41597_2022_1830_Fig4_HTML" id="d32e495"/></fig></p>
    <p id="Par7">COVID-19 SeroHub is intended to allow monitoring of the spread of COVID-19 across the country, inform future studies and public health decisions, and identify scientific gaps and disparities. Over the past year, SeroHub has been visited more than 1 million times and has helped inform governmental and policy discussions regarding the pandemic. Moving forward, we plan to continue to identify studies, extract their information, and update regularly as long as the COVID-19 pandemic continues.</p>

    <p id="Par9">Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> provides a flow chart indicating how the more than 1500 studies were identified and then evaluated for inclusion in COVID-19 SeroHub.</p>
    <p id="Par10">Upon identification, studies are reviewed independently by at least two reviewers to determine if the study meets inclusion criteria: includes novel seroprevalence data; was conducted in the United States; describes the population tested; and describes the serology test(s), including test name(s), the antigen target(s) (<italic>e.g</italic>., spike or nucleocapsid proteins), test type, and antibody isotype(s) (<italic>e.g</italic>., IgG, IgM, panIg) detected. The options available for each of these fields are listed in the Data Records section of this manuscript. Exclusion criteria include outbreak investigations (e.g., single site, transmission chain), studies conducted on known or suspected SARS-CoV-2 infected populations, studies describing assay development or validation, or studies aiming to understand immune responses to coronavirus infection.</p>
    <p id="Par11">Studies meeting these inclusion criteria are extracted using a standardized data template with predefined fields (see a list of fields in the Data Records section below) by at least two extractors. Consensus is required for each field. Data elements were adapted and expanded from a prior effort developed by the NIAID Centers of Excellence for Influenza Research and Response (CEIRR) network<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. At least two infectious disease epidemiologists conduct the second level of review. For studies that appeared suitable, but failed to include key information, such as serology test used, attempts are made to obtain this information from study investigators. Approved studies are then posted to COVID-19 SeroHub. Data from preprints are reviewed upon publication in peer-reviewed journals and subsequent data releases from extracted studies are also added when available.</p>
    <p id="Par12">Seroprevalence data in the COVID-19 SeroHub are aggregated and we do not collect individual level results. Most included seroprevalence data were extracted from study publications or preprints. However, staff are flexible and other mechanisms are possible. For example, seroprevalence data from studies with many collection periods and study locations, such as the CDC Blood Donor and Commercial Laboratory Seroprevalence Surveys<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/geographic-seroprevalence-surveys.html">https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/geographic-seroprevalence-surveys.html</ext-link>), were obtained directly from investigators or imported via API. To help users keep track of the data posted on SeroHub, data available for download is tagged with a version number (currently 3.1.0) and posting date.</p>
    <sec id="Sec3">
      <title>Data storage and integration</title>
      <p id="Par13">Once extracted, the COVID-19 SeroHub system programmatically validates extracted data against the data template by comparing the JSON schema expected values to the extracted values. Validated study and collection and report metadata are stored as structured JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) files on Amazon Web Services (AWS) S3 buckets. JSON files are the standard data exchange format for an Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL) pipeline built using AWS Lambda (Python). JSON data are structured for search and then indexed in Elasticsearch.</p>

      <title>Data visualization</title>
      <p id="Par14">Currently, data visualizations include an Interactive Seroprevalence scatter plot (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>), a Studies Map (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>), Individual Study Pages (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>), a Study Information Data Table, and a Seroprevalence Data Table that includes extracted seroprevalence results from each study. Source data for each visualization is keyword searchable and filterable; therefore, users can create custom searches for seroprevalence study data. For searches, the secure API queries Elasticsearch, a fuzzy full-text keyword search engine. This ETL process standardizes unstructured data for machine-readable access through APIs. For visualizations, the User Interface (UI) calls APIs to produce data visualizations and search results on COVID-19 SeroHub instantaneously.</p>
      <p id="Par15">The default view is the Interactive Seroprevalence Tool (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>), a scatterplot where calendar time is plotted on the x-axis and seroprevalence on the y-axis. The scatterplot contains all extracted seroprevalence results plotted by the midpoint of the collection period for each sample. Users can choose which results to display. Filters are dynamically deployed based upon available data. For example, users can decide to examine seroprevalence results in a particular state by calendar time, by age, by sex, by race/ethnicity, among specific populations (general population, healthcare setting, long-term care facilities, other occupations, pregnant people, military setting), by test characteristics such as spike (which detects positive results due to infection or vaccine), nucleocapsid (which detects positive results most likely due to infection), or by a combination of these factors.

    <p id="Par71">As described in Methods, we have included several procedures to ensure that we are accurately importing study data into COVID-19 SeroHub. Before posting, extracted study information is reviewed by several members of the extraction team. Then, these data undergo a second-level review by at least two infectious disease epidemiologists to ensure consistency across studies. All structured data are computationally validated against a JSON standardized data template before incorporation into COVID-19 SeroHub. Once posted, results are periodically checked for accuracy and completeness by the entire team and automated tests. We also incorporate feedback from study authors about the extraction of their studies and comments from the public.</p>

  <sec id="Sec50">
    <title>Usage Notes</title>
    <p id="Par72">COVID-19 SeroHub is intended to be used by researchers, policymakers, state and local public health officials, and the public to monitor the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infections and COVID-19 vaccinations across the country, facilitate evidence-based decision making, inform future studies, and identify scientific gaps and disparities. Demands for seroprevalence data continue to increase as the database grows and the pandemic evolves. For example, COVID-19 seroprevalence data informed discussion by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices of vaccine recommendations for children aged 5–11 years (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/meetings/slides-2021-11-2-3.html">https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/meetings/slides-2021-11-2-3.html</ext-link>).</p>
    <p id="Par73">By extracting and presenting seroprevalence data in a standard format, COVID-19 SeroHub helps users to efficiently review numerous studies and identify gaps. COVID-19 SeroHub also helps users to monitor the spread of SARS-CoV-2 over time by population and geographic area, important for identifying the populations and regions most vulnerable to the virus, such as locations where vaccination rates are low. Users can search through extracted studies using keywords as well as obtain extracted data by download or API. COVID-19 SeroHub does not have any restrictions on who can use or download data from the site. However, all data in COVID-19 SeroHub are stored as aggregate datapoints, and thus there is no risk to accidental release of individual or private data.</p>
    <p id="Par74">A strength of COVID-19 SeroHub is that studies are identified by comprehensive literature searches and from a wide variety of sources, including peer-reviewed publications, pre-prints, and government reports. COVID-19 SeroHub is also updated weekly and includes an ever-expanding number of studies and seroprevalence estimates. A flexible architecture allows the inclusion of both single data releases and biweekly or monthly data releases from ongoing studies, such as the large CDC nationwide commercial laboratory<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup> and blood donor studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Tools are provided that allow users to easily find specific studies and populations of interest, such as diabetes patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>, pregnant people<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>, crew on a fishing boat<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>, first responders<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>, and health care providers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Standard data extraction and presentation protocols allow users to compare data across many studies. Seroprevalence estimates are reported verbatim from study publications allowing re-use of the data without concern that results may have been transformed from the original publication or data release. Studies can be compared across key fields including study population, age, sampling methodology, test performance and characteristics, antigen target, and other fields. Visualization tools allow users to examine the spread of the virus in different populations and geographic areas by calendar time. COVID-19 SeroHub’s tools allow users to view seroprevalence results by whether participants were tested for spike or nucleocapsid antibodies. Because vaccinations in the United States are directed against the spike component of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, this allows the user to examine results restricted to infection-induced seropositivity or to view results that include vaccine-induced seropositivity.</p>
    <p id="Par75">COVID-19 SeroHub has several limitations. It is manually curated, and as such, there is a lag between study availability and inclusion in COVID-19 SeroHub. The availability of APIs for some studies have greatly facilitated quick incorporation of study data into SeroHub. More widespread use of these and other tools for data sharing would be useful in the future. Extracting a standard set of data elements facilitates comparisons across studies; however, these are often a subset of the data available in individual studies. Although we include abstracts on each individual study page and provide a powerful search function, users interested in particular topics or sub-populations would benefit by consulting the original publications. To facilitate such explorations, individual study pages include links to the associated publications. Additionally, studies included in COVID-19 SeroHub have a range of study designs and sample sizes. Individual studies use many different sampling strategies and serology tests, each with distinct performance characteristics. For example, tests vary in their sensitivity and specificity, as well as in their ability to detect antibody waning over time<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. Due to the complexity of comparing across studies, variation in how users wish to use the data, and importance of identifying studies conducted in various populations and geographic areas, we decided not to formally evaluate study quality in COVID-19 SeroHub. Substantial differences between studies speak to the importance of SeroHub and its ability to help users to identify and compare studies with different strengths and weaknesses that have been conducted at the same time in the same geographic area.</p>
    <p id="Par76">Although there is an urgent public health need for timely seroprevalence data, there are substantial lags in data availability. As of September 1, 2022, SeroHub includes 13,300 (37.5%) seroprevalence estimates from studies conducted in 2020, 21,400 60.3%) from studies conducted in 2021, and just 800 (2.3%) seroprevalence estimates from studies conducted in 2022. Although 156 studies provided data for 2020, only 21 studies provided data for 2021, with most results from the large ongoing CDC Blood Donor and Commercial Laboratory Seroprevalence Surveys<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Only one study includes data from 2022<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup> reflecting the Omicron variant surge in the US, with the most recent data for May-June 2022<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. Even with the emergence of pre-print servers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>, most seroprevalence results are released months after sample collection. Sustained efforts to increase the timeliness of data release are thus needed. Other fields, such as genomics, have moved to models where sequence data are rapidly deposited into established databases and analyzed in real-time. We believe that this is an important goal for serology studies as well and note that the infrastructure developed for COVID-19 SeroHub could facilitate the rapid release of seroprevalence data. For example, studies could submit their information while in the field and then release their data systematically to the public via API. Although perhaps too late for SARS-Cov-2, such infrastructure efforts should be considered as part of the response to future pandemics.</p>
    <p id="Par77">Additionally, despite the known importance of representative surveillance in the United States, we have not identified any truly nationally representative seroprevalence studies. Only a few representative studies have been conducted at either a state-wide or county-wide level and these studies were conducted early in the pandemic in 2020<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. Most studies have recruited volunteer participants or special populations such as blood donors or dialysis patients, raising concerns about the representativeness of conducted studies. A wealth of data indicates that the impact of SARS-CoV-2 varies substantially by key demographic factors such as age and race/ethnicity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. Yet, there is considerable variability in how individual studies have categorized these important demographic variables. This lack of standardization challenges efforts to harmonize and present these important data. Seroprevalence also likely varies by socio-economic status, yet unfortunately few studies collected information about education or income.</p>
    <p id="Par78">Two years into the pandemic, seroprevalence studies continue to provide important insights into the spread of SARS-CoV-2 through the population as well as vaccination. For this reason, we expect to incorporate studies and add functionality to COVID-19 SeroHub well into the future.</p>

    <p>COVID-19 SeroHub uses custom code to store manually extracted data without processing. As described above, these data are downloadable by users via spreadsheet or API. Tools for visualizing extracted data were produced using HTML 5.0 and ECMAScript/Javascript and tested with Chrome Browser 90.x, Safari 14.x, and Firefox 88.x. The Apache eCharts 5.1.1 library was used to produce the Studies Map, Interactive Seroprevalence Tool, and Individual Study Page data visualizations. API code was produced using the Python version 3.8 on AWS Lambda, AWS API Gateway, and Elasticsearch 7.9.</p>
    <p>All code and cloud resources are secured in Federal Information Security Modernization Act (FISMA) compliant environments.</p>
