      <title>Abstract</title>
      <p>Advances in transcriptomic and translatomic techniques enable in-depth studies of RNA activity profiles and RNA-based regulatory mechanisms. Ribosomal RNA (rRNA) sequences are highly abundant among cellular RNA, but if the target sequences do not include polyadenylation, these cannot be easily removed in library preparation, requiring their post-hoc removal with computational techniques to accelerate and improve downstream analyses. Here, we describe <italic toggle="yes">RiboDetector</italic>, a novel software based on a Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) neural network, which rapidly and accurately identifies rRNA reads from transcriptomic, metagenomic, metatranscriptomic, noncoding RNA, and ribosome profiling sequence data. Compared with state-of-the-art approaches, <italic toggle="yes">RiboDetector</italic> produced at least six times fewer misclassifications on the benchmark datasets. Importantly, the few false positives of <italic toggle="yes">RiboDetector</italic> were not enriched in certain Gene Ontology (GO) terms, suggesting a low bias for downstream functional profiling. <italic toggle="yes">RiboDetector</italic> also demonstrated a remarkable generalizability for detecting novel rRNA sequences that are divergent from the training data with sequence identities of &lt;90%. On a personal computer, <italic toggle="yes">RiboDetector</italic> processed 40M reads in less than 6 min, which was ∼50 times faster in GPU mode and ∼15 times in CPU mode than other methods. <italic toggle="yes">RiboDetector</italic> is available under a GPL v3.0 license at <ext-link xlink:href="https://github.com/hzi-bifo/RiboDetector" ext-link-type="uri">https://github.com/hzi-bifo/RiboDetector</ext-link>.</p>

    <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
    <p>rRNA is the predominant form of RNA in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1–6</xref>). The RNA content in a prokaryotic or an eukaryotic cell consists of 80–90% rRNA, 10–15% transfer RNA (tRNA) and 3–7% messenger RNA (mRNA) and regulatory ncRNA (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1–6</xref>). RNA sequencing (RNAseq) of microbial communities and prokaryotic isolates is widely used for activity profiling in microbiology (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7–9</xref>). Sequencing of functional non-coding RNAs (ncRNAseq) has also expanded our knowledge of the regulatory roles of various ncRNAs (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Furthermore, sequencing of ribosome-protected mRNA fragments, called ribosome sequencing (Riboseq) or ribosome profiling, provides insight into the translatome (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). However, the lack of polyadenylation (polyA) tails in prokaryotic mRNAs, all ncRNAs, and ribosome-protected mRNA fragments in Riboseq complicates the enrichment of these non-rRNA sequences before sequencing using polyA tails. Currently, numerous rRNA depletion kits are available that can drastically remove rRNA sequences for model organisms (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). However, the efficacy for non-model organisms and unknown bacteria is limited, which results in highly abundant rRNA reads being retained in the sequencing data. For example, rRNA reads correspond to 78.44 ± 11.41% of RNAseq data after rRNA depletion with the MicrobEnrich and MicrobExpress kits in our previous oral metatranscriptome study (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). In other metatranscriptomic and bacterial transcriptomic studies, in which the RiboZero kit was used, the rRNA reads account for 22.05% ± 20.18% to 31.98% ± 10.07% of total reads (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14–16</xref>).</p>
    <p>The presence of abundant rRNA can introduce substantial bias to transcriptome data. A number of protein coding genes contain some rRNA-like sequence segments (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17–20</xref>), so their expression levels can be strongly overestimated unless the rRNA reads are removed. Furthermore, rRNA removal can greatly reduce the data size for downstream analysis and accelerate the entire workflow. To facilitate the removal of rRNA sequences from large-scale sequencing data, a number of methods have been developed, including Meta-RNA (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>), rRNASelector (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>) and rRNAfilter in the RNA-QC-chain pipeline (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>) (named RQC_rRNAfilter below), which use hidden Markov models (HMMs) trained on curated rRNA sequences; RiboPicker (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>) and SortMeRNA (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>), which are based on sequence alignment; and rRNAFilter (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>), which applies an expectation-maximization algorithm to discriminate rRNA reads and non-rRNA reads based on their k-mer profiles. Some short-read aligners such as BWA (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>) can also be used to remove rRNA reads. Most of these methods are either based on alignment algorithms that search for sequence homologies or based on a first-order HMM, which makes probabilistic predictions based on the assumption that the current state only depends on the state one step before. Moreover, RNAseq datasets are usually large: one sample can comprise 10G bases and one dataset may have 100 such samples, and the existing methods take hours to process one such sample. Thus, those methods may require weeks to remove rRNA from an entire dataset.</p>
    <p>Deep neural networks, particularly recurrent neural networks (RNNs), are able to capture the sequence patterns in a long-range context (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28–30</xref>). Therefore, we proposed a novel method named <italic toggle="yes">RiboDetector</italic>, which is based on a sophisticated RNN architecture, the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>) network, and detects rRNA sequences from large sequencing datasets rapidly and accurately with a very low level of bias for downstream functional analyses.</p>

    <title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title>
    <sec id="SEC2-1">
      <title>Data collection and <italic toggle="yes">RiboDetector</italic> training</title>
      <p>We collected all the rRNA sequences from the SILVA database, version 138.1 (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>), and coding sequences (CDSs) from the Orthologous MAtrix (OMA) database (August 2020 version) (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). SILVA v138.1 contains curated sequences for 510 508 small subunit (SSU) and 95 286 large subunit (LSU) rRNAs. The August 2020 version of OMA includes 5 979 441 prokaryotic and 9 522 432 eukaryotic non-redundant protein coding DNA sequences. To further reduce the number of sequences but keep the diversity of the remaining sequences, we performed sequence clustering using MMseqs2 v12.113e3 (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>) at a sequence identity cutoff of 0.7 and a coverage of 0.7 with ‘easy-cluster –min-seq-id 0.7 -c 0.7 –cov-mode 1’, which resulted in 6 935 571 representative sequences from both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. The resulting CDSs were mapped against the SILVA sequences using minimap2 v2.17-r941 (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>) with the CIGAR (Concise Idiosyncratic Gapped Alignment Report) output option ‘-c –secondary = no’ to detect possible rRNA sequences in the CDS collection. Thus, 354 CDSs, which shared 98% similarity and 90% coverage with any rRNA sequences in the SILVA database, were removed, as they were probably rRNA sequences erroneously included in the OMA database. The rest of the CDS collection, consisting of 6 935 217 sequences, comprises the OMA_id07_cov07 dataset. Next, ∼300 000 rRNA sequences and 300 000 CDSs were randomly selected from SILVA and OMA_id07_cov07 as training data for training the <italic toggle="yes">RiboDetector</italic> models. A validation dataset was also generated for selecting the best model. It consists of 1 million paired-end rRNA reads and 1 million paired-end CDS reads simulated from sequences that are not included in the training data.</p>
      <p>To determine the optimal hyperparameter settings, such as use of a one-directional or bi-directional LSTM, one or two LSTM layers, and different numbers of hidden units (64, 128, 256), we compared models trained from the first 30 epochs with different hyperparameter settings. For training, one-hot encoded full-length rRNA and CDSs were provided as input. The classification models were trained with a batch size of 256, a maximum sequence length of 100 (varying from 70 to 100), and a sliding window step size of 25 for rRNA sequences and 30 for CDSs. We chose 100 as the maximum sequence length because most of the current next-generation sequencing short reads are around 100 bp long. The trained models can be also used for the classification of reads longer than 100 bp and shorter than 70 bp. All the models using 256 hidden units and models based on two layers of BiLSTM with 128 hidden units were not trained successfully, because of an ‘out of CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture)’ memory issue. The architecture using one BiLSTM layer with 128 hidden units showed the best performance in terms of Matthews correlation coefficients (MCCs, <inline-formula><tex-math id="M0001" notation="LaTeX">\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

      <p>We then trained the <italic toggle="yes">RiboDetector</italic> models with the selected optimal hyperparameters (one input layer, one BiLSTM layer with 128 hidden units, and one fully connected linear layer with two outputs representing two classes) on the same training dataset with 150 epochs and an initial learning rate of 0.001 (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S1B</xref>). The softmax values of the outputs from the linear layer representing the predicted probabilities of the input sequences being rRNA and non-rRNA were computed to calculate the cross-entropy loss. The implementation uses PyTorch v1.6 and Python v3.8. Parameter optimization was performed using the stochastic gradient descent method Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam). The learning rate decayed by a factor of 0.5 every 10 epochs. After 150 epochs of training, the best model was selected from these 150 models (last model of each epoch) based on the MCC on the validation dataset. The reads used in the tSNE visualization were generated from <italic toggle="yes">Firmicutes</italic> mRNA, <italic toggle="yes">Tuf</italic> genes, virus sequences obtained from the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) database, and rRNA sequences downloaded from the Human Oral Microbiome Database (HOMD) (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>).</p>
      <p>To further improve the runtime performance of <italic toggle="yes">RiboDetector</italic> in CPU mode, we used the Open Neural Network Exchange (ONNX) technique to accelerate <italic toggle="yes">RiboDetector</italic> on a CPU. When taking full advantage of multiprocessing, it was only about three times slower in CPU mode with 40 CPU cores than in GPU mode with one NVIDIA Tesla V100 GPU and 40 CPU cores. For low-memory computers, we provided a ‘–chunk_size’ parameter that can substantially reduce the memory use but does not affect much of the runtime. Additionally, there is also an ‘–ensure’ option (with option values of ‘none’, ‘rrna’, ‘norrna’ or ‘both’) for paired-end reads. Specifically, the option ‘rrna’ will output rRNAs with high confidence; in other words, the read pair is considered as rRNA only when both ends are predicted as rRNAs, whereas ‘norrna’, conversely, outputs non-rRNAs with high confidence. For the option ‘both’, the discordantly predicted read pair will be discarded. The option ‘none’, which is the default option, averages the output probabilities of both ends and chooses the class with the higher average probability.</p>
      <p>In the benchmark, we considered rRNA reads as positives and non-rRNA reads, including mRNA, regulatory ncRNA, and viral reads as negatives. Therefore, correctly classified rRNA reads were considered to be true positives (TPs), whereas incorrectly classified rRNA reads were considered to be false negatives (FNs). Further, correctly classified non-rRNA reads were true negatives (TNs) while misclassified non-rRNA reads were false positives (FPs). The false positive rate (FPR) was formulated as <inline-formula><tex-math id="M0001a" notation="LaTeX">\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

We also attempted to include Meta-RNA v3 and rRNASelector in the benchmarking. However, Meta-RNA did not finish generating the final output for the SILVA_rRNA dataset after running for 5 days with 40 CPU cores, whereas rRNAselector is not maintained anymore and the download link is unavailable. For BWA, we used the BWA-MEM algorithm with the default parameter settings. The training rRNA sequences of <italic toggle="yes">RiboDetector</italic> were used as rRNA reference sequences for mapping. The unmapped reads were extracted by SAMtools (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>) with ‘-f 12 -F 256’ and BEDTools bamtofastq (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>).

We also evaluated <italic toggle="yes">RiboDetector</italic> with the default setting ‘–ensure none’ for all benchmark datasets. The number of misclassifications was 513 ± 359, which was much lower than that of other methods (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table S1</xref>). Minimap2 was used to determine the similarity, query coverage, and sequence divergence between sequences in the benchmark datasets and the training sequences or reference sequences.

      <title>rRNA reads may be mapped to protein coding genes by short read alignment</title>
      <p>To demonstrate that activity profiling without rRNA removal introduces considerable bias towards certain functional groups, we mapped rRNA reads from the SILVA_rRNA dataset against CDSs in the OMA database with BWA (Material and Methods). Over 83.37% of the rRNA reads were mapped to CDSs. Genes belonging to 27 GO terms had over 1% of the rRNA reads mapped (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S2A</xref>). Base coverage analysis showed that the reads were most likely to be mapped onto certain regions of these protein-coding genes, indicating that these genes have one or several short regions that share sequence similarity to rRNA sequences (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S2B</xref>). The results suggest that functional groups such as membrane, translation, ATP-binding, and DNA-binding proteins can be strongly overestimated, if rRNA reads are not removed before activity profiling. We also calculated the fraction of rRNA reads mapped to CDSs after filtering by the mapping quality score (MAPQ) and using a longer exact match seed length in BWA. The MAPQ quantifies the probability that a read is misplaced because of ambiguity, poor base quality, and/or bad alignment. A larger MAPQ represents a higher certainty that the alignment is correct and unambiguous. A longer seed length setting in BWA will generate a more stringent and unambiguous alignment. This analysis showed that 56.26% of the rRNA reads were mapped uniquely to specific CDSs with MAPQ ≥5, 47.15% with MAPQ ≥ 10 and 41.59% with MAPQ ≥20. In comparison to the default seed length of 19, with a seed length of 29, the fraction of rRNA reads being mapped to CDSs was reduced to 25.49%. However, a longer seed length will decrease the alignment rate for mRNA reads to the reference sequences in real data analysis.</p>

      <p>We then evaluated the performance of <italic toggle="yes">RiboDetector</italic> alongside BWA, RiboPicker, rRNAFilter, SortMeRNA and RQC_rRNAfilter on five benchmark datasets derived from SILVA rRNA sequences, 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequences, OMA CDSs, viral sequences, and ncRNA sequences (Materials and Methods). On average, <italic toggle="yes">RiboDetector</italic> had the fewest misclassifications, namely 165 ± 114 per 1 million (M) reads, compared with 8956 ± 7219, 1488 ± 1302, 373 257 ± 509 856, 948 ± 1438, and 12 800 ± 28 544 for BWA, RiboPicker, rRNAFilter, SortMeRNA and RQC_rRNAfilter, respectively (Figure <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">1B</xref>, <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table S1</xref>). The number of misclassifications of <italic toggle="yes">RiboDetector</italic> was six times lower than the method ranked second (i.e. SortMeRNA). SortMeRNA is the most commonly used method for rRNA read detection at present. RQC_rRNAfilter made the fewest FP predictions, but had the highest FNR (6.39%) for the SILVA_rRNA dataset. For the OMA_CDS dataset which was simulated from 500 000 CDSs, RQC_rRNAfilter and <italic toggle="yes">RiboDetector</italic> had only 24 and 35 genes, respectively, with a FPR ≥0.5 in classifying the corresponding reads, while it was 549 for BWA, 114 for RiboPicker, 579 for rRNAFilter, and 153 for SortMeRNA (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S3</xref>). For each method, the FPR of a gene was computed as the number of FP reads produced by the method from the gene divided by the total number of reads from the gene. Nineteen out of 35 high-FPR (≥0.5) genes of <italic toggle="yes">RiboDetector</italic> were also high-FPR genes of all other methods, except for rRNAFilter, which had no overlap with all the other methods (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S3</xref>). Remarkably, following RQC_rRNAfilter, <italic toggle="yes">RiboDetector</italic> also had a very low level of FPs on the human ncRNA dataset (Figure <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">1B</xref>, <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table S1</xref>). Specifically, RQC_rRNAfilter falsely predicted 504 out of 6 330 381 human ncRNA reads as rRNA reads and <italic toggle="yes">RiboDetector</italic> misclassified 2021 human ncRNA reads, whereas BWA falsely predicted 113 816; RiboPicker, 11 085; rRNAFilter, 5 815 406; and SortMeRNA, 21 898 reads.</p>
      <p>Next-generation sequencing datasets are usually large, containing over 10M reads per sample. Therefore, in addition to predictive quality, the runtime is another important factor of software performance. We evaluated the runtimes and memory uses of all methods with the benchmark functionality of Snakemake (Material and Methods). <italic toggle="yes">RiboDetector</italic> required 0.43 ± 0.05 minutes per million reads, which was 6.9 times faster than BWA (the second fastest method) and 33.2 times faster than SortMeRNA on average (Figure <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">1B</xref>, <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table S1</xref>). <italic toggle="yes">RiboDetector</italic> also had the smallest output size (420.21 ± 232.83 MB per million reads). In terms of memory usage, the high-memory mode of <italic toggle="yes">RiboDetector</italic> used slightly more memory (1955.50 ± 463.05 MB) per million reads than BWA (1674.22 ± 1420.67 MB). However, in low-memory mode with a chunk size of 64, the memory use of <italic toggle="yes">RiboDetector</italic> was reduced to 485.55 MB per million reads (a quarter of the high-memory mode) while increasing the runtime by only 1.5 times (0.59 minutes per million reads for the SILVA_rRNA dataset).</p>
      <p>To assess the performance of different methods on microbiome data, we benchmarked these methods on a metatranscriptome dataset consisting of oral microbial mRNA, human mRNA, viral mRNA, and rRNA reads (Materials and Methods). <italic toggle="yes">RiboDetector</italic> made the fewest misclassifications (70 misclassifications per million reads), followed by SortMeRNA (269), RiboPicker (344), rRNAFilter (5142), RQC_rRNAfilter (6111) and BWA (16839) (Figure <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">1C</xref>, <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table S2</xref>). <italic toggle="yes">RiboDetector</italic> had low levels of misclassification for all sequence types, whereas RQC_rRNAfilter and rRNAFilter made few misclassifications for bacterial and human mRNA reads, but had very high misclassification levels for rRNA and viral mRNA reads. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of the <italic toggle="yes">RiboDetector</italic> predictions on this metatranscriptome dataset (area under the curve: 0.9999942) also shows that it performs well on microbiome data (Figure <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">1D</xref>). SortMeRNA and RiboPicker were performant as well on this dataset in terms of their TPR and FPR.</p>
      <p>Based on all benchmark datasets that we evaluated above, <italic toggle="yes">RiboDetector</italic> produced 6, 9, 69, 78 and 2088 times less misclassifications than SortMeRNA, RiboPicker, BWA, RQC_rRNAfilter and rRNAFilter, respectively. Since SortMeRNA ranked second in the benchmarks and is the most used method for rRNA removal, we investigated whether its performance could be further improved when using the training rRNA sequences of <italic toggle="yes">RiboDetector</italic> as reference database. However, in this setting SortMeRNA produced 1883 misclassifications per 1 million reads on the metatranscriptome dataset, 7 times more than with the original SortMeRNA reference database. The result suggests that its original database was highly optimized for SortMeRNA. <italic toggle="yes">RiboDetector</italic> performs better than SortMeRNA is not because of the training sequences.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="SEC3-3">
      <title>Test on CDSs similar to FPs and rRNAs</title>
      <p>To compare the performance of different methods on non-rRNA sequences sharing similarity to rRNA sequences, we used two additional non-rRNA datasets named OMA_SILVA and HOMD_FP for this evaluation (Material and Methods). RiboPicker, rRNAFilter, and RQC_rRNAfilter, which had runtimes of &gt;30 min per 1M reads in the Snakemake runtime benchmark (Figure <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">1B</xref>), were not included in this evaluation and following analyses. The HOMD database contains a collection of well-annotated human oral microbial genomes, CDSs and rRNA genes, the CDSs of which can be used as negative samples for evaluation. The FPRs of <italic toggle="yes">RiboDetector</italic> were 1.1% and 1.5% for OMA_SILVA and HOMD_FP, respectively (Figure <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">1E</xref>). BWA had a FPR of 17.4% for OMA_SILVA and 32.0% for HOMD_FP, whereas SortMeRNA had a FPR of 10.1% for OMA_SILVA and 4.3% for HOMD_FP. Thus, the FPRs of <italic toggle="yes">RiboDetector</italic> were about 15–20 times lower than those of BWA and 3–10 times lower than those of SortMeRNA for these two datasets. The results suggest that <italic toggle="yes">RiboDetector</italic> performs well even for the CDSs sharing similarity to rRNA sequences.</p>

    <sec id="SEC3-4">
      <title>Generalizability of different methods for novel rRNA detection</title>
      <p>It is important for rRNA detection methods to be able to identify novel rRNA sequences that are not in the public databases. This is particularly critical in microbiome datasets, in which numerous novel and unknown microbes are likely to be present. We analyzed the probabilities of the correct class assignment (termed confidence) to given rRNA or non-rRNA sequences predicted by <italic toggle="yes">RiboDetector</italic>. In general, the confidence was not smaller for sequences that were more divergent from the training data (Figure <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2A</xref>). To compare the generalizability of <italic toggle="yes">RiboDetector</italic> with that of BWA and SortMeRNA, we grouped the reads from the SILVA_rRNA dataset into different divergence bins on the basis of the least divergence from the training dataset or reference database sequences and summarized their FPRs (Figure <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2B</xref>). The divergence was determined by mapping the rRNA sequences used in SILVA_rRNA to the training or reference rRNA sequences with minimap2 (Material and Methods). BWA and SortMeRNA showed a clear increase in their FNR, along with an increase in the divergence between the benchmark data and sequences in their reference databases or training datasets (Figure <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2B</xref>). The FNR of BWA was close to 20% when the divergence was 20%, and SortMeRNA was close to 15%, whereas the FNR of <italic toggle="yes">RiboDetector</italic> remained at a very low level across all the divergence bins. There are no sequences in the SILVA_rRNA benchmark dataset that have a sequence divergence from the training dataset and reference database of more than 20%. To demonstrate the performance of <italic toggle="yes">RiboDetector</italic> on more divergent (≥20%) rRNA sequences from training and reference sequences, we identified 144 such rRNA sequences from the SILVA database. We then analyzed the FNRs of different methods on 38,083 reads simulated from these 144 rRNA sequences (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S4</xref>). The FNRs for these more divergent sequences were indeed higher than those for the sequences in the SILVA_rRNA dataset for all methods. However, the FNRs of <italic toggle="yes">RiboDetector</italic> are still about two times smaller than those of the other methods, rising from 12.8% to 23.0% with increasing sequence divergence. These results show that identifying novel sequences that are not in databases is a big challenge for currently widely used methods, whereas <italic toggle="yes">RiboDetector</italic> demonstrated a substantial generalizability for divergent rRNA sequences, which should facilitate the accurate identification of novel rRNA sequences. Still, for rRNA sequences with a divergence ≥20% from training and reference sequences, all the methods showed a high FNR (≥10%). In practice, this case may be very rare though, as the sequences in the training data and reference database well represent rRNA sequence diversity.</p>

      <title>Analysis of the FPs of BWA, <italic toggle="yes">RiboDetector</italic> and SortMeRNA</title>
      <p>To elucidate why some non-rRNA reads from the OMA_CDS dataset were classified as rRNA by different methods, we analyzed the alignments for the FPs of BWA and SortMeRNA. As <italic toggle="yes">RiboDetector</italic> does not generate alignments, to show whether the FPs of <italic toggle="yes">RiboDetector</italic> are similar to rRNAs, we mapped its FPs to the training rRNA sequences with BWA and analyzed the alignments. Around 30% of its FP reads could be mapped. In this analysis, the alignment match reflects the length of the aligned region and the edit distance represents the total bases of mismatches, insertions and deletions (indels) within the alignment. The mapped FPs of <italic toggle="yes">RiboDetector</italic> had a much longer alignment match length than those of BWA and SortMeRNA, as well as fewer mismatches and indels within the alignment (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S5A</xref>). For BWA, 84.5% of the alignments had an alignment match length between 19 (the default seed length) and 21 nucleotides to the reference, and the remaining read regions were not aligned to rRNA (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S5A</xref>). The default seed length of BWA is 19, thus allowing for one mismatch in 20 nucleotides, which corresponds to 95% identity or 5% divergence on average. Therefore, the number of FPs could be reduced by increasing the seed length of BWA. However, our generalizability analysis showed that the FNR of BWA started to increase for tested rRNA sequences with a divergence of over 5% from the reference rRNA sequences. Together, these points indicate that a larger seed length will result in a low FPR but a higher FNR. To prove this, we ran BWA on the OMA_CDS and SILVA_rRNA datasets with a larger seed length, namely 29 (one mismatch in 30 nucleotides, corresponding to ∼97% identity). As expected, the number of FPs for the OMA_CDS dataset decreased from 283 517 to 17 021, whereas the number of FNs on SILVA_rRNA increased from 58 736 to 85 610. With SortMeRNA, the FPs tended to have a larger alignment match with the reference rRNA sequences, but more mismatches and indels within the alignment than BWA (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S5A</xref>). Only 16.68% of the mapped FPs of <italic toggle="yes">RiboDetector</italic> had an aligned length shorter than half of the read (50 nucleotides), but this value rose to 98.15% for BWA and 56.23% for SortMeRNA. Moreover, 95.60% of the mapped FPs of <italic toggle="yes">RiboDetector</italic> had an edit distance (mismatches and indels, not including clipping) smaller than five; this was 99.48% for BWA and 57.96% for SortMeRNA. This result suggests that the FPs of <italic toggle="yes">RiboDetector</italic> that could be mapped to rRNA are very similar to rRNA sequences, whereas the FPs of BWA and SortMeRNA are less similar to rRNAs overall, but contain either short exact matches to rRNA or long alignment matches with numerous mismatches and indels. We also analyzed the predicted probabilities of FPs that could be mapped to rRNAs, FPs that could not be mapped to rRNAs, and the TPs of <italic toggle="yes">RiboDetector</italic>. Remarkably, the unmapped FPs tended to have smaller probabilities than the mapped FPs and the TPs (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S5B</xref>). Overall, the FPs have intermediate probabilities and all TPs have very high probabilities close to one (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S5B</xref>). This suggests that <italic toggle="yes">RiboDetector</italic> generates FPs by predicting non-rRNA reads as rRNA reads with low confidence.</p>
      <p>rRNA removal methods must ensure not to introduce bias towards certain functional groups by FP predictions. That is, the FP sequences being removed should not be significantly enriched in certain functional groups. Therefore, we performed a GO term enrichment analysis with Fisher's exact test based on the hypergeometric distribution of the number of FP and TN reads from the OMA_CDS dataset for each GO term (Material and methods). The FPs of <italic toggle="yes">RiboDetector</italic> were enriched in three GO terms with a FDR of ≤0.01 and an odds ratio of 10 (Figure <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3A</xref>, <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table S3</xref>), but none of them had FPRs higher than 5%. In comparison, BWA’s FPs were significantly enriched in 39 GO terms; all of these had FPRs over 5% and 22 had FPRs higher than 15% (Figure <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3B</xref>, <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table S3</xref>). The FPRs can be up to 40.5% for certain GO terms. The FPs of SortMeRNA were enriched in 62 GO terms, 18 of which had FPRs higher than 5% (Figure <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3C</xref>, <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table S3</xref>). Its FPRs were up to 22.5% for certain GO terms. Overall, analysis suggests that the FPs of <italic toggle="yes">RiboDetector</italic> were enriched in fewer functional groups than other methods, which will enable a more accurate functional analysis of the data.</p>

      <title>Benchmarking computational resource requirements of <italic toggle="yes">RiboDetector</italic></title>
      <p>To systematically evaluate the computational performance of <italic toggle="yes">RiboDetector</italic>, we ran the software on different computers with limited CPU, GPU, and memory resources. First, we compared <italic toggle="yes">RiboDetector</italic> with other methods on a personal workstation computer with a consumer-grade GPU NVIDIA RTX 2080 Ti (Figure <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">4A</xref>). Compared to the consumer-grade GPU 2080 Ti, V100 has more CUDA cores, and it is an advanced data center GPU (<ext-link xlink:href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/v100/" ext-link-type="uri">https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/v100/</ext-link>). Interestingly, the runtime on the 2080 Ti computer was shorter than that on one with a V100 (17.6 s versus 22.8 s for 1 million paired-end reads), possibly because <italic toggle="yes">RiboDetector</italic> can take advantage of the high input/output speed of the solid-state drive of the workstation. Since the memory on the workstation is limited, we used the low memory mode of <italic toggle="yes">RiboDetector</italic> and it used only 4.5GB memory for 20M paired-end reads. To make <italic toggle="yes">RiboDetector</italic> suitable for most use cases, including on computer without GPU, we optimized <italic toggle="yes">RiboDetector</italic> for CPUs using ONNX (Material and Methods). It was then tested on different computational servers with a V100 GPU, a T4 GPU, or only CPUs with different memory settings by changing the chunk size (Figure <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">4B</xref>). In CPU mode, <italic toggle="yes">RiboDetector</italic> was only 3.3 times slower than in the GPU mode but still 5.6 times faster than the second-fastest method (BWA) and 12.3 times faster than SortMeRNA on the same dataset (Figure <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>).</p>

      <p>A metatranscriptome data processing workflow usually consists of read quality control, rRNA reads removal, host reads removal, and reference gene mapping. To demonstrate that rRNA removal is the most time-consuming step in processing with the most widely used method (SortMeRNA), we ran the entire data processing workflow on the oral metatranscriptome dataset that was used in the previous benchmark with 40 CPU cores. We performed read quality control with Fastp (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>), then removed rRNA reads with SortMeRNA, filtered out human reads by mapping the non-rRNA reads against the human reference with BWA, and finally mapped the cleaned reads against HOMD reference CDSs with BWA. The read quality control required 1 min, rRNA removal with SortMeRNA took 109 min, human reads removal took 4 min, and read alignment took 2 min of computing time. In comparison, with <italic toggle="yes">RiboDetector</italic>, rRNA removal required only 4 min in GPU mode and 15 min in CPU mode.</p>

    <title>DISCUSSION</title>
    <p>Here, we describe <italic toggle="yes">RiboDetector</italic>, a deep learning-based method leveraging GPU acceleration and a BiLSTM model to capture patterns from a long-range context for rapid and accurate rRNA sequence detection. Removal of rRNA reads is an essential step in prokaryotic transcriptome, metatranscriptome, ncRNAseq, and Riboseq data analysis. In rRNA detection, <italic toggle="yes">RiboDetector</italic> was very accurate with low levels of both false positives and negatives. Moreover, <italic toggle="yes">RiboDetector</italic> also demonstrated a notable generalizability for detecting rRNA sequences divergent from the training data over other methods. While alignment-based methods generated more false positives with partial matches to rRNAs, whereas the HMM-based method was substantially slower in terms of runtime and produced numerous false negatives. <italic toggle="yes">RiboDetector</italic> showed a false negative rate over 15% on the rRNA sequences with divergence &gt;25% from training dataset, but this is about two times lower than those of other methods. In practice, this case will be very rare, as the sequences in the training dataset well represent rRNA sequence diversity and we identified only 144 rRNA sequences in the whole SILVA database with divergence ≥20% from the training dataset. The LSTM is capable of memorizing many previous steps in a sequence, which, together with the highly efficient implementation provided by <italic toggle="yes">RiboDetector</italic> based on the Pytorch package, allows for a more accurate and rapid prediction compared with alignment- and HMM-based methods.</p>
    <p>The misclassification of reads by rRNA removal methods can introduce bias to the downstream analysis. More specifically, the abundance of a given non-rRNA gene will be underestimated if the reads originating from it are misclassified as rRNA reads and thus removed. On the other hand, the abundance of a non-rRNA gene will be overestimated if false negatives of a rRNA removal method can be mapped to this gene. If the genes with a biased abundance estimation are enriched in certain functional groups, the entire analysis of these functional groups will be biased. On the CDS benchmark dataset, the few false positives of <italic toggle="yes">RiboDetector</italic> introduced a very low level of functional bias compared with other methods. CDSs sharing partial sequence similarity to rRNAs are enriched in certain functional groups, which may cause the enrichment of false positives for alignment-based approaches in numerous functional groups. Additionally, many false positives of <italic toggle="yes">RiboDetector</italic> did not share sequence similarity to rRNA at all, which may also explain why these reads were not enriched in many functional groups.</p>
    <p>The sample sizes in microbiome or ncRNA studies are generally large, with each sample consisting of tens of millions of reads. Processing such datasets is excessively time-consuming and computationally intensive. rRNA read removal can be the most time-consuming step in the entire data processing pipeline. <italic toggle="yes">RiboDetector</italic> is able to process tens of millions of reads in a few minutes and it is over 30 times faster than the most widely used method (SortMeRNA), yet achieves a misclassification rate six times smaller. <italic toggle="yes">RiboDetector</italic> does not need a large reference database, unlike other methods, and the size of the model file is around 1.5 MB.</p>
    <p>Currently, <italic toggle="yes">RiboDetector</italic> is intended for rRNA short read detection from sequence data. As it demonstrated a remarkable performance in nucleotide sequence classification, we will develop methods with a similar architecture for rRNA gene annotation from genome assembly data or other sequence recognition problems in the future.</p>
