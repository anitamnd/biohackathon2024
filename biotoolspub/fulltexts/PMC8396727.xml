    <abstract>
      <p>CPA/AT transporters are made up of scaffold and a core domain. The core domain contains two non-canonical helices (broken or reentrant) that mediate the transport of ions, amino acids or other charged compounds. During evolution, these transporters have undergone substantial changes in structure, topology and function. To shed light on these structural transitions, we create models for all families using an integrated topology annotation method. We find that the CPA/AT transporters can be classified into four fold-types based on their structure; (1) the CPA-broken fold-type, (2) the CPA-reentrant fold-type, (3) the BART fold-type, and (4) a previously not described fold-type, the Reentrant-Helix-Reentrant fold-type. Several topological transitions are identified, including the transition between a broken and reentrant helix, one transition between a loop and a reentrant helix, complete changes of orientation, and changes in the number of scaffold helices. These transitions are mainly caused by gene duplication and shuffling events. Structural models, topology information and other details are presented in a searchable database, CPAfold (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="http://cpafold.bioinfo.se" ext-link-type="uri">cpafold.bioinfo.se</ext-link>).</p>

      <title>Author summary</title>
      <p>The availability of experimentally solved transmembrane transport structures are sparse, and modelling is challenging as the families contain non-canonical transmembrane helices. Here, we present structural models for all families of CPA/AT transporters. These proteins are then classified into four “fold-types”, including one novel fold-type, the reentrant-helix-reentrant fold type. We find extensive structural variations within the fold with members having from three to fourteen transmembrane helices. We explore the evolutionary mechanisms that have shaped the topological variations providing a deeper understanding of membrane protein structure and evolution. We also believe our work could serve as a model system to understand the evolution of topology variations for other membrane proteins.</p>

    <title>Introduction</title>
    <p>Proteins belonging to the Pfam CPA/AT clan (monovalent cation-proton antiporter/anion transporters) transport: ions, amino acids, and other charged compounds [<xref rid="pcbi.1009278.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>–<xref rid="pcbi.1009278.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Due to their functional importance, these transporters are ubiquitously present in all three kingdoms of life [<xref rid="pcbi.1009278.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1009278.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>–<xref rid="pcbi.1009278.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. In humans, these transporters are associated with pathological conditions such as intestinal bile acid malabsorption, ischemic and reperfusion injury, heart failure and cancer [<xref rid="pcbi.1009278.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1009278.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Therefore, these transporters serve as important drug targets. [<xref rid="pcbi.1009278.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1009278.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p>
    <p>In the Transporter Classification Database (TCDB), these transporters are classified into the CPA- and the BART-superfamily. In contrast, Pfam[<xref rid="pcbi.1009278.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] and OPM[<xref rid="pcbi.1009278.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1009278.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] group all families into a single superfamily (“CPA/AT clan” and “Monovalent cation-proton antiporter”, respectively). PDB structures are available only for five families in the Pfam CPA/AT clan, with topologies starting from 10 transmembrane helices (TM) in the SBF family [<xref rid="pcbi.1009278.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] to 12 TM in Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> Antiporter 1 and OAD beta [<xref rid="pcbi.1009278.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1009278.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], and 13 TM of Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> Exchanger and 2HCT [<xref rid="pcbi.1009278.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1009278.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p>
    <p>All known structures of CPA/AT transporters consist of two inverted symmetric <bold><italic toggle="yes">repeat units</italic></bold>
<xref rid="pcbi.1009278.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A and 1B</xref>, which are essential to enable the different conformational states necessary for the transport mechanism [<xref rid="pcbi.1009278.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>–<xref rid="pcbi.1009278.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Each of the repeat units can be further divided into two structurally distinct parts, the <bold><italic toggle="yes">scaffold</italic></bold> and the <bold><italic toggle="yes">core subdomain</italic></bold> (<xref rid="pcbi.1009278.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A and 1B</xref>
<italic toggle="yes">[<xref rid="pcbi.1009278.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</italic>). Two scaffold and core subdomains come together in structure to give rise to the complete scaffold and core domains <xref rid="pcbi.1009278.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A and 1D</xref>.</p>

    </fig>
    <p>The scaffold domain is involved in dimerization and also interacts with the core domain. The interface between the two domains forms an aqueous cavity where the substrate binds. The core domains generally consist of six transmembrane helices (three from each subdomain), with the middle helix of each subdomain being a non-canonical helix, either in the form of a broken or a reentrant helix. The broken helix is a transmembrane helix that crosses the membrane, but contains a discontinuity in the alpha-helix, forming a loop within the membrane <xref rid="pcbi.1009278.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>. In contrast, the reentrant helix does not cross the membrane and, therefore, enters and exits from the same side <xref rid="pcbi.1009278.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>. Two non-canonical helices of the same type (Broken or reentrant), from the N- and C-terminal core subdomain respectively, interact to form a polar non-helical part in the center of the membrane. This polar region is capable of binding and transporting ions [<xref rid="pcbi.1009278.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] and transfer them to the other side of the membrane using an elevator mechanism [<xref rid="pcbi.1009278.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p>
    <p>To investigate the structural features of the protein families, we perform homology and ab initio modelling. Homology modelling was performed using Modeller [<xref rid="pcbi.1009278.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] from the HHpred webserver [<xref rid="pcbi.1009278.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] and ab initio-modelling with trRosetta [<xref rid="pcbi.1009278.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Although homology modelling is usually the first choice for protein modelling, ab initio models can nowadays also be of high accuracy [<xref rid="pcbi.1009278.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Here, we find that trRosetta [<xref rid="pcbi.1009278.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1009278.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] can be used to model these transporter families where homology modelling fails. Most importantly, we identify a novel fold, named the reentrant-helix-reentrant fold, present in three families and describe their evolutionary history. The novel fold is characterized by the fusion of two reentrant helices in a single region wherein the homologous resolved structures of the reentrant helices are separated in two symmetric domains. To facilitate for other researchers, we present all models and alignments in a searchable database, CPAfold (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="http://cpafold.bioinfo.se/" ext-link-type="uri">http://cpafold.bioinfo.se</ext-link>).</p>

      <title>Topology annotation and protein structural modelling led to the identification of four fold-types in the CPA/AT transporters</title>
      <p>A few evolutionary related Pfam families were added to CPA/AT clan to form the CPA/AT transporter dataset, for details see the <xref rid="sec015" ref-type="sec">material and methods</xref> section, this brings the final dataset to include 23 protein families <xref rid="pcbi.1009278.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. Next, using the integrated pipeline we predict the topologies (including broken and reentrant helices) of all families. For topology annotations, we use a combination of evolution guided topology prediction, similarity to families with known structure, the difference in positively charged residues present in inside and outside loops in different topological models, and structural modelling. This effort allows us to determine the topology of the proteins in all Pfam families, resulting in a wide range of topologies from 3 to 14 helices. <xref rid="pcbi.1009278.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> Topologies identified in this work are in agreement with earlier experimental topology annotations [<xref rid="pcbi.1009278.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>–<xref rid="pcbi.1009278.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].</p>

      <p>On the basis of the models, we grouped CPA/AT transporter families belonging to the same fold-type based on their topology and structure. Here, we define “fold-types” to be structurally similar repeat units found in a group of families. We find four different fold-types <xref rid="pcbi.1009278.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. Families that belong to the BART superfamily from TCDB belong to the BART fold type, while families from the CPA superfamily are classified into three fold-types: CPA-broken, CPA-reentrant or Reentrant-helix-reentrant (RHR). Crystal structures are available for at least one family in three out of four fold-types but not for the RHR fold-type. The identification and the evolution of this new fold type are discussed in detail in the following section.</p>
      <p>All the data generated from this work is made available as “CPAfold database” (http://<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="http://cpafold.bioinfo.se/" ext-link-type="uri">cpafold.bioinfo.se</ext-link>). The CPAfold database can be useful to experimentalists interested in studying the structure, function, mutation and design of any protein belonging to this fold. 3D structure models are available for all the families in this fold. Functional and mutational studies can be supported by these models. Reentrant motifs for the reentrant type transporters have been identified. Full length and repeat level topology and sequence alignments of a particular protein family with all the other families in the fold are provided. This becomes helpful for the comparison of the structure and function of related families of interest.</p>
      <p>Users can check which family their protein of interest belongs to, as well as other details such as representative sequence, topology, multiple sequence alignments, Core and scaffold domain annotation, KR-bias, fold-type classifications are also available.</p>

      <title>The Reentrant-helix-reentrant fold-type</title>
      <p>Through ab initio protein modelling, we identified the novel reentrant-helix-reentrant (RHR) fold. We found three families with this fold type; Putative Sulfate Exporter (PSE), LrgAB operon proteins and the Lys_export family.</p>

      <title>Putative Sulfate Exporter (PSE)</title>
      <p>The PSE family (Pfam: PF03601, Cons_hypoth698) exists in two topological forms with 9 and 11 transmembrane domains (TM), here referred to as PSE_1 and PSE_2. Their predicted structures are almost identical except for the two additional N-terminal TM helices in PSE_2. The PSE family share significant sequence similarity with the 2HCT family, E-value 1.3*10<sup>−19</sup>, using HHsearch [<xref rid="pcbi.1009278.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], <xref rid="pcbi.1009278.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. There is one known structure (PDB: 5a1s) in the 2HCT family. However, the two trRosetta models for the PSE family show substantial differences compared to the corresponding homology models based on the 5a1s template <xref rid="pcbi.1009278.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A and 2B</xref>. In particular, the homology models lack the second reentrant helix, leaving a central cavity in the model. This means that in the homology model the active site is not complete. In contrast, the trRosetta model of PSE_1 contains two reentrant helices, and a potential active site can be identified.</p>

      <p>Three additional observations confirm the reliability of the PSE_1 trRosetta model: (1) alternative contact predictions methods provide very similar models <xref rid="pcbi.1009278.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Fig</xref>, (2) a model of the E. coli member of PSE (YieH) has been presented earlier with an identical fold [<xref rid="pcbi.1009278.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], (3) the recently added protein model from Pfam predicts a similar fold (see Pfam website).</p>
      <p>Structurally, the core of the trRosetta PSE_1 and 5a1s from the 2HCT family are aligned, see <xref rid="pcbi.1009278.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2C</xref>. However, in PSE_1, only a single transmembrane helix separates the two reentrant helices, while in 2HCT, five helices are separating the two reentrant helices. Thus, the fold of the C-terminal subdomain is different. This reentrant-helix-reentrant fold is also distinct from all known CPA/AT structures and PSE_1 is to the best of our knowledge the first example of CPA/AT transporters without an internal symmetry.</p>

      <p>The LrgAB operon proteins and the Lys_export family also contain an RHR fold. However, these families exist as both monomers and dimers. In Prokaryotes, LrgB contains the RHR fold but interacts with the auxiliary smaller subunit LrgA (Pfam: PF03788) which contains four transmembrane helices. While in eukaryotes, it exists as a fused monomeric form LrgAB (Pfam: PF04172). Similarly, the Lysine exporter (Pfam: PF03956) has two topological forms: a monomeric fused form LysAB and two shorter proteins LysA and LysB forming a dimer that interact with each other. LysB and LysAB contain the RHR fold while LysA is a short protein with three transmembrane helices.

      <title>Evolutionary relationships between the fold-types in the CPA/AT transporters</title>
      <p>Sensitive MSA-MSA alignments of repeat units or full-length proteins between a pair of families reveal evolutionary relationships between the different fold-types. Each family MSA was searched (full length or repeat unit) using HHsearch against the MSA of all Pfam families in Pfam-A_v32. The output is an alignment of the query family MSA and the Pfam family MSA, these query-template MSA are referred to as MSA-MSA alignments.</p>
      <p>Scores of the alignments are used to generate a weighted network. Both the full length and repeat level networks <xref rid="pcbi.1009278.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A and 3B</xref> show one major cluster consisting of the CPA-reentrant, CPA-broken families as well as the PSE family from the reentrant-helix-reentrant fold type. The families in BART fold-type and the other families in RHR fold-type are only loosely connected to this main cluster. This clearly shows that CPA-broken and CPA-reentrant fold-types are evolutionarily closest to each other. The evolution of the novel RHR fold-type from CPA-reentrant is also evident, at least for PSE. The exact relationship of the outlier families is however not completely clear from the evolutionary analysis.</p>

      <p>The repeat network also clearly highlights the shuffling of the domains in the mem_trans family compared to the other BART families, discussed below. The repeat level network also helped to infer the various evolutionary mechanisms responsible for the evolution of different fold-types.</p>
      <p>Evolution can occur both at the repeat level and involving the entire protein. For example, it is clear from the network discussed previously that evolution within the fold-types typically occurs at full length, as two N-terminal repeat units in different families are closer to each other than they are to the C-terminals.</p>

From the alignment between PSE_1 and 2HCT (identity 14.5%, 316 aligned positions), it can be speculated that PSE is a truncated version of <italic toggle="yes">2HCT</italic>, <xref rid="pcbi.1009278.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A and 4B</xref>. The sequence alignment shows that PSE_1 aligns from TM2 to TM10 of <italic toggle="yes">2HCT</italic>, i.e., both scaffold domains as well as the N-terminal core domain are conserved (except TM1) but only the first TM helix of the second core domain is present in PSE. The alignment of TM1-5 of PSE to TM7-11 of 2HCT reveals an internal symmetry; however, the alignment contains a gap, covering the second reentrant helix and TM6 (residues 169–248) of PSE_1. This region is instead structurally aligned to the second reentrant helix and TM11 of 2HCT.</p>

        <p>We suggest that the novel fold could have arisen through a rescue mechanism of a truncated reentrant protein from the 2HCT family. The truncated transporter would not be functional as the active site is not complete. However, the structure could have been resurrected by the adaptation of a novel fold in which; (i) TM7 (green in <xref rid="pcbi.1009278.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4C and 4D</xref>) moved into the center of the protein and (ii) the connecting loop (red in <xref rid="pcbi.1009278.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4C and 4D</xref>) became a novel reentrant helix. This ancestral protein would then have the topology of PSE. The LrgAB operon and Lys exporter families could then evolve from this ancestral protein by terminal duplications and rearrangements, see <xref rid="pcbi.1009278.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref>. However, the sequence identity is so low between these families and all other families, so we cannot exclude that two families have evolved independently from some other ancestral reentrant protein.</p>

        <p>An interesting question is if the ancestral protein was functional. If it was truncated and no reentrant region was present it could certainly not function as a transporter. However, we do believe that it is not necessary to assume that the ancestral protein was non-functional. It is possible that the new reentrant region in PSE might exist as a minor state even in a full-length ancestral protein.</p>
        <p>The reentrant-helix-reentrant fold has not been described before in the CPA/AT Pfam clan, but the fold is present in a protein in the SLC1/EAAT transporter family [<xref rid="pcbi.1009278.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1009278.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] as well as in the predicted structure of human protein Tmem41b [<xref rid="pcbi.1009278.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. If these families have a common origin or are the results of convergent evolution is unfortunately not possible to deduce as we cannot detect any sequence similarity between these families.</p>

        <title>2) Broken-reentrant transition by repeat duplication</title>
        <p>DUF819 (CPA-reentrant fold-type) and Na_H_Exchanger_1 (CPA-broken fold-type) are the two closest related families <xref rid="pcbi.1009278.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5A</xref>.The N-terminal repeat of Na_H_Exchanger family (CPA-broken fold-type) is closely related to both the N- and C-terminal repeat units from DUF819 (CPA-Reentrant fold-type), see <xref rid="pcbi.1009278.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3A and S3B Fig</xref>. Broken -reentrant transition involves many changes. First, a gain or loss of a helix at the C-terminal scaffold subdomain is observed in order to maintain the inverted nature of the repeat units <xref rid="pcbi.1009278.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5A and 5B</xref>.</p>
        <p>The CPA-reentrant is enriched in glycines and sometimes prolines in the core motif with low hydrophobicity thereby aiding the formation of the loop Figs <xref rid="pcbi.1009278.g005" ref-type="fig">5C, 5D</xref> and S4A.The core sequence motifs for all the families are available in the CPAfold database.</p>

Thirdly, the transition between a reentrant and a broken helix changes the orientation of the last helix of the core subdomain, thereby also changing the orientation and packing of all the following helices <xref rid="pcbi.1009278.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4B and S4C Fig</xref>. Therefore, the number of positively charged residues in the surrounding loops should change upon transition.</p>
        <p>The structural basis of topological transitions discussed previously holds true for all the other pairs of families belonging to the CPA-broken and CPA-reentrant fold-types. Our sequence and structural analysis show that the initial transition between the broken and reentrant transporters occurred by duplication of the repeat. Therefore, we propose that the broken-reentrant transition includes these following steps: (i) Mutations in the N-terminal repeat of the CPA-broken repeats leading to reentrant helix (ii) Duplication of the repeat unit, (iii) fusion of the repeats, and (iv) mutations to change the orientational preference of one of the repeats to form a functional reentrant transporter <xref rid="pcbi.1009278.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5E</xref>.</p>

The N-terminal repeat of the SBF_like family is similar to the C-terminal-repeat of Mem_trans and vice versa Figs <xref rid="pcbi.1009278.g007" ref-type="fig">7</xref> and <xref rid="pcbi.1009278.s007" ref-type="supplementary-material">S7</xref>. This is also clear from the repeat network and the pairwise repeat alignments. This reciprocal similarity between the repeat units shows that there has occurred a recent shuffling of the repeat units causing the change in orientation, see <xref rid="pcbi.1009278.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7C</xref>.</p>

        <p>It is generally assumed that the topology is conserved within a family [<xref rid="pcbi.1009278.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>].

    <title>Conclusion</title>
    <p>In this work, we mapped and analyzed the vast variability in folds and transmembrane topologies in CPA/AT transporters. <xref rid="pcbi.1009278.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig 8</xref> summarizes the variation and the evolution of the CPA/AT transporters. CPA/AT transporters generate a selective permeability across cell membranes and a key role in the substrate selection is played by the non-canonical-helices. Here we suggest that the transition between broken, reentrant and reentrant-helix-reentrant helices can be caused by multiple point mutations or a stop codon mutation. The new reentrant region might be present in an ancestral protein with multiple states or it might have appeared to resurrect a non-functional protein. Transporters are also characterized by pseudo-symmetry in sequence and structure. We provided evidence of how the two repeats can evolve independently, shuffle and maintain transport functionality.</p>

    <p>A final common feature of the transporters is their existence as dimer or trimer. The scaffold domain acts as an oligomerization interface and is the part of the proteins that show the highest variability in terms of topology. Among CPA/AT transporters indeed we identified variation in the topology even within the same protein family. Collectively, these pieces of evidence provide a complete picture of the surprising plasticity of membrane transporters.</p>

          <title>An example showing the annotation of the topology of DUF819 family using our integrated pipeline.</title>
          <p>The main steps involved in the pipeline are shown. (a) Evolution guided topology annotation: Topology predictions are mapped onto the seed MSA to obtain a multiple topology alignment. The phylogenetic tree from seed MSA is used to reorder the multiple topology alignment into a “Reordered topology alignment”. This evolution guided topology prediction is used to infer initial topologies for a family. Generation of the final topology and annotation of core and scaffold subdomains is obtained by comparing to the known structure of sodium-citrate symporter (PDB id: 5A1S). The TM helices (in-out) and TM helices (out-in) are colored dark red/grey and light red/grey, respectively. Reentrant helices (in-in) and (out-out) are colored yellow and blue respectively. The inside and outside loops are colored yellow and blue respectively. The vertical bar is colored based on the taxonomy of the sequences (Bacteria: Purple, Archaea: Dark blue Eukaryotes: Green). Scaffold subdomains and reentrant core subdomains are colored brown and green, respectively. N- and C-terminal repeats are shown as black trapezoids. ΔG values describing the hydrophobicity [<xref rid="pcbi.1009278.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>] are obtained for the representative sequence and are plotted to the aligned residues in the representative sequence. (b) Validation of broken/reentrant transporters by using the KRbias for the DUF819 family. KRbias or positive inside rule is the enrichment of inside loops compared to the outside loops of a transmembrane protein[<xref rid="pcbi.1009278.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1009278.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1009278.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. The number of Lys (K) and Arg(R) amino acids in the inside and outside loops are compared. The expected correct topology would show a higher KR-bias in one of the two topology models (Broken/Reentrant). The KR-bias plot is shown as a 2D scatter plot.

        <title>i) Identification of Pfam subfamilies, each with a unique topology and assignment of initial topologies</title>
        <p>We extracted reference proteome sequences from the 13 Pfam families in the CPA/AT clan [<xref rid="pcbi.1009278.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1009278.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. The reference proteomes are complete proteomes that represent taxonomic diversity. In particular, they include the well-studied model organisms that are of biomedical and biotechnological interest. Fragments, sequences with &lt;75% Pfam domain coverage, and highly similar sequences (&gt;90% identity) were excluded. The remaining sequences were clustered at 30% identity using blastclust [<xref rid="pcbi.1009278.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] and aligned using Clustal Omega to generate a seed MSA[<xref rid="pcbi.1009278.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Topologies for all the members of the families were predicted using TOPCONS2 [<xref rid="pcbi.1009278.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. It is important that seed MSA represents the full-length sequence to map the complete topology.</p>
        <p>Predicted topologies were mapped on to the seed MSA to get a topology alignment. A phylogenetic tree is generated from the seed MSA using the FastTree program [<xref rid="pcbi.1009278.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. The seed MSA is reordered according to the branching order of the phylogenetic tree. This MSA is renamed as the “Reordered topology alignment”. This procedure of reordering the topologies serves two purposes: (1) It helps to weed out the topology errors caused by topology prediction programs (2) Identify evolutionarily distinct clusters that show systematic topology variation in the predicted topologies. If the reordered topology alignment shows more than one topology, the MSA is then split based on the topology. The families are split into subfamilies that each have a unique topology. Despite combining the evolutionary information guided topology predictions, it was noted that the topology predictions sometimes consistently missed predicting either one or both broken/reentrant helices. Therefore, the topologies annotated using the reordered topology alignments were labelled as “Initial topologies”. To assign correct topology to all families within the CPA/AT clan, we had to use additional steps <xref rid="pcbi.1009278.g009" ref-type="fig">Fig 9A</xref>.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec018">
        <title>ii) Improved classification of the CPA/AT transporters</title>
        <p>A representative sequence for each family was selected. In the case of families with a known structure, this sequence was selected. In cases without a known structure, the top hit from a single search with HMMsearch [<xref rid="pcbi.1009278.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] against Uniprot was used. The representative sequence of each family was searched against Uniclust30 [<xref rid="pcbi.1009278.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] using the HHblits program [<xref rid="pcbi.1009278.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] with an E-value cut-off of 0.001 and 3 iterations generating the family MSA. The Meff score for the family MSA was calculated using cd-hit [<xref rid="pcbi.1009278.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] with an identity cutoff of 0.62 and a word length of 4.</p>
        <p>We used HHsearch version 3.2.0 [<xref rid="pcbi.1009278.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] to find possible evolutionary relationships between the family MSA of the CPA/AT clan and other families in Pfam-A_v32.0 [<xref rid="pcbi.1009278.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. We wanted to search for new Pfam families that are not yet assigned to be part of CPA/AT clan.</p>
        <p>Pfam clans are not always updated. We updated the Pfam clan CPA/AT by adding a few more Pfam families. HHsearch alignments clearly showed that LrgA (PF03788), LrgB(PF04172), AbrB (PF05145) and 2HCT (PF03390) are evolutionarily related to Pfam CPA/AT clan. 2HCT family has not been classified into any Pfam family. The AbrB family has been misclassified into the Mem_trans clan in Pfam. New families that are added to the CPA/AT clan went through the previous step to annotate their initial topology and check if they have topology variations within the family.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec019">
        <title>iii) Generating final topology</title>
        <p>The next step was to identify the missing, broken/reentrant helices if any. The representative sequence of the family/subfamily was searched against the PDBmmCIF70_22_May database using HHsearch [<xref rid="pcbi.1009278.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] to compare the “initial topology” of the family with the topology derived from the crystal structure. PDBmmCIF70 is a HHsearch database that belongs to the HHsuite program. PDB_mmCIF70 are filtered with representative sequences with a maximum of 70% sequence identity selected. The query HMM is compared to the database of HMM-based on PDB chains to generate the query-template MSA-MSA alignments. Missing transmembrane helices (reentrant or broken) in the representative sequence were inferred from the alignment to the known structure.</p>
        <p>Predicted topology and the topology from the crystal structure were mapped onto the pairwise MSA-MSA alignment to obtain a topology alignment. Transmembrane helices were considered to be aligned when at least five residues of both helices are aligned, as used before [<xref rid="pcbi.1009278.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Otherwise, it is a, TM helix aligned to gap regions, TM helix aligned to inside/outside loops, TM helix aligned to signal peptide. The type is chosen based on the dominating composition in the segment of the TM helix that is aligned. Missing helices in the representative sequence were inferred when the TM helix in the topology with known structure was aligned to loops in the representative sequence. Since we have structural templates for both broken and reentrant type transporter, classification is based on the type of transporter with a known structure with the best hit (lowest E-value) <xref rid="pcbi.1009278.s012" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Table</xref>. Based on the classification of broken/reentrant type, missing helices were added, and the orientations were corrected. The final topology was then inferred for all families <xref rid="pcbi.1009278.g009" ref-type="fig">Fig 9A</xref>. All the helices, including the transmembrane helices and the non-canonical helices, are counted together to assign the topology. The orientation of the protein is assigned based on the N-termini.</p>

        <title>iv) Identification of core, scaffold subdomains and inverted repeat units from known structures</title>
        <p>Annotations of scaffold and core subdomains were taken from the literature of the Pfam families with known structure. Subdomain annotations were then transferred from the family with an available structure to the family with an unknown structure based on the definition of aligned TM helices described in the previous section <xref rid="pcbi.1009278.g009" ref-type="fig">Fig 9A</xref>.</p>

      <sec id="sec021">
        <title>v) Validation of Broken/Reentrant type of transporters by the positive inside rule</title>
        <p>The “positive-inside rule” or KR-bias is the preferential occurrence of positively charged residues (lysine and arginine) at the cytoplasmic loops of transmembrane helices [<xref rid="pcbi.1009278.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1009278.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1009278.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Therefore, it can be used to identify the orientation of the protein. A large-scale study with statistical observations of 107 organisms strongly supports the positive-inside rule. In general, KR bias can be applied to any genome for topology prediction [<xref rid="pcbi.1009278.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1009278.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. We counted the number of K (Lysine) and R (Arginine) starting from 10 residues inside the TM helix and up to 25 residues after the helix as this has been shown to contribute to the positive inside rule [<xref rid="pcbi.1009278.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. The KR-bias is then calculated using the family MSA and comparing the number of KR in the inside and outside loops. Two models were made one representing the broken, and one the reentrant topology. This was then used to confirm the topology of all families/subfamilies. KR bias is calculated for all the helices in the full-length protein, and the expected correct topology would show a higher KR-bias <xref rid="pcbi.1009278.g009" ref-type="fig">Fig 9B</xref>.</p>

      <title>Generation of protein models and quality assessment</title>
      <p>Topology annotations explained in the previous section were also supported and validated with homology or ab initio models for the representative sequence. The homology models were generated by Modeller [<xref rid="pcbi.1009278.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] from an alignment and templates obtained from the webserver HHpred [<xref rid="pcbi.1009278.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] <xref rid="pcbi.1009278.g009" ref-type="fig">Fig 9C</xref>, with the selected templates shown in <xref rid="pcbi.1009278.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>.</p>
      <p>The trRosetta models were generated running trRosetta locally [<xref rid="pcbi.1009278.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Subsequently, we use the predicted distances and angles as input for pyRosetta [<xref rid="pcbi.1009278.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. We run pyRosetta twenty times obtaining twenty models from the same set of constraints <xref rid="pcbi.1009278.g009" ref-type="fig">Fig 9D</xref>. The quality of the contact predicted models were then evaluated using Pcons [<xref rid="pcbi.1009278.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>] giving as input the folder with the twenty models. The benchmark between the models with PDB structures and relative Pcons score is provided in <xref rid="pcbi.1009278.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig</xref>.</p>
      <p>In addition, for PSE_1 we used three alternative methods: RaptorX [<xref rid="pcbi.1009278.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>], DeepMetaPsicov [<xref rid="pcbi.1009278.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>] and PconsC4 [<xref rid="pcbi.1009278.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. In all these methods, we used the same MSA as input as for trRosetta. RaptorX was run from the web server while we used the pipeline we developed in Bassot et al. [<xref rid="pcbi.1009278.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>] that use the predicted contacts from PconsC4, DeepMetaPsicov and the Psipred 3.0 [<xref rid="pcbi.1009278.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>] secondary structure prediction as restraints for Confold [<xref rid="pcbi.1009278.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. All models have the same fold.</p>
      <p>The topology annotation for all the families belonging to the Reentrant-helix-reentrant fold-type was carried out from the ab-initio models only, as we failed to annotate topology using evolution guided topology annotation because we could not recognize the second reentrant helix.</p>
      <p>The Eukaryotic LrgAB protein was treated differently as this subfamily is present only in eukaryotes and is distinct from the prokaryotic members of the family. For the LrgAB protein, we generate the multiple sequence alignment using only eukaryotic sequences, generated from sequences retrieved from the Jackhammer web server [<xref rid="pcbi.1009278.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. The choice of the web server was made due to the ease of collecting the sequence of specific groups of organisms. Starting from the representative sequence of LrgAB (Swissprot: Q9FVQ4) we run three iterations with an E-value cutoff of 10<sup>−3</sup> on the eukaryotic reference proteomes. The obtained full sequences were downloaded and used as a customized database for a local run of Jackhmmer [<xref rid="pcbi.1009278.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] from where we obtained the family MSA.</p>

Dotplots were generated using Matplotlib scripts available from the GitHub repository. In the sequence alignment dotplots, the colors correspond to the order of magnitude of the E-value of the alignment. The aligned dots are colored.

The output is an alignment of the query family MSA and the Pfam family MSA. These query-template MSA are referred to as MSA-MSA alignments. The hit is considered to be N- or C-terminal repeat based on the alignment with query repeat. If bi-directional pairs of query-hit are obtained, the pair containing the lowest E-value is obtained. Log<sub>10</sub>(E-values) were used to construct a weighted network using the python library NetworkX.</p>

        <p>A structural template with the lowest E-value (in bold) is used to identify the broken or reentrant type. Additionally, identification of the type of transporters based on KR bias calculations is chosen based on the highest mean KR bias value (shown in bold). Two E-values are provided for the broken structure template of the Mem_trans family. Mem_trans does not align full length with the structure template. It instead aligns with the repeats in N- C-terminal way.</p>

    <p>Dear Dr. Elofsson,</p>
    <p>Thank you very much for submitting your manuscript "The evolutionary history of topological variations in the CPA/AT superfamily" for consideration at PLOS Computational Biology.</p>
    <p>As with all papers reviewed by the journal, your manuscript was reviewed by members of the editorial board and by several independent reviewers. In light of the reviews (below this email), we would like to invite the resubmission of a significantly-revised version that takes into account the reviewers' comments.</p>
    <p>The consensus among the reviewers was that the two manuscripts on the evolution of CPA/AT proteins and the identification of a novel fold type in CPA/AT proteins were each of insufficient contribution on their own. However, if the two manuscripts were combined and the other revisions implemented, they may be of sufficient interest for publication. We of course understand if you wish to publish these manuscripts as two separate articles in a different venue. In addition, I would like to apologize for the length of time it took to complete reviews on this manuscript. I wish it could have been shorter.</p>
    <p>We cannot make any decision about publication until we have seen the revised manuscript and your response to the reviewers' comments. Your revised manuscript is also likely to be sent to reviewers for further evaluation.</p>
    <p>When you are ready to resubmit, please upload the following:</p>
    <p>[1] A letter containing a detailed list of your responses to the review comments and a description of the changes you have made in the manuscript. Please note while forming your response, if your article is accepted, you may have the opportunity to make the peer review history publicly available. The record will include editor decision letters (with reviews) and your responses to reviewer comments. If eligible, we will contact you to opt in or out.</p>
    <p>[2] Two versions of the revised manuscript: one with either highlights or tracked changes denoting where the text has been changed; the other a clean version (uploaded as the manuscript file).</p>
    <p>Important additional instructions are given below your reviewer comments.</p>
    <p>Please prepare and submit your revised manuscript within 60 days. If you anticipate any delay, please let us know the expected resubmission date by replying to this email. Please note that revised manuscripts received after the 60-day due date may require evaluation and peer review similar to newly submitted manuscripts.</p>
    <p>Thank you again for your submission. We hope that our editorial process has been constructive so far, and we welcome your feedback at any time. Please don't hesitate to contact us if you have any questions or comments.</p>
    <p>Sincerely,</p>

    <p>Reviewer's Responses to Questions</p>
    <p>
      <bold>Comments to the Authors:</bold>
    </p>
    <p>
      <bold>Please note here if the review is uploaded as an attachment.</bold>
    </p>
    <p>Reviewer #1: The current study focuses on the CPA/AT family of transmembrane transporters and proposes a different mode of classification based on a combination of evolutionary, biochemical and structural (topology) features that provides a more in-depth view of the differences between the members of this group of proteins. The study also collects and organizes these results into a searchable database developed by the authors.</p>
    <p>The work done on the CAP/AT family is extensive and uses a combination of high throughput computational analysis and some manual verification and corrections required when dealing with large number of sequences and structures.</p>
    <p>As a whole, I believe this manuscript is a valuable contribution to the structural biology, classification and evolution of membrane proteins as it paints a renovated picture of what it constitutes to be a member of this family by including new ideas like “fold types” and topology prediction. I was less enthusiastic when thinking about the potential use of this study or the database in the community. I would have liked to see examples on how the community could benefit from the results of this new way of classifying the family and how the proposed models of evolution can be used. If the authors could include a section clarifying or illustrating these possibilities, I believe, it would strengthen this manuscript.</p>
    <p>I have a series of comments and questions which I would like to be addressed in future versions of this manuscript:</p>
    <p>General Comments</p>
    <p>1. The authors should do a better job convincing the reader why yet another classification of transporters is needed. Pointing out discrepancies between the current classifications is not enough since this new classification will bring yet another set of discrepancies.</p>
    <p>2. In the beginning of the results section it is explained that two new families were added, an explanation was provided alluding to the need of reliable alignment to other families, however it is not explained why. Conversely, two families were excluded because they are distantly related, how is threshold for distance defined? And why are those families present in the family in the first place?</p>
    <p>3. Figure 2, deals with the family DUF819 family. I would suggest to incorporate this into the actual figure to make it clear for the reader when looking at the figure before reading the captions</p>
    <p>4. The KR-bias is used in Fig. 2 before it is properly introduced in the manuscript. I suggest you include a brief definition in the figure caption to correct this continuity issue.</p>
    <p>5. The MSA-MSA pairwise alignment is not clearly defined. Please include a brief explanation in the fold types section.</p>
    <p>6. The manuscript uses the concept of the “positive inside rule” as a ground truth, is this assumption extensive and general? As a non-expert I would doubt this always has to be true, could the authors clarify ?</p>
    <p>7. In step 1 of topology annotations, the authors use the reference proteome sequences for Pfam. Typically this set is much smaller than those including all the Uniprot proteins. What is the rationale to use only the reference proteomes and not all available sequences?</p>
    <p>8. Please include a section describing possible applications or use cases of this database. For example Pfam can be used as input MSAs for contact prediction, what about this database?</p>
    <p>Minor details</p>
    <p>1) Abstract. Replace “losses of core helices” with “loss of core helices”</p>
    <p>2) Author summary. Line 60, add a period between “superfamily” and “We”</p>
    <p>3) Page 5, line 101. Replace “repeat (In ..” With “repeat (in ..”</p>
    <p>4)Page 6, line 115 , replace “enter and exit” with “enters and exits”</p>
    <p>5) In table one some cells start with a semicolon (;) what is the reason for this?</p>
    <p>6) Fig. 3 captions, line 193, replace “is represented” with “are represented”</p>
    <p>7) Page 12, line 210, replace “helices themself” with “helices themselves” or remove “themself”</p>
    <p>8) Page 14, line 238. I suggest to remove “Anyhow” at the beginning of the paragraph</p>
    <p>9) Page 17, line 281. Replace “family have” with “family has”</p>
    <p>10) Page 21, line 374. Replace the comma with a period in “selected, In case”</p>
    <p>11) Could the authors explain what is the PDBmmCIF70_22_May database?</p>
    <p>Reviewer #2: In the submitted manuscript authors present sequence- and structure-based classification of the CPA/AT transporters superfamily. Such a classification is an important step towards understanding the evolution of these proteins, however, experiments being at the base of this work may lack robustness.</p>
    <p>- Fig. 2. “The figure shows a reordered topology alignment” – what does reordered mean in this context? What is the meaning of helix numbering (also in Figs. 4, 5, and 6). Is the presence of the reentrant helix (RH) in N or C repeat mutually exclusive? These issues should be addressed in the introduction. Also, figures’ legends would benefit from clarifications. Now it is hard to understand them without referring to the methods.</p>
    <p>- It is unclear to me how Fig. 3 was used to define the three groups. First, the title of the figure is “Repeat units are clustered based on conserved C-terminal repeat” (also Pg. 19, Ln. 320) but it shows 30 units which correspond (I guess) to N and C terminal repeats of the 15 families from Table 1 (this is also stated on page 10, lines 182-183). It is not clear when the authors refer to a single (N or C) repeat or the full fusion protein. Second, I don’t understand how the investigation of the dendrogram could have led to the definition of the groups. The purple group actually comprises two sub-groups that share no similarity, the same is for the green and pink groups (I don’t see how Fig 3 could support their existence – page 11, lines 196-197). I suggest representing the all-vs-all similarities in a form of a cluster map (e.g., with CLANS [T Frickey 2004] or a similar tool) and using such a representation for defining groups. Currently, it looks like the manually-defined groups were mapped onto the dendrogram just to state that they were actually obtained from it.</p>
    <p>- It is not clear what Fig. S6 actually shows. Please clarify. Pg. 12, Ln. 212-214. Why helix gain/loss would be restricted only to the C-termini scaffold subdomain? Can’t the broken to reentrant transition occur in the N-termini core domain? Pg. 14, Ln. 242-250 – why only one example was given? Are there other examples that would support different scenarios (for example, a transition that does not involve duplication of a single repeat but rather a transformation of a two-repeat fusion protein)?</p>
    <p>- In general, the presented evolutionary scenarios (Pg. 12-17) are speculative and are based on anecdotical observations rather than the investigation of all the available data (comparison of the repeating units). In my opinion, the work would benefit from having a figure in the main text (maybe a schematic tree?) that would summarize all the families, including the relative similarities between their repeats, their features (core helix type, orientation, etc.), and list the possible scenarios of duplications/fusions/swaps, etc. The S16 Fig. may be a good starting point for such a figure.</p>
    <p>- It is not clear why the four families were excluded from the analyses.</p>
    <p>- The authors do not comment on the fact that in some cases the two repeats are not in a single protein chain but are rather encoded separately.</p>
    <p>Reviewer #3: The work described by Sudha and colleagues, describes the effort to use a number of sequence and structural bioinformatics tools, to study the evolutionary history of the CPA/AT family.</p>
    <p>Clearly this work, is relevant for a very specialized crowd that studies the CPA/AT superfamily and I have a hard time seeing the impact of this work outside of that community. On a more positive note, the authors di make the effort to summarize their findings on a searchable database, that can serve the community that studies these proteins to use the findings of this paper.</p>
    <p>Another point that strikes me in the manuscript is related to the proposed evolutionary pathways – as far as my understanding goes these evolutionary pathways are just “putative solutions” and sometimes the language in the manuscript oscillates in between this is a proposed mechanism and this is the only event possible. Would be important to be consistent in this section.</p>
    <p>Specific comments</p>
    <p>CPA/AT family in the title is generally not a great way to present the work to a broader audience as many scientists will not know what the CPA/AT superfamily is</p>
    <p>- line 60 missing a punctuation</p>
    <p>-line 63 would or could ?</p>
    <p>- in terms of notation I find figure 1 c confusing as clearly we do not have 2 and 3 helices – but rather 4 and 6</p>

    <p>
      <bold>Comments to the Authors:</bold>
    </p>
    <p>
      <bold>Please note here if the review is uploaded as an attachment.</bold>
    </p>
    <p>Reviewer #1: The authors have made an extensive revision to the original article(s). They have responded in a satisfactory way my questions and requests for clarification, as well to other reviewers’ comments. I have only a couple of comments that I hope can be incorporated in a final version of this article. These proposed changes do not require an additional revision.</p>
    <p>1. The authors responded in a clear way potential use cases and applications of the database (Question 8), but I did not see this information incorporated in the final text. A little bit of this response is incorporated in Data availability but it is not complete. The authors should make sure to incorporate this information as it provides a guideline to general audiences about the importance of this work. A partial incorporation that helps retain style and continuity would be ok with me.</p>
    <p>2. Make sure the correct symbol is used for the biological hydrophobicity scale, at the moment the symbol appears as a broken symbol in the PDF.</p>
    <p>Reviewer #2: All my comments and suggestions were addressed what is much appreciated. In my opinion, the merged manuscript reads very well (both the results and methods sections). I have just a few minor suggestions:</p>
    <p>Pg. 4. HHpred is not a tool for homology modeling but for template identification.</p>
    <p>Pg. 4. “Most importantly, we identify a novel fold, named the reentrant-helix-reentrant fold, present in three families and describe their evolutionary history.” – I suggest adding a sentence giving a glimpse on what is new/interesting/unusual in the new fold (lack of symmetry?).</p>
    <p>Figure 3b. Node labels are too crowded and thus hard to read. Perhaps the authors could label nodes with numbers and provide a legend?</p>
    <p>Pg. 8. “The network in Figure 5 clearly shows the evolutionary relationship” – Figure 3, I guess? Please check the figures numbering.</p>
    <p>Pg. 11, point 4. Font type/size seems to be different</p>
    <p>Pg. 12. “can evolve independently,, shuffle” – two commas?</p>
    <p>Final thought: most of the presented evolutionary scenarios involve an intermediate state corresponding to a non-functional protein (lack of the active site, broken symmetry, etc.). I am wondering about the mechanism that enabled their “resurrection”. Paralogs with a similar function? Formation of inter-family hybrids?</p>
    <p>**********</p>
    <p>
      <bold>Have the authors made all data and (if applicable) computational code underlying the findings in their manuscript fully available?</bold>

    <p>Figure Files:</p>
    <p>While revising your submission, please upload your figure files to the Preflight Analysis and Conversion Engine (PACE) digital diagnostic tool, <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://pacev2.apexcovantage.com" ext-link-type="uri">https://pacev2.apexcovantage.com</ext-link>. PACE helps ensure that figures meet PLOS requirements. To use PACE, you must first register as a user. Then, login and navigate to the UPLOAD tab, where you will find detailed instructions on how to use the tool. If you encounter any issues or have any questions when using PACE, please email us at <email>figures@plos.org</email>.</p>
    <p>Data Requirements:</p>
    <p>Please note that, as a condition of publication, PLOS' data policy requires that you make available all data used to draw the conclusions outlined in your manuscript. Data must be deposited in an appropriate repository, included within the body of the manuscript, or uploaded as supporting information. This includes all numerical values that were used to generate graphs, histograms etc.. For an example in PLOS Biology see here: <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="http://www.plosbiology.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pbio.1001908#s5" ext-link-type="uri">http://www.plosbiology.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pbio.1001908#s5</ext-link>.</p>
    <p>Reproducibility:</p>
    <p>To enhance the reproducibility of your results, we recommend that you deposit your laboratory protocols in protocols.io, where a protocol can be assigned its own identifier (DOI) such that it can be cited independently in the future. Additionally, PLOS ONE offers an option to publish peer-reviewed clinical study protocols. Read more information on sharing protocols at <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://plos.org/protocols?utm_medium=editorial-email&amp;utm_source=authorletters&amp;utm_campaign=protocols" ext-link-type="uri">https://plos.org/protocols?utm_medium=editorial-email&amp;utm_source=authorletters&amp;utm_campaign=protocols</ext-link></p>
    <p>References:</p>
    <p>Review your reference list to ensure that it is complete and correct. If you have cited papers that have been retracted, please include the rationale for doing so in the manuscript text, or remove these references and replace them with relevant current references. Any changes to the reference list should be mentioned in the rebuttal letter that accompanies your revised manuscript.</p>
    <p>
      <italic toggle="yes">If you need to cite a retracted article, indicate the article’s retracted status in the References list and also include a citation and full reference for the retraction notice.</italic>

    <p>Dear Dr. Elofsson,</p>
    <p>We are pleased to inform you that your manuscript 'The evolutionary history of topological variations in the CPA/AT transporters' has been provisionally accepted for publication in PLOS Computational Biology.</p>
    <p>Before your manuscript can be formally accepted you will need to complete some formatting changes, which you will receive in a follow up email. A member of our team will be in touch with a set of requests.</p>
    <p>Please note that your manuscript will not be scheduled for publication until you have made the required changes, so a swift response is appreciated.</p>
    <p>IMPORTANT: The editorial review process is now complete. PLOS will only permit corrections to spelling, formatting or significant scientific errors from this point onwards. Requests for major changes, or any which affect the scientific understanding of your work, will cause delays to the publication date of your manuscript.</p>
    <p>Should you, your institution's press office or the journal office choose to press release your paper, you will automatically be opted out of early publication. We ask that you notify us now if you or your institution is planning to press release the article. All press must be co-ordinated with PLOS.</p>
    <p>Thank you again for supporting Open Access publishing; we are looking forward to publishing your work in PLOS Computational Biology. </p>
    <p>Best regards,</p>
    <p>Joanna Slusky, Ph.D.</p>
