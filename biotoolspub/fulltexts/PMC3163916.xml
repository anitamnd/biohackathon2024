      <p>Protein secretion systems used by almost all bacteria are highly significant for the normal existence and interaction of bacteria with their host. The accumulation of
genome sequence data in past few years has provided great insights into the distribution and function of these secretion systems. In this study, a support vector
machine (SVM)- based method, SSPred was developed for the automated functional annotation of proteins involved in secretion systems further classifying them
into five major sub-types (Type-I, Type-II, Type-III, Type-IV and Sec systems). The dataset used in this study for training and testing was obtained from KEGG
and SwissProt database and was curated in order to avoid redundancy. To overcome the problem of imbalance in positive and negative dataset, an ensemble of
SVM modules, each trained on a balanced subset of the training data were used. Firstly, protein sequence features like amino-acid composition (AAC), dipeptide
composition (DPC) and physico-chemical composition (PCC) were used to develop the SVM-based modules that achieved an average accuracy of 84%, 85.17%
and 82.59%, respectively. Secondly, a hybrid module (hybrid-I) integrating all the previously used features was developed that achieved an average accuracy of
86.12%. Another hybrid module (hybrid-II) developed using evolutionary information of a protein sequence extracted from position-specific scoring matrix and
amino-acid composition achieved a maximum average accuracy of 89.73%. On unbiased evaluation using an independent data set, SSPred showed good prediction
performance in identification and classification of secretion systems. SSPred is a freely available World Wide Web server at

    <title>Background</title>
    <p>Recent years have witnessed a great thrust in the number of completely
sequenced microbial genomes available online to the scientific community. Till
date, more than 1600 microbial genomes have been completely sequenced and
sequencing of ˜5000 is in progress. This leads to an increase in demand of
functional annotation of genomic and proteomic data through computational
methods. Functional annotation allows categorization of genes in functional
classes, which can be very useful to understand the physiological meaning of
large amounts of genes. Bacteria on the basis of staining procedure can be
classified into Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. While the Grampositive
bacteria contain a single plasma membrane followed by a thick cell
wall, Gram-negative bacteria comprise of double membrane layer enclosing the
periplasmic space and peptidoglycan layer between the two lipid bilayers 
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R01">1</xref>].
Bacterial organisms have evolved dedicated secretion systems that aid in the
transport of polypeptides across their outer membrane. While little has been
studied about the secretion system pathways in Gram-positive bacteria, various
detailed studies have been performed on Gram-negative bacteria 
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R01">1</xref>,
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R02">2</xref>].
Furthermore, genome sequencing of a variety of Gram-positive bacteria
showed that many of the secretion genes, which are initially identified in
<italic>E.coli</italic>, are also present in these organisms 
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R03">3</xref>]. Secretion systems in gramnegative
bacteria secrete a wide range of proteins across the cell membrane
such as those involved in biogenesis of pili and flagella, nutrient acquisition,
virulence and efflux of drugs and other toxins. On the basis of molecular nature
of transport machineries and their catalyzed reactions, Secretion systems can be
classified into several classes: (1) Type I Secretion (T1S); (2) Type II Secretion
(T2S); (3) Type III Secretion (T3S); (4) Type IV Secretion (T4S); and (5) Sec
Secretion system pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R01">1</xref>,
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R04">4</xref>]. Being critical of the export of virulence
proteins, functional annotation of proteins involved in export machinery
pathways can provide novel drug targets that will be crucial in combat against
rapidly evolving pathogenic microorganisms. Most of the tools developed for
the identification for secretion systems are either dedicated to only one major
class of secretion systems, Type-III [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R05">5</xref>,
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R06">6</xref>,
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R07">7</xref>], or are not specifically meant for
secretion systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R08">8</xref>]. 
In this context, similarity based search tools like BLAST
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R09">9</xref>] 
have aided in the functional annotation of proteomic data, but the major
limitation of these tools have been in identifying novel and distantly related
proteins. This work explores the use of machine learning approach, Support
Vector Machine (SVM), for the identification and classification of proteins
involved in secretion system pathways from their sequence. SVM is a widely
used machine learning approach for biological sequence analysis due to its
ability to handle high dimensional and noisy data. Further, due to its strong
mathematical background, it has a great generalization capacity that makes it
less susceptible to over-fitting, an important feature in learning algorithms 
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>].
SVM has been widely used for diverse range of Biological applications 
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>].
We have implemented the approach as a web-server application SSPred,
available online at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.bioinformatics.org/sspred">
http://www.bioinformatics.org/sspred</ext-link>. SSPred predicts a
protein to be involved in secretion system pathways on the basis of SVM
modules developed using amino acid composition (AAC), dipeptide
composition (DPC), physico-chemical composition (PCC), combination of all
the three aforementioned properties and combination of PSSM profiles with
AAC. A query protein sequence predicted to be part of secretion systems was
further classified into one of the five major sub-types i.e. T1S, T2S, T3S, T4S
and Sec secretion systems. (Supplementary Figure 1 available at
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.bioinformatics.org/sspred">

measure analysis of SSPred will be discussed in the subsequent sections of the
manuscript.</p>

    <title>Discussion</title>
    <p>The aim of this study was to develop a prediction server based on SVM for the
identification and classification of bacterial secretion systems. Different SVM
models based on diverse set of input features were developed and their
performance was evaluated based on training, testing and independent datasets.
The results are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1a-d</xref> and Supplementary Table 2 available at
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.bioinformatics.org/sspred">
http://www.bioinformatics.org/sspred</ext-link>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1a-c</xref> shows Mathew Correlation
Coefficient (MCC) observed during 5-fold cross-validation and validation test.
SVM models based on hybrid-II input features achieved highest MCC at each
prediction level, for all three datasets (training, test and independent) as shown
in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1a-c</xref>. Figure 1a displays the MCC for various SVM models
evaluated using 5-fold cross validation on training dataset. The highest MCC of
0.80 was observed for hybrid-II based SVM model in distinguishing secretion
system proteins from non-secretion system proteins. Similarly, at subclassification
of secretion systems, hybrid-II based models achieved highest
MCC of 0.95, 0.71, 0.85, 0.72 and 0.76 for Type-1, Type-2, Type-3, Type-4
and Sec Secretion Systems, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1a</xref>). This suggested that
inclusion of evolutionary information using PSSM matrix significantly aided
the SVM models in increasing sensitivity and specificity of predictions. It is to
be noted that inclusion of additional features in the input vector for training
SVM modules does not necessarily result in improvement in accuracy as
observed for low MCC for some dipeptide based SVM models in comparison
to amino-acid based models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1a-c</xref>). 
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1b and 1c</xref> displays the
MCC for various SVM models evaluated using validation test and independent
dataset respectively. As observed during 5-fold cross-validation, hybrid-II
based models achieved the highest MCC. For the test dataset, hybrid-II based
models achieved a MCC of 0.81 in the classification of secretion system
proteins from non-secretion system proteins. Similarly, for the subclassification
of secretion system proteins in test dataset, hybrid-II based
models performed best with the highest MCC of 0.92 and lowest MCC of 0.72
was observed for Type-I and Type-II secretion systems, respectively. On
unbiased evaluation of trained SVM models using independent dataset, hybrid-
II based models achieved a MCC of 0.94 for the classification of secretion
system proteins from non-secretion system proteins. Similarly for the subclassification
of secretion systems, the MCC for hybrid-II based models ranged
from 0.53 to 0.86 for Type-II and Type-I secretion systems respectively. The
performance of other SVM models based on input features like amino-acid,
dipeptide, physico-chemical and hybrid-I are also displayed in 
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1a-c</xref> for
performance comparison to hybrid-II based models.</p>
    <p>Earlier studies have shown that various secretion systems share protein
components among them like four of the proteins in the T2S and T4S systems,
viz. the prepilin peptidase/N-methyl transferase, ATPase, the secretin and the
multispanning transmembrane (TM) proteins are shown to be homologous,
suggesting a common evolutionary origin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>,
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R02">2</xref>]. Similarly, T3S protein
components share their injectisome apparatus with flagellar apparatus and
some proteins like type-II/III secretion proteins are common in both T2S and
T3S system apparatus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>]. It is worth mentioning that for training SVM
modules the ideal dataset should not have two identical objects with opposite
labels (positive and negative) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>] as this may result in misclassification of
shared labels. In this context, shared proteins among T2S, T3S and T4S
systems may be misclassified by SSPred. In fact, the confusion matrix derived
from validation test on independent dataset displays some of the protein
sequences from Type-III and Type-IV secretion systems misclassified as Type-
II secretion systems (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1d</xref>). Many of these proteins were indeed observed
to be shared components of Type-II, III or IV secretion system machinery
(UniProtKB Id: Q7CMH0) and this partially explains the relatively low MCC
observed for Type-II in comparison to other secretion system classes. Although
this may be regarded as a drawback of the current prediction tool, considering
the fact that biological data does not always qualify the prerequisites of
machine learning algorithms. Moreover, long recognized similarity between the
T2S, T3S and T4S proteins may tend any machine learning algorithm towards
a certain level of misclassification. Furthermore, if SSPred was considered as
the first tool for functional annotation of huge proteomic data it may prove
significant in refining the candidate proteins for further wet-lab based research.
All the SVM modules trained in this study have been implemented in the form
of a web-server available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.bioinformatics.org/sspred">
http://www.bioinformatics.org/sspred</ext-link>. Server-side
programming was implemented using Perl-CGI while for client-side
programming HTML and JavaScript were used. SSPred provides a userfriendly
interface where the user can type or paste the query sequence(s) in the
text-area or can upload the sequence(s) as a single file. Input sequence should
be in FASTA format. The server provides options to select any of the
prediction approaches (AAC-, DPC-, PCC-, Hybrid-I or Hybrid-II based) for
the identification and classification of secretion systems.</p>

    <title>Conclusion</title>
    <p>Protein secretion plays a central role in modulating the interactions of bacteria
with their environment. Despite a considerable diversity of proteins involved in
various classes of secretion systems, our knowledge of the complexity of
bacterial secretion systems has expanded. With the rapid accumulation of
bacterial genome data, assistance of computational tools for automated
functional annotation of genomic data is inevitable. We present here a
prediction server, SSPred for the identification and classification of proteins
involved in bacterial secretion systems. SSPred is based on a machine learning
approach, SVM and is trained using fixed length input vector derived from
compositional and evolutionary features of the protein sequence. SSPred has
shown good prediction accuracy and authors believe that SSPred will enlighten
the path of researchers in their quest in further understanding the complex
machinery of bacterial secretion systems.</p>

      <p>Prediction performance of various SVM models. a) Prediction
performance of models on a) training dataset evaluated using 5-fold crossvalidation;
b) Test dataset evaluated using validation test and; c) independent
dataset evaluated using validation test. Each bar represents MCC achieved by a
model based on distinct input features. Hybrid-II based models achieved
highest MCC both for the classification of secretion system proteins from nonsecretion
system protein and at the sub-classification of secretion system
proteins; d) Confusion matrix showing prediction results of SSPred in the subclassification
of secretion system proteins from independent dataset. A
relatively low MCC was observed for Type-II secretion systems due to many
false positive predictions. This can be partly explained by the fact that many of
Type-II secretion systems proteins are shared among Type-III and Type-IV
secretion system proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>,
