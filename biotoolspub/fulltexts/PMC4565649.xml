    <abstract>
      <p>A major challenge in gene library generation is to guarantee a large functional size and diversity that significantly increases the chances of selecting different functional protein variants. The use of trinucleotides mixtures for controlled randomization results in superior library diversity and offers the ability to specify the type and distribution of the amino acids at each position. Here we describe the generation of a high diversity gene library using tHisF of the hyperthermophile <italic>Thermotoga maritima</italic> as a scaffold. Combining various rational criteria with contingency, we targeted 26 selected codons of the <italic>thisF</italic> gene sequence for randomization at a controlled level. We have developed a novel method of creating full-length gene libraries by combinatorial assembly of smaller sub-libraries. Full-length libraries of high diversity can easily be assembled on demand from smaller and much less diverse sub-libraries, which circumvent the notoriously troublesome long-term archivation and repeated proliferation of high diversity ensembles of phages or plasmids. We developed a generally applicable software tool for sequence analysis of mutated gene sequences that provides efficient assistance for analysis of library diversity. Finally, practical utility of the library was demonstrated in principle by assessment of the conformational stability of library members and isolating protein variants with HisF activity from it. Our approach integrates a number of features of nucleic acids synthetic chemistry, biochemistry and molecular genetics to a coherent, flexible and robust method of combinatorial gene synthesis.</p>

    <title>Introduction</title>
    <p>Proteins with novel and pre-determined properties, such as catalysis of chemical reactions or specific binding of low or high molecular weight ligands, are much sought for in biotechnology and biomedicine. Synthetic access to such proteins, however, is anything but straightforward, due to the fact that our knowledge of protein folding and structure/function relationship is still too fragmentary to allow deducing an amino acid sequence from nothing but the functional requirements it would have to meet.</p>
    <p>For this reason, efforts to engineer proteins with new and pre-deliberated functions were originally confined to identifying functionally important single amino acid residues or small subsets of them within a pre-existing structural framework and replacing them by other residues of defined nature. This, by now classical, approach of directed mutagenesis (hypothesis-driven and "one molecule at a time") has more recently been complemented by methods sampling the sequence space using many candidate molecules in parallel and under incorporation of elements of chance, i.e. randomization of one or more amino acid positions. These methods are collectively known under the names of evolutionary and combinatorial protein engineering [<xref rid="pone.0136778.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0136778.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p>
    <p>Repertoire diversity is a key parameter in such an approach because the probability of identifying one or several molecular species within a collection of partially randomized proteins as carriers of a specific predefined function increases linearly with the number of participating candidates. However, there are limits: With n fully randomized amino acid positions of a protein, the formal library size is 20<sup>n</sup> or 10<sup>1.3n</sup>. For larger values of n, this number rapidly exceeds the number of molecules participating in a real life experiment. Under typical laboratory conditions the latter number is approximately as follows: 10<sup>16</sup> for chemical oligonucleotide synthesis, 10<sup>14</sup> for DNA ligation, 10<sup>12</sup>−10<sup>14</sup> for ribosome display and 10<sup>8</sup> for transformation of <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> with plasmid DNA [<xref rid="pone.0136778.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. These numbers impose narrow constraints on what fraction of formal library diversity can actually be utilized in an experimental search for a given function.</p>
    <p>Incentive is thus provided not to waste a large proportion of a gene library on candidates that have little if any chance to pass the functional test. This means that randomization ought to be directed away from residues involved solely in the maintenance of scaffold structure and stability and towards residues plausibly expected to contribute to the envisaged new function. In addition, it is highly attractive to also combine chance and beforehand knowledge by controlling not only the position but also the extent and quality of (partial) randomization.</p>
    <p>This principle has paradigmatically been illustrated with libraries of immunoglobulins, or fragments thereof [<xref rid="pone.0136778.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0136778.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], guidance being provided by the general architecture of immunoglobulin variable domains. Here, structure-supporting residues are organized in "framework" regions of largely invariant sequence. These are interspersed by regions of great sequence flexibility which are present in the three-dimensional structure as clustered ensembles of "hypervariable loops" forming matching pockets for binding structurally diverse antigens [<xref rid="pone.0136778.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0136778.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]–hence the name "complementarity-determining regions" or "CDRs". With respect to enzymatic catalysis, a similar case is arguably provided by the (β/α)<sub>8</sub>-fold [<xref rid="pone.0136778.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0136778.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] which is highly prevalent among enzymes. By analogy, the regions corresponding to the CDRs of immunoglobulins are the eight loops connecting the C-termini of β-strands to the N-termini of α-helices. These invariably form the sites for substrate binding and catalysis. Utilization of this concept for finding (β/α)<sub>8</sub>-proteins with new and pre-determined catalytic properties requires sequence randomization addressing specifically those amino acid residues that are part of these loops and, in addition, extend their side chains towards the substrate binding cavity.</p>
    <p>One of the methods to introduce random codons at specific positions within the synthetic DNA is oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis (for reviews see [<xref rid="pone.0136778.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0136778.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]). In standard oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis schemes, a randomized DNA sequence is synthesized by sequentially coupling a mixture of the four nucleoside precursors to the growing oligonucleotide. In this way all 64 possible codon sequences (NNN) are generated, including 41 redundant and 3 stop codons, where much of the clones obtained later are redundant or truncated. One way to improve this is to use NNS (S = G or C) or NNK (K = G or T). For both, there are only 32 possible codons with only one stop codon increasing the chance for productive clones, in particular if randomizing more than one position [<xref rid="pone.0136778.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. However, the bias in favor of the amino acids encoded by multiple codon sequences is maintained, and the presence of a stop codon will produce truncated amino acid sequences upon translation. This considerably limits the complexity that can be achieved for long randomized peptide libraries.</p>
    <p>Several methods have been devised since to increase the quality of the library at the step of randomization. In the DimerTrimer method different pre-synthesized dimers and trimers are combined to yield only one codon per each of the 20 amino acid with no stop codons [<xref rid="pone.0136778.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The same library quality can be obtained by the “small intelligent” focused mutagenesis [<xref rid="pone.0136778.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Here, for each position to be randomized four oligonucleotides are needed, one with NDT (D = not C) representing 12 amino acids, one with VMA (V = not T, M = A or C) representing 6 amino acids and two with only one codon (ATG and TGG). Mixing the oligonucleotides in molar ratios of 12:6:1:1 should yield libraries without stop codons and an even distribution of each amino acid. It could be shown that using this method the library is considerably more balanced than using the NNS strategy. Recently, alternative methods for saturation mutagenesis have been described that include the “22c trick” [<xref rid="pone.0136778.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], MAX and ProxiMAX randomization methodology [<xref rid="pone.0136778.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0136778.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. These techniques use complex mixtures of oligonucleotides for saturation mutagenesis without bias, however the number of oligonucleotides required for randomization of more than 3 codons is impractical to handle. Of these only ProxiMAX, based on iterative cycles of blunt-ended ligation, PCR amplification and digestion, is suited to produce longer randomized contiguous codons, however with increased outlay of reagents and time.</p>
    <p>A major drawback of all these methods is that there is no real control on the amount of randomization and the nature of the amino acid substitutions at any given position. A convincing solution of these problems is offered only by gene synthesis strategies, which incorporate trinucleotide phosphoramidites as coupling units, as has already been demonstrated for immunoglobulins [<xref rid="pone.0136778.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0136778.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Mixtures of such trinucleotide blocks are applied at every codon position to be fully or partially randomized. This achieves full position-wise control over the amino acid exchange probability and the composition of the participating set of residues. On the other side of the balance sheet are problems with synthesis and efficient coupling of trinucleotide blocks. Several syntheses of trinucleotide phosphoramidites are described in the literature [<xref rid="pone.0136778.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0136778.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] but there is still room for improvement. Despite the obvious attractiveness of trinucleotide phosphoramidites, their application is still limited to just a few published examples [<xref rid="pone.0136778.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0136778.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0136778.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0136778.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] among which the already mentioned randomization of immunoglobulin variable domains is the most prominent. Utilization of anticalins, non-immunoglobulin scaffolds with hypervariable loops, for the development of new therapeutic strategies is the most promising biomedical approach for protein engineering strategies [<xref rid="pone.0136778.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].</p>
    <p>Here we describe a novel method of combinatorial gene synthesis exemplified by tHisF, a thermostable (β/α)<sub>8</sub>-protein [<xref rid="pone.0136778.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. The following reasons prompted us to choose tHisF as a model: Many enzymes are endowed with only minimal folding stability in the sense that at physiological temperatures they operate close to conformational collapse [<xref rid="pone.0136778.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. As a thermostable protein, tHisF could be expected to provide a broader bandwidth of stability at 37°C making it possible to observe orderly folded variants with different degrees of conformational destabilization. The generation of the library is based on total gene synthesis in which mixtures of pre-synthesized trinucleotide phosphoramidites are employed for chain elongation whenever a codon site to be randomized is reached. The method combines the advantages of controlled codon randomization with hierarchical fragment combinatorics, based on stable and well-established laboratory procedures. The reliability of the method is critically assessed by sequence analysis of a larger number of candidate clones picked at random from libraries of genes and gene fragments. For efficient library analysis, we developed a freely available software tool (MUSI) for sequence analysis of mutated gene sequences. Finally, the quality of the library was tested by assessment of the conformational stability of library members and selection for protein variants with HisF functions.</p>

      <title>Trimer phosphoramidite mixtures</title>
      <p>Fully protected trimer phosphoramidites (protecting groups: 5'-O: Dimethoxytrityl; internucleotidic phosphate residues: 2-Chlorophenyl; 3'-O-Diisopropylphosphoramidite: 2-Cyanoethyl) were purchased from Glen Research, Sterling, VA. Trimer phosphoramidite mixtures were prepared as follows. A trimer representing a resident codon (0.7 equivalents) was mixed with a standard mixture of 19 trimers, representing all amino acids except cysteine (0.3 equivalents together). Ten such mixtures were required to serve all 26 codon positions to be randomized; they were purchased pre-mixed from the supplier. The standard mixture of 19 had the following composition (first number in brackets: molar fraction as intended to be realized at the protein level as amino acid residues; second number: correction factor applied by the supplier to amounts of respective trimers in order to compensate for empirically determined differences of incorporation rates in oligonucleotide synthesis). <bold>A</bold>: GCT (0.053/1.5), <bold>D</bold>: GAC (0.137/1.3), <bold>E</bold>: GAA (0.093/1.9), <bold>F</bold>: TTC (0.018/1.3), <bold>G</bold>: GGT (0.071/1.1), <bold>H</bold>: CAT (0.067/1.9), <bold>I</bold>: ATC (0.022/1.2), <bold>K</bold>: AAA (0.101/1.1), <bold>L</bold>: CTG (0.037/1.2), <bold>M</bold>: ATG (0.017/1.3), <bold>N</bold>: AAC (0.053/1.0), <bold>P</bold>: CCG (0.038/1.8), <bold>Q</bold>: CAG (0.046/2.0), <bold>R</bold>: CGT (0.081/1.1), <bold>S</bold>: TCT (0.052/1.3), <bold>T</bold>: ACT (0.048/1.3), <bold>V</bold>: GTT (0.028/1.9), <bold>W</bold>: TGG (0.007/2.4), <bold>Y</bold>: TAC (0.031/1.6).

      <title>Oligonucleotides</title>
      <p>Oligonucleotides were chemically synthesized by PURIMEX, Grebenstein, Germany, at 100 nmol scale using an ABI model 392/394 synthesizer and applying standard conditions with the following modifications. Support: 2000 Å controlled pore size glass (ChemGenes, Wilmington, MA). Coupling catalyst: 0.2 M 5-Benzylmercaptotetrazole (emp Biotech, Berlin, Germany). Coupling time: 24 sec (monomers), 5 min (trimers). Base and phosphate deprotection: 32% ammonia, room temperature, 17 h, followed by 55°C, 4 h. Products were purified by two rounds of HPLC (5'-dimethoxytrityl groups on/off; matrix: Oligo R3, Perseptive Biosystems, Framingham, MA), followed by preparative PAGE. Yields ranged from 3 to 5 nmol.</p>
      <p>Sequences of chemically synthesized oligonucleotides (T1—T13) are listed below. Following the name of each oligonucleotide, its number of residues and the restriction sites flanking the corresponding double-stranded gene module are given in parentheses. Randomized positions are underscored with indicated sequences representing the corresponding wild type codons. Oligonucleotide T5 (two randomized positions) was used in the synthesis of library L26; for synthesis of L24, a second version of T5 was prepared with wild-type sequence throughout. The term "wild type" is used in the sense of "coding for wild-type protein sequence (including the C9A exchange)".</p>

      <title>MUSI (<underline>Mu</underline>tation <underline>si</underline>tes) sequence analysis tool</title>
      <p>The MUSI software tool was designed for sequence analysis of mutated gene sequences both by site-directed mutagenesis and by standard methods of random mutagenesis like error-prone PCR. MUSI is freely available for download at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://bioinf.uni-greifswald.de/bioinf/musi/musi.html">http://bioinf.uni-greifswald.de/bioinf/musi/musi.html</ext-link>. The tool identifies the mutations and exports them in Excel data sheets. The tool has to be provided with a reference sequence (the scaffold sequence) and the sequences to be compared to the reference sequence (the sequences obtained by mutating the scaffold sequence). It then fulfills the task of generating a detailed report on mutation events on nucleotide, codon, and amino acid level as well as summary analysis of the mutation events. The reference sequence, the target sequences, and—in case of site-directed mutagenesis—a sequence indicating the codon positions targeted by the directed mutagenesis have to be provided in FASTA format in aligned form (any standard multiple sequence alignment software will work for this). Hereby, the number of target sequences is limited to 250. MUSI is implemented in Java and runs on Windows as well as UNIX based systems. It has not been tested for Mac OS. Further details about how to use MUSI are provided in the manual that is included in the download package.</p>

      <p>The plasmid library preparation was used for electroporation of competent auxotrophic <italic>E</italic>.<italic>coli</italic> ΔhisF cells (Keio collection, National BioResource Project (NIG, Japan, JW2007). After one hour recovery in SOC medium at 37°C, the transformants were washed 2 times with PBS buffer and streaked on large M9 minimal plates, containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin, 200 ng/ml anhydrotetracycline and amino acid mix 19 (all amino acids except histidine—40 μg/ml; Trp– 20 μg/ml). As a negative control, cells were transformed with empty pASK-08 vector and as a positive control–with pASK-08-tHisF (wild type). The plates were incubated at 37°C for 2 days. At that time, visible colonies have grown both on selection plates and on those transformed with the positive control. In contrast, no growth could be detected on the negative control plates, transformed with the empty vector, even by prolonged incubation (5 days). A total of 287 clones were counted on the selective plates by a total titer of library transformants on non-selective LB-plates, containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin, of 1.8 x 10<sup>6</sup>. Single clones were picked from the selective plates and plasmid preparations were done.

Gly 81 and Gly 82, though meeting the above criteria, were not included in the set because they have combinations of dihedral angles Φ and Ψ not commonly observed with other amino acids.

        <title>Randomization parameters</title>
        <p>Parameters for incorporation of mixtures of trinucleotides were set as follows and applied in identical fashion to all randomized positions: <italic>(i)</italic> A standard mixture of 19 trinucleotide phosphoramidites was prepared representing all amino acids except cysteine. The latter was excluded in order to avoid complications arising from oxidation at the protein level. <italic>(ii)</italic> For each position, the trinucleotide representing the wild type residue was added to the standard trinucleotides mixture at a molar fraction of 0.7. Since the respective wild type trinucleotides were also present in the standard mixture–and to a variable degree (see below)–this lead to exchange probabilities per codon position closely clustered around an average of 0.28. For a library with 26 randomized positions this results in expected 7.31 codon exchanges on average; for 24 randomized positions in 6.69 (see below). <italic>(iii)</italic> A bias was introduced into the spectrum of exchange propensities of individual amino acids in favour of known surface [<xref rid="pone.0136778.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] and catalytic [<xref rid="pone.0136778.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] residues as follows. Molar fractions of corresponding trinucleotides in the standard mixture were adjusted to weighted means of their observed occurrence with weighting factor 0.75 for surface residues and 0.25 for catalytic residues (see <xref rid="pone.0136778.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>). Calculated molar fractions were further corrected for different chain elongation kinetics; for details refer to Materials and Methods.</p>

At the core of the strategy are single round DNA polymerase reactions and the potential of certain "Type IIS" restriction enzymes (in this case Esp31 and BsaI) to generate protruding DNA ends of arbitrarily chosen sequence [<xref rid="pone.0136778.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] (compare <xref rid="pone.0136778.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). This allows splitting of the gene into modules at any nucleotide outside of the randomized positions.</p>

            <p>(A) The gene sequence was divided into 14 modules (C1-C14). The black bars represent modules with wild type sequence; the red bars represent randomized sequences. The modules were chemically synthesized and randomization, which was achieved by incorporating trinucleotide mixtures at the corresponding codon positions, indicated by asterisks. Module C5 was synthesized both as wild type and as randomized sequence. The gene library was generated by combinatorial assembly of smaller modules (fragment libraries) at two steps, schematically represented with arrows. (B) Enzymatic steps involved in generation of double-stranded fragments and step-wise gene assembly. All C-fragments were designed in such a way that recognition sequences of Type RII restriction enzymes are located outside the coding sequence and are removed in the act of cleavage, whereas cleavage points in both DNA strands are within coding sequence but outside randomized DNA sites.

        <p>Twelve synthetic C-fragments have lengths between 57 and 86 nucleotides which is well within reach of chemical DNA synthesis. These were converted to blunt-end double stranded DNA by fill-in reaction using the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I (<xref rid="pone.0136778.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3B</xref>, top). Two modules not containing any randomized positions (C2 and C14 with lengths of 112 and 121 nucleotides, respectively) were prepared by PCR-copying from a previously synthesized <italic>thisF</italic> gene encoding wild type tHisF (this laboratory, unpublished).</p>
        <p>The resulting blunt-end fragments were analyzed by PAGE (<xref rid="pone.0136778.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig</xref>) and inserted into a TOPO vector, generating C-fragment clones (“black fragments"–compare <xref rid="pone.0136778.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A</xref>) and C-fragment libraries (“red fragments"). Transformation efficiencies of the eight C-fragment libraries were in the order of several thousand each (<xref rid="pone.0136778.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). According to our experience, such small numbers are not uncommon in transformation experiments involving chemically synthesized DNA. Thus, multiplicity of coverage of the theoretical combinatorial diversity spans a spectrum of approximately 19 fold (C1) to 10<sup>−3</sup> fold (C10). Due to two additional stages of combinatorial mixing (fragment ligation to yield libraries at levels B and A), as few as one thousand different sequences present in each of the eight C-module libraries would still open up a sequence space, available at level A, of (10<sup>3</sup>)<sup>8</sup> = 10<sup>24</sup> distinct molecular species–a merely formal number, way beyond the number of DNA molecules handled at any time during this experiment or restricted by the transformation bottlenecks.</p>
        <p>One clone of confirmed sequence was kept for further use from each non-randomized ("black") fragment; "red" fragments were stored as plasmid libraries.

        <title>Sequence Analysis</title>
        <p>Experimental DNA sequence analysis was carried out as described under Materials and Methods. In order to extract relevant information from crude primary data sets, software tool MUSI (<underline>Mu</underline>tation <underline>Si</underline>tes) was developed, which has been designed to be applicable to a broad range of mutagenesis experiments. MUSI software can be used for analysis of mutated gene sequences by site-directed mutagenesis and by standard methods of random mutagenesis like error-prone PCR. Starting from multiple sequence alignments, MUSI extracts sequence variations at randomized sites and throughout the entire gene length. It renders the results susceptible to further statistical analysis by exporting them into Excel tables. MUSI is freely available for download at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://bioinf.uni-greifswald.de/bioinf/musi/musi.html">http://bioinf.uni-greifswald.de/bioinf/musi/musi.html</ext-link>.

        <title>Overall Substitution Rates</title>
        <p>As pointed out under <italic>Library Design</italic>, trinucleotide mixtures were adjusted such as to produce substitutions at any randomized position with a probability of 0.28. <xref rid="pone.0136778.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> summarizes substitution rates as observed by sequencing 828 clones of 14 different full size and fragment libraries. We define the observed substitution rate at a given randomized position as the number of non-wild-type codons found at that position, divided by the number of clones sequenced to determine that number. The close agreement of observed and expected substitution rate is a first indicator of good control over gene synthesis with partial randomization.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec043">
        <title>Individual Substitution Rates</title>
        <p>Free choice of relative representation of different codons at randomized sites is an important element of controlled library synthesis. These representations are established by coupling reactions in which different trinucleotides are present in excess and compete in mixture for free 5'-hydroxyl groups of growing, immobilized chains. Since the elongation reactions are irreversible, the representations are controlled by the forward reaction rates. Assuming first-order reactions and equal rate constants, codon representations should reflect their molar ratios in the codon mixtures. Molar ratios can be corrected by empirical adjustment factors to compensate for different reactivities (compare below).</p>
        <p>Again, DNA sequence analysis of a large number of clones must be used for assessing to what degree such synthesis plans were borne out by experiment. The problem can be looked at from two complementary sides: One can measure the rates by which individual resident codons are substituted by any of the eighteen other codons and one can measure the efficiencies of different trinucleotides to compete with others in replacing a resident codon. Both calculations were carried out on the cumulative data set stated in <xref rid="pone.0136778.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> (10,116 codons at randomized positions, 2,762 codon substitutions).</p>
        <p>The 26 codons of the <italic>thisF</italic> gene selected for controlled partial randomization comprise ten different wild-type ("resident") codons, occurring between one and seven times. Their rates of substitution for non-resident codons are displayed in <xref rid="pone.0136778.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6A</xref>.</p>

Comparison of the expected exchange probabilities (the fraction of foreign trimers in each trinucleotide mixture) with the observed exchange rate per type of resident codon (cumulative, sample size: 2762 exchanges). The number of resident amino acids among the 26 selected positions is indicated in parentheses, below is the respective codon. The differences in the expected exchange probabilities per type of residue are due to the biased composition of the trimer mix. The thick horizontal line indicates the average exchange probability (0.28), the dashed line–the average observed exchange rate (0.27). (B) Pertaining to replacing residues. Comparison of the expected frequency distribution of the amino acid exchanges (the molar ratio of each trimer in the trinucleotide mixture) with the observed frequency distribution for a sample of 2762 trinucleotide exchanges. (C) Binomial distribution of the number of mutations in L24 and L26. The observed distribution of the number of mutations per molecule (mutant class) is compared with the expected one (number of representatives in each mutant class for the given sample size = occurrences). The expected distribution of the mutant classes (L24: k = 1–24; L26: k = 1–26) is calculated according to the binomial distribution for a sample size of 239 sequences (L24) and 76 sequences (L26).</p>

        </fig>
        <p>There is fairly good agreement between expected and observed substitution rates (due to different contributions made to the standard mixture by different trinucleotides, calculated rates are not identical throughout). Small but significant deviations are, however, apparent: Exchange rates observed at Gly and His codons are markedly higher, those at Ile, Lys and Thr codons lower than expected. This could be due to either inaccurate weighing in the preparation of codon mixtures or to intrinsic differences in coupling efficiencies, which were not compensated appropriately by individual adjustment factors (compare above). In the latter case, the observed over- and underrepresentations should be mirrored by opposite effects in the set of rates with which different codons recruited from the standard mixture substitute resident codons; relevant data are illustrated in <xref rid="pone.0136778.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6B</xref>.</p>
        <p>With respect to this latter question, no compelling message emerges from <xref rid="pone.0136778.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6B</xref>: In some cases the agreement between expected and observed representation is good, in others it is not–the most drastic deviations being seen with Tyr (two-fold over-represented) and Arg (two-fold under-represented). The mirror trend of over- and under-representations between Fig <xref rid="pone.0136778.g006" ref-type="fig">6A and 6B</xref>, considered in the previous paragraph, is seen with Gly, Lys and Thr, but not with His and Ile, which would argue more in favour of weighing inaccuracies. It should, however, be kept in mind that in some cases <italic>(i</italic>.<italic>e</italic>. broken down to individual amino acids) the sample sizes on which <xref rid="pone.0136778.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6B</xref> is based are fairly small (0.01 normalized frequency of occurrence corresponds to not more than 28 cases).</p>

        <p>The deliberately set substitution probability of 0.28 per randomized codon position is expected to result in an average number of 7.3 substitutions per gene in L26 and 6.7 substitutions in L24 with binomial distribution around these mean values. <xref rid="pone.0136778.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6C</xref> shows the experimentally determined distribution of both full size libraries–in comparison with the respective expectation. There is generally good agreement between observed and expected distribution and with L24 there is less fluctuation around expected values than with L26.

        <p>Deletions of three consecutive nucleotides (Δ3) associated with randomized positions occur in the percent range and are thus the most frequent of all types of unintended sequence deviations. This obviously reflects the unfavorable chain elongation kinetics of the trinucleotide synthons used (note that a missing trinucleotide at a randomized position requires failure of both the corresponding elongation reaction and the subsequent capping of the unreacted 5'-hydroxyl group by acetic anhydride).</p>
        <p>While the occasional missing of a single codon at a randomized site may be a rather innocuous mistake, its frequency could be decreased by any of the following measures: <italic>(i)</italic> use of more reactive trinucleotide blocks, <italic>(ii)</italic> further increase in trinucleotide excess, <italic>(iii)</italic> further increase in reaction time, <italic>(iv)</italic> stronger capping conditions. With option <italic>(iii)</italic> one may run into the problem of partial detritylation of trimer building blocks due to their longer exposure to the mildly acidic coupling agent. In this context it is significant to note that only one instance was observed in which two trimers were incorporated in one step.</p>
        <p>A total of 51 deletions of a single nucleotide (Δ1) were detected within the sample of 10116 sequenced randomized sites (<xref rid="pone.0136778.t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). This corresponds to a 0.5% contamination of trinucleotides by dinucleotides (under the simplifying assumption of identical incorporation kinetics). 38 cases can be attributed to the incorporation of a dinucleotide of the standard set lacking its 5'-terminal residue, 2 to a lacking central residue, 1 to a lacking 3'-terminal residue and 10 cannot be explained as being derived from the trinucleotides of the standard set by lacking one residue. Taken together, these results point to failure of the last coupling step in a 3'→5' trinucleotide synthesis scheme as the most frequent source of contaminating dinucleotides.</p>

        <title>Practical Diversity of Library</title>
        <p>Only genes encoding full-length proteins with sequences within the constraints set by the synthetic design can count as contributing to library diversity in a practically useful way. If one includes in this count (the low number of) unintended nucleotide substitutions and Δ3 deletions, one arrives, in first approximation, at a practical library diversity by subtracting from the number of independent transformants the number of candidate clones carrying stop codons (not observed here) or frameshift mutations. With a gene length of 260 codons (<xref rid="pone.0136778.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>) and a cumulative frequency of Δ1 and Δ2 mutations per codon of 0.54% for randomized and 0.26% for non-randomized sites, the probability (P) for the occurrence of a frameshift-free gene for L24 is:

        <p>In other words: With the quality of reagents and the chemical procedures available for this study, half of all primary transformants are wasted as frameshift mutants. In comparison, other sources of diversity reduction, such as multiple occurrences of individual molecular species in the classes of very low number of mutations, are insignificant. The result highlights the tight quality constraints in chemical synthesis of gene libraries and points to limitations, which will need to be addressed first in any future efforts of further improvements.</p>

        <title>Calculation of the actual library diversity</title>
        <p>The true measure of library diversity, i.e. the functional library size, is the number of different molecular species, existing in the library population, corrected with the fraction of correctly assembled clones without frameshifts or stop codons. Standard methods for codon randomization produce redundant sequences and stop codons and the actual library diversity can be orders of magnitude below the reported number of transformants.</p>
        <p>Here the actual diversity of the two libraries L24 and L26 is calculated, which represents the number of unique members that exist in any copy number, counting each single member only once. The calculation is based on the experimentally determined binomial distribution and assuming equal probability of occurrence for all possible clones.</p>

When increasing number of codons are randomized, there is a reduction in the efficiency of randomization due to inevitable cloning of redundant codons. For n = 26 the ratio genes: proteins is 2 x 10<sup>5</sup>. In contrast, the L26 library generated with the current method for combinatorial chemical synthesis results in 0.89 x 10<sup>8</sup> unique proteins encoded by 0.9 x 10<sup>8</sup> frameshift-free genes, thus the ratio genes: proteins is 1.01.</p>

        <title>Fraction of conformationally stable proteins</title>
        <p>A sample of 48 clones was chosen at random from the subset of L24 genes having complete open reading frames (deletions of three consecutive nucleotides permitted). Levels of accumulation of protein in the soluble fraction of induced cells were visualized by subjecting cell lysates to SDS gel electrophoresis and Western blotting as shown in <xref rid="pone.0136778.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7</xref>. Robust protein accumulation is observed in the majority of cases, exceptions being clones #7, #8, #12, #20 and #25 which accumulate significantly less full-length protein and/or show multiple degradation bands. There is published evidence that within a set of sequence derivatives of one particular protein, solubility and (relative) protease resistance are good proxies for conformational stability (see, for example [<xref rid="pone.0136778.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]). By that criterion, we estimate the fraction of conformationally stable proteins in the full-reading-frame subset of L24 to be ca. 90%.</p>

The strong accumulators carried 6.0 replacements and 0.2 three-nucleotide deletions on average, the weak accumulators 8.4 replacements and 0.6 3N-deletions (note that in the latter case the sample comprises only five genes). The mean values for the complete sample are 6.3 and 0.25, respectively. The high proportion of stable proteins (90%), together with the asymmetric distribution of numbers of replacements between the two classes can be taken as indicating that the starting assumption of a set of amino acid residues with no influence on folding as well as the chosen randomization parameters are, in first approximation, justified.</p>

        <title>tHisF Variants with HisF function</title>
        <p>In a first test experiment for the feasibility of our method, we searched for clones that are able to complement an <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> Δ<italic>hisF</italic> mutant. Wild type tHisF is known to complement histidine auxotrophic <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> cells lacking a functional hisF gene [<xref rid="pone.0136778.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. We preferred this approach over a screen for new enzymatic functions, since we could make solid predictions about the number of clones we have to find, allowing us to test the method much more rigorously. Searching for new enzymatic activity and failing to detect them would not give a clear answer. That is, it would be unclear whether we just failed to detect those, whether there was intrinsic shortcoming in our procedure or whether the new activity could not be generated.</p>
        <p>As shown above, library L24 contains ca. 50% complete open reading frames among which about 90% code for proteins accumulating in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> cells in soluble form. The frequency of the wild-type HisF sequence in the protein library corresponds to the Zero-term of the binomial distribution (about 1.4 x 10–4 for L26 –corrected for complete frames and fraction of stable proteins). Sampling 106 transformants in a routine experiment should therefore yield more than 100 wild type <italic>hisF</italic> genes. Moreover, one would expect an unknown number of mutants closely clustered around the wild type HisF in the sequence space and carrying amino acid exchanges specifically in the subset of the 26 randomized amino acid positions that are not essential for the HisF function. <xref rid="pone.0136778.t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref> gives a summary of the outcome of the experiment. Twelve protein variants were selected, among them the wild type HisF, as expected. This demonstrates that the approach is in principle viable. In sequenced clones, only nine of 26 randomized positions could be demonstrated to accept mutations under conservation of HisF function. The average number of amino acid substitutions in the selected set is 1.6. With respect to chemical characteristics of the residues involved, the observed substitutions are generally of a conservative nature. Taken together, rather stringent structural constraints emerge for HisF function. This result is not too surprising in view of the demanding two-step reaction catalyzed by HisF [<xref rid="pone.0136778.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>].</p>

        <p>Since the diversity of the chemically produced library used for transformation is very much larger than 106, each candidate clone can be expected to code for a protein of unique sequence. This should make it possible to find candidates meeting certain arbitrarily set functional requirements as long as these are not too demanding with respect to protein structure. The high functional diversity of the library should significantly improve the outcome of future experiments for selection of catalytically performing proteins.</p>
        <p>As already elaborated in the introduction, the claim that trinucleotides are superior in library construction to other methods for generating randomized oligonucleotides coding for protein variant could largely be demonstrated, although, as already discussed above, it might be improved by optimizing chemical synthesis in order to eliminate frameshift mutations. Another aspect is the introduction of the library into the cells. Here we used total gene synthesis with subsequent introduction of the gene variants into cells <italic>via</italic> transformation. An option to be considered is multiplex automated genome engineering (MAGE) described by the Church lab [<xref rid="pone.0136778.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Here, a culture of <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> cells is repeatedly transfected with the randomized oligonucleotides and the mutations are transferred to a gene residing either in the chromosome or on a plasmid with the help of the lambda red recombination system. This is certainly a viable option since this procedure can be repeated over and over, which might be advantageous for optimization of selected protein variants with low activity. The MAGE method enables generation of high sequence diversity. However, one loses some control of the degree of randomization if mutating multiple positions in a genome, which our method offers. Furthermore, there is no immediate estimate of the diversity of the <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> population. The advantages of MAGE are mainly offered if the selection or screening procedure can be applied to proliferating <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> cells. If, however, any other labor intensive screening procedure is necessary, it would be rather advantageous to keep complete control on the experimental parameters, in particular to know exactly the diversity of the library.</p>

    <title>Conclusions</title>
    <p>The thorough statistical analysis demonstrates that trinucleotide randomization is a method of choice that allows any required subset of amino acids to be encoded exclusively and reliably. The use of trinucleotides mixtures for controlled randomization avoids the codon redundancy and the inevitable incorporation of stop codons when standard methods for randomization with degenerate oligonucleotides are used and achieves high functional diversity. No PCR was involved for amplification of mutagenized fragments and hence no concomitant skewing of library composition due to amplification bias. The new approach for combinatorial assembly of gene fragments combines the advantages of trimer phosphoramidites with easy and cost-effective design of a gene library. The cost of the gene library is generally restricted to the purchase of trimer phosphoramidites and oligonucleotide synthesis and depends on the number of positions for randomization. The method requires low cost consumables for the additional biochemical procedures and no special laboratory equipment. For a summary of the method, see <xref rid="pone.0136778.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig 8</xref>.</p>

        <p><italic>Library design</italic>: the method imposes no restrictions to the number of residues selected for mutagenesis or to their location. The composition of the trinucleotide mixture and the exchange rate can be freely chosen without any limitations. Contact the oligonucleotide synthesis company of your choice well in advance and coordinate the purchase of trimer phosphoramidites. <italic>Assembly design</italic>: The fractionation of the gene sequence into modules depends on the locations of the residues for randomization. Divide the gene sequence into modules with a length between 40 bp and 90 bp, containing the mutagenized codons. The fragment borders of the modules should create unique overhands for ligation assembly after restriction digestion (see <xref rid="pone.0136778.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> and main text for details). Use PCR for longer stretches of wild type gene sequence. <italic>Chemical synthesis</italic>: Invest efforts and resources into high quality oligonucleotide synthesis as well as cloning and analysis of the C-libraries. The chemically synthesized diversity is stored in them and they are the starting point for all future gene libraries. Clone a wild type sequence, corresponding to each mutagenized module. <italic>Library synthesis</italic>: Generate B-fragment libraries by ligation from C-fragment libraries. Different B-fragment libraries (1, …, n) can be obtained in parallel by exchanging or mixing mutagenized modules with the corresponding wild type modules. Archive the B-libraries. Generate gene libraries by ligation assembly of B-libraries. Use the combinatorics approach for generation of multiple unique gene libraries.</p>

    <p>The splitting of the gene into multiple modules depends on the location and number of the randomized positions. There are no constrains as to the number of modules or the number of randomized codons per module. The length of the randomized modules is restricted by the synthesis of oligonucleotides up to a length of about 90 nucleotides. Longer stretches of gene sequence without randomized positions can be amplified by PCR. The fragment borders of the modules should create unique overhands for ligation assembly after restriction digestion. Since the restriction enzymes of Type IIS cleave an arbitrary sequence outside of their recognition sequence, the splitting of the gene into modules can be done at any nucleotide outside of the randomized positions.</p>
    <p>The mutual exchange of a mutagenized library fragment with a wild type fragment or vice versa allows numerable iterations at a later stage without the need to start “from the beginning”. The mutation rate at specific positions can be controlled by simply mixing or exchanging the wild type and the randomized fragment without need of new chemical synthesis, which considerably reduces the costs for library synthesis. The easy control over the combinatorics and the reliable storage of low diversity at the stage of fragment libraries allows the generation of new unique libraries by each ligation and transformation procedure. The new method for combinatorial gene synthesis can be broadly applied to engineering of gene libraries for screening of new functional mutants, being directly relevant for industries such as biomedicine or biotechnology.</p>
