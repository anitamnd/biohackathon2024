      <p>Quantitative proteomics has evolved
considerably over the last
decade with the advent of higher order multiplexing (HOM) techniques.
With the development of methods such as—multitagging, cPILOT,
hyperplexing, BONPlex, and MITNCAT, the HOM technique is rapidly taking
the center stage in multiplexed quantitative proteomics. These studies
combined MS<sup>1</sup> and MS<sup>2</sup> labels in a single experiment
enabling higher sample throughput. While HOM is highly promising,
the computational analysis is still a big challenge, as the available
tools cannot harness its power completely. We have developed a new
quantitative pipeline, HyperQuant to aid in accurately quantitating
complex HOM data. The pipeline uses identification results from either
MaxQuant or any other search engine and quantitation results from
QuantWiz<sup>IQ</sup>. The Mapper and Combiner modules of HyperQuant
allow facile integration of the labeled data, along with peptide spectrum
match (PSM) intensity/ratio integration for proteins, respectively,
for each PSM label combination. This also includes appropriate combination
of replicates/fractions before summarizing the protein intensity/ratio,
leading to robust quantitation. To the best of our knowledge, this
is the first tool for the quantitation of HOM data with flexibility
for any combination of MS<sup>1</sup> and MS<sup>2</sup> labels. We
demonstrate its utility in analyzing two 18-plex data sets from the
hyperplexing and the BONplex studies. The tool is open source and
freely available for noncommercial use. HyperQuant is a highly valuable
tool that will help in advancing the field of multiplexed quantitative
proteomics.</p>

    <title>Introduction</title>
    <p>Proteomics has enabled
the high throughput study of cellular systems
to uncover the mechanisms regulating cellular health and disease.
Understanding the cellular signaling networks or perturbations to
different types of stimuli requires robust and reproducible quantitation
at a large scale. Quantitative proteomics has made it possible to
identify as well as quantify proteins from multiple conditions in
a single run.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref></sup> Protein quantitation in
shotgun proteomics is carried out using metabolic or chemical labeling.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref></sup> Metabolic labeling of proteins with SILAC (stable
isotope labeling of amino acids in cell culture) replaces essential
amino acids in the cell culture with their stable isotope-labeled
counterparts (such as heavy lysine or arginine).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref></sup> The separate cultures from normal (light) and labeled (heavy)
samples are subsequently mixed in equal amounts, digested, and analyzed
by LC–MS/MS. The peptides from the two samples are reflected
in MS<sup>1</sup> spectra as pairs separated by known mass differences
between light and heavy peptides. On sequencing in MS/MS, the peptides
are identified by database search followed by FDR control,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref></sup> while their MS<sup>1</sup> intensities are a
proxy for their relative quantitation. Because of mixing the cell
cultures early in the workflow, it is the most accurate technique
for quantitation. However, biological samples cannot always be labeled
in cell culture and require chemical labeling. In chemical labeling
techniques such as iTRAQ<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref></sup> (isobaric tags
for relative and absolute quantitation) or TMT<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref></sup> (tandem mass tag), digested peptides from two to sixteen samples
are labeled with different variants of isobaric tags that label the
N-termini and the free amino group on lysine residues.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref></sup> The isobaric tags increase the mass of peptides from all
samples equally, and the peaks in MS<sup>1</sup> represent a sum of
peptide intensities from all samples. Upon fragmentation in MS/MS,
the unique mass reporter ions from iTRAQ/TMT tags are observed in
the low mass region, while the sequencing peaks are used for identification.
The reporter peaks help in relative quantitation between the samples.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref></sup> While these techniques have made proteome-wide
quantitation possible, strategies that enhance the depth and multiplexing
capacity of quantitation are desirable for systems biology studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref></sup></p>
    <p>With the advancements in higher order multiplexing
(HOM) technologies
(combining MS<sup>1</sup> and MS<sup>2</sup> labels), designing a
statistically robust experiment with high sample throughput is now
feasible for studying proteome dynamics at systems level.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref></sup> Identifying and quantifying proteins up to 54
conditions in a single run of the mass spectrometer with the help
of HOM considerably reduces the technical variability arising because
of multiple runs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref></sup> Since the first experiment
performed in 2010, the technology has vastly evolved with different
combinations of metabolic and chemical labeling such as multitagging,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref></sup> cPILOT,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>−<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref></sup> hyperplexing,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref></sup> SILAC-iTRAQ tails,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref></sup> TMT-SILAC hyperplexing,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref></sup> BONPlex,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref51">51</xref></sup> MITNCAT,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref></sup> and mPDP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref></sup> to achieve higher
sample throughput in a single mass spectrometry run. Even though the
technique has been around for almost a decade, the computational analysis
is still lagging behind and is performed with two different searches
and custom scripts for analysis. Using conventional tools, the quantitative
analysis is cumbersome as the individual runs inadvertently summarize
protein quantitation incorrectly. The dual search strategy is performed
to identify peptides as no search engine can search for two modifications
together on one amino acid. For identification of peptides labeled
with both MS<sup>1</sup> and MS<sup>2</sup>, a modified MS<sup>1</sup> search (including mass of MS<sup>2</sup> label) is conducted which
provides a summed up MS<sup>1</sup> quantitation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref></xref>A). For quantitation of MS<sup>2</sup> labels, another search is performed for MS<sup>2</sup> combination
with lighter MS<sup>1</sup>, and custom scripts are written to derive
MS<sup>2</sup> quantitation of heavier MS<sup>1</sup> combinations
(<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref></xref>B). The downstream
analysis becomes a challenge that requires custom analysis suited
to each experiment type for the correct biological interpretation
or designing ingenious experiments to evade the need for quantitation
from one of the labels, limiting the capacity of HOM.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref></sup> For example, in the 18-plex hyperplexing study, the SILAC
labels were used for biological replicates, while TMT labels were
used for time points.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref></sup> Two database searches
were conducted—one for each label as fixed modification and
quantitation was performed using in-house program Vista.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref></sup> The use of two types of chemical labels in cPILOT
allowed it to be useful for biological and clinical samples that cannot
be metabolically labeled. The protein ratios in the cPILOT studies
were calculated with the help of an internal standard reporter ion,
thus requiring one of the reporters to be used as an internal standard.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref></sup> In TMT-SILAC hyperplexing study, the SILAC labels
were used to study the kinetics of protein quantitation over time points labeled by TMT
labels. Two searches were performed, one with SILAC as a fixed label,
yielding SILAC ratios and one with only TMT labels. A kinetics model
was calculated based on reporter ion intensities to calculate protein
synthesis and degradation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref></sup> In MITNCAT
study, the protein dynamics was studied with the TMT labels at specific
time points, while SILAC and AHA labels were used exclusively for
protein selection in a time window.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref></sup></p>

comparison of data analysis performed by current tools
versus HyperQuant. Current tools cannot quantitate the HOM data correctly.
Manipulating label definitions in search tools (SILAC-Light, SILAC-Medium,
and SILAC-Heavy) can help in the identification of PSMs but not correct
protein quantitation whether MS<sup>1</sup>-based search (SILAC search)
or MS<sup>2</sup>-based search (iTRAQ/TMT) is used. (A) MS<sup>1</sup> quantitative search will combine the quantitative contribution from
all six time points of each SILAC into the respective MS<sup>1</sup> peaks (L/M/H), as depicted by the colored boxes (light blue, light
red, and light yellow). (B) MS<sup>2</sup> search only allows identification
and quantitation of SILAC light-based reporters. The SILAC medium
and SILAC heavy reporters will not be identified or quantified. (C)
HyperQuant combines data from A with reporter quantitation from QuantWiz<sup>IQ</sup> to correctly carry out quantitation across each SILAC-iTRAQ
combination separately.</p>

    <p>Despite the obvious benefits
of the HOM technique to provide reproducible,
cost-, and time-efficient study designs, it is not yet fully exploited
as a regular proteomic workflow because of challenges in computational
analysis and mixing of quantitation from MS<sup>1</sup> and MS<sup>2</sup> labels.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref></sup> To enable easy and flexible
analysis of data from HOM studies, we have designed a computational
pipeline—HyperQuant, which is the first tool that collates,
deconvolutes labels, summarizes, and calculates normalized protein
intensities or ratios for each condition (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref></xref>C). The normalized intensities can be used
to calculate relative protein ratios from any combination of metabolic
or chemical labels as per the experiment to facilitate uncomplicated
biological interpretations. HyperQuant is flexible enough to use the
results from any search engine provided in a simple predefined text
format making it interoperable with many search engines. The peptide
and protein quantitation is performed by combining data from multiple
replicates and can output the summarized protein intensity. HyperQuant
has several advantages apart from experiment-agnostic integration
of HOM data. It also rescues proteins with a low number of peptide
spectrum matches (PSMs) in individual replicates as combining PSMs
before outlier removal or filtering saves consistently occurring replicate
level one-hit wonders. Apart from rescuing protein identifications,
increasing the number of peptide data points can enhance the statistical
confidence in the protein quantitation. The poorer (or highly variable)
quantitation values across replicates will be removed during an outlier
removal. HyperQuant also provides normalized intensities for each
sample used in the experiment, thus giving users the flexibility in
choosing any denominator for ratio calculation. To demonstrate the
utility of the pipeline; we have reanalyzed the 18-plex hyperplexing
data from Dephoure and Gygi<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref></sup> and compared
HyperQuant results with the results from their study.</p>
    <p>We also
analyzed our previously published data of “hyperplexing
and click chemistry” (later named BONPlex),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref></sup> investigating the effect of mycobacterial
infection on human macrophage secretome using a combination of pSILAC,
AHA, and iTRAQ. Although macrophage secretome has been previously
studied using similar techniques by Eichaelbaum et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref></sup> using pSILAC with AHA and Khan et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref></sup> using targeted proteomics, these studies used either LPS or attenuated
bacteria to create an immune response. The sample multiplexing was
merely 2–3 plex and involved multiple 2-plex experiments for
temporal study.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref></sup> Our study exploited AHA
with the power of the HOM technique to reduce the need for multiple
experiments and run-to-run variability.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref51">51</xref></sup> The study was also unique for using clinical and lab strains of
Mtb instead of LPS, thus providing more realistic insights into the
elicited immune response. The experiment focused only on newly synthesized
secreted proteins and their temporal profile upon infection. Quantifying
the secretome can aid in understanding the dynamics of the host–pathogen
crosstalk. With the help of HyperQuant, strain specific as well as
temporal changes in the host secretome were quantitated demonstrating
its utility in a truly HOM experiment.</p>

  <sec id="sec2">
    <title>Results &amp; Discussion</title>
    <p>The novel design of an HOM experiment allows two types of labels
for two quantitative dimensions (MS<sup>1</sup> and MS<sup>2</sup>) in one MS run. This can be conceptually represented as a 2-D matrix
to explain two types of labeling (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref></xref>A,B). To ensure the complete biological understanding
of the conditions labeled, the quantitation must be performed on both
the dimensions of the matrix. The analysis is a challenge with the
current tools, necessitating multiple searches for quantitating both
labels and custom analysis scripts. This does not completely harness
the power of HOM studies. To exploit the true multiplexing nature
of technology and easy quantitation without any loss of information
on any label, we designed the HyperQuant tool to integrate identification
with quantitation along with replicate combination. There are two
modules in the HyperQuant tool—Mapper and Combiner. Mapper
aids in mapping of PSM identification and quantification results from
MaxQuant and QuantWiz<sup>IQ</sup> outputs, respectively. Apart from
MaxQuant, users also have the flexibility to use any other identification
engine using a simple text format that specifies PSM and label information.
The Combiner module integrates the PSMs from all replicates and summarizes
the protein intensity/ratio depending on the user choice. The detailed
workflow of the tool is shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref></xref>C.</p>
    <sec id="sec2.1">
      <title>Benchmarking of the HyperQuant Tool Using
Hyperplexing Data</title>
      <p>We tested the pipeline for identifying
and quantifying the proteome
using Dephoure and Gygi data.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref></sup> We searched
the 3 × 6 experiment (18-plex) from Dephoure study using MaxQuant,
performed spectra level quantitation by QuantWiz<sup>IQ</sup>, and
integrated the results using the HyperQuant pipeline to obtain protein
ratios. For this particular data, we used the weighted average method
for calculating protein ratios as per the original study. We compared
our results obtained from the pipeline with their protein list. Despite
using different tools (Sequest<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref></sup> vs MaxQuant),
we observed that ∼84% of the proteins identified were matching
(<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>A). The number
of peptides identified in light, medium, and heavy SILAC channels
also showed good corroboration (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>B). Our reanalysis identified 394 more proteins, while
100 proteins were missed, but we did not analyze it further as we
were only interested in quantitative comparison for common proteins.</p>

the TMT<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref></sup> labels for each SILAC channel—light,
medium, and heavy separately. Because the protein ratio method used
here uses peptide numbers as weights, there are some differences attributable
to differences in peptide identifications (because of different search
engines); thereby altering quantitation marginally. We still observed
high ratio concordance across all labels. These results suggest that
the HyperQuant pipeline is able to analyze HOM data and can accurately
calculate the quantitative values for every label combination.</p>

    <sec id="sec2.2">
      <title>Analysis
of BONPlex Data</title>
      <p>BONPlex study was designed
to investigate the effect of mycobacterial infection (clinical and
laboratory strains) on the human macrophage secretome. In this study,
BONCAT was used to study the newly translated proteins secreted by
THP-1 human macrophages after mycobacterial infection (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref></xref>A). The second technique, SILAC
was used as a pulsed medium and heavy labels to tag the THP-1 cells
infected with different mycobacterial strains namely H37Ra (medium)
and H37Rv (heavy) in one set, while BND433 (medium) and JAL2287 (heavy)
in another, each with their respective light SILAC uninfected controls.
The pulsed SILAC allowed selective labeling of newly synthesized proteins
in a time-window postinfection, while AHA allowed their selective
enrichment (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref></xref>B). Although the light channel contains both pre-existing as well
as newly synthesized proteins, which would be otherwise indistinguishable,
the BONCAT labels allows for their selective enrichment, removing
this quantitation bias. The third technique is isobaric quantitation
with iTRAQ used to label six time points of each infection in the
THP-1 cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref></xref>C) from 6 to 26 h at 4 h intervals. The labeled and digested secretome
from the light, medium, and heavy SILAC, each with 6-plex iTRAQ labeling
for time points were mixed, separated by LC, and analyzed by tandem
MS. MaxQuant was used to identify the spectra while the in-house developed
tool QuantWiz<sup>IQ</sup> was used to calculate iTRAQ areas for each
time point. The HyperQuant tool was used to integrate the data from
identification and quantitation followed by replicate combination
and calculation of ratios from the areas.</p>

      <p>After removing contaminants

secretome (NSS) proteins using BONPlex in both the experiments combined
together. We observed 343 proteins in set 1 with laboratory strains
and 213 proteins in set 2 with clinical strains (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsomega.0c00515/suppl_file/ao0c00515_si_002.xlsx">Table S2</ext-link>). We observed that the number of secreted proteins
in infected cells reduces considerably as compared to uninfected cells
in both the sets (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref></xref>A,B). We found that 81, 46, 59, and 36 proteins were secreted
in response to infection with H37Ra (avirulent), H37Rv (virulent),
BND433 (clinical virulent), and JAL2287 (clinical virulent) respectively,
which are hereafter referred to as Ra, Rv, BND, and JAL for the sake
of brevity. We compared the proteins identified in uninfected and
infected THP-1 cells in Set 1 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref></xref>A) and Set 2 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref></xref>B). We observed that majority of the proteins expressed
in the control (246 in set 1 and 144 in set 2) are not expressed in
infection hinting at suppression of the cellular function, as also
observed in <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsomega.0c00515/suppl_file/ao0c00515_si_001.pdf">Figure S4A,B</ext-link>. Some proteins
are expressed exclusively in infected cells (34, 17, 24, and 15 proteins

(Rv, BND, and JAL) for comparison against the avirulent Ra as well
as the controls from both the sets (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsomega.0c00515/suppl_file/ao0c00515_si_001.pdf">Figure S4C</ext-link>). We observed 27 and 48 proteins to be exclusive to avirulent and
virulent strains, respectively. By observing the quantitation of proteins
identified, we found that the majority of proteins secreted in different
infections are downregulated (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref></xref>C, down + absent in infection &amp; <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsomega.0c00515/suppl_file/ao0c00515_si_001.pdf">Figure S5A,B</ext-link>).

cellular response (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref></xref>E). The proteins absent in any of the infection were not considered
in this analysis. The macrophages secrete these proteins to probably
aid in the initiation of an immune response. Failure to initiate an
immune response leads to apoptosis or necrosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref></sup> The mycobacteria, on the other hand, tries to block the
signals that can lead to immune response or tries to force production
of anti-inflammatory proteins which may be a fail-safe mechanism in
case some inflammatory signals leak out to the extracellular region.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref></sup> In order to identify proteins that can mount
an immune response, we queried UniProt for specific immunomodulatory
keywords. We found 9 chemokines, 43 cytokines, 11 laminins, 14 proteases,
6 matrix metalloproteases, and 3 caspases. We also observed that 275
proteins identified were involved in signaling mechanisms. As we were
studying macrophages responses, we also observed proteins involved
in bacterial response (6 proteins), immune response (55 proteins),
or inflammatory response (48 proteins) in our keyword searches (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsomega.0c00515/suppl_file/ao0c00515_si_001.pdf">Tables S1 and S3</ext-link>).</p>

      <title>Common NSS Proteins in
All Four Infections</title>
      <p>We observed
sixteen proteins expressed in all four infections. Except one (CSF1R
was absent in control of set 2), all of the proteins were observed
in control as well as in infections. CSF1R is the macrophage colony
stimulating factor-1 receptor that acts as a cell surface receptor
for CSF1 and IL34 and is important for release of proinflammatory
chemokines.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">32</xref></sup> It is a tyrosine kinase that
activates the signaling for MAPK, STAT3, and PIP3 pathways.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">33</xref></sup> It was downregulated in Ra, Rv, and BND infections
but was upregulated in initial time points of JAL infection, which
later was downregulated by the last time point (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsomega.0c00515/suppl_file/ao0c00515_si_001.pdf">Figure S7</ext-link>).</p>
      <p>Among the other 15 proteins (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsomega.0c00515/suppl_file/ao0c00515_si_001.pdf">Figure S7</ext-link>), all proteins were either downregulated
or unchanged in all infections except for IL1RN and PPT1 in JAL. IL1RN
is the receptor antagonist of IL1 that inhibits the binding of IL1
(α and β) to its receptor and reduces the inflammatory
response. In unstimulated macrophages, it is expressed to prevent
any unwanted inflammatory response due to nonspecific stimuli.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34">34</xref></sup> During Ra infections, it gets highly downregulated
in later time points as the macrophage exhibits delayed immune response
and increased production of IL1β to contain Ra bacilli. In Rv
infection, however, the secretion levels kept increasing in later
time points, although it does not qualify as differentially expressed
at our threshold criteria (±2 fold change). During BND infection,
it remains downregulated in the secretome for the first few time points,
while gradually increasing in the last time point. In JAL infection,
it was overexpressed consistently, demonstrating its heightened capability
to suppress the immune response. PPT1 is a thioesterase responsible
for negative regulation of apoptotic processes in infections. It removes
protein palmitoylation, thus regulating the cellular localization
of substrates to cytosol.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref35">35</xref></sup> It was significantly
downregulated only in one time point (6 h) in Ra. In Rv, the expression
was initially low which then increased to normal levels by 14 h and
dropped back to lower levels again by 26 h. In BND infection, the
secretion behavior was similar to Ra infection, which was under expressed
only in one time point. However, it was significantly upregulated
in JAL infection.</p>

      <title>Immune Regulatory Processes</title>
      <p>We searched
the immune-related
pathways in UniProt and reactome to identify proteins observed in
specific immune processes in our data. The common defense mechanisms
during infections are cytokine production and secretion, interleukin
production, inflammation, antigen processing and presentation, complement
cascade, apoptosis, and autophagy. Several pathways lead to regulation
of one or more defense response pathways that are observed in this
experiment. The detailed integration of these pathways with the NSS
proteins and how they may be regulated in the infections is shown
in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref></xref>, <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsomega.0c00515/suppl_file/ao0c00515_si_001.pdf">Table S3</ext-link>, and <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsomega.0c00515/suppl_file/ao0c00515_si_001.pdf">Figure S8</ext-link>. The most common pathway observed during a bacterial infection is
toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling which leads to activation of the

      <title>MAPK Pathway</title>
      <p>MAPK cascade helps
in cytokine production
during infection and also aids in caspase activation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref38">38</xref></sup> There are several activators of MAPK cascade such as PSAP,
CHI3L1, and CSF1R expressed in all four infections, but all underexpressed
except CSF1R in JAL infection, indicating the bacterial control in
restricting MAPK signaling. We also observed certain proteins such
as GDF15 (down) and ITGA4 (up) that could activate the MAPK pathway
in avirulent infection. MTUS1 was also upregulated in avirulent infection,
which blocks activation of the MAPK pathway, displaying a dual control
on infected cells (one by macrophages and other by infecting bacteria).
PPEF2 had upregulated secretion in Rv infection which blocks MAPK,
while RASGEF1A was also upregulated which activates RAS and thus MAPK
indicating the dual control. In BND, RBPJ was secreted which activates
the NOTCH pathway, which in turn activates MAPK and NFκB pathways.
This interaction could produce SPP1 (in all infections) and CXCL3
(in Ra infection) cytokines.</p>

    <sec id="sec2.7">
      <title>AKT/PI3K Pathway</title>
      <p>The AKT/PI3K pathway
activation leads
to downstream regulation of multiple immune response pathways.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref39">39</xref></sup> It aids in transcription of inflammation pathway
proteins. It directly inhibits apoptosis processes and inhibits the
mTOR pathway. The mTOR pathway inhibits autophagy processes, and in
its absence, autophagy gets activated. Because the avirulent strain
will not be able to block apoptosis of cells to evade infection, many
proteins were observed in the secretome of avirulent infected cells
to activate the AKT pathway such as CCDC88A, IGFBP3, and ANGPT2. AKT
itself is observed in the secretome of the uninfected cells required
to activate growth response pathways. THEM4 is observed in avirulent
strain infection, which is a known inhibitor of the AKT pathway. APP
and CLSTN1 (both down) were observed in avirulent and clinical infection
that leads to the activation of apoptotic pathways. Also, the inhibitors
of the apoptosis pathway—CST3, CTSH, TREM2, and PPT1—were
observed in NSS proteins (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref></xref>). QSOX1 is a known inhibitor of the autophagy process
identified to be downregulated in all infections. However, in BND
infection, TMEM74 is secreted out which helps in the activation of
the autophagy process.</p>

    <sec id="sec2.8">
      <title>Complement Cascade, Antigen Processing, and
Presentation</title>
      <p>Complement cascade leads to cell lysis, opsonization,
and inflammatory
response.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref40">40</xref></sup> We observed A2M (up) in avirulent
and C4A (up) in Rv infections that assist in regulation of the complement
cascade. Interestingly, there was no known protein observed in clinical
strain infections. We observed B2M (down) in Ra, Rv, and BND infections,
which is known for regulating antigen processing and presentation
in macrophages. B2M is a known target of the mycobacterial ESX secretion
system, which aims to degrade B2M in the ER, so that it cannot be
secreted out for antigen presentation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref42">42</xref></sup> We also observed
HLA-B (JAL), IL4I1, and CENPE (Ra, Rv) that are part of antigen processing
and presentation.</p>
      <p>Of the four strains, Ra is not able to block
the necessary pathways of immune response. IL1β was observed
in Ra infection that leads to caspase activation and thus apoptosis.
In Rv infection, we observed proteins pertaining to complement cascade,
MAPK pathways, antigen processing and presentation, and so forth that
could lead to an immune response. In BND infection, proteins that
activate NOTCH and autophagy pathways were observed. In JAL infection,
which is the most aggressive virulent strain among the four, upregulated
NSS proteins were observed in inhibitory pathways of apoptosis and
IL1β with only one exception of CSF1R that activated the MAPK
pathway. Even the antigen processing or cytokines expressed showed
no significant change in secretion, indicating its competence in molding
the immune response to suit its purpose.</p>
      <p>Because the aim of
this study is to demonstrate the utility of
the HyperQuant pipeline in analyzing the HOM study designs, these
examples highlight the advantages of using the tool for analysis of
complex data. Several interesting hypothesis could be generated for
further studies from this data. While we were able to observe many
immune response proteins, we also observed cytoskeletal proteins,
kinases, phosphatases, thiols, and proteases required for housekeeping
functions. Although this analysis was aimed as the proof of concept
for the tool being able to analyze a truly HOM study with 18 different
conditions in one run, several immunomodulatory pathways were observed
which can be a highly useful resource for the TB community.</p>

    <title>Conclusions</title>
    <p>Several higher order multiplexing studies have been applied to
interesting biological problems over the past decade.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref></sup> The advances in HOM techniques, however, outpaced the associated
computational developments for analysis, which prevented its widespread
adoption. Recently, the number of HOM studies is increasing rapidly
necessitating the need for computational tools that allow labs without
computational expertise to be able to exploit this technique.</p>
    <p>With the development of HyperQuant, we aim to fill this gap and
facilitate easy analysis of data from HOM studies, allowing a true
hyperplexing capacity for quantitation. We have also shown its utility
by reanalyzing 18-plex data from hyperplexing study and BONPlex study.
Summarizing the individual label combinations using areas or ratios,
HyperQuant allows flexible analysis designs from any type of HOM data.
With increased multiplexing from novel HOM studies designs, HyperQuant
is already suited to analyze the data beyond 18-plex. For examples
of possible multiplexing using HOM, the readers are referred to Table
1 of Aggarwal et al. 2019.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref></sup> The tool is
open source, platform independent, freely available, and allows flexibility
in analysis of complex HOM datasets for diverse experimental designs.
By exploiting the HOM technique, including replicates and/or biological
conditions in the same run, better data fidelity and robustness can
be achieved that is usually lacking in most underpowered studies.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first and only tool available
for analyses of HOM data. This will enable researchers to adopt HOM
techniques to plan interesting studies without worrying about complicated
custom data analysis pipelines.</p>

searched using MaxQuant<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref43">43</xref></sup> with carbamidomethylation
and iTRAQ (<italic>N</italic>-term) as fixed modifications. Two new
modifications were created in the MaxQuant parameter dictionary for
the combined masses of iTRAQ and SILAC (medium and heavy separately)
on lysine residues. SILAC pipeline search was used with SILAC light
as the mass of iTRAQ, while SILAC-medium and SILAC-heavy as the new
modifications created on lysine. The SILAC masses on arginine residues
were 0, 6, and 10 Da, respectively, for light, medium, and heavy.
BONCAT at methionine residues, deamidation of asparagine and glutamine,
and methionine oxidation were used as variable modifications. The
enzyme specificity was trypsin, while missed cleavage was set to 1.
The data was identified at ≤1% FDR for PSMs and proteins. The
precursor and fragment mass tolerances were specified as defaults
for the AB Sciex 5600 instrument in MaxQuant. For isobaric quantitation,
the mgf files were converted using msconvert and provided as an input

calculation of protein ratios, we developed a command-line tool HyperQuant
in the Perl programming language. HyperQuant takes identification
results along with MS/MS quantitation results as input and provides
a list of protein areas after replicate combination. As an example,
the MaxQuant text files were used to select PSM identification results.
For PSMs identified and passed at ≤1% FDR threshold, quantitation
values were extracted from QuantWiz<sup>IQ</sup> results for corresponding
spectra. If no PSM is quantified for a protein, it is reported in
a separate file at this step. This module of the tool is called the
Mapper, which maps the identification and quantitation results. The
Mapper results for all the replicates or a single file (in case of
no replicates) are subsequently provided to another module called
the Combiner. The Combiner creates a dictionary (hash) of each protein
group specified by MaxQuant as a key and information about all the
PSMs in that group as the value. If a protein group is a subset of
another protein group from other replicate(s), the two groups are
combined and the PSMs are merged for these groups as one group (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsomega.0c00515/suppl_file/ao0c00515_si_001.pdf">Note S1</ext-link> and <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsomega.0c00515/suppl_file/ao0c00515_si_001.pdf">Figure S1</ext-link>). The quantitation values for each label combination are processed
separately (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsomega.0c00515/suppl_file/ao0c00515_si_001.pdf">Figure S2</ext-link>). For example, the
intensity values for all the PSMs with the 113-iTRAQ reporter of SILAC
light are used to calculate the standard deviation and values outside
±2 standard deviations range is discarded as outlier. This step
of outlier removal ensures that during combination any extreme value
will be removed (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsomega.0c00515/suppl_file/ao0c00515_si_001.pdf">Note S2</ext-link>). The median intensity
of the remaining values is used as the protein intensity for that
sample. This enables normalization of the PSM intensities to be used
for the protein-normalized intensity. The users can also select peptide
ratios of isobaric labels to summarize protein ratios instead of normalized
intensities. There are three methods available to the user for summarizing
protein intensity/ratios that are median, average, and weighted average
methods (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsomega.0c00515/suppl_file/ao0c00515_si_001.pdf">Note S3</ext-link>). The results are reported
with details of scan count, unique peptide count, protein length,
and replicates in which the particular labels were observed along
with their calculated quantitation errors. The postsearch filters
on the number of peptides/replicates for each protein can be used
as per the experimental design or user choice. This allows flexibility
of the experimental design as the decoupling of analysis intricacies
now allows innovative ways to analyze data postquantitative integration,
depending on whether the labels were used as replicates. A demonstration
of quantitative processing is shown in <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsomega.0c00515/suppl_file/ao0c00515_si_001.pdf">Figure S2</ext-link>. The tool is platform independent, open source, and freely

      <title>Ratio Calculation</title>
      <p>For BONPlex study,
the ratio is calculated
separately for infection by different strains, as well as temporally,
for further analysis (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsomega.0c00515/suppl_file/ao0c00515_si_001.pdf">Figure S3</ext-link>). The log<sub>2</sub> fold change was calculated for labeled protein with respect
to corresponding unlabeled counterparts at a given time point for
studying the strain-specific variations in THP-1 responses to infection.<disp-formula id="ueq1"><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="ao0c00515_m001" position="anchor"/></disp-formula></p>
      <p>Some proteins were only observed in
infected cells. To observe changes in these proteins, iTRAQ ratios
were calculated for all time points with respect to the first one.
The significance threshold chosen was ±2 fold change, that is,
±1 at log<sub>2</sub> scale (also see <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsomega.0c00515/suppl_file/ao0c00515_si_001.pdf">Note S4</ext-link> and <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsomega.0c00515/suppl_file/ao0c00515_si_001.pdf">Table S3</ext-link>). All absent and
zero values (identified in any one channel) were converted to −6.64,
(log<sub>2</sub> of 0.01, minimum quantified value) which denoted
an infinitely small value or 6.64 for highly overexpressed or only
expressed in infection conditions (log<sub>2</sub> of 100, maximum
quantified value).</p>
      <p>For hyperplexing data, the peptide ratios
were used for calculating
the weighted average protein ratio, as described earlier.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref></sup> The following formula was used:<disp-formula id="ueq2"><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="ao0c00515_m002" position="anchor"/></disp-formula>where, <italic>N</italic> represents the total
number of quantitated peptides for the protein.</p>
      <p>The protein
ratios were calculated from TMT labels, as the SILAC
labels were used as biological replicates in this experiment. The
results provided as the <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsomega.0c00515/suppl_file/ao0c00515_si_001.pdf">Supporting Information</ext-link> file by the authors was used for comparison with our results.</p>

The data
was filtered at ≤1% Bonferroni FDR. Because the study was on
immune cells, several keywords based on immune response as elucidated
in the literature,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>−<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref48">48</xref></sup> were searched in UniProt<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref49">49</xref></sup> to the fetch
list of proteins. The lists were then compared to the proteins identified
in this experiment. The lists were generated using the following keywords:
cytokine, chemokine, interferon, interleukin, defense response, caspase,
growth factor, signaling, secretory, proteases, and matrix metalloproteases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref></sup> (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsomega.0c00515/suppl_file/ao0c00515_si_001.pdf">Tables S1 and S3</ext-link>). The proteins associated
with immune response pathways were also queried in UniProt to use
the resulting list to match with strain specific changes in proteins.
These pathways included TLR-4, MAPK, AKT/PI3K, NOTCH, JAK/STAT, WNT,
