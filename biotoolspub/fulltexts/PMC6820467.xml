    <abstract>
      <p>Red clover (<italic>Trifolium pratense L.</italic>) is a diploid, naturally cross-pollinated, cool-season species. As a perennial forage legume, red clover is mostly cultivated in temperate regions worldwide. Being a non-model crop species, genomic resources for red clover have been underdeveloped. Thus far, genomic analysis used in red clover has mainly relied on simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers. However, SSR markers are sparse in the genome and it is often difficult to unambiguously map them using short reads generated by next generation sequencing technology. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been successfully applied in genomics assisted breeding in several agriculturally important species. Due to increasing importance of legumes in forage production, there is a clear need to develop SNP based markers for red clover that can be applied in breeding applications. In this study, we first developed an analytical pipeline that can confidently identify SNPs in a set of 72 different red clover genotypes using sequences generated by targeted amplicon sequencing. Then, with the same filtering stringency used in this pipeline, we used sequences from publicly available RNA-seq data to identify confident SNPs in different red clover varieties. Using this strategy, we have identified a total of 69,975 SNPs across red clover varieties. Among these, 28% (19,116) of them are missense mutations. Using <italic>Medicago truncatula</italic> as the reference, we annotated the regions affected by these missense mutations. We identified 2,909 protein coding regions with missense mutations. Pathway analysis of these coding regions indicated several biological processes impacted by these mutations. Specifically, three domains (homeobox domain, pentatricopeptide repeat containing plant-like, and regulator of Vps4 activity) were identified with five or more missense SNPs. These domain might also be a functional contributor in the molecular mechanisms of self-incompatibility in red clover. Future in-depth sequence diversity analysis of these three genes may yield valuable insights into the molecular mechanism involved in self-incompatibility in red clover.</p>

    <title>Background</title>
    <p>Red clover (<italic>Trifolium pratense</italic> L.) is a diploid, naturally pollinated, cool-season species (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Quesenberry and Taylor, 1996</xref>). It belongs to the tribe Trifolieae, in the legume family. As a perennial forage legume species, red clover is mostly cultivated in temperate regions worldwide. Red clover is adapted to a wide range of soils, with the ability to fix atmospheric N through symbiosis with <italic>Rhizobium</italic> species (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Lerue and Patterson, 1981</xref>). Red clover’s shade tolerance and ability to adapt to poor soils have made red clover a great choice for intercropping with corn silage (<italic>Zea mays</italic> L.) to control soil erosion (<xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">Wall et al., 1991</xref>). Similar to other legume species, red clover produces isoflavones, which function as antioxidants, phytoestrogens, and antimicrobial compounds. Among them are polyphenol oxidases (PPOs), which have been shown to protect plant proteins from degradation in rumen (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Jones et al., 1995</xref>). Additionally, red clover offers high-value feed to livestock, due to its high digestibility, high voluntary intake by livestock and high protein content during ensiling (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Frame et al., 1998</xref>). Specifically, red clover is suitable as a conserved or gazed feed. All these unique features make red clover one of the most important forage legume species for livestock. With the burgeoning interest in sustainable agriculture and organic farming, the use of red clover has attracted renewed interest as a cover crop, forage, and/or green manure (<xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">Taylor, 2008</xref>).</p>
    <p>Red clover is highly self-incompatible, which leads to its extremely polymorphic genome. Consequently, natural ecotypes and varieties of red clover can appear similar morphologically, but have highly heterogeneous genetic content (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Istvanek et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, genomic profiling based evaluation of genetic variation is very important for reliable identification of parentage, seed purity analysis, pasture population analysis and selection of genetically divergent varieties for genetic mapping studies (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Forster, 2001</xref>). Despite its highly polymorphic genome, the potential of using genomic variation for trait mapping and informed breeding is largely untapped in red clover. Thus, identification of genomic markers are needed as the first step to a wide range of genomic diversity associated applications in red clover.</p>
    <p>Being a non-model crop species, genomic resources for red clover have been underdeveloped. Its nuclear genome is comprised of seven chromosomes, with an estimated genome size of 418 Mbp (<xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">Vizintin et al., 2006</xref>). Early studies of genome structure in red clover were carried out using fluorescence <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization (<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">Sato et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Kataoka et al., 2012</xref>). The first consensus linkage map of red clover contained 1,414 SSRs, 181 amplified length polymorphisms and 228 restriction fragment length polymorphisms (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Isobe et al., 2009</xref>). DNA markers were also used to identify quantitative loci associated with persistence, disease resistance and winter hardiness (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Herrmann et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Klimenko et al., 2010</xref>). Whole-genome sequencing and assembly have provided a great platform for advances in genomics studies into traits of agronomic importance and for molecular marker assisted breeding in red clover (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Istvanek et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">De Vega et al., 2015</xref>). Transcriptome sequencing has also been used to study gene expression changes in drought stress (<xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">Yates et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Chakrabarti et al., 2016</xref>) and leaf senescence (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Chao et al., 2018a</xref>). A recently study reported the sequences and complete structure of full-length transcripts in red clover using single-molecule, long-read sequencing (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Chao et al., 2018b</xref>).</p>
    <p>By reanalyzing of previously published whole genome sequencing reads of red clover, Istvanek et al. (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Istvanek et al., 2017</xref>) reported genome-wide, gene-specific SSR and SNPs. In their study, an average of 5.3 SNPs were found per gene and one SSR marker was found per 12.39 kbp in the genome, indicating the rich genetic diversity of red clover that can be used for future development of genomics-based breeding applications and identification of genetic markers for key traits (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Istvanek et al., 2017</xref>).</p>
    <p>Whole genome sequencing has been widely used in SNP identification and analysis. Typically, hundreds of thousands of SNPs are identified through genome-wide comparison between a targeted genotype and the reference genome. These SNPs might be useful in developing large-scale, genotyping-based breeding selection tools. However, the majority of identified SNPs <italic>via</italic> genomic sequencing analysis are located in the non-coding regions of the genome, and are most likely not under selection pressure (<xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">Shastry, 2002</xref>). Without further functional annotation (e.g., targeted variant editing analysis for coding variants), the actual functional role of the large quantity of SNPs, especially those in the non-coding regions, remains unknown, for use as trait-associated selection markers.</p>
    <p>Transcriptome studies can help interpret the functional elements of the genome. These functional elements might contribute to various phenotypes, including characteristics of cells and tissues, developmental stages, and diseases (<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">Shah et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Lacar et al., 2016</xref>). Specifically, SNP markers in transcribed coding regions can provide invaluable resources for marker-assisted selection, and the development of trait-associated genetic markers. With the application of high throughput RNA-seq, researchers can now assess the expression of tens of thousands of transcripts in any given organism or tissue type in an unbiased manner. Additionally, RNA-seq is capable of providing genetic information at single-nucleotide resolution (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Mortazavi et al., 2008</xref>) and the opportunity to detect allele-specific expression (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Gregg et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">Zhuo et al., 2017</xref>). RNA-seq based SNP biomarker identification has led to SNP identification in coding/transcribed regions of the genome (<xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">Ulloa et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Lopez-Maestre et al., 2016</xref>). Missense SNPs in coding regions are of particular interest as they are expected to affect the function of a protein, and therefore have a more direct functional impact (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Botstein and Risch, 2003</xref>; <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Hirschhorn and Daly, 2005</xref>; <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Lopez-Maestre et al., 2016</xref>). Consequently, a number of disease-associated SNPs have been reliably identified with a larger proportion of them as missense variants (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Botstein and Risch, 2003</xref>; <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">Shah et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Kridel et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">Shah et al., 2012</xref>).</p>
    <p>In this study, we developed an analytical pipeline to confidently identify SNPs using reads generated by targeted amplicon sequencing. Specifically, by comparing genomic sequences of one variety of red clover, Cherokee, to published reference genome (cultivar Milvus B), we identified and confirmed a set of highly confident SNPs using targeted amplicon sequencing. Then, using the same analytical strategy, RNA-seq reads were used to identify a set of highly confidently SNPs in transcribed regions in red clover. SNPs generated from this study will contribute to further development of informative genomics tools for red clover breading studies and applications.</p>

      <title>SNP Confirmation Using Targeted Amplicon Sequencing</title>
      <p>Before performing SNP identification using RNA-seq reads, we conducted a pilot study by comparing genomic sequences of Cherokee cultivar (data not shown) with that of the draft genome of red clover (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">De Vega et al., 2015</xref>) downloaded from NCBI Bioproject (accession number: PRJEB9186). The main purpose of this study was to develop an analytical pipeline that can confidently identify SNPs using targeted amplicon sequencing. Paired-end, genomic reads were mapped to the red clover reference genome using BWA (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Li and Durbin, 2009</xref>). Mapped reads were filtered using samtools view with “-q 10” option (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2009</xref>) to keep uniquely mapped reads. Variants were called using samtools mpileup (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2009</xref>). Variants with less than 15 mapped reads were excluded from further analysis. An initial set of 200 SNPs were pursued for further analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM4"><bold>Supplemental File 1</bold></xref>). Up- and down-stream, 120 bp sequences flanking the targeted SNP were extracted for each of the SNPs to form a 240 bp fragment for each SNP. And the 240 bp sequence fragment was used to perform genome-wide mapping search to identify the fragments with unique mapping locations in the reference genome. Additionally, SNPs with indels in their proximity (up- and down-stream 100 bp region) were excluded. A final set of 36 SNPs were identified (referred as 36 loci from here on).</p>
      <p>To confirm the final set of SNPs, primer sets were designed for each of these 36 SNPs for targeted amplicon size of 200 bp. Genomic DNAs from a total of 72 genotypes from an experimental breeding population, C328WS, were included in the confirmation study. C328WS is a red clover breeding population developed by Dr. Riday as part of his duties at USDA-ARS (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Riday et al., 2015</xref>); C328WS is currently stored and maintained at the US Dairy Forage Research Center (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM3"><bold>Supplemental Table 3</bold></xref>). Genomic DNAs were extracted using an adaptation of the method of Štorchová et al. (<xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">Štorchová et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Riday et al., 2013</xref>).</p>
      <p>For each locus, multiplex, paired-end sequencing of targeted amplicons from all 72 genotypes was performed using Illumina MiSeq (Illumina, San Diego, USA) <italic>via</italic> MonsterPlex, a commercial service from FloodLight Genomics LLC (<uri xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://floodlightgenomics.com/">http://floodlightgenomics.com/</uri>). After sequencing, paired-end reads were mapped to the red clover reference genome using BWA (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Li and Durbin, 2009</xref>). Mapped reads were filtered using samtools view with “-q 10” option (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2009</xref>) to keep uniquely mapped reads. Variants were called using samtools mpileup (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2009</xref>). Variants with less than 15 mapped reads were excluded from further analysis.</p>
      <p>To test the effectiveness of the identified SNPs in differentiating the 72 red clover genotypes, cluster analysis was performed using the R package pvclust (<xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">Suzuki and Shimodaira, 2006</xref>). The SNP genotyping data matrix used for the analysis was prepared as follows: homozygous reference alleles (0/0) were coded as 0, heterozygous alleles (0/1) were coded as 1 and homozygous alternative allele (1/1) were coded as 2. The bootstrap cutoff value of 85% was used to identify the significant clades.</p>

      <title>SNP Identification Using RNA-Seq Data</title>
      <p>Two RNA-seq data sets were obtained from NCBI SRA database: PRJNA287846 and PRJNA219226. The data from PRJNA287846 was done by our laboratory. For this project, leaf, root and flower tissues from red clover Kenland cultivar were used for RNA-seq (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Chakrabarti et al., 2016</xref>). “Kenland” is a red clover variety registered in 1951 by the Kentucky Agricultural Experiment Station (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Hollowell, 1951</xref>). It is currently stored and maintained at USDA-ARS Forage-Animal Production Research Unit, in Lexington, KY. Data from PRJNA219226 (<xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">Yates et al., 2014</xref>) was downloaded from NCBI. The data was generated from young leaf tissues from F1 pseudo-testcross derived from a single genotype from each of two varieties, Milvus and Britta. Genome reference of red clover (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">De Vega et al., 2015</xref>) (NCBI accession PRJEB9186) was used as reference for read mapping. After quality control check, raw reads from all RNA-seq libraries were aligned using a two-step alignment approach. First, Tophat2 (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al., 2013</xref>) was used with the following settings: “-r 70 –mate-std-dec 90.” Second, unmapped reads from step one were realigned with Bowtie2 using the “–very-sensitive-local” method. SNP was identified using mpileup from samtools after filtering of uniquely mapped reads. SNPs with less than 15 mapped reads were filtered out. After filtering, 600 bp sequences (300 bp up-stream and 300 bp down-stream) flaking each SNP were extracted. Using the methods we developed for genomic amplicon sequencing, flanking fragments were further checked to assess their uniqueness in the genome along with indel screening in the surrounding region. SNPs with uniquely mapped flanking fragments and without indels in their proximity were pursued with further analysis.</p>

    <sec id="s2_3">
      <title>Annotation of Missense SNPs and Their Impacted Genes</title>
      <p>Potential functional effect of the SNPs identified by RNA-seq data was predicted using SNPeff (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Cingolani et al., 2012</xref>). We focused on SNPs that were predicted as missense mutations. To annotate the coding regions impacted by these missense SNPs, 600 bp flanking fragment of each missense SNPs were extracted using custom Python and shell scripts (<uri xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="https://github.com/WLpython19/RedClover">https://github.com/WLpython19/RedClover</uri>). To ensure that these SNPs were from unique regions in the genome, a genome-wide mapping search was performed using blat (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Kent, 2002</xref>). Only uniquely mapped flanking fragments were pursued with gene annotation. To identify which genes these SNP flanking fragments belong to, we first extracted nucleotide sequences from <italic>Medicago truncatula</italic> (<xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">Young et al., 2011</xref>) from the nucleotide collection at NCBI (<uri xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/db/FASTA/nt.gz">ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/db/FASTA/nt.gz</uri>). BLASTn (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Altschul et al., 1990</xref>) was used for the annotation with nucleotide sequences from <italic>Medicago truncatula</italic> as the reference. BLAST hits are determined as significant when E- value is less than 1e-20.</p>

(2000)</xref> and <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Riday et al. (2013)</xref> with minor modifications. For cDNA synthesis, leaf tissues from Kenland was first collected and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen before RNA extraction. Total RNA was extracted using MasterPure Complete DNA and RNA extraction kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA, US) following manufacture’s instruction. Extracted RNA samples were treated with DNAase provided by the extraction kit. Qubit RNA BR Assay kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) was used to quantify the extracted RNA samples. Two micrograms of total RNA was used using Superscript III First-Strand synthesis system (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) following manufacturer’s instruction.</p>
      <p>Targeted amplicon sequencing was performed as follows. <italic>First</italic>, A 600 bp flanking region (300 bp up- and down-stream of the targeted SNP) for each SNP was extracted from the reference genome (PRJEB9186). These flanking regions were used for PCR primer design. Primer pairs were designed using Primer3 (<xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">Untergasser et al., 2012</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1"><bold>Supplemental Table 1</bold></xref>). <italic>Second</italic>, to amplify targeted fragments, PCR reactions were performed in a reaction volume of 12 µl. PCR reaction final concentrations were 1 X JumpStart REDTaq ReadyMix (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), 0.20 μM of each primer, 0.50 mM additional MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.50 M betaine (Sigma-Aldrich), and approximately 20 ng template DNA. Thermal cycling was carried out on a DNA Engine Dyad (Bio-Rad) as follows: 95°C for 1 min; 45 cycles of 95°C for 20 s, 50°C for 2 min, and 72°C for 1 min; 72°C for 10 min; and a final step of 4°C for 1 min. <italic>Third</italic>, for sequencing of amplified targets, PCR products were submitted to the University of Wisconsin Biotechnology Center for Sanger sequencing. Sequencing traces were viewed and aligned using CodonCode Aligner 6.0.2 (Codon Code Corporation, Centerville, MA).</p>

      <title>Genomic SNP Confirmation Using Targeted Genomic Amplicon Sequencing</title>
      <p>For the pilot study, we identified a set of 36 SNPs for confirmation using targeted genomic amplicon sequencing. With the multiplex, targeted amplicon sequencing, we obtained 45,247 to 300,477 paired-end reads for each of these loci (Bioproject accession: PRJNA559390). All of the SNPs in the 36 loci were confirmed and additional nine were identified in eight of the loci (22% of the loci) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM2"><bold>Supplemental Table 2</bold></xref>). For the multiple SNPs identified from the same locus, the average spacing between them is 20 bp. In the clustering analysis, 11 subclades were identified with significant bootstrap values of 85% or more (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1"><bold>Figure 1</bold></xref>).</p>

A closer look at the annotated function of these genes indicated that they were associated mainly in four biological functions: 1) plan development, specifically in flower and embryo development after fertilization; 2) response to abiotic stress; 3) epigenetic control of gene expression and transcript translation; and 4) genes involved in potential mechanisms in self-incompatibility and male sterility (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table"><bold>Table 1</bold></xref>).</p>

      <title>Red Clover Has a Large Number of SNPs Identified in Coding/Transcribed Regions</title>
      <p>Out of all the highly confident SNPs identified, a significant portion of them, 19,116, were missense mutations located in 2,909 annotated coding regions. Future RNA-seq analyses on additional varieties will likely identify new coding variants that could be used for functional SNP marker development. Most interestingly, 18 annotated coding regions were identified with at least five missense SNPs in them. Functional annotation of these genes revealed that they were involved in several key biological and physiological processes in plants. Of note, three annotated coding regions were identified with important roles in embryo development after fertilization (homeobox domain), potential role in cytoplasmic male sterility (PPR containing plant-like) and self-incompatibility (regulator of Vps4 activity in the MVB pathway). Homeobox domain is a DNA-binding domain of 60 amino acids, characterizing a large family of transcription factors (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Mukherjee et al., 2009</xref>). This motif plays a major role in regulating gene expression of targeted genes, by recognizing and binding to specific DNA sequences. Additionally, in plants, homeobox genes have been reported as key regulators at the early stages of embryogenesis and embryonic patterning (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Haecker et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Prigge et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Nardmann et al., 2007</xref>). PPR containing plant-like (PPR protein) is encoded by restorer (Rf) genes (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Bentolila et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Akagi et al., 2004</xref>). Rf genes are required for the development of a functional male gametophyte (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Fujii et al., 2011</xref>). Studies have shown that male fertility can be restored by PPR proteins (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Bentolila et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Hanson and Bentolila, 2004</xref>). Furthermore, in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, gene knock-out studies indicated that PPR proteins were critical during early embryogenesis (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Cushing et al., 2005</xref>). In <italic>Brassicaceae</italic>, MVBs (multi-vesicular bodies) were suggested for vesicle secretion by stigmatic papillae, which is essential for hydration and pollen tube penetration of compatible pollen grains. Thus, this protein may play a very important role in the molecular mechanisms underlying self-incompatibility (<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">Safavian and Goring, 2013</xref>).</p>
      <p>Red clover is known for its outcrossing nature with gametophytic self-incompatibility, which leads to high degree of genetic diversities (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Riday and Krohn, 2010b</xref>;a). Such a high degree of genetic diversity imposes a substantial hurdle in genetic diversity based strategies for quantifying variation within and between populations. Identifying loci that are associated with self-incompatibility represents a vital step in tackling the highly genetically heterogeneous nature of red clover (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Riday and Krohn, 2010a</xref>). For a compatible pollen to germinate and eventually produce seeds, a few steps have to happen after a pollen lands on the stigma of a flower. They include pollen germination, pollen tube growth, ovule fertilization and embryo development (<xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">Takayama et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Charlesworth et al., 2005</xref>). A disruption at any one of these stages may contribute to self-incompatibility. Even though red clover is known for its high-degree of self-incompatibility, currently we know little about the genes instrumental for this inbreeding prevention mechanism. For the three genes/coding regions identified with high number (&gt; = 5) missense SNPs, their annotated function indicates that they might be a functional contributor in the molecular mechanisms of self-incompatibility in red clover. Future studies might involve targeted gene capture and sequencing of these genes/domains in a larger selection of red clover varieties. Such studies will help reveal extensive degrees of genetic diversity of these genes. Additionally, they will also help provide valuable genetic markers that can be used to genetic diversity related studies and applications.</p>

      <title>Targeted PCR Amplification Followed by Sequencing can be a Valuable Method for Novel SNP Identification in Red Clover</title>
      <p>As a species with high self-incompatibility, the genomic diversity of red clover deserves thorough investigation. Detailed genomic information can further facilitate breeding and molecular studies in red clover. However, genomics based diversity research is largely lacking in red clover. Our study clearly demonstrated the feasibility of targeted amplicon sequencing as an invaluable tool for genetic diversity identifications in red clover. Out of the 36 loci we pursued using targeted genomic amplicon amplification and sequencing, we discovered an additional 9 variants in 72 genotypes of red clover surveyed in the study. Taken together, 22% of the loci we investigated have additional SNPs aside from the original confirmed SNPs, with an average in-between SNPs spacing of 20 bp. Also, these 9 additional SNPs were identified based only on a 200 bp amplicon length. Our data strongly supports that red clover has a high degree of genomic variation among different cultivar varieties. Thus, it is reasonable to speculate that a large number of SNPs in red clover are still un-discovered. Currently, the most widely used genomic markers in red clover are SSR markers (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Dias et al., 2008</xref>). These markers are generally scarce in the genome. Additionally, due to their repetitive nature, it is generally not easy to sequence them directly in the genome using short read technology. As evidenced by our study, targeted, amplicon-based sequencing can be used to rapidly discover novel SNPs among different varieties, without the complications of sequence assembly using a typical, whole genome sequencing approach.</p>
      <p>Targeted amplicon sequencing based SNP identification requires the selection of a known set of loci. Once the targeted loci are selected, targeted amplicon sequencing based method has the advantage of surveying large germplasm collections from the same species for the same set of loci without the need of <italic>de novo</italic> primer design as shown in our study. On the other hand, two restriction enzyme digestion based methods, Multiplex restriction amplicon sequencing (MRASeq) (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Bernardo et al., 2019</xref>) and genotyping by sequencing (GBS), are also used for SNP identification. GBS is a proprietary technology that requires high license and future royalty fees when used to develop commercial cultivars. Currently, the per sample GBS cost is ∼$20–$30. In comparison to GBS, MRASeq only uses two PCR steps to construct the library, omitting enzyme digestion and adapter ligation steps employed in GBS, and its estimated per sample cost is $8. However, MRASeq only amplifies a subset of restriction sites targeted by GBS. Thus, MRASeq generates fewer SNPs than GBS (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Bernardo et al., 2019</xref>).</p>
      <p>Newly identified SNPs should provide new opportunities for red clover genome research, including informed genomics assisted breeding with high density SNP markers, and even red clover seed-bank informatics development, with each germplasm’s barcoded SNP polymorphism profile recorded. Of note, using our SNP genotyping data, we were able to identify 11 sub-clades of red clover out of the initial 72 genotypes we had surveyed. This finding indicated that low-density SNP information was effective at identifying sub-population structure in red clover. Along with phenotypic data (e.g., tolerance to heat stress, high-yield, protein-content), SNP-assisted genotype clustering analysis becomes useful in the identification of cultivars with desired economic traits. Additionally, as a non-model organism, SNP surveys across populations becomes beneficial at identifying genes with high variance, like the three domains potentially linked to self-incompatibility we identified in our study. Future in-depth, population-wide deep sequencing of these domains and their predicted interacting partners will help yield insights into the dynamics of these genes in influencing self-incompatibility.</p>
      <p>For genome-wide SNP identification using a whole genome or whole transcriptome sequencing approach, long-read based technology might be especially beneficial for red clover. Currently, the most commonly used sequencing methods are short-read based. Short-read based sequencing technologies have transformed the fields of genetics and comparative biology. However, in the case of red clover genome sequencing, accurate identification of SNPs is likely compromised by its high levels of polymorphism, especially when divergent reads from the same genomic region are recognized as different loci, subsequently are assembled inaccurately, or when the reference genome is highly divergent from the target, causing inaccurate mapping (<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">Schneeberger et al., 2009</xref>). With the advent of single-molecule, long-read sequencing, like Pacific Biosciences (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Gordon et al., 2016</xref>) and Oxford Nanopore MinION sequencing (<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">Schneider and Dekker, 2012</xref>), it might be necessary to employ long-read sequencing for contig assembly and SNP identification in red clover. Such long-read based application will most likely improve the contig assembly of red clover. Additionally, long-reads will help more accurate phasing of SNPs that are closely linked to each other.</p>

    <title>Conclusions</title>
    <p>Red clover has a large number of SNPs identified in coding regions using RNA-seq data. Specifically, three genes/domains are identified with five or more missense SNPs. Future sequence diversity analysis of these three genes may yield valuable insights into the molecular mechanism involved in self-incompatibility in red clover. Given the highly diversified genome of red clover, targeted amplicon sequencing followed by sequencing can be an effective method for novel SNP identification in red clover.</p>
