    <abstract>
      <p>Ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) are used as a phenotypic marker in mouse models of neuropsychiatric disorders. Nevertheless, current methodologies still require time-consuming manual input or sound recordings clean of any background noise. We developed a method to overcome these two restraints to boost knowledge on mouse USVs. The methods are freely available and the USV analysis runs online at <ext-link xlink:href="https://usv.pasteur.cloud" ext-link-type="uri">https://usv.pasteur.cloud</ext-link>. As little is currently known about usage and structure of ultrasonic vocalizations during social interactions over the long-term and in unconstrained context, we investigated mouse spontaneous communication by coupling the analysis of USVs with automatic labeling of behaviors. We continuously recorded during 3 days undisturbed interactions of same-sex pairs of C57BL/6J sexually naive males and females at 5 weeks and 3 and 7 months of age. In same-sex interactions, we observed robust differences between males and females in the amount of USVs produced, in the acoustic structure and in the contexts of emission. The context-specific acoustic variations emerged with increasing age. The emission of USVs also reflected a high level of excitement during social interactions. We finally highlighted the importance of studying long-term spontaneous communication by investigating female mice lacking <italic toggle="yes">Shank3</italic>, a synaptic protein associated with autism. While the previous short-time constrained investigations could not detect USV emission abnormalities, our analysis revealed robust differences in the usage and structure of the USVs emitted by mutant mice compared to wild-type female pairs.</p>

    <title>Introduction</title>
    <p>Social communication regulates major biological functions under strong selective pressure, such as finding reproductive partners, raising progeny, group coordination for territory advertisement, and protection from predators (Bradbury and Vehrencamp, <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). It is not yet clear whether the mechanisms underlying these functions are shared between species, but an increasing number of genes and brain circuits related to social interaction and communication have been identified (e.g., Arriaga et al., <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Chen and Hong, <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>; Tu et al., <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>; Kelley et al., <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>), suggesting that at least certain social brain circuits are conserved across species. Several genes associated with autism have been mutated in animal models and lead to atypical social interactions (e.g., mice: Ey et al., <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Crawley, <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; rats: Modi et al., <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>; Drosophila: Coll-Tané et al., <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>; monkeys: Tu et al., <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). This suggests that animals can be used as models to better understand the causes of neuropsychiatric conditions affecting social interactions and communication, keeping in mind their limits (e.g., the absence of convincing proofs of vocal learning, a major characteristic of human communication, in the above-cited model species; Jarvis, <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). Hereafter, we will focus on mice, due to their broad use as models for neuropsychiatric disorders.</p>
    <p>Mice are social animals, naturally living in <italic toggle="yes">demes</italic>, with a single dominant male, occasionally a few subordinate males, and several females occupying contiguous nests, but only a fraction of them reproduce (Palanza et al., <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>). This social organization leads mice to use tactile, olfactory, visual, and vocal (mostly in the ultrasonic range) signals in same-sex social interactions, male-female socio-sexual interactions, and mother-infant relationships (Latham and Mason, <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>; Brennan and Kendrick, <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Portfors, <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). Tactile, visual, and olfactory cues are investigated through the observation of contacts, body postures, and marking behavior (e.g., Mathis et al., <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>; de Chaumont et al., <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). Ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) are interpreted as a proxy for vocal communication (Zippelius and Schleidt, <xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr">1956</xref>; Sewell, <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">1970</xref>; Portfors, <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). USVs may also represent emotional reflectors of social interactions, reflecting the positive or negative valence of the interaction and the excitement of the interacting mice. Our understanding of mouse USVs nevertheless is still poor compared to our knowledge of vocal communication in other species, such as birds or primates (reviewed in Naguib et al., <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; for non-human primates in Fischer and Hammerschmidt, <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>).</p>
    <p>Mouse USVs are generally investigated in contexts in which the motivation of the animals is controlled, through either social deprivation or the introduction of a sexual component to trigger a maximum quantity of USVs (reviewed in Portfors, <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). Indeed, after the developmental period when isolated mouse pups emit USVs that trigger approach and retrieval from the mother (Zippelius and Schleidt, <xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr">1956</xref>; Sewell, <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">1970</xref>), the amount of USVs emitted by juveniles and adults is maximized by social deprivation (Ey et al., <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). In these contexts, USVs may be used to regulate close contacts and hierarchy (Moles et al., <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; Ey et al., <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). Finally, an estrous female, or at least its odor, stimulates adult males to vocalize (Holy and Guo, <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>; Chabout et al., <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Such male USVs are suspected to facilitate close body contact with the female (Pomerantz et al., <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">1983</xref>; Hammerschmidt et al., <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; reviewed in Egnor and Seagraves (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Examining USVs in these specific contexts allowed to suggest some of their functions, but, to refine them, linking USVs emission to behavioral contexts is required.</p>
    <p>Under constrained conditions, previous studies highlighted that USVs are mostly emitted during close contacts and approach behaviors in male-male (Ferhat et al., <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>) and female-female (Ferhat et al., <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>) interactions (including when one is socially deprived). Specific phases of courtship interactions trigger different call types, which might therefore reflect the different behaviors expressed in these phases (Nyby, <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">1983</xref>; Hanson and Hurley, <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). It was also shown that male-female and female-female interactions trigger the longest USVs sequences, with the most complex types of USVs, compared to male-male interactions (Matsumoto and Okanoya, <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>). In a group of four adult mice (two males and two females, aged 3–5 months) interacting for 5 h after at least 2 weeks of social deprivation, both the females and males vocalized, more specifically during chasing (Neunuebel et al., <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). The lowest call rates occurred when the animals were isolated from one another, whereas the highest call rates occurred when the mice were sniffing each other’s ano-genital region. Vocalizations are therefore emitted in different proportions depending on the behavioral context (Sangiamo et al., <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). In paired interactions, USVs trigger no behavioral variations in female-female interactions, but males run faster when the females accelerate while vocalizing in male-female interactions (Warren et al., <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">2018a</xref>,<xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">b</xref>, <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). Altogether, linking USVs with behavioral contexts remains focused on constrained interactions and does not shed light on the usage of spontaneous USVs.</p>
    <p>In the present study, we developed a method using the Live Mouse Tracker (LMT; de Chaumont et al., <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>), which allows a detailed description of the behavior, synchronized with USV recordings (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1A,B</xref>). We delivered the complete pipeline of recording and analyses, as well as an original online application<xref rid="fn0001" ref-type="fn"><sup>1</sup></xref> (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>) to automatically segment and analyze the USVs. Using this method, we characterized the spontaneous social and vocal behavior of C57BL/6J (hereafter B6) mice in same-sex pairs over an undisturbed period of 3 days and nights. We tested whether the usage and structure of USVs vary according to their behavioral contexts of emission. We focused on same-sex interactions between sexually naive mice to avoid mixing sexual motivation in the factors that influenced vocal behavior. We compared the vocal behavior of male and female pairs at three different ages (5 weeks and 3 and 7 months) to examine age-related maturation. In addition, we investigated whether spontaneous USVs are perturbed in mice lacking Shank3, a glutamatergic synaptic scaffolding protein that we previously associated with autism (Durand et al., <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; Leblond et al., <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; deletion of exon 11; Schmeisser et al., <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Vicidomini et al., <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). This first in-depth investigation of spontaneous mouse social communication and the resources presented here will be helpful for the community to design more sensitive tests to better investigate the natural abilities of mice (Warburton et al., <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">1988</xref>; Gerlai and Clayton, <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>), as well as to detect and interpret social communication phenotypes in mouse models of neuropsychiatric disorders.</p>

      <p>We tested eight male and eight female C57BL/6J mice (hereafter B6 mice; Charles River Laboratories, Ecully, France). Mice arrived at 3 weeks of age as a group and were directly housed in same-sex pairs in the experimental facility. <italic toggle="yes">ProSAP2/Shank3</italic> mutant mice (deletion of exon 11; Schmeisser et al., <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>) were generated onsite from heterozygous parents on a C57BL/6J background (&gt;10 backcrosses). Twelve <italic toggle="yes">Shank3</italic><sup>−/−</sup> females arrived at 1–1.5 month of age in the experimental facility. Before arrival, these mice were housed within mixed-genotype groups, littermates or not. <italic toggle="yes">Shank3<sup>+/+</sup></italic> females were not available in sufficient number to conduct a similar study with these control mice, and therefore B6 females aged 3 months were used as control group given their similar genetic background. <italic toggle="yes">Shank3</italic><sup>−/−</sup> females were directly housed in age-matched pairs upon arrival, at least 3 weeks before the recording session to let them stabilize social relationships. In this mouse model, we focused on a single age class (3 months of age) since it is the classical age for behavioral characterization. We focused only on females given the low amount of USVs spontaneously emitted by B6 males, which is the genetic background used to generate the <italic toggle="yes">Shank3</italic> mutant mice tested here. In the experimental facility, mice were housed in classical laboratory cages with food and water <italic toggle="yes">ad libitum</italic> and 11 h/13 h dark/light rhythm (lights off at 08:00 p.m.).</p>
      <p>We inserted RFID chips (12 × 2.12 mm; Biolog-Id, Bernay, France) subcutaneously behind the left ear and pushed it down to the flank at 4 weeks of age in B6 mice and between 5 and 7 weeks in <italic toggle="yes">Shank3</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice. After this operation conducted under gas (isoflurane) anesthesia and local analgesia (&lt;0.05 ml lidocaïne at 20 mg/ml), mice were left at least 1 week to recover.</p>
      <p>We did not control for the sexual status of females in our experiments. Nevertheless, as the experiments lasted 3 days, we cover a large proportion of the sexual cycle (see also von Merten et al., <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). In addition, we wanted to avoid manipulating animals throughout the recording session and following the estrus cycle would have necessitated daily handling.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="s2-2">
      <title>Behavioral and USV Recordings</title>
      <p>For the recordings, each pair was placed in the LMT setup (de Chaumont et al., <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>), a Plexiglas cage of 50 × 50 cm with transparent walls furnished with fresh bedding, food dispersed on the ground in the center, a water bottle at the down right side of the cage, a house (width: 100 mm, depth: 75 mm, height: 40 mm) in red Plexiglas in the down left corner and nesting material (six dental cottons) spread on the bedding in the center of the cage. Each LMT setup was isolated in an experimental room, with no other mouse in the same room. Recordings were launched between 03:00 and 04:00 p.m. (20–23°C, 80–100 lux when lights were on). Once the recordings were started, we did not disturb the mice anymore for 3 days (11 h/13 h dark/light rhythm, with lights off at 08:00 p.m.). Recordings were stopped after 71 h and setups were cleaned with soap water, dried, and re-furnished before launching another recording session. In WT mice, the first recordings occurred at 5 weeks of age. We next recorded in identical conditions the same mice at 3 and 7 months of age. Between the recording sessions, the pairs of mice were left undisturbed, with only a weekly change of the bedding. The six pairs of <italic toggle="yes">Shank3</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice were recorded only once, at 2.5–3 months of age, the age class classically recorded in behavioral phenotyping of mouse models.</p>
      <p>Launching recordings consisted in monitoring both behavior and USV emission. Behavioral monitoring occurred through the LMT system (Kinect camera on the top, plugins 465, 524, 600, or 705; de Chaumont et al., <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>), in which mice were automatically identified and tracked throughout the recording session. All spontaneous ultrasonic vocalization sequences were recorded using an Avisoft-Bioacoustics CM16/CMPA microphone (located 50 cm above the bottom right corner of the LMT cage, oriented toward the center of the cage) and the Avisoft UltraSoundGate Recorder system (Avisoft Bioacoustics, Glienicke, Germany; 300 kHz sampling rate, 16-bit format) using the trigger function (trigger: level of this channel; pre-trigger: 1 s; hold time: 1 s; duration &gt;0.005 s; trigger event: 2% energy in 25–125 kHz with entropy &lt;50%). Both systems were synchronized within LMT (see hereafter). Behaviors were attributed to individuals while USVs were measured at the scale of the pair of mice since we cannot identify the emitter.</p>

      <p>The spontaneous behavior of the mice was automatically labeled using the LMT system. Both social and non-social behaviors were used, as in (de Chaumont et al., <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>; recapitulated in <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).</p>

      <sec id="s2-4-1">
        <title>Vocalization Waveform to Spectrum</title>
        <p>We process wav files recorded at a sampling rate of 300 kHz with a resolution of 16 bits per sample. We first apply an FFT (overlap of 0.75% and FFT-size = 1,024 points) to the original audio signal to get its spectrum.</p>
        <p>The signal recorded presents three main problems: (1) The continuity of the USVs can be interrupted if the signal gets too low. (2) The animals produce a lot of noise by interacting with their environment. (3) The animal facility environment itself produces interfering ultrasonic noise. To overcome these problems which might prevent correct classification, we need to filter the signal of the spectrum. The processing steps are detailed in the <xref rid="SM1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Methods</xref> section (<xref rid="SM1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Methods</xref>—USV segmentation method: Method parameters, Filtering spectrum data, Constant and blinking frequency canceler, Vocalization segmentation, Spectrum signal extraction). The USV segmentation was validated on a set of manually annotated USVs (<xref rid="SM1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Methods</xref>—USV detection validation; <xref rid="SM1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table I</xref>). As recorded files might contain USVs or noise, we sorted them automatically (<xref rid="SM1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Methods</xref>—Filtering out wave files containing only noise) and double-check them manually.</p>

        <title>Avisoft Burst Record and Synchronization With Live Mouse Tracker</title>
        <p>The system is designed to work for an unlimited duration. As USVs are infrequent events, we do not record the sound continuously. We instead use the automatic record trigger functionality of Avisoft-RECORDER. The automatic trigger of Avisoft-RECORDER monitors the sound level and starts recording a sound if the current sound level within a given frequency range is over a given threshold. The sound is recorded as long as the sound level is over the threshold. This function takes a hold time parameter: if Avisoft-RECORDER detects another signal during the hold period, the record is not interrupted. The hold period also adds a record period around the first and the last signal over the threshold. In our experiment, we use a hold time of 1 s.</p>
        <p>To synchronize USV recording with the tracking, we use the “Trigger control” of Avisoft-RECORDER. This function allows launching of an external program at each start and end of records. We use the free software PacketSender<xref rid="fn0002" ref-type="fn"><sup>2</sup></xref> to perform communication between Avisoft-RECORDER and Live Mouse Tracker (LMT). Through PacketSender, we send a UDP string packet containing the file number currently recorded by Avisoft-RECORDER. This information is recorded by LMT within the database as an “USV event.” The goal of the synchronization is to match the USV record with the current data frame number recorded by LMT.</p>

      <p>The currently available methods to detect and analyze mouse USVs need specific installations and software. To facilitate the testing of our own algorithm, we provide a website to test the method or to process data online<sup>1</sup>.

        <title>Behavioral Profiles of Mice</title>
        <p>We built a behavioral profile for each mouse considering the following behavioral event types: single move, single idle, get away, break contact, approach within the social range, approach contact, nose-nose contact, nose-anogenital contact, side-by-side contact, side-by-side contact/head-to-tail, follow, train2. We also examined the total distance traveled. For each behavioral event type, we compared the total time spent in this behavioral event type, the number of events, and the mean duration of these events.</p>
        <p>Each of these variables was tested for the effect of age within each sex separately. We used a non-parametric Kruskal–Wallis test followed by paired Wilcoxon tests to compare age classes within each sex. When applying a correction for multiple testing, we corrected it by the number of tests conducted (2). The effect of sex was tested within each age class separately using Mann–Whitney <italic toggle="yes">U</italic>-tests.

        <title>Comparison Between Age Classes, Sexes, or Genotypes of USVs and USV Bursts</title>
        <p>To examine the effect of age class, we used nonparametric paired Wilcoxon tests to compare the amount of USVs between age classes within each sex. When applying a correction for multiple testing, we corrected it by the number of age classes (3). We compared the amount of USVs between <italic toggle="yes">Shank3</italic><sup>−/−</sup> and B6 mice using nonparametric Mann–Whitney <italic toggle="yes">U</italic>-tests (no correction applied).</p>
        <p>To detect an age or a sex effect, we used a linear mixed model (fixed factor: age or sex, random factor: pair) to compare the number of USVs per USV burst between sexes within each age class (5 weeks, 3 months, and 7 months). When applying a correction for multiple testing, we corrected it by the number of age classes (3). To detect an effect of the <italic toggle="yes">Shank3</italic> mutation on the number of USVs per USV burst, we used a linear mixed model (fixed factor: genotype, random factor: pair) to compare the number of USVs per USV burst between <italic toggle="yes">Shank3</italic><sup>−/−</sup> pairs and B6 pairs. The same analyses were conducted within each behavioral context (single idle, break contact, approach contact, nose-nose contact, nose-anogenital contact, side-by-side contact, side-by-side contact/head-to-tail, follow, train2). When applying a correction for multiple testing, we corrected it by the number of behavioral contexts examined (9).</p>
        <p>Acoustic features of USVs were compared between sexes within age classes, between age classes within each sex, and also between sexes within age classes and within each behavioral context using Linear Mixed Models using the pairs as a random factor. When applying a correction for multiple testing, we corrected it by the number of age classes (3) multiplied by the number of acoustic variables tested (16) when testing sex effect, by two tests multiplied by the number of acoustic traits (16) when testing age effect. When comparing acoustic traits across contexts, corrections included the number of acoustic traits (16) and the number of contexts combinations. We also compared the acoustic features between B6 and <italic toggle="yes">Shank3</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice using Linear Mixed Models with genotype as a fixed factor and genotype as a random factor.

For that purpose, after computing the acoustic features of all USVs, we compared acoustic features of USVs between the different behavioral contexts (single idle, break contact, approach contact, nose-nose contact, nose-anogenital contact, side-by-side contact, side-by-side contact/head-to-tail, follow, train2) using linear mixed models (fixed factor: context, random factor: pair) with a Bonferroni correction (combination of two within nine behavioral events × 16 acoustic features). Acoustic variations between contexts in <italic toggle="yes">Shank3</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice were tested similarly (Figure M1c-d).

        <title>Relationship Between the Occurrence of USV Bursts and the Speed of Mice as Well as the Duration of Social Events</title>
        <p>We focused on the following sample of behavioral events: break contact, approach contact, contact, nose-anogenital contact, follow, and Train2. First, we tested whether animals displaying these behaviors accompanied by USVs had a higher speed than when they displayed the same behaviors without USVs. For that purpose, for each behavioral event of each type, we computed the mean speed of the mouse displaying this behavior over the whole event. We performed a paired Wilcoxon test (alternative = “greater”) to compare the mean speed of the animal with and without USVs at the group level. In addition, to better understand inter-individual variations, we compared, within each individual and for each behavioral event type, the speeds during events overlapping with USVs to the speeds during events not overlapping with USVs using Mann–Whitney <italic toggle="yes">U</italic>-tests (unpaired, one-sided).</p>
        <p>Second, we tested whether one type of behavioral event was longer when emitted concomitantly with USVs than when it was not concomitant with USVs. For that purpose, within each individual and for each behavioral event type, we gathered the durations of events overlapping with USVs as well as the duration of events not overlapping with USVs. We compared these two lists of durations using Mann–Whitney <italic toggle="yes">U</italic>-tests (unpaired, one-sided) within each individual. We also performed a paired Wilcoxon test (alternative = “greater”) to compare at the group level the mean duration of the event with USVs and the mean duration of the same event without USVs. To control for the fact that longer behavioral events were more likely to include USVs, we used a random process in which USVs would occur at a random time. In this case, the longer USVs would have more chances to overlap with a USV. We simulated 1,000 different random distributions of the USVs, and we kept the same proportions of USVs overlapping with behavioral events as in the original data. We performed this test for each behavioral event in each experiment separately (data not shown). In each simulation, we performed the same statistical test (Mann–Whitney <italic toggle="yes">U</italic>-test) as in the original data, and we kept the <italic toggle="yes">p</italic>-value. The ratio of the number of <italic toggle="yes">p</italic>-values below the original one provided the probability to obtain the same effect randomly. In our study, this probability was less than 3%, suggesting that the effects of the presence of USVs on the duration of behavioral events could be found randomly with only a weak probability, i.e., longer events were not more likely to occur with USVs than shorter ones.</p>

      <title>A Platform to Analyze and Synchronize USVs With Behaviors</title>
      <p>We needed to automatically detect USVs despite the background noise (i.e., animals moving in the bedding, continuous electronic or ventilation noises) and to extract their acoustic features, all these aspects being synchronized with behavioral monitoring (<xref rid="SM1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Methods</xref>—Motivation to create a new recording and analysis pipeline). In our system, sounds were recorded using Avisoft SASLab Pro Recorder and synchronized with behavioral monitoring using LMT (Methods—Avisoft record and synchronization with Live Mouse Tracker). Mechanical noises (e.g., amplitudes at continuous frequencies from electronic devices or ventilation) were removed (<xref rid="SM1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Methods</xref>—Filtering spectrum data) and the USVs extracted (<xref rid="SM1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Methods</xref>—USV segmentation method/USV detection validation). The USVs were then synchronized with behaviors and the acoustic characteristics extracted and stored as metadata in the database (<xref rid="SM1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Tables II, III</xref>—Description of the acoustic variables measured for each USV and burst). We provide a library in Python to access and query these data. We developed an online application that allows the segmentation and analysis of wave files without software installation<sup>1</sup>.

      <title>Age- and Sex-Related Variations in Spontaneous Social Behaviors</title>
      <p>We examined the spontaneous social interactions of male and female same-sex pairs of B6 mice over 3 days. The previously observed reduced activity in males compared to females (de Chaumont et al., <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>) was not significant in juvenile males but only in mature males (i.e., aged 3 months or more) compared to females (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). The reduced time spent in social contacts displayed by males compared to females was visible already in immature males (example of nose-anogenital contact in <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>; see also <xref rid="SM1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>). Surprisingly, the mean duration of non-specific contacts (i.e., contact between the two mice without specifying any body parts) tended to be longer in mature males than in females (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>), while, as soon as specific contact are considered, the mean duration of these specific contacts such as nose-nose (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>) and nose-anogenital contacts (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref> and <xref rid="SM1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 2</xref>) were shorter in males than in females. Therefore, even if contact events are globally longer in males than in females, these two very specific contact types seem more prominent in females than in males. Males also displayed significantly shorter approach (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>) or escape (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2G</xref>) behaviors compared to females in adulthood, suggesting that their contacts initiated and terminated more abruptly, possibly reflecting aggressive interactions. As expected, these sex-related differences were less visible when the animals were immature (i.e., aged 5 weeks; <xref rid="SM1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figures 1, 2</xref>). In both sexes, the total time spent in nose-nose and nose-anogenital contacts tended to decrease with increasing age (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref rid="SM1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>).</p>

The total number of USVs recorded for 3 months-old <italic toggle="yes">Shank3</italic><sup>−/−</sup> females over the 3 days (5,527.0 ± 3,236.8) was not statistically different from that of USVs recorded for age-matched B6 females (6,589.3 ± 1,979.8; Mann–Whitney <italic toggle="yes">U</italic>-test: <italic toggle="yes">U</italic> = 8.0, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = 0.228; <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). <italic toggle="yes">Shank3</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice emitted significantly fewer USVs than B6 mice only during the second night (<italic toggle="yes">U</italic> = 2.0, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = 0.021; data not shown).</p>

        <p>We next examined the contexts in which USVs were emitted. Again, we observed a strong sex-related difference in the contexts of emission. Indeed, in males, most USVs were emitted when the mice were at a distance from each other (i.e., single idle), while in females most USVs were emitted in contact with each other, initiating contact, or approaching in a social range (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>). Interestingly, the Train2 behavior (i.e., following while keeping ano-genital contact) was highly specific to USV emission since up to 70% of these events were accompanied by USVs, in contrast to even closely related social behaviors such as ano-genital contacts or follow without contact (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>). The context-specificity described here was observed in all age classes as well as in 3-months old <italic toggle="yes">Shank3</italic><sup>−/−</sup> female pairs (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3D,E</xref>), despite their perturbed social behavior (see behavioral profiles above).</p>

      <title>Variations of the Acoustic Characteristics of USVs With Sex, Age, and Genotype</title>
      <p>For clarity of presentation, we selected acoustic variables based on PCA over the whole set of B6 USVs and validated through correlations between acoustic variables (see <xref rid="SM1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Methods</xref>—Selection of representative acoustic variables). The whole set of acoustic features is available in the supplementary files. Spectrograms of six USVs for B6 males (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>), B6 females (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>) and <italic toggle="yes">Shank3</italic><sup>−/−</sup> females (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>) aged 3 months are given as examples. When all USVs were considered, we observed that mature B6 males emitted significantly shorter (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>), less modulated (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>) and less harsh (i.e., less noisy; <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>) USVs compared to females (see also <xref rid="SM1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 7</xref>). These differences did not reach significance in juveniles (5 weeks of age) but only when animals were fully mature (i.e., at 3 and 7 months of age; <xref rid="SM1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 7</xref>). B6 males also emitted USVs with limited frequency difference between the start and the end points of the signal compared to females at any age (<xref rid="SM1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 7</xref>). Overall, USVs emitted by males appeared to be shorter, purer, and flatter compared to females’ USVs.</p>

      <p>When examining the influence of age on vocal production, we found that, in B6 females, the duration, frequency modulations, harshness, and loudness of USVs increased with increasing age, while the frequency-related traits decreased (<xref rid="SM1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 8</xref>). In males, this evolution with increasing age was more restricted, with a significant increase in duration, frequency, and harshness only between 3 and 7 months of age, as if it took more time for males to establish their social signals. Age-related variations in frequency-related traits appeared not to be stable between age classes, with the lowest frequency-related traits at 3 months of age (<xref rid="SM1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 8</xref>).</p>
      <p>Contrary to our hypothesis of simpler vocal communication in <italic toggle="yes">Shank3</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice, <italic toggle="yes">Shank3</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice emitted USVs with acoustic characteristics that were not significantly different from those of B6 females (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4G–J</xref>). There was only a trend for USVs to be starting at higher frequency (genotype: <italic toggle="yes">z</italic> = 2.31 [396.0, 4,775.1], <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = 0.021; intercept: <italic toggle="yes">z</italic> = 75.66, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &lt; 0.001 [63,713.9, 67,102.7]; <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4J</xref>) and to be quieter (i.e., less powerful) in <italic toggle="yes">Shank3</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice compared to B6 female mice (genotype: <italic toggle="yes">z</italic> = −2.80 [−0.42, −0.07], <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = 0.005; intercept: <italic toggle="yes">z</italic> = 15.22, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &lt; 0.001 [0.90, 1.17]; <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4K</xref>; see also <xref rid="SM1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 9</xref>). The differences in the power characteristics were not related to differences in the proximity to the microphone (<xref rid="SM1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figures 10A,B</xref>). The slightly smaller body volume (previously reported for body size in Schmeisser et al., <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>) and here estimated through body surface on the tracking mask; <xref rid="SM1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 10C</xref>) of <italic toggle="yes">Shank3</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice relative to that of B6 mice could partially explain the reduced power of <italic toggle="yes">Shank3</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mouse USVs.</p>

        <p>In males, the variations observed with increasing age remained significant only in single idle (and to a lower extent in approaching before a contact and in nose-nose contacts), where frequency-related traits were minimum at 3 months of age (<xref rid="SM1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 14</xref>). In other behavioral contexts, either the number of USVs emitted was too low or the variations were not significant. In females, the variations related to age were consistent across all behavioral contexts, with increasing duration, frequency modulations, power, and harshness as well as decreasing frequency-related traits with increasing age (<xref rid="SM1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 15</xref>).</p>

        <title>Variations of Acoustic Features Between Contexts</title>
        <p>From this step of the analysis, we restricted our investigations to females, given the low number of USVs emitted by males in other contexts than single idle. In B6 females, the context specificity increased with increasing age. Indeed, at 5 weeks (<xref rid="SM1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 17</xref>) and 3 months (<xref rid="SM1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 18</xref>) of age, USVs emitted during single idle and break contact displayed significantly shorter duration (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>), lower frequency modulations (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref>), lower harsh index compared to USVs emitted in other contexts. USVs emitted in both contexts were similar to each other, except for the mean frequency that was lower in break contact than in any other context (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5F</xref>). In addition, the USVs emitted during the different types of close contacts (nose-nose, nose-anogenital, side-side) displayed similar frequency characteristics and modulations but differed from other social contexts (see example for the frequency modulations in <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref>). At 7 months of age (<xref rid="SM1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 19</xref>), USVs emitted during the different types of close contacts were again not significantly different. In contrast, USVs emitted during the approach preceding a contact emerged as acoustically different from the USVs emitted during close contacts, follow and train2 behaviors as if the aging animals refined their approach behavior.</p>
        <p>In <italic toggle="yes">Shank3<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice recorded at 3 months of age, we observed that USVs emitted during Follow and Train2 behaviors were acoustically similar (<xref rid="SM1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 20</xref>), and both types significantly differed compared to USVs emitted in all other contexts, i.e., longer (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5G</xref>), harsher, larger frequency modulations (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5H</xref>) and lower mean frequency (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5I</xref>). Interestingly, USVs emitted by <italic toggle="yes">Shank3</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice during nose-to-nose contacts were significantly different [i.e., shorter duration (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5G</xref>), lower frequency modulation (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5H</xref>), higher-pitched (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5I</xref>)] from USVs emitted in other types of contacts.

      <title>Comparisons of Behaviors With and Without USVs</title>
      <p>We next hypothesized that behaviors accompanied by USVs were more intense (i.e., longer and with higher mean speed) than behaviors not accompanied by USVs. As a proxy for arousal, we considered the speed of the animals. We thus quantified the mean speed of the animals during behaviors accompanied or not by USVs, as well as the duration of these behaviors.</p>
      <p>Our hypothesis was not verified for Train2 events in any age class at the individual level. Indeed, within each individual, the duration of the event and the speed of the mice did not vary significantly, regardless of whether USVs were emitted or not (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>). This might be related to the fact that this behavior was the most specific to USVs (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>). In contrast, follow (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>), approach contact (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>), contact, getaway, and oral-genital contact (data not shown) showed both a significantly higher speed and longer duration when accompanied by USVs, in agreement with our hypothesis at the individual level. For break contact, the presence of USVs was accompanied by higher speed but not necessarily a longer duration (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref>). Overall, the relationship between USV emission and behavioral display (speed and duration of the event) suggests USVs can be considered as an expression of higher arousal in simple (e.g., follow, approach contact, break contact, oral-genital contact) social investigation, but not in the very intense and highly specific social investigation (such as Train2). These results obtained in B6 mice were also observed in <italic toggle="yes">Shank3</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice (<xref rid="SM1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 21</xref>).</p>

        <title>Evolution of Variables Over the Bursts</title>
        <p>For bursts containing nine or more USVs, we examined the evolution of the acoustic characteristics over the sequences of USVs. We restrained our analyses to females since such long USV bursts were extremely rare in males. In 3 months old B6 females, USVs appeared to be more complex in the middle of the USV bursts than at the extremities. This means that USVs in the middle of a burst displayed longer duration, larger frequency modulations, higher harsh index, and higher power in comparison with those at the beginning or at the end of the burst. These profiles were more subtle at 5 weeks of age and clearer at 7 months of age (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7E</xref>, three left columns). Interestingly, <italic toggle="yes">Shank3</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice displayed similar variations over the bursts, except for the mean power.

      <title>Tackling the Complexity of Mouse Ultrasonic Vocalizations</title>
      <p>In the vast majority of previous studies investigating mouse social communication, USVs were triggered by social deprivation (e.g., 2 weeks of isolation) and recorded in the first minutes or hours of interaction (Scattoni et al., <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Neunuebel et al., <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; Warren et al., <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">2018a</xref>, <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>; Sangiamo et al., <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). The USV types were either classified in a pre-determined repertoire (Scattoni et al., <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>) or simplified for modeling to reduce the complexity of the signals (e.g., ignoring harmonic components or frequency jumps or normalizing over duration; (Neunuebel et al., <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; Warren et al., <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">2018a</xref>, <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>; Sangiamo et al., <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>; but see Warren et al., <xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>). In our study, we provide a complementary approach by determining a large set of acoustic variables to avoid masking the complexity of the signals and leave the door open for any user to design their own classification as in Kikusui et al. (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>). This approach has the limit of inducing a large number of statistical tests over the different acoustic traits. In addition, the reduced number of pairs here recorded allowed to highlight only large effects between age or sex classes, and also between genotypes, despite the large amount of USVs recorded from each pair. We kept this limit in mind in our exploratory study, and we remain as cautious as possible throughout the study in the interpretation of the results. Future studies will elaborate on these results which work as working paths.</p>
      <p>We chose not to build an exhaustive repertoire, as the link between meaning and classification can be a pitfall due to the normalization of time and frequency, which provides the same meaning to short, long, or differently dynamic USVs. We chose to examine specific acoustic characteristics and relate them directly to the behavioral context. This approach should help to understand the information carried in USVs (Hertz et al., <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). We observed that USVs emitted during intense social interactions were longer, harsher, more modulated, and showed more frequency jumps than USVs emitted during non-social behaviors or at the end of social contacts (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>). This is reminiscent of USVs emitted by wild house mice during social contact, which are longer than USVs emitted when standing alone (near a food spot, in the nest; Hoier et al., <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>).</p>

      <title>Hypotheses About the Functions of USVs</title>
      <p>As previously observed in captive wild house mice (von Merten et al., <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>), we confirm over a long period that males in same-sex pairs emit few spontaneous USVs. Over short-term experiments, C57BL/6J male-male pairs also emitted the lowest number of USVs compared to male-female and female-female pairs, with the shortest bouts and simplest USVs (Matsumoto and Okanoya, <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>). In contrast, socially-deprived males have been shown to emit a non-negligible number of USVs (e.g., Chabout et al., <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Hammerschmidt et al., <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Ferhat et al., <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). In these previous studies, the vocal repertoire did not differ significantly between males and females (Hammerschmidt et al., <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Ey et al., <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; but see Matsumoto and Okanoya, <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>) and both sexes emitted USVs mostly during ano-genital sniffing and approach behavior (Ferhat et al., <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>, <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). In the present study, males emitted USVs in short bursts with context-specific rates a 100 times lower than that of females, probably because females were more active (longer distance traveled during the night) and spent more time in social interactions than males (<xref rid="SM1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>; see also de Chaumont et al., <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). Overall, because males are slightly less social and active than females, they may encounter fewer situations that trigger USVs. Nevertheless, this incommensurate decrease in call rate relative to females may be related to the natural social structure of mice, with only subordinate males regrouped in same-sex subgroups (Palanza et al., <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>). Other communication modalities, such as body posture and tactile contacts, may be sufficient for males to regulate their social interactions.</p>
      <p>We observed that females emitted USVs mostly during intense social interactions, such as Train2, and follow behaviors. The speed of the mice was also significantly higher during behaviors associated with USVs than those without (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>). It is thus possible that USVs reflect a high level of arousal, at least in C57BL/6J, the mouse strain tested here. The emission of a large number of spontaneous USVs suggests that female mice are sufficiently aroused in their “home-cage-like” life. In short-term experiments, socially-housed mice never reach this level of excitement during the first minutes of interaction (probably focusing on the exploration of the environment) and therefore emit few USVs (e.g., Hammerschmidt et al., <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Ey et al., <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). The emission of a large quantity of USVs can only be reached by social deprivation over such short periods. Social behaviors, such as follow, or approach contact, were significantly longer when accompanied by USVs than when occurring without (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>). This result parallels the reported increased duration of chasing when USVs were emitted by females chased by males (Neunuebel et al., <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). It is thus possible that some USVs are emitted only when a certain level of excitement is reached, for example after a specific time spent in contact. Whether certain USVs serve to maintain social contacts is currently unknown and would need to be tested using playback experiments synchronized with behavioral monitoring.</p>

      <title>Subtle Social Communication Abnormalities in <italic toggle="yes">Shank3</italic> Mutant Mice</title>
      <p>In our setting, <italic toggle="yes">Shank3<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice were less active, took a longer time to approach, and shorter time to escape their conspecific (<xref rid="SM1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 3</xref>), while individual contact events tended to be longer than those of WT mice (<xref rid="SM1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 4</xref>). These activity and social specificities are consistent with the results of previous studies using the same mutant mouse strain (Vicidomini et al., <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>; de Chaumont et al., <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). Other genetic models of <italic toggle="yes">Shank3</italic> mutant mice also display reduced social interest (<italic toggle="yes">Shank3</italic>-KO ex4–9: Bozdagi et al., <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Wang et al., <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Yang et al., <xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; <italic toggle="yes">Shank3</italic>-KO in ex21: Duffney et al., <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; <italic toggle="yes">Shank3</italic> ex4–9: Jaramillo et al., <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>; <italic toggle="yes">Shank3</italic>-cKI: Mei et al., <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>; <italic toggle="yes">Shank3</italic> exon 4–22 complete KO: Wang et al., <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>; <italic toggle="yes">Shank3B</italic>: Balaan et al., <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>; <italic toggle="yes">Shank3</italic> exon 13–16: Peca et al., <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Dhamne et al., <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>; Fourie et al., <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>; <italic toggle="yes">Shank3</italic>B<sup>+/–</sup>: Orefice et al., <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>; Pagani et al., <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). Nevertheless, other models failed to detect any atypical social interest in <italic toggle="yes">Shank3</italic> mutant mice (<italic toggle="yes">Shank3</italic>-KO ex4–9: Drapeau et al., <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; <italic toggle="yes">Shank3-</italic>KO ex9: Lee et al., <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; <italic toggle="yes">Shank3</italic>-KO ex 21: Kouser et al., <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; <italic toggle="yes">Shank3</italic>-KO and HZ in ex21: Speed et al., <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; <italic toggle="yes">Shank3</italic>-KO ex11–21 rat model: Song et al., <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>; conditional <italic toggle="yes">Shank3</italic> exon 4–22 knockout in the forebrain, striatum, and striatal D1 and D2 cells: Bey et al., <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>; <italic toggle="yes">Shank3</italic><sup>+/Q321R</sup> and <italic toggle="yes">Shank3</italic><sup>Q321R/Q321R</sup>: Yoo et al., <xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). Such variability may be the consequence of differences in the type of mutation, the behavioral protocols, or housing conditions.</p>
      <p>There are few studies that have investigated ultrasonic communication in <italic toggle="yes">Shank3</italic> mutant mice. Pup isolation calls were not affected in <italic toggle="yes">Shank3</italic>-KO ex4–9 mice (Yang et al., <xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Jaramillo et al., <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>), the <italic toggle="yes">Shank3</italic>-KO ex11–21 rat model (Song et al., <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>), or <italic toggle="yes">Shank3b</italic>-KO mice (Balaan et al., <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>), whereas those of complete <italic toggle="yes">Shank3-</italic>KO ex4–22 mice showed a lower rate, as well as shorter duration, lower frequency, and lower amplitude (Wang et al., <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). In the context of a male briefly interacting with an estrus female, the rate of USV emission was not affected in <italic toggle="yes">Shank3-</italic>KO ex21 (Kouser et al., <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>) or <italic toggle="yes">Shank3-</italic>KO ex4–9 mice (Yang et al., <xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Nevertheless, it was lower in <italic toggle="yes">Shank3B</italic>-KO mutant males (Dhamne et al., <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>; Pagani et al., <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>) and higher in <italic toggle="yes">Shank3-</italic>KO ex4–9 males (Wang et al., <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Jaramillo et al., <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>) than in WT male mice. In <italic toggle="yes">Shank3</italic><sup>Q321R/Q321R</sup> mutant mice, the number of USVs in male-female interactions was not significantly different from that of WT mice, but <italic toggle="yes">Shank3</italic><sup>+/Q321R</sup> mutants showed a higher mean duration of USVs than WT mice (Yoo et al., <xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). Male complete <italic toggle="yes">Shank3-</italic>KO ex4–22 mice also showed a lower rate of USVs than WT males when encountering an estrus female, but they were of shorter duration, reduced amplitude, and normal peak frequency (Wang et al., <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). One strength of our study is that it was designed to directly relate communication deficits with behavioral deficits. For example, the lower call rate of Shank3<sup>−/−</sup> mice on the second night may be related to a significantly reduced total duration of Train2 and significantly fewer of these Train2 events (data not shown), a behavior that triggers a high rate of USV emission in WT mice.</p>
      <p>Concerning USV bursts, <italic toggle="yes">Shank3<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice emitted fewer USVs per burst, but their USVs were weaker than those of B6 mice, with stable power throughout the burst, a trait rarely observed in B6 mice. Variations in USV duration were shown to be present in the <italic toggle="yes">Shank3</italic> mutant carrying the Q321R point mutation (Yoo et al., <xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>), while the reduction of amplitude/power was also highlighted in the <italic toggle="yes">Shank3</italic> KO ex4–22 mice (Wang et al., <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>), in parallel with the unstable dominance hierarchy in complete <italic toggle="yes">Shank3</italic> KO triads relative to WT triads (Wang et al., <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Overall, in our hands, <italic toggle="yes">Shank3</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice were able to emit USVs with similar acoustic structures and used them in similar contexts as B6 mice but perturbed hierarchical relationships may modify the structure of the USV bursts.</p>

      <title>Perspectives</title>
      <p>Here, we showed sex- and age-related differences in the spontaneous communication of mice. Major quantitative and qualitative differences emerged between males and females from 3 months of age on. Females emitted more USVs than males, specifically during intense social investigations. With increasing age, mice emitted longer and more complex USVs, with specific differences between USV acoustic structure and behavioral contexts. Female <italic toggle="yes">Shank3<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice emitted USV bursts with fewer but weaker USVs than age-matched WT females. Future developments will include the implementation of the identification of the emitter. Indeed, identifying the sound source will refine the contexts in which USVs are emitted, allowing also to test the interaction between mice of different sexes or genotypes. Our system offers the possibility to characterize spontaneous mouse communication and paves the way for new studies investigating the complex interplay between genetic background, social experience, and hierarchy in the richness of social communication.</p>
