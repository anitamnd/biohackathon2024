    <abstract>
      <p>Zinc-finger nucleases (ZFNs) are important tools for genome engineering. Despite intense interest by many academic groups, the lack of robust noncommercial methods has hindered their widespread use. The modular assembly (MA) of ZFNs from publicly available one-finger archives provides a rapid method to create proteins that can recognize a very broad spectrum of DNA sequences. However, three- and four-finger arrays often fail to produce active nucleases. Efforts to improve the specificity of the one-finger archives have not increased the success rate above 25%, suggesting that the MA method might be inherently inefficient due to its insensitivity to context-dependent effects. Here we present the first systematic study on the effect of array length on ZFN activity. ZFNs composed of six-finger MA arrays produced mutations at 15 of 21 (71%) targeted loci in human and mouse cells. A novel drop-out linker scheme was used to rapidly assess three- to six-finger combinations, demonstrating that shorter arrays could improve activity in some cases. Analysis of 268 array variants revealed that half of MA ZFNs of any array composition that exceed an ab initio B-score cutoff of 15 were active. These results suggest that, when used appropriately, MA ZFNs are able to target more DNA sequences with higher success rates than other current methods.</p>

<body>
  <p>Zinc-finger nucleases (ZFNs) have shown great potential as tools for genome engineering and gene therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">Mackay and Segal 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">Urnov et al. 2010</xref>). Two arrays of engineered zinc fingers must bind their DNA targets at a precise spacing (typically five, six, or seven base pairs) to allow their C-terminal FokI cleavage domains to dimerize and form an active nuclease. It has been challenging to engineer zinc-finger arrays with properties appropriate to produce highly active ZFNs. The proprietary methods of Sangamo Biosciences and Sigma-Aldrich appear to produce arrays that recognize a broad spectrum of DNA sequences, sufficient to create ZFNs that can disrupt any desired human gene or be used in clinical trials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">Urnov et al. 2010</xref>). However, the high cost of these commercial reagents has severely limited their use. In contrast, noncommercial engineering methods have been more restricted in their capabilities. Rapid and simple modular assembly (MA) methods have been developed based on fingers or modules that had been engineered (Barbas and coworkers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">Gonzalez et al. 2010</xref>]) or identified from nature (Kim and coworkers/ToolGen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">Bae et al. 2003</xref>]) and bind a broad diversity of 3-bp DNA sites. However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">Ramirez et al. (2008)</xref> reported that MA had unexpectedly high failure rates with only 6% of three-finger MA array pairs predicted to produce an active ZFN. More recently, success rates â¼25% were achieved using specialized sets of modules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">S Kim et al. 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">Zhu et al. 2011</xref>). Oligomerized pool engineering (OPEN) was introduced as a method to account for context-dependent effects by optimizing all three modules together in the context of the target sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">Maeder et al. 2008</xref>). However, OPEN was complicated, laborious, and limited to arrays that recognize all 16 GNN (e.g., GAG, GCTâ¦) and a few TNN triplets. Three-finger arrays that recognize 5â²-GNNGNNGNN-3â² are limited to &lt;4% of all possible 9-bp sites. Since two arrays are required for a ZFN, &lt;0.16% of all 18-bp sequences could be targeted. As one example of this limitation, it would not be possible to design OPEN arrays for 90 (87%) of the 104 target sites used in the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">Ramirez et al. (2008)</xref> study; thus, the expected failure rate of OPEN would be greater than the unexpected failure rate of MA (76%) on these targets. Context-dependent assembly (CoDA) enabled the rapid assembly of parts of previously successful OPEN arrays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">Sander et al. 2011</xref>). CoDA ZFNs were shown to successfully cleave 50% of their chromosomal targets. However, the range of targetable sequences was a subset of OPEN and insufficient to target, for example, all protein-coding regions in the genomes of zebrafish and <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">Sander et al. 2011</xref>). Thus, public capabilities are far from the aspirations to use ZFNs to precisely edit single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) or genetic mutations causing disease.</p>
  <p>A common interpretation for the failure rates of three-finger MA arrays was their insensitivity to context-dependent effects; modules engineered in one context may not perform well when placed in a different sequence context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">Cathomen and Joung 2008</xref>). However, an alternative interpretation was suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">Sander et al. (2009)</xref>, who observed that three-finger arrays composed of high-affinity Barbas modules tended to have high affinity, whereas arrays of low affinity modules bound poorly. Approximately 60% of the GNN-modules were considered to have high affinity, corresponding well with the 60% of GNN arrays reported to bind well by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">Ramirez et al. (2008)</xref>. These results led us to hypothesize that the primary inefficiency of three-finger MA arrays might not be a fundamental disregard for context dependencies, but rather that several modules lacked sufficient affinity. This hypothesis was reinforced by the recent demonstration that the specificity of MA arrays was similar to that of naturally occurring zinc-finger proteins and therefore was unlikely to be the primary cause of their poor performance in ZFNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">Lam et al. 2011</xref>). In principle, modules could be re-engineered to have higher affinity. As a more pragmatic solution, longer arrays of modules could be used to increase affinity. Anecdotal evidence supported this concept (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">Gordley et al. 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">Guo et al. 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">Perez-Pinera et al. 2012</xref>). However, we showed recently that a caveat to the latter approach is that the addition of modules can, in some cases, reduce the activity of a ZFN, perhaps by allowing subgroups of fingers to bind additional unexpected locations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">Shimizu et al. 2011</xref>). These considerations led us to perform a systematic investigation of number and composition of modules on ZFN activity.</p>

      <title>Longer MA arrays generally increase ZFN activity, but the relationship is not linear</title>
      <p>To systematically examine the relationship between array length and ZFN activity, we designed extended-MA ZFNs to eight loci in the human genome near SNPs associated with coronary artery disease. Target sites were chosen that contained spacers of five, six, or seven base pairs between the two zinc-finger binding sites, requiring ZFNs to be constructed with zinc fingerâFokI linkers of TGGS, TGAAAR, and TGPGAAAR, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">Handel et al. 2009</xref>). Unlike CoDA target sites, all sites here contained mixtures of ANN, CNN, GNN, and TNN type triplets (Supplemental Table S1; Supplemental Appendix SI). Arrays composed of three to six fingers were constructed using the Barbas set of zinc-finger modules, which are the most expansive in terms of sequence recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">Bhakta and Segal 2010</xref>). Since the sequential addition of modules is laborious, we developed a âdrop-out linkerâ strategy by which the three-, four-, and five-module arrays could be created from a six-module array using silent restriction sites in coding regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>; Supplemental Fig. S1). In this way, only two six-finger arrays would need to be synthesized or assembled for each heterodimeric ZFN. The two sets of four arrays could then be generated in parallel in one day to enable the rapid testing of all 16 combinations of arrays.</p>

      <p>Using a single-strand annealing (SSA) recombination reporter assay in HEK293T cells, we examined the activity of the various combinations of arrays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). Generally, ZFNs composed of two three-finger arrays were least active, whereas ZFNs composed of two six-finger arrays were more active (defined as a percentage of the activity of a control ZFN [GZF3-L3 + GZF1-R3]) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">Szczepek et al. 2007</xref>). However, activity did not correlate linearly with the number of modules. The optimal lengths for the left and right arrays were often different. For example, increasing the left array of the CS2-1 ZFN from three to six fingers increased ZFN activity, whereas increasing the right array decreased activity. The optimum was L5 + R3. For CS7-3, L6 + R5 was more active than L6 + R6.</p>

      <p>To streamline the methodology even further, we demonstrated that we could also omit the SSA assay. Cells were treated directly with the 16 combinations of ZFNs targeting two additional endogenous loci and analyzed using the Surveyor assay, which detects the appearance of mutations due to nonhomologous end joining at the cleavage site. Active MA ZFNs were obtained for both loci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>; Supplemental Fig. S2<bold>)</bold>. Consistent with the differential array behaviors observed in the SSA assay, all left arrays of the T2-X6 ZFN supported activity, but only R4 produced an active nuclease.</p>

      <p>High-throughput sequencing demonstrated that seven of the 10 L6 + R6 ZFNs (70%) produced indels (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>, Exploratory study; Supplemental Fig. S3; Supplemental Appendix SIII) at 0.5% or greater (a value considered âactiveâ in other ZFN studies) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">Gupta et al. 2012</xref>). In addition, seven array-length variants that had been found to be more active by SSA or the Surveyor assay were generally found to be more active at their endogenous sites. Some ZFNs remained inactive, perhaps due to an unfavorable chromatin environment at the endogenous locus. Of the 13 ZFNs for which both SSA and indel data were available, the correlation of percent indel activity to percent SSA activity was modest (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.25). However, there was perfect correlation between an indel threshold of â¥0.5% and an SSA threshold of â¥8%.</p>

      <title>Development of a scoring system to help predict outcomes</title>
      <p>To apply this âextended-MAâ approach as a useful method, we developed a scoring system to rank potential binding sites based on predicted zinc-finger binding affinity. Using the measured affinities of Barbas GNN modules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">Segal et al. 1999</xref>), previous studies showed that the relative affinity of new 3 Ã GNN arrays (recognizing sites of the composition 5â²-GNNGNNGNN-3â²) could be accurately predicted by calculating the value of ÎÎG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">Sander et al. 2009</xref>). Unfortunately, this method is limited to the prediction of 3 Ã GNN arrays since similar affinity data do not currently exist for ANN, CNN, or TNN modules. We therefore created an ab initio âB-scoreâ based on the theory that binding energy should be proportional to the number of bivalent hydrogen bonds, such as between G and Arg or between A and Gln or Asn (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>; Supplemental Table S2; Supplemental Discussion S1). The B-score correlated well (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.73â0.86) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B,C</xref>) with the measured affinities of 3 Ã GNN arrays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">Segal et al. 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">Sander et al. 2009</xref>) and moderately well (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.52) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4D</xref>) with the affinities of six-finger arrays of mixed ANN, CNN, or TNN composition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">MS Kim et al. 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">Shimizu et al. 2011</xref>). The weak correlation with the latter data set was somewhat expected since it is known that the affinities of arrays longer than three fingers often do not scale linearly. However, the trend predicted by the B-score was more accurate for this set than any currently available method, such as summing the number of GNN modules (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.12). Therefore, though not a perfect predictor, the B-score was used as a predictor of relative binding affinity. The SSA scores for 92 ZFN array-length variants were evaluated by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4E</xref>; Supplemental Appendix SI). The Comb.B score was found to be the best classifier for an SSA threshold of â¥8% (area under the curve [AUC] = 0.77). Importantly, the Comb.B score was more accurate than the number of GNN modules (AUC = 0.66), which was recently suggested to have the best correlation with the activity of 3 Ã GNN MA ZFNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">Zhu et al. 2011</xref>). A Comb.B score of 15 was found to be the best compromise between true and false positives.</p>

      <title>A prospective study based on B-scores</title>
      <p>The most efficient method for most investigators would be to (1) use the B-score to predict sites to which active ZFNs could be prepared; (2) screen just one ZFN combination on such sites for activity; and (3) optionally test all 16 combinations of arrays on active sites to determine the optimal nuclease configuration. ZFNs composed of six-finger drop-out linker arrays would be an ideal initial configuration because the 16 combinations of subarrays could be quickly constructed and tested, if desired. We therefore performed a prospective study on 11 additional ZFN targets that each had a B-score for the L6 + R6 arrays of â¥15 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>, Prospective study; Supplemental Appendix SIII). Eight of the 11 L6 + R6 ZFNs were successful in the indel assay (73%). In contrast to the earlier ZFN set, analysis of all 16 array-length combinations by SSA revealed few examples of shorter arrays providing improved activity (Supplemental Fig. S4). Six array variants were examined and found to have similar or reduced activity at their endogenous targets (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>).</p>

      <title>Long interfinger linkers do not improve ZFN activity</title>
      <p>The ZFNs made in this study exclusively use canonical TGEKP interfinger linkers, which have been shown to be the optimal linker length for six-finger arrays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">Peisach and Pabo 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">Neuteboom et al. 2006</xref>). However, proteins with four or more fingers have the potential to bind to off-target sites using subsets of three fingers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">Shimizu et al. 2011</xref>). Other studies have suggested that the use of noncanonical TGSQKP linkers between pairs of fingers can improve the specificity and consequently, ZFN activity, presumably by disrupting the binding of three-finger subsets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">Moore et al. 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">Gupta et al. 2012</xref>). This strategy has been adapted widely by Sangamo Biosciences and Sigma-Aldrich (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">Doyon et al. 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">Perez et al. 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">Hockemeyer et al. 2009</xref>). In contrast to these studies, we observed that the use of disruptive linkers dramatically decreased the SSA activity of all configurations of extended-MA ZFNs and did not rescue the activity of any inactive ZFNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>). These data suggest that the use of disruptive linkers is not recommended for extended-MA ZFNs.</p>

      <title>Longer MA arrays are not associated with increased cytotoxicity</title>
      <p>To better understand the mechanism by which additional fingers affect performance (Supplemental Discussion S2), the affinity and specificity of the three- and five-finger arrays of ZFN CS2-1 were investigated by quantitative electromobility shift assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6A</xref>; Supplemental Fig. S4). Consistent with the activity data, CS2-1 L3 did not display detectable binding (K<sub>D</sub> &gt; 532 nM), whereas L5 bound tightly (K<sub>D</sub> = 0.08 nM). In contrast, both R3 and R5 bound their target with similar affinity (K<sub>D</sub> = 0.56 nM). Therefore, the reduction in ZFN activity in comparing CS2-1-R3 to CS2-1-R5 is likely not due to loss of affinity, which is similar to observations we reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">Shimizu et al. 2011</xref>). The reduction in activity may be due to the ability of subsets of the multiple fingers to bind additional specific or nonspecific targets. As one measure of specificity, the proteins were tested for binding to a nontarget DNA (proteins L3 and L5 on the R6 target and vice versa). All proteins failed to shift the nontarget DNA even at the highest protein concentrations used in this assay, suggesting a &gt;1000-fold discrimination between target and nontarget. Specificity was further examined using the Bind-n-Seq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">Zykovich et al. 2009</xref>) target site selection assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6B</xref>). Compared to L3, L5 recognized a site that was not only longer but also a closer match with the intended target site. In contrast, the binding site length and composition of R5 improved minimally compared to R3. These results demonstrate that, for the case of CS2-1, ZFN failure was primarily the fault of just one array in the pair. Optimizing the array length improved both the affinity and specificity of the underperforming array.</p>

      <p>As another assay of the specificity of short and long arrays, we examined the cytotoxicity of three inactive and three active ZFNs. ZFNs with poor specificity have more off-target cleavage events, leading to cytotoxicity. CS7-1-L3 + R3 was inactive with three-finger arrays, HIV7533-L6 + R6 was inactive with six-finger arrays (even though the L4 + R3 version was active), and CS2-1-L3 + R5 was inactive with arrays of mixed length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6D</xref>). Cytotoxicity was assessed as a decrease in the percentage of ZFN-expressing cells on day 5 compared to day 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6C</xref>). None of the inactive ZFNs were observed to be cytotoxic, arguing against the possibility that the long array-ZFNs only appear inactive because they kill the cells expressing them. HIV7533-L4 + R3 was the shortest active combination of arrays in our study, CS7-1-L6 + R6 was active with the longest arrays, and CS2-1-L5 + R3 was active with mixed array lengths. Importantly, the active ZFNs with the shortest and longest arrays were not observed to be cytotoxic, demonstrating that long arrays per se are not problematic. The third ZFN of mixed array length showed a significant level of cytotoxicity. Considering all of the data, it seems likely that such cytotoxicity is due to the specifics of that particular ZFN and not a general deficiency of the methodology. These observations generally support the use of extended MA to create active and nontoxic nucleases.</p>

    <title>Discussion</title>
    <p>Combining the data from the exploratory and prospective studies, L6 + R6 extended-MA arrays produced active ZFNs at 15 of 21 (71%) of endogenous target sites, greater than the success rates recently reported for other MA methods (25%) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">S Kim et al. 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">Zhu et al. 2011</xref>) or CoDA (50%) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">Sander et al. 2011</xref>) and similar to the rate of an engineered two-finger archive (82%) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">Gupta et al. 2012</xref>). From a practical perspective, this means it might only be necessary to test one or two L6 + R6 ZFNs to different sites to find one that is active. Activity can be improved by using shorter arrays in some cases, and the drop-out linker can facilitate this rapid empirical testing. Shorter arrays can also be useful to maximize the spectrum of sequences that can be targeted, since in some cases the lack of appropriate modules may prevent the construction of two six-finger arrays. Toward that end, the SSA scores of all 268 ZFN array variants examined in this study suggest that any combination of MA arrays would be successful in 38% of cases; but with a combined B-score of â¥15, they could produce an active ZFN in 52% of cases (Supplemental Table S4), which again would require testing of only one or two ZFNs. Thus, when choosing sites that are not L6 + R6 arrays, the combined B-score is particularly helpful. The accuracy (69%) of using the B-score was found to derive primarily from avoiding true negative unsuccessful short-array target sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref>).</p>

    <p>Another potential parameter for optimization is the use of long disruptive linkers between sets of two fingers. However, in contrast to previous studies, we observed only deleterious effects from the use of long linkers. It could be that even more empirical testing would be required to realize a benefit, such as systematically evaluating all possible linker substitutions and combinations. It should also be noted that most other studies have used long linkers in the context of two-finger modules rather than one-finger modules. Until better guidance becomes available, long linkers should be avoided for extended-MA ZFNs.</p>
    <p>The very comprehensive lexicon of existing one-finger modules enables an extended-MA ZFN site approximately once every 52 bp (Supplemental Discussion S3). To illustrate the impact of the broader sequence recognition, a 60-kb region of DNA (hg18, chr9:22060000-22119999) was searched for potential ZFN sites using websites corresponding to three publicly available engineering methods.<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Our website (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.genomecenter.ucdavis.edu/segallab/segallabsoftware">http://www.genomecenter.ucdavis.edu/segallab/segallabsoftware</ext-link>) using extended MA found 3474 ZFN sites with a B-score â¥15 (spacers = 5, 6, or 7).

    <p>These enhanced capabilities should also allow extended MA to target 91% of 28,527 unique protein-coding transcripts in the zebrafish genome (Ensemble Zv9 database), with an average of 118 sites per transcript, and 99% of 27,251 unique protein-coding transcripts in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (The <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> Information Resource 10 release) with an average of 26 sites per transcript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8B</xref>).

    <p>The extended-MA method therefore provides dramatically improved genome engineering capabilities compared to other publicly available ZFN assembly methods. These results demonstrate that, when used appropriately, modular assembly can outperform methods that were developed to address its deficiencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">Cathomen and Joung 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">Maeder et al. 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">Sander et al. 2011</xref>). We believe that these results clarify a common misconception in the field that modular assembly is fundamentally inefficient. We note, however, that transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) appear to have an even greater success rate and target an even broader spectrum of DNA sequences than is currently possible with extended MA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">Bogdanove and Voytas 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">Reyon et al. 2012</xref>). Robust assembly methods have already enabled widespread adaptation of TALENs for genome engineering applications in contrast to the limited ZFN methods that inspired this study.</p>

Pairs of sequences were compared to each other to search for overlap between the ends of the reads. When overlap was found, both sequences were combined into a single DNA sequence. Each of these resulting sequences was compared to the sequence and length of the wild-type (WT) target site sequence and the number of instances of each particular sequence was recorded.</p>

      <title>Cytotoxicity assay</title>
      <p>Toxicity was assessed by measuring the ratio of transfected cells on day 5 compared to day 1, as described by (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">Cornu and Cathomen 2010</xref>). HEK293T cells (5 Ã 10<sup>5</sup>) were seeded in six-well plates in 2 mL of DMEM/BCS/PenStrep. Cells were transfected using Lipofectamine-2000 and 1 Î¼g of pPNLK-GFP and 1 Î¼g of each ZFN or PGK-empty (3 Î¼g of total DNA). On day 1 (24 h post-transfection), cells were harvested for flow cytometry. Cells were washed with 1 mL of DPBS. Cells were released with 300 Î¼L of trypsin then harvested in an additional 900 Î¼L of DMEM complete medium. A portion of this (350 Î¼L) was applied to a new six-well plate + 2 mL DMEM complete as the Day 5 sample. The remaining cells were washed with DPBS, resuspended in 300 Î¼L of DPBS, and transferred to tubes for flow cytometry on ice. Cells (50,000) were scanned for GFP using a BD Biosciences LSRII. On day 5, cells were similarly harvested and scanned. All experiments were performed in at least duplicates and repeated on two different days.</p>
