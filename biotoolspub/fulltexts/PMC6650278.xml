      <p id="Par1">Inflammatory bowel diseases, which include Crohnâs disease and ulcerative colitis, affect several million individuals worldwide. Crohnâs disease and ulcerative colitis are complex diseases that are heterogeneous at the clinical, immunological, molecular, genetic, and microbial levels. Individual contributing factors have been the focus of extensive research. As part of the Integrative Human Microbiome Project (HMP2 or iHMP), we followed 132 subjects for one year each to generate integrated longitudinal molecular profiles of host and microbial activity during disease (up to 24 time points each; in total 2,965 stool, biopsy, and blood specimens). Here we present the results, which provide a comprehensive view of functional dysbiosis in the gut microbiome during inflammatory bowel disease activity. We demonstrate a characteristic increase in facultative anaerobes at the expense of obligate anaerobes, as well as molecular disruptions in microbial transcription (for example, among clostridia), metabolite pools (acylcarnitines, bile acids, and short-chain fatty acids), and levels of antibodies in host serum. Periods of disease activity were also marked by increases in temporal variability, with characteristic taxonomic, functional, and biochemical shifts. Finally, integrative analysis identified microbial, biochemical, and host factors central to this dysregulation. The studyâs infrastructure resources, results, and data, which are available through the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Multiâomics Database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ibdmdb.org">http://ibdmdb.org</ext-link>), provide the most comprehensive description to date of host and microbial activities in inflammatory bowel diseases.</p>

    <p id="Par3">Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) affect more than 3.5 million people, and their incidence is increasing worldwide<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. These diseases, the most prevalent forms of which are Crohnâs disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), are characterized by debilitating and chronic relapsing and remitting inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract (for CD) or the colon (in UC). These conditions result from a complex interplay among host<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>, microbial<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>, and environmental<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup> factors. Drivers of IBD in the human genome include more than 200 risk variants, many of which are responsible for hostâmicrobe interactions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Common changes in the gut microbiome in individuals with IBD include an increase in facultative anaerobes, including <italic>Escherichia coli</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>, and a decrease in obligately anaerobic producers of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Here, to support a systems-level understanding of the aetiology of the IBD-associated gut microbiome that goes beyond previously reported metagenomic profiles, we introduce the IBDMDB, as part of the Integrative Human Microbiome Project.</p>
    <p id="Par4">We recruited 132 participants from five academic medical centres (three paediatric sub-cohorts: Cincinnati Childrenâs Hospital, Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) Pediatrics, and Emory University Hospital; and two adult cohorts: MGH and Cedars-Sinai Medical Center; Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>, Extended Data Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>, seeÂ <xref rid="Sec7" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref>). Individuals not diagnosed with IBD on the basis of initial endoscopic and histopathologic findings were classified as ânon-IBDâ controls. We analysed 651 biopsies (baseline) and 529 blood samples (approximately quarterly), which were collected in the clinic, and 1,785 stool samples, which were collected every two weeks using a home shipment protocol for one year (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). The latter yielded primarily microbially focused profiles: metagenomes (MGX), metatranscriptomes (MTX), proteomes (MPX), metabolomes (MBX), and viromes (VX) at several âglobalâ time points across all subjects (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>), as well as denser, more intensive sampling from individuals with more variable disease activity (seeÂ <xref rid="Sec7" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref>, Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">1aâd</xref>). We generated multiple measurement types from many individual stool specimens, including 305 samples that yielded all stool-derived measurements, and 791 MGXâMTX pairs (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>, Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). Biopsies yielded host- and microbe-targeted human RNA sequencing (RNA-seq (HTX)), epigenetic reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS), and 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing (16S), which were matched with human exome sequencing, serological profiles, and RRBS from blood.

    <title>Multi-omic gut microbiome changes in IBD</title>
    <p id="Par5">Consistent with prior studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>, although subsets of IBD (CD in particular) contributed to the second axis of taxonomy-based principal coordinates (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref>, Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>), inter-individual variation accounted for the majority of variance for all measurement types<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup> (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1e, f</xref>, Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>). Even relatively large effects, such as disease status or physiological and technical factors, explained a smaller proportion of variation (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1f</xref>); this was true across measurement types, although these captured distinct aspects of IBD dysbiosis (see below).</p>
    <p id="Par6">Most measurement types captured correlated changes among and within subjects, cross-sectionally and longitudinally (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1e</xref>). Functional profiles, measured from MGX, MTX, and MPX, were the most tightly coupled (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1e</xref>), although some individual feature-wise correlations were weak (Spearmanâs correlation MGXâMTX 0.44Â Â±Â 0.10 (meanÂ Â±Â s.d.), MGXâMPX 0.14Â Â±Â 0.083, and MTXâMPX 0.18Â Â±Â 0.096l; Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>). Unexpectedly, characterized enzymes tended to be only weakly correlated with their known substrates or products (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">1</xref>). Although our dietary characterization was obtained through a very broad-level food frequency questionnaire, it provides an initial characterization of longitudinal dietâmicrobiome coupling in a substantial population over many months; diet accounted for a small but significant 3% (false discovery rate (FDR) <italic>P</italic>Â =Â 7.4Â ÃÂ 10<sup>â4</sup>) of taxonomic variation between subjects, and 0.7% (FDR <italic>P</italic>Â =Â 4.3Â ÃÂ 10<sup>â4</sup>) of variation longitudinally.</p>
    <p id="Par7">Simple cross-sectional differences between individuals with IBD and those without (Supplementary Tables <xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media">1</xref>â<xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media">14</xref>) were most apparent in the metabolome (Figs. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1f</xref>, <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>, Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">2a, c, d</xref>, seeÂ <xref rid="Sec7" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref>). Overall, metabolite pools were less diverse in individuals with IBD, paralleling previous observations for microbial diversity (Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media">2</xref>); this might be caused by poor nutrient absorption, greater water or blood content in the bowels, and shorter bowel transit times in individuals with active IBD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. The smaller number of compounds that were more abundant in patients with IBD included polyunsaturated fatty acids such as adrenate and arachidonate. Pantothenate and nicotinate (vitamins B5 and B3, respectively) were particularly depleted in the gut during IBD; this is notable because these are not typically among the B vitamins that are deficient in the serum of patients with IBD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>, although low nicotinate levels have been detected during active CD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Both vitamins are required to produce cofactors used in lipid metabolism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>, and nicotinate has anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic functions in the gut<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Notably, nicotinuric acid, a metabolite of nicotinate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>, was found almost exclusively in the stool of patients with IBD. Faecal calprotectin and the HarveyâBradshaw Index (HBI), two measures of disease severity in CD, showed no significant correlation, whereas the Simple Clinical Colitis Activity Index<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup> (SCCAI) in UC did correlate weakly with faecal calprotectin levels (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><title>Metagenomic, metatranscriptomic, and stool metabolomic profiles are disrupted during IBD activity.</title><p><bold>a</bold>, Relative abundance distributions for ten of the most cross-sectionally significantly differentially abundant metabolites in samples from individuals with IBD, as a ratio to the median relative abundance in individuals without IBD (Wald test; all FDR <italic>P</italic>Â &lt;Â 0.003; seeÂ <xref rid="Sec7" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref>; Supplementary Tables <xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media">1</xref>â<xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media">14</xref>).

    <p id="Par8">Notably, no metagenomic species were significantly different between samples from individuals with IBD and those from control individuals after correction for multiple hypothesis testing (Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media">1</xref>), in contrast with previous work<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. We hypothesized this was due to the differentiation of study participants into two subsets, one with relatively inactive IBD (due to remission or recent onset) and the other with greater activity. This differentiation has been observed in several cohorts of patients with IBD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>, but it is more pronounced here because we did not take samples specifically from subjects selected for active disease. We therefore classified samples with taxonomic compositions highly unlike those of non-IBD control samples as âdysbioticâ (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>, Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">3aâe</xref>, seeÂ <xref rid="Sec7" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref>). Dysbiotic excursions in this cohort did not correspond with disease location (for example, ileal CD; <italic>F</italic>-test <italic>P</italic>Â =Â 0.11, seeÂ <xref rid="Sec7" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref>), and occurred longitudinally within subjects; they were weakly correlated with patient-reported and molecular measures of disease activity (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref>, Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>). In total, 272 dysbiotic samples were taken during 78 full periods of dysbiosis and 9 censored periods (that is, subjects who were dysbiotic at the end of the time series, seeÂ <xref rid="Sec7" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref>), or 17.1% of all samples (<italic>n</italic>Â =Â 178 (24.3%) in CD and <italic>n</italic>Â =Â 51 (11.6%) in UC). Plots of the durations of and times between dysbiotic periods were approximately exponential, suggesting that transitions are triggered, at least in part, by events with constant probability over time (and are thus potentially stochastic; Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2e</xref>).</p>
    <p id="Par9">Using the resulting definition of dysbiosis, dysbiotic periods corresponded to a larger fraction of variation in all measurement types than did overall IBD phenotype (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1f</xref>, Supplementary Tables <xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media">15</xref>â<xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media">28</xref>); this is likely to reflect a clearer delineation between active and less active disease states within extremely heterogeneous subjects over time. Though it is unclear which aspects of dysbiosis are causes or consequences of IBD, characterization of these changes will lead to greater understanding of microbial dynamics in disease. As in previous cross-sectional studies of established disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>, differences between dysbiotic and non-dysbiotic samples from individuals with CD were more pronounced than in those from individuals with UC (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1f</xref>). Notably, dysbiosis also distinguished between independent host measures, such as individuals with high and low ASCA (anti-<italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> antibodies), ANCA (anti-neutrophil cytoplasm antibodies), OmpC (outer membrane protein C), and CBir1 (anti-flagellin) antibody titres in serological profiles (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2f</xref>; Fisherâs combined probability test <italic>P</italic>Â =Â 0.00044 from Wilcoxon tests between dysbiotic and non-dysbiotic CD). Dysbiosis was not significantly associated with demographics or medication (logistic regression with subject as random effect, all FDR <italic>P</italic>Â &gt;Â 0.05). Dysbiosis recapitulated a known decrease in alpha diversity in active disease, but we also identified numerous communities with normal complexity as dysbiotic (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>). Notably, taxonomic perturbations during dysbiosis mirrored those previously observed cross-sectionally in IBD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>, such as the depletion of obligate anaerobes including <italic>Faecalibacterium prausnitzii</italic> and <italic>Roseburia hominis</italic> in CD and the enrichment of facultative anaerobes such as <italic>E. coli</italic> (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2f</xref>, Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>). <italic>Ruminococcus torques</italic> and <italic>Ruminococcus gnavus</italic>, two prominent species in IBD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>, were also differentially abundant in dysbiotic CD and UC, respectively (FDR <italic>P</italic>Â =Â 0.041 and 0.0087. A smaller subset of species also increased significantly in transcriptional activity (mean total transcript relative abundance relative to genomic abundance; seeÂ <xref rid="Sec7" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref>) as well as showing differences in abundance, including <italic>Clostridium hathewayi</italic>, <italic>Clostridium bolteae</italic>, and <italic>R. gnavus</italic> (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2f</xref>). All had significantly increased expression during dysbiosis (all FDR <italic>P</italic>Â &lt;Â 0.07), and thus their roles in IBD may be more pronounced than suggested solely by their differences in genomic abundance.</p>
    <p id="Par10">In the metabolome, SCFAs were generally reduced in dysbiosis (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2f</xref>). The reduction in butyrate in particular is consistent with the previously observed depletion of butyrate producers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup> such as <italic>F. prausnitzii</italic> and <italic>R. hominis</italic>, which was also observed here (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2f</xref>). We also detected enrichment of the primary bile acid cholate and its glycine and taurine conjugates (glycocholate <italic>q</italic>Â =Â 5.2Â ÃÂ 10<sup>â5</sup>, taurocholate <italic>q</italic>Â =Â 1.3Â ÃÂ 10<sup>â5</sup>) in dysbiotic samples from participants with CD, when compared with non-dysbiotic samples. Similarly, glycochenodeoxycholate (<italic>q</italic>Â =Â 1.1Â ÃÂ 10<sup>â4</sup>) was also enriched. By contrast, the secondary bile acids lithocholate and deoxycholate (<italic>q</italic>Â =Â 5Â ÃÂ 10<sup>â7</sup> and <italic>q</italic>Â =Â 1.8Â ÃÂ 10<sup>â4</sup>, respectively) were reduced in dysbiosis, suggesting that secondary bile-acid producing bacteria are depleted in IBD-related dysbiosis, or that transit time through the colon is too short for these compounds to be metabolized<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. These significant metabolomic differences during microbial dysbiosis, which were concordant with changes expected during disease, provide further evidence that the dysbiosis measure is specifically relevant in IBD.</p>
    <p id="Par11">We also observed several previously undescribed biochemical differences during dysbiosis, such as large changes in acylcarnitine levels. Many acylcarnitines were significantly enriched in dysbiosis (all FDR <italic>P</italic>Â &lt;Â 0.05; see Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">4c</xref>), whereas levels of base metabolites were typically reduced (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2f</xref>, Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">4d</xref>). Of note, however, arachidonoyl carnitine (C20:4 carnitine) was reduced, and free arachidonate, a precursor of prostaglandins involved in inflammation, was increased (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>). Like bile acids, carnitines are microbially modified compounds that can have competing phenotypic effects depending on the precise modifications: <sc>l</sc>-carnitine, for example, tends to be anti-inflammatory, whereas fatty acid-conjugated carnitine does not act uniformly on gut inflammation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. These opposing changes in biochemically related metabolites further suggest that the differences seen during dysbiosis do not stem simply from the wholesale dilution of stool. Numerous other metabolites were also significantly altered in individuals with dysbiotic IBD (117 of 548 tested known metabolites with FDR <italic>P</italic>Â &lt;Â 0.05; Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">4d</xref>, Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media">16</xref>), showing large-scale dysregulation of metabolite pools in tandem with host- and microbiome-specific taxonomic and molecular features (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2f</xref>). Finally, although we found only a single, poorly characterized bacteriophage to be differentially prevalent in both IBD and dysbiosis (notably with reduced prevalence in IBD; Supplementary Tables <xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media">3</xref>, <xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media">17</xref>), we note that several participants showed a spike in viral load before a dysbiotic period (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">2</xref>).</p>

    <title>Decreased gut microbiome stability in IBD</title>
    <p id="Par12">Our dense time series for stool-derived multi-omics from many subjects enabled us to carry out in-depth longitudinal analysis, integrating multiple measurements of the microbiome. Each subjectâs microbiome tended to diverge more from the baseline over time for metagenomic, metatranscriptomic, and metabolomic profiles (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>; <italic>F</italic>-test power law fit <italic>P</italic>Â &lt;Â 10<sup>â24</sup>; seeÂ <xref rid="Sec7" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref>). These changes were most pronounced for the taxonomic profiles of individuals with CD and UC (<italic>F</italic>-test difference in power law fits <italic>P</italic>Â &lt;Â 10<sup>â9</sup>), where a the microbiome of an individual may have almost no species in common with itself at an earlier time point (dissimilarity of 1; Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>), consistent with previous observations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>.

Meanwhile, gene family transcripts (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) Orthologues (KOs)), metabolites (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>), and proteins (KOs, Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">5a</xref>) varied much more rapidly, with essentially as much change after around two weeks as over longer time periods (increasing trends less or not significant: non-IBD, UC and CD <italic>F</italic>-test <italic>P</italic>Â =Â 0.0006, 0.001, and 0.04, respectively for transcripts; 0.02, 0.06, and 0.003 for metabolites; and 0.5, 0.15, and 0.06 for proteomics).

    <p id="Par13">We further characterized large-scale temporal differences by searching for âshiftsâ in the microbiome between consecutive time points, defined as BrayâCurtis dissimilarities more similar to those between different people than within one person (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>, Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">5b</xref>, seeÂ <xref rid="Sec7" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref>). First, considering only metagenomic taxonomic profiles, we found 166 such shifts, with 39 in individuals without IBD (of 382 total possible), 44 in individuals with UC (of 381), and 83 in individuals with CD (of 650) (Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media">29</xref>). Owing to differences in total observation times, the rate of shifts was only marginally higher in individuals with CD or UC than in non-IBD participants (2.09 and 1.83 shifts per year, respectively, compared with 1.79), and these were generally confined to a subpopulation of dysbiotic individuals (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>). However, the species with the greatest changes in relative abundance differed markedly (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>). Shifts in individuals without IBD occurred primarily in individuals with high abundances of <italic>Prevotella copri</italic>, which underwent repeated expansion and relaxation cycles over the course of weeks to months (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>). This organism is of particular interest owing to its behaviour as a population-scale outgroup and its enrichment during new-onset rheumatoid arthritis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. The lack of shifts due to <italic>P. copri</italic> in participants with IBD was not due to an absence of <italic>P. copri</italic> in these individuals or an overabundance in those without IBD (6 of 27 non-IBD subjects had at least one time point with more than 10% <italic>P. copri</italic>, consistent with healthy populations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>). Instead, the relative abundances that were present remained more stable in the population with IBD (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>). Taxonomic shifts in participants with IBD mirrored earlier observations of relative reductions in obligate anaerobes and overgrowth of facultative anaerobes (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>, Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">5c</xref>), and frequently corresponded with entry into and exit from dysbiosis (28 and 23 shifts marked entries and exits in IBD, respectively, accounting for 40% of shifts in IBD). <italic>E. coli</italic> in particular contributed to a large number of shifts in IBD, although there was no clear pattern in which species it traded abundance with (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">5c, d</xref>).</p>
    <p id="Par14">When we define shifts in a similar manner for metabolomics profiles (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">5e</xref>), the rate of shifts is approximately half that seen for the metagenome (1.05 shifts per year in participants without IBD, 0.99 shifts per year in UC and 1.36 shifts per year in CD), although these data were strongly affected by the availability of fewer metabolomics samples (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">5e</xref>). We examined differences in metabolite profiles between adjacent samples from the same subjects and found significant separation by diagnosis (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3d</xref>; PERMANOVA <italic>P</italic>Â &lt;Â 10<sup>â4</sup>). These differences were largely driven by unknown compounds, emphasizing the need for further compound annotation efforts and follow up to determine the significance of these compounds in IBD. Features with the greatest differences included urobilin (which showed larger differences in individuals without IBD), urate (largely in patients with CD), and a feature with an <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> of 152.0354 and retention time (RT) of 4.16Â min (potentially the formic acid adduct of pyridinaldehyde), which accounted for differences largely specific to UC. The primary contributors to shifts were largely unidentified compounds (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">5f</xref>, Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media">30</xref>). HILp_QI22918, an unknown feature with <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> of 648.43067 and RT of 5.03 min, contributed the most (ten) shifts exclusively in individuals with IBD. Among known compounds, methylimidazole acetic acid and urate were the primary contributors to the most shifts (four shifts each; Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3e</xref>).</p>

    <title>Microbiome-associated host factors</title>
    <p id="Par15">When we incorporated host molecular measurements, primarily from intestinal biopsies taken colonoscopically at baseline, into our analysis of the microbiome in IBD, the main influences on population variability were strikingly different from those that affected the microbiota alone. In particular, tissue location was a major driver of intestinal epithelial gene expression (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>) even in the face of microbial variation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup> (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">2d</xref>). We therefore performed microbiome and phenotypic association analyses independently for each standardized biopsy location (seeÂ <xref rid="Sec7" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref>).</p>
    <p id="Par16">We identified genes that were significantly differentially expressed (DEGs) in patient biopsies taken in inflamed locations of the ileum (from individuals with CD) and rectum (both CD and UC) compared to individuals without IBD (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">6a</xref>). This analysis identified 305 and 920 genes, genes that were differentially expressed (primarily overexpressed) in the ileum and rectum, respectively, for further analysis (together representing 1,008 unique genes, negative binomial model FDR <italic>P</italic>Â &lt;Â 0.05 and fold-change &gt;1.5; Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>, Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media">31</xref>). These included genes that can affect commensal microorganisms directly, such as the antimicrobial <italic>CXCL6</italic> (a cell membrane disruptor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>) and <italic>SAA2</italic> (which inhibits growth of Gram-negative bacteria<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>), as well as indirect microbial modulators such as <italic>DUOX2</italic> (which produces reactive oxygen species<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>) and <italic>LCN2</italic> (which induces microbial iron starvation through sequestration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>; Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>).

    <title>Dynamic, multi-omic microbiome interactions</title>
    <p id="Par18">We next searched for host and microbial molecular interactions that might underlie disease activity in IBD by constructing a large-scale cross-measurement type association network that incorporated ten microbiome measurements: metagenomic species, species-level transcription ratios, functional profiles captured as Enzyme Commission (EC) gene families (MGX, MTX and MPX), metabolites, host transcription (rectum and ileum separately), serology, and faecal calprotectin. To identify co-variation between components of the microbiome above and beyond those linked strictly to inflammation and disease state, each measurement type was first residualized using the same mixed-effects model (or linear model when appropriate) used to determine differential abundance (âadjustedâ network; seeÂ <xref rid="Sec7" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref>). This residualization uses longitudinal measurements to minimize any inter-individual variation (including IBD status), as well as dysbiotic excursions as drivers of the detected associations, and thus highlights within-person associations over time. The resulting network contained 53,161 total significant edges (FDR <italic>P</italic>Â &lt;Â 0.05) and 2,916 nodes spanning features from all measurement types (Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media">35</xref>). We constructed a filtered subnetwork for visualization from the top 300 edges (by <italic>P</italic> value) per measurement type in which at least one connected node was dysbiosis-associated (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c</xref>).</p>
    <p id="Par19">Representatives from the five stool-derived measurements occurred as hubs (defined as nodes with at least 20 connections) in this network, all of which were identified as differentially abundant in dysbiosis.

On the other hand, <italic>E. coli</italic> (and to lesser extent <italic>Haemophilus parainfluenzae</italic>) accounted for a large fraction of upregulated ECs. Members of the <italic>Roseburia</italic> genus were also associated, metatranscriptionally as well as metagenomically, with bile acids and a number of acylcarnitines, suggesting that <italic>Roseburia</italic> (together with <italic>Subdoligranulum</italic>) are involved in the carnitine and bile acid dysregulation observed in IBD.</p>
    <p id="Par20">Acylcarnitines and bile acids as overall chemical classes featured prominently in the network, related in part to their changes during dysbiosis.

Particularly notable biochemical hubs in the network included C8 carnitine, another acylcarnitine that was significantly increased in dysbiotic CD, cholate, chenodeoxycholate, and taurochenodeoxycholate, which together accounted for 107 edges (6%; Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c</xref>). Other prominent metabolite associations included several long-chain lipid hubs and the SCFA propionate; antibodies against OmpC were strongly associated with these, as well as with the metagenomic abundances of the numerous ECs involved in the systemâs biosynthesis or as interactors. Calprotectin, as the sole feature in its own measurement type, was weakly associated with a number of metabolites that were not differentially abundant in dysbiosis, as well as with the metagenomic abundance of several dysbiosis-associated ECs. Three host genes appeared in this high-significance subnetwork: ileal expression of <italic>GIP</italic>, <italic>NXPE4</italic>, and <italic>ANXA10</italic>. Expression of RNA polymerase was also a prominent node in the network, though not a hub, that was upregulated in dysbiosis (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig12" ref-type="fig">8</xref>). The regulation of this essential enzyme class is growth-rate-dependent<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>, suggesting that microbial communities as a whole are more often in higher growth conditions in dysbiotic IBD.</p>
    <p id="Par21">Finally, we also identified associations among features in the microbiome that took dysbiosis into account, resulting in a second network using the same methodology but without adjusting for dysbiosis (âunadjustedâ; <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">Supplementary Discussion</xref>, Extended Data Figs. <xref rid="Fig11" ref-type="fig">7b</xref>, <xref rid="Fig13" ref-type="fig">9</xref>, Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media">36</xref>). Together, these networks contextualize the multiple types of microbiome disruption that are observed in IBD, with associations among many molecular feature types that represent potential targets for follow-up studies on the mechanisms that underlie IBD and gastrointestinal inflammation.</p>

    <title>Conclusions</title>
    <p id="Par22">As part of the HMP2, we have developed the IBDMDB, one of the first integrated studies of multiple molecular features of the gut microbiome that have been implicated in IBD dynamics. While overall population structure was comparable among measurements of the microbiomeâmetagenomic, metatranscriptomic, metabolomic, and othersâeach measurement identified complementary molecular components of longitudinal dysbioses in CD and UC. Some, such as taxonomic shifts in favour of aerotolerant, pro-inflammatory clades, have been captured by previous studies; others, such as greater gene expression by clostridia during disease, were discovered by the use of new measurements (metatranscriptomes). The temporal stability of multiple microbiome measurements likewise differed across IBD phenotypes and disease activity, with distinct effects on molecular components of the microbiome (including unexpected stability of the relative abundance of <italic>P. copri</italic> in individuals with IBD). Our data provide a catalogue of new relationships between multi-omic features identified as potentially central during IBD, in addition to data, protocols, and relevant bioinformatic approaches to enable future research.</p>
    <p id="Par23">By leveraging a multi-omic view on the microbiome, our results single out a number of host and microbial features for follow-up characterization. An unclassified <italic>Subdoligranulum</italic> species, recently shown to form a complex of new species-level clades<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>, was both markedly reduced in IBD and central to the functional network, associating with a wide range of IBD-linked metabolites both identifiable (for example, bile acids and polyunsaturated fatty acids) and unidentifiable. The clade is likely to contain at least seven species that are closely related to the <italic>Subdoligranulum</italic>, <italic>Gemmiger</italic>, and <italic>Faecalibacterium</italic> genera, typically butyrate producers that are considered to be beneficial, particularly in IBD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. Therefore, the isolation and characterization of additional speciesâespecially in tandem with these associated metabolitesâis likely to reveal these cladesâ physiological and immunological interactions and the consequences of their depletion in IBD. More generally, strain-level profiling of implicated microorganismsÂ remains to be carried out, particularly in direct association with host epithelium and corresponding molecular changes. This profiling is feasible with existing data from this study, and will serve to pinpoint the specific organisms responsible for IBD-associated accumulation of primary unconjugated bile acids and depletion of secondary bile acids<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. Only very few, low-abundance species are currently known to be capable of secondary bile acid metabolism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>, and expanding the range of strains known to carry appropriate metabolic cassettes will indicate potential new targets for therapeutic restoration. Beyond short-chain fatty acids and bile acids, the large-scale acylcarnitine dysbiosis observed here may also provide a promising new target for IBD, particularly after determining whether this shift in metabolite pools is host- or microbiome-driven.</p>
    <p id="Par24">We stress that it has not yet been determined whether these multi-omic features of the microbiome can predict disease events before their occurrence and that the disease-relevant time scales of distinct molecular events have not been identified (for example, static host genetics, relatively slow epigenetics or microbial growth, rapid host and microbial transcriptional changes). It may also be fruitful to seek out the earliest departures from a subject-specific baseline state that, while themselves still âeubioticâ, may predict the subsequent onset of dysbiosis or disease symptoms. Some such characterization may be possible in data from this study, although other causal analysis may be better carried out at finer-grained time scales or using interventional study designs. It will be most important to take these molecular results back to the clinic, in the form of better predictive biomarkers of IBD progression and outcome, and as a set of new hostâmicrobe interaction targets for which treatments to ameliorate the disease may be developed.</p>

        <title>Recruitment</title>
        <p id="Par25">Five medical centres participated in the IBDMDB: Cincinnati Childrenâs Hospital, Emory University Hospital, Massachusetts General Hospital, Massachusetts General Hospital for Children, and Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. Patients were approached for potential recruitment upon presentation for routine age-related colorectal cancer screening, work up of other gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, or suspected IBD, either with positive imaging (for example, colonic wall thickening or ileal inflammation) or symptoms of chronic diarrhoea or rectal bleeding. Participants could not have had a prior screening or diagnostic colonoscopy. Potential participants were excluded if they were unable to or did not consent to provide tissue, blood, or stool, were pregnant, had a known bleeding disorder or an acute gastrointestinal infection, were actively being treated for a malignancy with chemotherapy, were diagnosed with indeterminate colitis, or had undergone a prior, major gastrointestinal surgery such as an ileal/colonic diversion or j-pouch. Upon enrolment, an initial colonoscopy was performed to determine study strata. Subjects not diagnosed with IBD based on endoscopic and histopathologic findings were classified as ânon-IBDâ controls, including the aforementioned healthy individuals presenting for routine screening, and those with more benign or non-specific symptoms. This creates a control group that, while not completely âhealthyâ, differs from the IBD cohorts specifically by clinical IBD status. Differences observed between these groups are therefore more likely to constitute differences specific to IBD, and not differences attributable to general GI distress. In total, 132 subjects took part in the study (Extended Data Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).</p>

        <title>Regulatory compliance</title>
        <p id="Par26">The study was reviewed by the Institutional Review Boards at each sampling site: overall Partners Data Coordination (IRB #2013P002215); MGH Adult cohort (IRB #2004P001067); MGH Paediatrics (IRB #2014P001115); Emory (IRB #IRB00071468); Cincinnati Childrenâs Hospital Medical Center (2013-7586); and Cedars-Sinai Medical Center (3358/CR00011696). All study participants gave written informed consent before providing samples. Each IRB has a federal wide assurance and follows the regulations established at 45 CFR Part 46. The study was conducted in accordance with the ethical principles expressed in the Declaration of Helsinki and the requirements of applicable federal regulations.</p>

        <title>Specimen collection and storage</title>
        <p id="Par27">Specimens for research (biopsies, blood draws, and stool samples) were collected during the screening colonoscopy, at up to five quarterly follow-up visits at the clinic (termed âbaselineâ, visit 2, and so on, occurring at months 0, 3, 6, 9, and 12), and every two weeks by mail.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="Sec12">
        <title>Biopsies</title>
        <p id="Par28">Biopsies were primarily gathered during the initial screening colonoscopy, where approximately four to fourteen biopsies were collected for each subject. For each location sampled (at least ileum and 10Â cm from rectum, plus discretionary sites of inflammation), one biopsy was collected for standard histopathology at the sampling institution, two biopsies were collected and stored in RNAlater for molecular data generation (host and microbial, stored at â20âÂ°C), and one biopsy was collected and placed in a sterile tube with 5% glycerol (stored at â80âÂ°C). If possible, additional biopsies from inflamed tissue and nearby non-inflamed tissue were taken from participants with CD or UC. For adults, a second set of biopsies was also collected from each location (rectum and ileum) for epithelial cell culture (for detailed protocols see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ibdmdb.org/protocols">http://ibdmdb.org/protocols</ext-link>). All biopsies were stored for up to two months at the collection site, and shipped overnight on dry ice to Washington University for epithelial cell culture or to the Broad Institute for molecular profiling.</p>

      <sec id="Sec13">
        <title>Blood samples</title>
        <p id="Par29">Blood samples (whole blood and serum) were taken at the quarterly clinical visits. For whole blood, 1 ml of blood was collected and stored at â80âÂ°C. For serum, blood was drawn into a 5-ml SST tube, and left at room temperature for 40 min. This was centrifuged for 15 min at 3,000 r.p.m. and 0.5-ml portions were immediately aliquoted into 2-ml microtubes. Tubes were stored at â80âÂ°C.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="Sec14">
        <title>Stool samples</title>
        <p id="Par30">Stool specimens were collected both at the clinical visits and every two weeks by mail using a home collection kit developed for the project (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ibdmdb.org/protocols">http://ibdmdb.org/protocols</ext-link>) and previously validated<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>. Participants first deposited stool into a collection bowl suspended over a commode. They then collected two aliquots using a scoop to transfer stool into two Sarstedt 80.623 tubes: one with approximately 5 ml molecular biology grade 100% ethanol, and one with no preservative. Stool samples were then sent from each participant by FedEx to the Broad Institute where they were processed immediately before storage at â80âÂ°C. The ethanol tube was centrifuged to pellet stool, which was subaliquotted, and the supernatant was transferred to a new tube for metabolomic analysis. Stool from ethanol was aliquoted into 2-ml cryovials in ~100â200-mg aliquots, prioritizing specimens for metaâomic sequencing, metabolomics, and viromics in that order. Any remaining stool was stored in additional aliquot tubes. One hundred milligrams of the non-ethanol stool was stored for assaying faecal calprotectin and the remainder was saved in a second tube. All samples were stored at â80âÂ°C after receipt before processing. This home-collection method was shown previously to produce reproducible results compared to flash-frozen samples<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>, consistent with previous observations across data types<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>. Note that an accurate estimate of the stool water content could not be obtained, as samples were collected by subjects and preserved in ethanol at room temperature until aliquots were generated for the different data generation platforms.</p>

At baseline (that is, during or before the screening colonoscopy), subjects completed a Reported Symptoms Questionnaire, the Short Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>, a Food Frequency Questionnaire, and an Environmental Questionnaire, and the Simple Endoscopic Score<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup> for CD subjects or Baronâs Score<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup> for UC subjects was assessed.</p>
        <p id="Par32">During both follow-up visits and paired with mailed stool samples, subjects completed an Activity Index and Dietary Recall Questionnaire to assess their disease activity index (HBI for CD or SCCAI for UC) and provide a retrospective recall of their recent diet.

        <title>Sample selection</title>
        <p id="Par33">Sample selection proceeded in two phases, with an initial round of data generation producing a pilot metagenomics and metatranscriptomics data set, which was analysed separately<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup>. This pilot sample selection included at least one sample per participant that was enrolled in the study at that time, two long time courses per disease group (CD, UC, non-IBD), and multiple shorter time courses, resulting in 300 samples. For a subset of 78 samples, metatranscriptomic data were generated. Samples were chosen on the basis of sample mass, preferentially selecting samples that could be re-sequenced if needed during the later data generation.</p>
        <p id="Par34">For the second, larger phase of data generation, stool samples were selected for different assays with the goal of generating data covering as many aspects of the cohort as possible, including per-subject time courses, cross-subject global time points, and samples from all patients, phenotypes, age ranges, clinical centres, and so forth (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). The subset of measurements performed for each sample was determined in large part by aliquot requirements (in particular, mass requirements for the assay relative to how much the patient provided) and cost.</p>
        <p id="Par35">For proteomics and metabolomics, six global time points were equally distributed over the year-long time series for as many subjects as possible. Restrictions such as available sample mass and missing samples were incorporated by selecting the nearest suitable sample in time, resulting in slight irregularities in the sampling pattern. In total, 546 metabolite profiles and 450 proteomics profiles were generated. From among these samples, 768 were selected for metagenomics, metatranscriptomics, and viromics, corresponding to 8 plates of 96 samples each. Samples already selected for proteomics or metabolomics were prioritised to facilitate integrated data analysis (316 samples had sufficient mass), resulting in six global time points for all subjects. In cases where the respective sample was not available for a subject, the nearest suitable sample in time was selected. Subjects with greater fluctuations in their HBI or SCCAI scores were then prioritized for denser sampling, resulting in 12 long time courses for 5 participants with CD, 4 with UC, and 3 without IBD. The selection also included 23 technical replicates for metagenomics, metatranscriptomics and viromics.</p>
        <p id="Par36">Finally, 576 additional samples were selected specifically for metagenomic sequencing (6 plates) resulting in a total of 1,344 metagenomic samples. Samples at previously selected global time points and long time courses that had been restricted by available mass for other measurement types were prioritized. An additional four global time points were added by this process, as well as 15 long time courses (representing 10 participants with CD, 10 with UC, and 7 without IBD), and 22 samples that had been previously sequenced for the pilot data and represented additional technical replicates. Lastly, 522 samples were selected for faecal calprotectin measurements, prioritizing samples that were selected for any other multi-omics data generation and representing a broad overview of the cohort. Of a total of 2,653 collected stool samples, 1,785 generated at least one measurement type (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>).</p>
        <p id="Par37">Sample selection for RNA-seq and 16S sequencing from biopsies, and host genotyping from blood draws, aimed to cover the 95 subjects who contributed at least 14 stool samples, as permitted by the availability of biopsies and blood draws for each assay. Sample selection from biopsies additionally aimed to cover biopsies from inflamed and non-inflamed sites. In total, 254 biopsies were selected for RNA-seq, covering 43 participants with CD, 25 with UC, and 22 without IBD, and distributed across biopsy sites and inflammation statuses (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">6A</xref>); and 161 biopsies were selected for 16S sequencing, covering 36 participants with CD, 21 with UC, and 22 without IBD.

This kit combines chemical and mechanical lysis with magnetic bead-based purification. Prior to extraction on the MSM-I, TE buffer, lysozyme, proteinase K, and RLT buffer with beta-mercaptoethanol were added to each stool sample. The stool lysate solution was vortexed to mix.</p>
        <p id="Par40">Samples were then placed on the MSM I unit to automate the following steps: M-PVA magnetic beads were added to the stool lysate solution and vortexed to mix. The bead-bound total nucleic acid was then removed from solution using a 96-rod magnetic head and washed in three ethanol-based wash buffers. The beads were then washed in a final water wash buffer. Finally, the beads were dipped in elution buffer to resuspend the DNA sample in solution. The beads were then removed from solution, leaving purified total nucleic acid eluate. The eluate was then split into two equal volumes: one for DNA and the other for RNA. SUPERase-IN solution was added to the DNA samples, and the reaction was cleaned up using AMPure XP SPRI beads. DNase was added to the RNA samples, and the reaction was cleaned up using AMPure XP SPRI beads.</p>

Illumina sequencing libraries were prepared from 100â250Â pg DNA using the Nextera XT DNA Library Preparation kit (Illumina) according to the manufacturerâs recommended protocol, with reaction volumes scaled accordingly. Prior to sequencing, libraries were pooled by collecting equal volumes (200 nl) of each library from batches of 96 samples. Insert sizes and concentrations for each pooled library were determined using an Agilent Bioanalyzer DNA 1000 kit (Agilent Technologies). Libraries were sequenced on HiSeq2000 or 2500 2x101 to yield ~10 million paired end reads. Post-sequencing de-multiplexing and generation of BAM and FASTQ files were generated using the Picard suite (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://broadinstitute.github.io/picard">https://broadinstitute.github.io/picard</ext-link>).</p>

Barcoded RNAs were pooled and depleted of rRNA using the RiboZero rRNA depletion kit (Epicentre). Pools of barcoded RNAs were converted to Illumina cDNA libraries in two main steps: (i) reverse transcription of the RNA using a primer designed to the constant region of the barcoded adaptor with addition of an adaptor to the 3â² end of the cDNA by template switching using SMARTScribe (Clontech) as described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref></sup>; (ii) PCR amplification using primers whose 5â² ends target the constant regions of the 3â² or 5â² adaptors and whose 3â² ends contain the full Illumina P5 or P7 sequences. cDNA libraries were sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq2500 platform to generate ~13 million paired end reads.</p>

Reads were demultiplexed into a sample bin using the barcode prefixing read-1 and read-2, allowing zero mismatches. Demultiplexed reads were further processed by trimming off barcodes, semi-random primer sequences, and Illumina adapters. This process used a custom demultiplexer and the BBDuk algorithm included in BBMap (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/bbmap">http://sourceforge.net/projects/bbmap</ext-link>).

Functional profiles (MGX, MTX, and MPX) were first summarized to the KO level using HUMAnN2. Profiles were first normalized before calculation of dissimilarities.

Subject-subject dissimilarity matrices were then generated and compared using the mantel.rtest function in the R package ape4. To quantify longitudinal covariation, we first generated the complete sampleâsample dissimilarity matrix, but only calculate the Mantel test statistic (the Pearson correlation between distances) from distances between samples from the same subject.

To account for the repeated measures present for all measurement types tested, relevant permutations were performed blocked within subject for variables that change over time (medication, biopsy location, inflammation status, and dysbiosis). Meanwhile, variables that were constant (or change slowly enough to be considered constant) across samples from the same subject (age, sex, body mass index (BMI), race, recruitment site, diagnosis, and disease location) were first permuted across subjects and samples were relabelled with the variable from their permuted subject. To determine the significance of models including inter-individual variance (the Subject and All rows), permutations were performed freely. For subjects with incomplete records for BMI, we imputed the mean BMI of the remaining population. The All row is the total variance explained when including all other variables in the model.</p>

        <title>Dysbiosis score</title>
        <p id="Par97">To identify samples with highly divergent (dysbiotic) metagenomic microbial compositions, as a complement to baseline disease diagnosis, we defined a dysbiosis score based on BrayâCurtis dissimilarities to non-IBD metagenomes. First, a âreference setâ of samples was constructed from non-IBD subjects by taking all samples after the 20th week after the subjectâs first stool sample. This was chosen because a subset of the non-IBD subjects at the start of their respective time series may not yet have overcome any gastrointestinal symptoms that triggered the initial visit to a doctor, though these were ultimately not caused by IBD. The dysbiosis score of a given sample was then defined as the median BrayâCurtis dissimilarity to this reference sample set, excluding samples that came from the same subject (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>).</p>
        <p id="Par98">To identify samples that were highly divergent from the reference set, we thresholded the dysbiosis score at the 90th percentile of this score for non-IBD samples. This therefore identifies samples with a feature configuration that has aÂ less than 10% probability of occurring in a participant without IBD. By this measure, 272 metagenomes were classified as dysbiotic. Samples from participants with CD or UC were overrepresented in the dysbiotic set, with 24.3% and 11.6% of their samples classified as dysbiotic, respectively. As expected, these samples also tended to locate in the extremes of the taxonomic ordination based on metagenomes (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">3b, c</xref>). Dysbiosis was unevenly distributed among subjects (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">3d</xref>), with some subjects remaining dysbiotic for all or most of their time series, while others remained non-dysbiotic for their entire time series.</p>
        <p id="Par99">To lend additional support to the definition of dysbiosis (that is, as outliers by one type of microbiome profile), we tested the concordance between dysbiosis classifications made using the same statistical definition, but applied to metabolomic rather than taxonomic profiles. That is, we defined a metabolomic dysbiosis score as the median BrayâCurtis dissimilarity of one metabolomic profile to the non-IBD metabolomic profiles (after the 20th week), and defined the dysbiosis threshold as the 90th percentile of this distribution among non-IBD metabolomic profiles. We then compared these dysbiosis classifications with those from the nearest metagenomic sample (up to two weeks, see âCross-measurement type temporal matchingâ) and found that dysbiotic samples identified by metagenomics were 4.6 times more likely to be dysbiotic by metabolomics (Fisherâs exact <italic>P</italic>Â =Â 5.9 Ã 10<sup>â9</sup>), showing that dysbiosis measurements are highly consistent across measurement types.</p>
        <p id="Par100">To test the sensitivity of the dysbiosis classification to the choice of reference data set, we also performed the dysbiosis classification using the HMP1-II stool samples<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup> as the reference sample set instead of the non-IBD samples. The resulting dysbiosis scores (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">3e</xref>) were highly concordant (Spearman <italic>Ï</italic>Â =Â 0.86; <italic>P</italic>Â &lt;Â 2.2 Ã 10<sup>â16</sup>), as were the dysbiosis classifications (odds ratio of 56; Fisherâs exact <italic>P</italic>Â &lt;Â 2.2 Ã 10<sup>â16</sup>). This shows that, despite the inclusion of subjects with other conditions in the non-IBD group here, as well as large differences in measurement technologies between the data sets, the dysbiosis classification is highly robust. Furthermore, 43 out of 426 (10.1%) of non-IBD samples were classified as dysbiotic using the HMP1-II samples as reference, falling remarkably close to the 10% expected by the definition and showing that the enrichment of IBD samples in the dysbiotic set is not simply a consequence of the definition.</p>

        <title>Dysbiosis durations and intervals</title>
        <p id="Par101">Samples of the dysbiosis durations and intervals were obtained by taking the difference in time between stool metagenomes in which the dysbiosis state changes, that is, the time from the first dysbiotic sample in an excursion into dysbiosis until the next non-dysbiotic sample was taken as one sample of the dysbiosis duration distribution. If the subjectâs time series ended before this transition occurred, this resulted in a âcensoredâ duration or interval (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2e</xref>). Estimates of the durations of and time between dysbioses were then obtained from a censored maximum likelihood estimator for the mean of an exponential distribution.

As an individualâs microbial profile naturally changes over time<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92">92</xref></sup>, the BrayâCurtis threshold at which this occurs will increase with the time difference between samples. To determine these thresholds, kernel density estimates were generated for the distribution of BrayâCurtis dissimilarities between profiles from different individuals without IBD and between samples from the individuals without IBD at a range of time differences, using the density function in R. The point at which the inter-individual density estimate exceeded the intra-individual density estimate was then taken as the threshold to define a âshiftâ, with the additional constraint that this must be a monotonically increasing function of the time difference between samples (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>). Metabolomic shifts were defined similarly, although owing to the more sparse temporal sampling of the metabolomics data (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) and lack of a strong upward trend in BrayâCurtis dissimilarities with time difference (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>), only a single threshold was used based on the distribution of BrayâCurtis dissimilarities from comparisons within-subject over time in participants without IBD.

        <title>Longitudinal multi-omic study design</title>
        <p id="Par105">Owing to the large variation in microbial profiles between people (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">2</xref>), with relatively smaller variation within subjects over time (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>), longitudinal study designs have the potential to be higher-powered than purely cross-sectional studies, particularly in their ability to self-control individuals and to capture transitions between phenotypes (or after interventions) of interest<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR94">94</xref></sup>. Here, although some subjects remained in a dysbiotic state far longer than others (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">3d</xref>), the heterogeneity observed was enough to discover differences in measurement types other than where dysbiosis was defined. For example, subjects who had unusual, disease-associated microbiome taxonomic profiles also proved to have generally shifted serological and/or metabolomic profiles at corresponding time points. Noting these dysbiotic time points offered a complementary set of differences to what was visible cross-sectionally (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>).</p>
        <p id="Par106">Among microbially related measurements, metabolomics provided the most robust separation between disease and dysbiosis groups, possibly because it integrated a combination of host, microbial, and dietary differences (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1e, f</xref>). Thus, despite the challenges presented by untargeted metabolomics, such as unknown compound identification, the presence of redundant and background signals, and the complexity of the stool matrix, this measurement type often provides a robust characterization of subjects, their disease state, and individual small molecules that interface between host and microbiome. Conversely, the current state of viromics assays and reference databases makes this more challenging to work with, although the importance of the virome in microbial community dynamics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95">95</xref></sup> will make this an extremely interesting feature space going forward.</p>
        <p id="Par107">All longitudinal microbial measurement types showed significant variation within two weeks (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>, Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">5a</xref>). This suggests that even higher sampling rates may be needed to catch relevant microbial variation, particularly before the onset of more severe clinical symptoms. Our sampling protocol also did not account for other potential sources of within-subject variation, such as transit time or the precise portion of each whole stool that was sampled. In this data set, we thus cannot distinguish between temporal and technical variation within subjects. To mitigate the higher costs associated with processing additional samples, a future study aiming to achieve higher temporal resolution might proceed in two phases, thanks to the coupling between data types (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1e</xref>): first, collect samples at a higher frequency, and process these with metagenomic or 16S sequencing. Then proceed with more expensive and detailed data generation only for samples taken specifically around periods of interest, such as periods of dysbiosis identified during the first stage. To this end, the sampling rate can also be tuned to target a particular probability of missing a dysbiosis period.</p>

        <title>Lenient cross-measurement type temporal matching</title>
        <p id="Par108">For comparison between multiple measurement types, we first constructed sets of samples corresponding to the same biosample across data sets. However, exact matches were not always possible, for example, owing to specimen limitations during sample selection (see âSample selectionâ) or to samples that failed quality control. In these cases, matching sample sets across data sets were created using nearby samples. During this process, a degree of leniency was allowed in the matching, allowing samples up to a given time difference (two or four weeks) apart to be âmatchedâ. To perform this matching (sample numbers in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref> and Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>), we used the following algorithm.</p>
        <p id="Par109">For a given set of measurement types to be matched for a particular subject, find the first time window in which all measurement types have at least one produced sample. Next, within this window, find the time point with the most measurement types produced; in the event of a tie, select earlier time points. Finally, for each data set, select the nearest sample to this target time point that is within the time window, breaking ties towards earlier time points. This set of selected samples comprises one âmatchedâ sample. For each data set, all samples up to and including the later of the selected sample or the target time point are then disregarded from future consideration (and thus any sample will be included in at most only one matched time point). This process is repeated for each subject until no such window exists.</p>

        <title>Cross-measurement type interaction testing</title>
        <p id="Par110">Significant associations between features from multiple measurement types were identified using two different models: an âunadjustedâ model of associations that are mainly due to dysbiosis, and an âadjustedâ model that emphasizes associations in addition to those that are dysbiosis-linked. Associations in both cases incorporated features from ten data sets: metagenomic species, species-level transcription ratios, functional profiles at the EC level (MGX, MTX and MPX), metabolites, host transcription (rectal and ileal separately), serology and faecal calprotectin.</p>
        <p id="Par111">To detect adjusted associations, we first obtained residuals of features from the above data types fit to a mixed-effects model including subjects as random effects as above for the differential abundance testing (or a simple linear model without the random effects when only baseline samples were used) and adjusting for age, sex, diagnosis, dysbiosis status, antibiotic and immunosuppressant use, and bowel surgery status. Residuals from subjects with fewer than four samples in their time series for the measurement type were ignored, and for measurements with no longitudinal samples (for example, serology and host transcriptomics measurements), the residualization was repeated with the first available samples using a simple linear model without random effects. This allowed the identification of significant (FDR <italic>P</italic>Â &lt;Â 0.05 for most measurement types, <italic>P</italic>Â &lt;Â 0.25 for serology) Spearman associations using HAllA 0.8.17 (hierarchical all-against-all association testing, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://huttenhower.sph.harvard.edu/halla">http://huttenhower.sph.harvard.edu/halla</ext-link>, Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media">35</xref>). As subject-specific random effects and covariate effects were removed from these residuals, the resulting correlations are likely to be independent of all sources of inter-individual variation as well as confounding effects due to the covariates.

The network was constructed from ten data sets: metagenomic species, species-level transcription ratios, functional profiles at the EC levels (MGX, MTX and MPX), metabolites, host transcription (rectal and ileal separately), serology and faecal calprotectin. As in Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c</xref>, measurement types were approximately matched in time with a maximum separation between paired samples of four weeks. The top 300 significant correlations (FDR <italic>P</italic>Â &lt;Â 0.05) among correlations between features that were differentially abundant in dysbiosis were used to construct the network visualized here (for serology, a threshold of FDR <italic>P</italic>Â &lt;Â 0.25 was used). Nodes are coloured by the disease group in which they are âhighâ, and edges are coloured by the sign and strength of the correlation. For this adjusted network, Spearman correlations were calculated using HAllA from the residuals of a mixed-effects model with subjects as random effects (or a simple linear model without the random effects when only baseline samples were used) after adjusting for age, sex, diagnosis, dysbiosis status, recruitment site, and antibiotics (seeÂ <xref rid="Sec7" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref>). Appropriate normalization and/or transformation for each measurement type was performed independently before the model fitting (seeÂ <xref rid="Sec7" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref>). Singleton node pairs were pruned from the network. Source associations are in Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media">35</xref>, sample counts in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b, c</xref>.</p>
