      <title>Abstract</title>
      <p>RNA interference (RNAi) is mediated by small, 20-24-nt-long, non-coding regulatory (s)RNAs such as micro (mi) and small interfering (si) RNAs via the action of ARGONAUTE (AGO) proteins. High-throughput sequencing of size-separated sRNA pools of plant crude extracts revealed that the majority of the canonical miRNAs were associated with high molecular weight RNA-induced silencing complexes co-migrating with AGO1 (HMW RISC). In contrast, the majority of 24-nt-long siRNAs were found in association with low molecular weight complexes co-migrating with AGO4 (LMW RISC). Intriguingly, we identified a large set of cytoplasmic sRNAs, including mature miRNA sequences, in the low molecular size range corresponding to protein-unbound sRNAs. By comparing the RISC-loaded and protein-unbound pools of miRNAs, we identified miRNAs with highly different loading efficiencies. Expression of selected miRNAs in transient and transgenic systems validated their altered loading abilities implying that this process is controlled by information associated with the diverse miRNA precursors. We also showed that the availability of AGO proteins is a limiting factor determining the loading efficiency of miRNAs. Our data reveal the existence of a regulatory checkpoint determining the RISC-loading efficiencies of various miRNAs by sorting only a subset of the produced miRNAs into the biologically active RISCs.</p>

    <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
    <p>RNA interference (RNAi) is a fundamental and widespread regulatory mechanism, which has been in the focus of extensive basic and applied researches. RNAi mediates sequence-specific regulation of target RNAs by the action of small, 20–24 nucleotide (nt) long, non-coding regulatory (s)RNAs such as micro (mi) and small interfering (si) RNAs (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). In plants, various RNAi pathways play indispensable roles in diverse developmental processes and in responses to biotic and abiotic stress factors (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). MiRNAs are typically encoded by independent transcription units transcribed by RNA polymerase II producing primary miRNA transcripts (pri-miRNAs) (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). In the nucleus, pri-miRNAs are targets of extensive post-transcriptional processing to produce mature miRNAs. The DICER-LIKE1 (DCL1), an RNase III enzyme, cleaves the hairpin out of the pri-miRNA producing an 80–300-nt-long miRNA precursors (pre-miRNAs). The same DCL1 enzyme cleaves the precursor at sites determined by structural features to generate small double-stranded miRNA intermediates, the miRNA:miRNA* duplexes (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). These duplexes are 2′-<italic>O</italic>-methylated at their 3′ termini by the HUA ENHANCER 1 (HEN1) methyltransferase and then transported to the cytoplasm probably in complex with ARGONAUTE1 (AGO1), the central executor component of miRNA mediated RNAi (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). During this process, one of the strands of miRNA duplexes (miRNA*) is displaced while the mature strand (miRNA) remains bound to AGO1. In the cytoplasm, the miRNA loaded AGO1 containing RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) mediates the sequence-specific repression of target RNAs via mRNA-cleavage or translational repression. Polysome fractionation indicated that AGO1 can be associated with polysomes (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>) and it was also revealed that AGO1 linked miRNAs are enriched in membrane-bound polysomes (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Since miRNAs are key regulators of essential developmental processes and stress responses, their action must be tightly controlled. There are several transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms which control the production level and function of miRNAs. The 2′-<italic>O</italic>-methylation of miRNA intermediate duplexes at their 3′ ends protects them from oligo-uridylation and degradation (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>) while exoribonucleases of the SDN (SMALL RNA DEGRADING) family degrade mature miRNAs influencing their accumulation level (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). AGO1 can also stabilize the levels of some miRNAs in the cytoplasm as a result of stress response (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). In addition to AGO1, other nine AGO proteins are encoded in the <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> genome and they have specialized functions for various RNAi pathways but often show functional redundancies (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Regulation of miRNA sorting into various AGO proteins is strongly influenced by the 5′ nucleotide of small RNAs, i.e. AGO1 shows a preference for 5′ U (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>) and also by structural features on the miRNA duplexes (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). In contrast to miRNAs, different siRNA classes are generated from perfect double-stranded (ds)RNA intermediates produced by RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RDRPs) (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). The 21-nt-long phased (pha)siRNAs are originated from Pol II-dependent mRNAs cleaved by a 22-nt long class of miRNAs (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Trans-acting (tasi) RNAs are a subset of phasiRNAs and act at the post-transcriptional level by negatively regulating disease resistance and transcription factor genes (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). DCL3 produces the 24-nt-long heterochromatic siRNAs (hetsiRNA) by processing the Pol IV/RDR2-dependent long dsRNA products originating from intergenic or repetitive regions of the genome. HetsiRNAs are predominantly loaded into the RNA-induced transcriptional silencing (RITS) complex playing fundamental roles in maintaining genome integrity by regulating the <italic>de novo</italic> DNA methylation of transposable and repetitive elements. It was shown that hetsiRNA species are predominantly loaded into the AGO4 in the cytoplasm and subsequently imported into the nucleus (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Moreover, it was also demonstrated that some hetsiRNAs are also present as double-stranded siRNAs in low molecular weight fractions which correspond to the AGO-unbound sRNAs. Until now, studies mainly focused on the molecular details of sRNA biogenesis and sorting into the specific AGO proteins, but relatively limited attention has been devoted to the identification of functional pools of the full sRNA population of the cells. Analysis of total RNA extracts cannot distinguish between RISC incorporated and unincorporated sRNAs while immuno-precipitation experiments detect only sRNAs loaded into a given AGO protein. By applying a gel-filtration mediated size separation method, the association of sRNAs with various protein complexes, such as AGO containing RISCs, can be determined (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18–21</xref>).</p>
    <p>In this work, using gel-filtration assays we identified three pools of sRNAs at a genome-wide level based on the molecular size-dependent mobility of nucleoprotein complexes. High-throughput sequencing (HTS) analyses of these pools revealed that their molecular composition is markedly different confirming that they are distinct biological entities. We show that canonical miRNAs predominantly associate with a high molecular weight (HMW) RISC which co-migrates with AGO1. By providing HTS data we show that the 24-nt siRNAs are mainly associated with a low molecular weight (LMW) RISC co-migrating with AGO4. More intriguingly, we identified a large pool of protein-unbound sRNAs containing 2′-<italic>O</italic>-methylated mature and star sequences of annotated miRNAs potentially in a double-stranded form and also unloaded 23- and 24-nt siRNAs. We show that miRNAs differ in their RISC-loading efficiencies indicated by their different distribution between the AGO-bound and -unbound pools. Moreover, we demonstrate that the RISC-loading efficiency of some miRNAs can be different between tissues. This can be partly attributed to the different level of AGO proteins because the loading level of miRNAs can be enhanced by overexpressing AGO proteins. We also show in transient and stable transgenic expression systems that the RISC-loading efficiencies of distinct miRNAs are predominantly controlled by their diverse precursor RNAs.</p>

    <sec id="SEC2-1">
      <title>Plant materials and growth conditions</title>
      <p><italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> plants were grown in Jiffy peat blocks and kept under 8 h light/16 h darkness cycle at 21°C for 4 weeks. Next, these plants were planted in pots and were moved to a light room under 16 h light 8 h darkness at 21°C. Young leaves were harvested from six-weeks-old plants being in the vegetative phase. Young flowers and flower buds were collected from inflorescences which already have 2–6 immature siliques. <italic>Nicotiana benthamiana</italic> plants were grown under the lightroom conditions described above. The <italic>hen1-1</italic> mutant was ordered from the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center. Plasmid construct of miR168, miR171, miR159 and miR390 hairpin structures (described below) were introduced into Col-0 plants with the floral dip method (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>), transformants were selected according to their kanamycin resistance and homozygous lines were established through subsequent self-mating and monitoring of transgene expression.</p>

    <sec id="SEC2-2">
      <title>Gel filtration assay</title>
      <p>Size separation gel-filtration experiments were carried out using Superdex 200 10/300 column (Akta-FPLC, GE Healthcare) or the same size Sephacryl S-300 High Resolution (Pharmacia LKB) columns. The gel-filtration experiments were carried out as it was described previously (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). Briefly, the plant tissues were homogenized in liquid nitrogen using 200 μl elution buffer (50 mM Tris–HCl pH 7.5, 10 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> and 4 mM DTT) per 0.1 g plant material. The homogenized crude extracts were kept continuously in ice and centrifuged 3 times for 10 min (12 000 g) at 4°C to eliminate tissue debris. 200 μl of the cleared crude extract was immediately applied on the cold buffer equilibrated gel-filtration column and fractions of 325 μl were collected immediately after sample injection. The size-separation chromatography was always carried out in a cold room at 4°C. Altogether, we collected 68 fractions but discarded the first 20 and from the remaining 48 fractions we either purified total RNA to detect sRNAs or precipitated the proteins to detect endogenous or overexpressed AGO proteins. Markers of known sizes (Carbonic Anhydrase, 29 kDa; Albumin, 66 kDa; β-amylase, 200 kDa; apoferritin, 443 kDa; blue dextran, 2000 kDa) were used to calibrate the columns. Crude extracts were prepared from 0.3 g plant material collected from leaves of <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> plants three days post-infiltration, young rosette leaves of six weeks old <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> plants or <italic>A. thaliana</italic> flower buds.

To one part (60 μl) one volume of 2× Laemmli buffer was added, boiled for five minutes, and was centrifuged at full speed for five minutes, and used as a protein sample. The remaining part was supplemented with 355 μl extraction buffer and was used for RNA extraction with the standard phenol-chloroform method. For analyses of gel-filtration fractions, odd number fractions were used for RNA while the even number fractions were used for protein extractions. For RNA extraction, 350 μl of phenol:chloroform (1:1) mixture was added to an equal volume of fraction, the aqueous phase was precipitated with ethanol, resuspended in 10 μl sterile water, and used for small RNA northern blotting. To investigate proteins 1200 μl cold acetone was added to each fraction, left at −70°C to precipitate, centrifuged, washed with 70% EtOH, dried and resuspended in 10 μl 2× Laemmli buffer and used for western blot analyses.</p>

The number and quality of the reads before and after the filtering steps were analyzed with FastQC. The read statistics are summarized in Additional file 2: <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>. Next, non-redundant, genome-matching reads were collected and their normalized abundances (read per million, RPM) were calculated for every library with an in-house script.

For the miRNA heat maps, the sequences matching the <italic>A. thaliana</italic> mature miRNA sequences in the miRBase v21 database were extracted from the abundance table containing all the mapped, filtered sequences (it can be downloaded from GEO database) and filtered to retain only miRNAs having a mean abundance of at least 1 RPM across the FPLC-fractions in both tissues (input samples excluded) (Additional file 4: <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S3A</xref>).

      <title>sRNAs are partitioned into three distinct pools in plant crude extracts</title>
      <p>To identify the localization of sRNA in plant cells, total crude extracts were prepared from <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> leaves and young flowers with flower buds. These total crude extracts were applied on size separating gel-filtration column and the collected fractions were investigated for their AGO1 and AGO4 or small RNA content. In line with our previous findings (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>), we identified the position of HMW RISC which co-fractionates with the majority of AGO1, the main executor of the miRNA pathway (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>) (between 2000 and 669 kDa; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). Small RNA northern blot hybridization of RNA extracts from the corresponding fractions also showed that the majority of miR159 co-localize with the HMW RISC. In addition, miR168 is also detected in the HMW RISC suggesting that HMW RISC is the main executor component of the miRNA pathway. We also found that ribosomal RNAs co-fractionate with AGO1 and miR159 indicating the polysomal association of HMW RISC (Additional file 1: <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S1</xref>). However, as we previously showed (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>), the majority of miR168 is detected in low molecular weight fractions (at 29 kDa) possibly representing a protein-unbound miR168 pool (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). In contrast to miR168, no high amount of miR159 was detected in the unbound sRNA fractions suggesting that different miRNAs exhibit various loading properties into the HMW RISCs. To reveal that these fractions represent <italic>bona fide</italic> protein-unbound sRNA species, the small RNA content of the leaf sample was extracted, deproteinized and loaded onto the gel-filtration column. Hybridization of the collected fractions with a probe detecting the highly conservative miR159 showed that the deproteinized miRNAs co-migrated with the suspected unbound miR168 of previous blots indicating that these fractions indeed represent AGO-unbound miRNA species (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). To test the accumulation of AGO4, the main executor protein of the 24-nt-long siRNA mediated pathway, the fractions were analyzed for their AGO4 content. Similarly to a previous work (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>) we detected AGO4 protein predominantly in fractions corresponding approximately to the size of single AGO proteins eluted between 200 and 66 KDa (designated as low molecular weight or LMW RISC; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). In addition, in line with a previous work (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>), we detected heterochromatic-siRNA 1003 in our experimental system in fractions co-migrating with AGO4 and representing protein unbound sRNAs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). We were not able to detect AGO4-specific signals in samples representing HMW RISC demonstrating that AGO4 is dominantly present in LMW RISC. In addition to the two experimentally investigated AGO proteins (AGO1 and AGO4), there are further eight in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> which can also associate with sRNAs influencing their mobility properties during gel-filtration experiments. Based on these observations we identified three dominant pools of sRNAs in plant crude extracts: HMW RISC co-fractionating with AGO1, LMW RISC co-fractionating with AGO4 and AGO-unbound sRNAs.</p>

      <title>Cytoplasmic component of crude extracts is predominantly responsible for miRNA signals detected in gel-filtration experiments</title>
      <p>To reveal the cellular composition of the crude extract used in our experiments, cytoplasmic and nuclear markers were also detected on gel-filtered samples (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). As for cytoplasmic markers, BINDING IMMUNOGLOBULIN PROTEIN (BiP) localized in the endoplasmic reticulum lumen and ACTIN, the essential component of cell cytoskeleton were used. Both of them were present at a high level demonstrating the cytoplasmic content of the crude extract (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). The 17 kDa nuclear specific marker HISTONE 3 (H3) also accumulated in high molecular weight complexes indicating that the crude extract also contains nuclear components and protein complexes remained intact during gel-filtration. To reveal the cellular origin of the signals associated with miRNAs, nuclei were purified from <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> leaves and the protein and sRNA contents were investigated (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). We found that the purified nuclei did not exhibit strong signals of the investigated miRNAs. The majority of the observed low signals could be associated with cytosolic contamination of the sample indicated by the faint signals of ribosomal RNAs. We also found that in addition to its dominant accumulation in the cytoplasm, AGO1 is also present in the nuclei at higher amounts than expected from cytosolic contamination indicating that this nuclear pool of AGO1 is not loaded with the tested mature miRNAs. We found, in line with previous results (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>), that the genome associated siRNA1003 was present predominantly in samples representing cytoplasmic components (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>; Additional file1: <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S2</xref>). Moreover, investigation of purified nuclei of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> flowers indicated that AGO4 is also enriched in the cytoplasm (Additional file1: <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S2</xref>). Altogether, these data show that the crude extract used for gel-filtration contains both cytoplasmic and nuclear protein complexes, but the cytoplasmic component of the plant crude extracts is predominantly responsible for the miRNA signals detected during gel-filtration experiments.</p>

      <title>HTS analysis reveals three sRNA pools with distinct sequence-length distribution profiles</title>
      <p>To gain genome-wide information on the sRNA contents of the different pools, young <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> Col-0 leaves and flower samples containing mainly flower buds (Additional file 1: <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S3A</xref>) were subjected to size separating gel-filtration in two independent biological replicates. The purified RNA content of the fractions representing the three identified pools was separately collected, fractions 6–10 were combined for HMW RISC, 19–25 were combined for LMW RISC and 29–35 were combined for unbound sRNAs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). These combined RNA samples and an input total RNA sample originating directly from the crude extract were used for small RNA purification and subsequent HTS. Raw sequences were trimmed to remove adapters and low quality reads, and then filtered to keep only the 20–25-nt-long sequences. Filtered reads were mapped to the <italic>A. thaliana</italic> reference genome and sequences mapped to rRNA and tRNA genes were removed. The number of sequences obtained during the different steps of the process is summarized in Additional file 2: <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>. Abundances of the mapped sequences were calculated and normalized to make them comparable across the samples. The normalized abundance table containing all the filtered sRNA sequences have been deposited in the GEO database (for details, see the Data Availability section).</p>
      <p>To get an initial assessment of the quality of our samples and biological replicates, we performed a principal component analysis (Additional file 1: <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S4</xref>). According to this, the PC1 clearly separates the samples by the tissue of origin (&gt;58% of the variance between the samples can be explained by this), while a further 26% variance can be explained by PC2, which separates the various combined fractions (PC2). The replicates are close to each other which reflects the good quality of our data. This analysis also suggests that the combined fractions represent different biological entities. Analyses of redundant reads revealed that the majority of the sRNAs in both leaf and flower input samples were 24-nt-long (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>) which is a typical characteristic of plant small RNA profiles (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). We identified the 23-nt-long sRNA species as the second most abundant class in the input samples. The 21-nt-long and the 22-nt-long sRNAs accumulated at comparable levels. Analyses of the unique read distributions of leaf and flower input samples revealed similar sRNA size distribution profiles although the proportion of 21-nt-long reads was clearly reduced indicating that this sRNA population contains less individual sRNA sequence with higher abundances (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). In contrast to input, the gel-filtrated samples show markedly different size distribution profiles. Analyses of redundant reads revealed that in HMW RISC the proportion of 21-nt-long reads increased markedly, while the presence of 24-nt-long sRNA species was drastically reduced (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). The relative ratio of 22- and 23-nt-long sRNA species also increased in HMW RISC sRNAs. Analyses of the HMW RISC nonredundant reads show a drastic reduction, especially in case of leaf sRNA classes, which again suggests that HMW RISC associated sRNA population consist of abundant reads with limited sequence diversities (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). In contrast, LMW RISCs were dominantly associated with 24-nt-long sRNAs but also the 21, 22 and 23-nt-long sRNA species were detectable in these samples. Similarly to the HMW RISC, the investigation of unique sequences revealed the profound reduction of reads. More intriguingly, sRNA species were detected with high abundance in the protein-unbound fraction of sRNAs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). The 24 and 23-nt-long sRNAs were the most abundant classes in this sample but extensive amounts of 21- and 22-nt-long sRNAs were also present. The especially dominant presence of 23-nt long sRNAs indicates that this size class of sRNAs is mainly sorted into the biologically inactive unbound sRNA pool. The moderate reduction of nonredundant reads of this sample indicates that this sRNA population mainly contains diverse reads with low abundance.</p>

          <p>Sequence length distribution of sRNAs in the samples. Redundant sequences are the cumulative abundances of the unique sequences in the libraries with the given length. Abundances are normalized to the library size (read per million, RPM). Scales were modified for better visualization. For example, 0.5 of redundant 24-nt sRNAs means 500 000 24-nt sequences in a library with a size of one million total sequences of 20–25-nt length. The non-redundant sequences reflect the number of unique sequences of the given size class normalized to the redundant library size. If the redundant abundance is high but the non-redundant one is low, it means that there are only a few sequences present with a high abundance. On the other hand, if both abundances are high, it means that there are many different sequences with low expression levels. Columns with the same color represent the two biological replicates.

      <title>Distribution of 21- and 24-nt-long siRNAs in the identified pools</title>
      <p>RNA-directed DNA methylation is regulated by 24-nt-long heterochromatin-associated siRNAs loaded into their effector, the AGO4 protein (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). Previous works demonstrate that selected 24-nt-long siRNAs are associated with AGO4 in the cytoplasm and accumulate in the fractions corresponding to LMW RISC and also as unbound siRNA duplexes (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). In agreement with this finding, we observed that the majority of the 24-nt-long siRNAs are indeed associated with AGO4 containing LMW RISC and unbound sRNA pools (Additional file 1: <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S5A</xref>) both in the leaf and flower samples. To confirm the distribution of this class of siRNAs, we selected two representatives and investigated their distribution in gel-filtration fractions by northern blot analyses. In line with HTS data, we observed the presence of these 24-nt-long siRNAs mainly in the LMW RISC and unbound sRNA containing fractions (Additional file 1: <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S5B</xref>). In contrast to the 24-nt-long siRNAs, the predicted 21-nt-long siRNAs exhibited an enhanced association with the HMW RISC both in the leaf and flower samples, and they were also present in the protein-unbound fraction of sRNAs (Additional file 1: <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S5A</xref>).</p>
      <p>Genome-wide quantitative distribution of the 21- and 24-nt-long sRNAs in the different sRNA pools were calculated and visualized in a genome browser (Additional file 1: <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figures S6 and S7</xref>, respectively). This allows the investigation of spatial correlation between the sRNAs and the different genomic features, and at the same time, an assessment of the RISC-loading efficiency of certain sRNA specimens.</p>

      <p>Next, we investigated the presence of the known <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> miRNAs in the identified pools. Heat maps were prepared to display the distribution of miRNAs in the different pools. For the convenient display, only miRNAs with a mean abundance above the threshold of 1 RPM were included in the heat map (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>).

      </fig>
      <p>By hierarchical clustering analysis, we identified six clusters including two that represent tissue-specific miRNAs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). However, since we wanted to compare the RISC-loading efficiencies between the two tissues, we removed these two clusters from further analysis and investigated only those miRNAs that are present in both tissues. In Cluster A, miRNAs have moderately, while in Cluster C miRNAs have strongly limited ability to incorporate into the HMW RISC in the leaf, while a large portion of these miRNAs is present in the unbound sRNA pool. However, both in Cluster A and C, miRNAs show enhanced loading ability in the flower where AGO1, AGO2 and AGO4 proteins are represented in higher amount (Additional file 1: <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S3B</xref>). Cluster B contains miRNAs that are able to incorporate into the HMW RISC very efficiently in both tissues. Finally, miRNA sequences that accumulate mainly in the AGO-unbound pool both in the leaf and flower samples were sorted into Cluster D. These are almost exclusively miRNA* (passenger) strands. It is also apparent, that miRNAs are predominantly associated with the HMW RISC rather than the LMW RISC. This is in line with the dominant presence of AGO1, the main executor protein of the miRNA pathway, in the HMW RISC. Comparison of leaf and flower samples shows that the loading abilities of some miRNAs can be changed depending on the tissue of expression. The sequence logos of the Clusters (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>) do not indicate any common sequence motifs within the miRNA sequence itself which can be characteristic for the particular miRNA clusters. This observation suggests the existence of other, structural features on the miRNA precursors determining the loading efficiency of a particular miRNA. The majority of Cluster A–C miRNAs possess U at their 5′ end (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>) predicting the AGO1-dependence of their action. Moreover, heat map representation of 5′-U miRNAs without an abundance filter (Additional file 1: <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S8A</xref>) reveals various loading rates of miRNAs further supporting the regulated loading of miRNAs into AGO1 and suggesting that this phenomenon is not the consequence of sorting into different AGOs. We also could not detect a correlation between the absolute abundance of the miRNAs and their loading efficiencies (Additional file 1: <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S8B</xref>). Based on these data we revealed the abundant accumulation of unbound miRNAs which postulates a regulatory checkpoint determining RISC-loading efficiencies of particular miRNAs subsequently of their production.</p>

      <title>Validation of the HTS data by northern blot analyses</title>
      <p>To validate the HTS data experimentally, further gel-filtration experiments were carried out using crude extracts of young leaves and flower buds. RNA content of the collected fractions was used for small RNA northern blotting and subsequent hybridization with selected radiolabeled LNA and DNA probes. Coherently with the sequenced data, we experienced great variety in RISC-loading efficiencies of various miRNAs. In line with bioinformatic data, miR156-157 and miR390 showed extremely low RISC-loading rate and high-intensity signals in the pool of unbound miRNAs in leaves (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). In contrast, miR319 similarly to miR159 showed efficient RISC-loading since strong signals were detected in HMW RISC pool and only a moderate signal was detected in the protein-unbound pool. Other miRNAs such as miR161 and miR167 showed intermediate efficiency of loading since comparable signals of HMW RISC and protein-unbound pools were identified (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). Next, we investigated the presence of miRNA* strands in the three defined pools of miRNAs by hybridizing with probes specific for miR156*, miR168* and miR390* strands. In line with the bioinformatic results, we found that these miRNA* strands were present in the low molecular weight fractions suggesting that the AGO-unbound pool of miRNAs represents, at least partly, dsRNA species (Additional file 1: <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S9A</xref>). To test this hypothesis, a crude extract from <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> leaves was directly separated under non-denaturing conditions to preserve miRNA duplexes. We were able to detect the miRNA duplexes of miR168 and miR390, miRNAs which predominantly accumulate in the AGO-unbound pool but duplexes of miR159, exhibiting efficient HMW RISC-loading ability, were not detectable (Additional file 1: <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S9B</xref>). To reveal the methylation status of the unbound miRNAs, a crude extract prepared from <italic>hen1-1</italic> plants (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>) was applied onto a gel-filtration column and the collected fractions were subjected to small RNA northern blot analysis using a probe specific to miR167. Since miR167 possesses an intermediate HMW RISC-loading characteristic (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>) it is possible to detect the polyuridylation, characteristic to unmethylated miRNAs, of both the HMW RISC-loaded and protein-unbound miRNAs. In contrary to Col-0, in <italic>hen1-1</italic> both pools show the typical size increase of small RNAs due to the addition of U residues suggesting that in wild type-plants, RISC-loaded and AGO-unbound miRNAs are methylated as well. The unbound pool of miR167 showed slightly less efficient uridylation (Additional file 1: <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S9c</xref>). This phenomenon can be explained by the protective nature of the supposed dsRNA intermediate form of miR167 in the AGO-unbound pool. Comparison of gel-filtration experiments of vegetative and generative tissues revealed that many of the miRNAs have a higher level of HMW RISC incorporation in flowers than in leaves, i.e. miR157 or miR167 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). These results confirm the accumulation of various miRNAs in the protein-unbound sRNA pool and indicate that loading efficiencies of miRNAs into the HMW RISCs are tightly regulated according to the cellular environment.</p>

      <title>Overexpression of precursor RNAs confirms the altered HMW RISC loading abilities of different miRNAs</title>
      <p>Our data suggest that there are miRNAs which despite their effective production from their precursors are not able to incorporate with high capacity into HMW RISCs. To experimentally validate the different loading efficiencies of various miRNAs, we selected three miRNAs exhibiting higher (miR159a, miR171a) and lower (miR168a) HMW RISC-loading capacities. The precursors of the selected miRNAs were cloned into binary plasmids and transformed into <italic>Agrobacterium tumefaciens. Nicotiana benthamiana</italic> leaves, a heterologous plant system, were infiltrated with <italic>Agrobacterium</italic> suspensions harbouring the individual miRNA precursors or the empty vector as a negative control. Leaf samples were collected at three days-post-infiltration (dpi) and used for RNA extraction or preparation of crude extract suitable for gel-filtration experiments. First, we assessed the overexpression levels of miRNAs in the various infiltrated leaves by small RNA northern blot analyses. We found that all the three miRNAs were massively overexpressed in the infiltrated patches compared to the control infiltrations (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>). Next, we investigated the HMW RISC-loading abilities of different miRNAs by gel-filtration assays. We found that overexpression of miR168 resulted in an extremely high-level accumulation of protein-unbound miR168 species. In contrast, the overexpression of miR159 was accompanied by efficient HMW RISC-loading and only a smaller portion of miR159 was present in the fractions representing protein-unbound sRNAs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>). In the case of miR171 overexpression, we experienced an intermediate HMW RISC-loading ability since, in addition to the high-level accumulation of unbound miR171 species, we observed a marked level of miR171 loaded into the HMW RISC. The availability of functional RISCs in miR171 and miR168 overexpressing samples was investigated with the re-hybridization of gel-filtration blots with probe detecting miR159 while the presence of unbound miRNAs in miR159 overexpressing sample was confirmed by the detection of endogenous miR168 (Additional file 1: <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S10A</xref>). To further confirm the results of the transient <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> studies, we stably overexpressed the same miRNA precursors by establishing homozygous transgenic <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> lines. We first assessed the level of overexpression of particular miRNAs in selected lines (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>) than investigated the HMW RISC loading properties of overproduced miRNAs by gel-filtration assays. In the transgenic plants, the overexpressed miR168 exhibited very poor, miR171 intermediate, while miR159 very efficient HMW RISC-loading (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5D</xref>). The availability of functional RISCs in miR168 overexpressing plants was investigated with the re-hybridization of gel-filtration blot with probe detecting miR159 (Additional file1: <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S10B</xref>). These findings are very similar to the results of the transient assays further supporting the central role of diverse miRNA precursor RNAs in determining the HMW RISC loading efficiencies of various miRNAs. These observations confirm our results about the altered HMW RISC-loading capacities of individual miRNAs since the experimental results are in line with the previous bioinformatic and gel-filtration data. These results also exclude the possibility that the altered tissue-specific expressions of particular miRNAs and AGO proteins are the main cause of the presence of protein-unbound miRNA species since the <italic>Agrobacterium</italic>-mediated transient expression studies were carried out in a similar cellular environment.</p>

      <title>The availability of AGO proteins is the limiting factor of miRNA loading</title>
      <p>Bioinformatic analysis of our HTS data showed that numerous miRNAs with U at their 5′ end, directing AGO1 sorting, show restricted RISC-loading efficiencies. This suggests a competition mechanism between miRNAs for limiting AGO1 proteins, the main executor component of HMW RISC. To test this hypothesis, we transiently overexpressed miR168 in <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> leaves in the presence or absence of transiently overexpressed <italic>4m-AGO1</italic>, a functional, miR168 regulation resistant version of AGO1 (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>). Gel-filtration experiments revealed that in the excess of AGO1 protein more miR168 were loaded into the HMW RISC indicating that there is an available active reservoir of miR168. Very similar results were found in transgenic plants overexpressing <italic>4m-AGO1</italic> (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>) where the <italic>AGO1</italic> mRNA overexpression resulted in the enhanced HMW RISC-loading of miR167 compared to the wild plant (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>). These results also imply that miR167 species sorted into the unbound pool in wild type plants can be directed into HMW RISC in <italic>4m-AGO1</italic> plants. To test the hypothesis of AGO limitation of miRNA loading in another system, we examined the specific miR390-AGO7 interaction as well. It was shown that in contrast to the broad expression domains of <italic>MIR390a</italic> and <italic>MIR390b, AGO7</italic> mRNA expression was confined to the vascular tissues indicating that miR390 is active only in those cells that co-express AGO7 (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>). In line with this theory, we found that miR390 accumulated predominantly in the protein-unbound pool of sRNAs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). High level of miR390 overexpression resulted only in a moderate increase in HMW RISC-loading rate and the vast amount of the overexpressed miR390 accumulated in the unbound pool (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6C</xref>) probably due to the limited availability of AGO7. In contrary, in AGO7 protein overexpressing plants (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>) (Additional file 1: <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S11</xref>) we detected the markedly promoted loading of miR390 into the HMW RISC (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6C</xref>). These data show that the availability of AGO proteins represents a major bottleneck in determining the levels of biologically active, RISC-loaded miRNAs and that the excess miRNAs can be sorted into RISCs when more AGO proteins are available.</p>

    <title>DISCUSSION</title>
    <p>RNAi pathways, mediated by the action of miRNAs, are pivotal regulators of developmental programmes and alleviation of biotic and abiotic stresses. Consequently, the expression and biological activity of miRNAs must be spatiotemporally and quantitatively coordinated. Since MIR genes are transcribed into primary miRNAs (pri-miRNAs) by RNA polymerase II (Pol II), and similarly to protein-encoding genes, <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements and <italic>trans</italic>-acting regulators play fundamental roles in their transcriptional regulation (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>). Due to this control, miRNAs often exhibit spatially highly coordinated, tissue-specific expression patterns (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46–48</xref>) and various miRNAs are able to dynamically respond to environmental stresses (<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>). The transcriptional regulation of MIR genes is followed by multiple levels of post-transcriptional regulatory steps influencing the stability, production rate and biological activity of generated mature miRNAs (<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>). The 5′ capped and 3′ polyadenylated long pri-miRNAs form an imperfect stem-loop structure and are subsequently processed by DCL1 to precursor miRNA (pre-miRNA) possessing specific stem-loop structures. These pre-miRNAs are further processed in the nucleus to miRNA intermediate duplexes consisting of the guide strands (mature miRNA) and the passenger or star strands (miRNA<sup>∗</sup>). In contrast to animal miRNA precursors, which are relatively uniform in size and structure defining the precise cleavage of pre-miRNA stem-loops (<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>) plant pre-miRNAs are highly diverse in size and structure (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Maturation of selected plant pre-miRNAs was shown to be strictly coordinated by various structural elements of stem–loop structures (<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52–54</xref>), however, the extremely diverse structure of plant pri- and pre-miRNAs could hide undiscovered biologically important regulatory, structural or sequence features. According to our knowledge gained so far, the produced mature miRNAs are either loaded into AGO containing RISCs or degraded. In this work, we revealed a new regulatory layer acting at post-production of miRNAs by adjusting the RISC-loading efficiencies of individual miRNAs. Gel-filtration based size separation chromatography is a suitable tool to investigate the large population of sRNAs in interaction with the different RISCs simultaneously. Using this method intact large protein complexes can be separated and investigated. Gel-filtration of plant crude extracts allowed us to separate HMW (co-migrating with AGO1), LMW (co-migrating with AGO4) RISCs and more intriguingly, an unexpected large pool of protein-unbound sRNAs. A previous study using gel-filtration based approach detected AGO1 in a monomer form (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>), however, in this experiment FLAG-AGO1 was first immuno-purified from crude extracts and then applied onto the gel-filtration column. It is possible that the HMW RISCs disintegrate under the experimental procedure of immunoprecipitation. Other works using a similar experimental method also detected AGO1 in a monomer form (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). The differences in the experimental conditions in these studies may explain the dominant presence of AGO1 in fractions representing the monomer form of AGO1. Moreover, Ye <italic>et al.</italic> did not investigate the fractions corresponding to the HMW complexes (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). In our experiments, we used very young intensively developing tissue samples and tried to apply the mildest experimental treatment of the samples before loading them onto the columns and repeatedly detected the dominant accumulation of AGO1 in high molecular weight complexes likely co-migrating with polysomes consistently with previous results (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>). This does not exclude that some portion of AGO1 can exist in monomer form but it is under the detection level of our system. High-throughput sequencing of the sRNA content of gel-filtrated plant crude extracts made it possible to identify the RISC-bound and protein-unbound miRNA pools genome-wide in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. Moreover, this experimental approach allowed us to assess the ratios of AGO1 co-fractionating HMW RISC-bound versus AGO-unbound pools of individual miRNAs. Based on these observations, we identified miRNA species with U at their 5′ end, characteristic for miRNAs sorting into AGO1, which did not load efficiently (e.g. miR156, miR168) or only with intermediate (e.g. miR161, miR167) efficiency into the HMW RISC. The unloaded portion of these poorly loading miRNAs are present in the cytoplasm, co-migrating with deproteinized sRNAs, probably as methylated miRNA/miRNA* duplexes, indicated by their migration in native agarose gel, the polyuridylation of protein-unbound miRNAs in <italic>hen1-1</italic> plants, and the presence of miRNA* strands in this pool. This is consistent with the previous finding where two miRNAs (miR159 and miR165) were detected at low molecular weight fractions (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>) but the origin or importance of the observed signals was not commented. These data show that miRNAs which are abundantly produced are not necessarily fully loaded into executor complexes (RISCs). Similar results were found in the case of 24-nt siRNAs since they were found to be associated mainly with LMW RISC and also with unbound sRNA pool. This result is in line with a previous study where it was shown that 24-nt-siRNA species were associated with AGO4 in the cytoplasm eluting from gel-filtration column between 160 and 66 KDa, at the size of LMW RISC, but they were also present as ds siRNAs in low molecular weight fractions corresponding to protein-unbound sRNAs (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). One hypothetical explanation for the abundant accumulation of these miRNAs in AGO-unbound samples could be the spatially different expression pattern of miRNAs and AGO1 protein. However, this is not likely since AGO1 shows widespread expression in different tissue types throughout the developmental process providing the executor protein continuously (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>). Another possibility is that different miRNAs have an altered ability to load into the AGO1 containing HMW RISCs. To test this hypothesis, we carried out overexpression of three different selected pre-miRNAs, exhibiting various HMW RISC-loading efficiencies, transiently in <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> leaves and in stable transgenic <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> lines. We revealed that the overexpressed miRNAs behaved differently; the efficiently loading miR159 was detected mainly in HMW RISC, miR171 exhibiting intermediate loading ability was present in HMW RISC and also in the unbound sRNA pool, while miR168 with strongly restricted ability to load into HMW RISC accumulated predominantly in the unbound sRNA pool and only a minority of the overexpressed miR168 was loaded into the HMW RISC. The altered HMW RISC-loading of miRNAs in the same tissue environment indicates that structural, sequence and/or <italic>trans</italic>-factors associated with pre-miRNAs orchestrate the HMW RISC-loading ability of individual miRNAs determining the biologically active, loaded portion of the total miRNAs produced. The elevated loading rate of many miRNAs into HMW RISC in flowers (e.g. miR167, miR157) where AGO1 protein is present at a high level (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>) postulates that the accessibility of AGO1 proteins can be a limiting factor. To confirm this assumption we investigated the HMW RISC loading efficiency of the poorly and moderately incorporating miR168 and miR167, respectively, in transient and transgenic expression systems, where the miR168 resistant form of AGO1 protein was overproduced. In both cases, we experienced increased loading of the investigated miRNAs indicating that the availability of AGO proteins can indeed determine the portion of loaded miRNAs utilising the biologically active reservoir of miRNAs. Based on these observations we can hypothesize a regulatory mechanism where abundant production of miRNA species is followed by a competition for unloaded AGO1 pool. Biologically active portions of miRNAs are not solely determined by their production rates but also by the pre-miRNA-driven HMW RISC-loading efficiencies of individual miRNAs. The loading properties of miRNAs are probably further modulated by the competing sRNA population present in the given cellular environment. Previously, it was thought that miRNA duplexes are exported partly by HASTY to the cytoplasm and are loaded into AGO1 here (<xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>). However, a recent finding suggests an alternative mechanism where AGO1 loading takes place in the nucleus (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). AGO-limited RISC-loading was also demonstrated in the miR390 - AGO7 relationship. However, in this case, the spatially different regulation of AGO7 and miR390 expressions can be the reason for the massive accumulation of unbound miR390 pool. This is supported by previous observations demonstrating that while <italic>MIR390a</italic> and <italic>MIR390b</italic> exhibit spatially wide expression, <italic>AGO7</italic> mRNAs express only in the vascular tissues (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>). Based on our findings we suggest a model for a new regulatory mechanism which determines the biological activity of miRNAs by controlling their RISC loading efficiencies through the action of diverse precursor RNAs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). We also think that our results can be useful from a practical point of view for scientists designing artificial (a)miRNAs (precursor backbone selection, modification for optimal results, enhancing or reducing amiRNA activity). Further experiments are needed to understand the detailed molecular mechanisms and spatial distributions lying behind the co-ordinated HMW RISC-loading of miRNAs. It will be also important to understand whether the unbound sRNAs retained their biological activities and can be redirected to RISC-loading or they are partly or completely biologically inactive by-products of previous regulatory steps determining the ratio of biologically active miRNAs.</p>

        <p>Schematic representation of the proposed model. Genome-encoded MIR genes (red, green and blue boxes) are transcribed to various, extremely diverse miRNA precursors (hairpin structures) according to the regulated activities of their promoters. The different miRNA precursors are processed to miRNA intermediate duplexes containing the mature and passenger (*) miRNA strands. These miRNAs undergo methylation at the 3′ nucleotide. The next step is the selective loading of the mature miRNA stands (red, green and blue curved lines) into the executor complexes, the AGO1 containing RISCs (black circles), while the miRNA* strands are eliminated. However, here, a newly identified regulatory mechanism, likely controlled by information carried on the diverse miRNA precursors, determines the RISC-loading efficiencies of various miRNAs sorting only a subset of the produced miRNAs into the biologically active RISCs. The superfluous miRNA populations accumulate in the cytoplasm as protein-unbound pool very likely as miRNA:miRNA* duplexes. Due to this regulation, miRNAs have high (red), intermediate (green), or low (blue) RISC-loading capacities in the given cellular environment. The availability of unloaded RISCs can influence loading properties of miRNAs suggesting that excess of sRNA population compete for limiting empty RISCs. The place of RISC-loading is not known, it can be either in the cytoplasm or nucleus (empty RISC circles). It is also unknown whether the cytoplasmic pool of protein-unbound miRNAs can be redirected to RISCs or they represent biologically inactive products. Altogether, this model suggests that the production rate of certain miRNAs is not the only factor which determines their biological activity. A highly controlled post-production regulatory mechanism can determine the biologically active portion of the produced miRNA population by adjusting their RISC-loading efficiencies in the given cellular environment.</p>
