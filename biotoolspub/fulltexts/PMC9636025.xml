    <abstract id="Abs1">
      <p id="Par1">We present Light-Seq, an approach for multiplexed spatial indexing of intact biological samples using light-directed DNA barcoding in fixed cells and tissues followed by ex situ sequencing. Light-Seq combines spatially targeted, rapid photocrosslinking of DNA barcodes onto complementary DNAs in situ with a one-step DNA stitching reaction to create pooled, spatially indexed sequencing libraries. This light-directed barcoding enables in situ selection of multiple cell populations in intact fixed tissue samples for full-transcriptome sequencing based on location, morphology or protein stains, without cellular dissociation. Applying Light-Seq to mouse retinal sections, we recovered thousands of differentially enriched transcripts from three cellular layers and discovered biomarkers for a very rare neuronal subtype, dopaminergic amacrine cells, from only four to eight individual cells per section. Light-Seq provides an accessible workflow to combine in situ imaging and protein staining with next generation sequencing of the same cells, leaving the sample intact for further analysis post-sequencing.</p>

    <p id="Par3">To comprehensively understand the cellular states that drive biological function and pathology, it would be ideal to combine optical characterization and imaging-based screening of fixed cells and tissues with omics-level profiling by next generation sequencing (NGS).</p>
    <p id="Par4">Recent applications that focus on integrating imaging with transcriptomic measurements of the same individual cells rely largely on physical dissociation and sorting of cells using opto- or microfluidics before, after or during imaging<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Alternative methods rely on photoconversion of fluorescent proteins in selected live cells for later sorting<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>, or photoactivation of messenger RNA capture moieties followed by physical aspiration of target live cells for transcriptomic analysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. These approaches typically require live imaging of cells and extraction of a limited number of visual features before pooling or single-cell sorting of dissociated cells for sequencing. In these cases, the spatial information or the original location of the cell is typically lost or is not relevant.</p>
    <p id="Par5">In an effort to preserve spatial information and morphology, particularly in tissues, recent spatial transcriptomic methods aim to profile cells in situ<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Employing various modes of DNA barcoding, spatial omics approaches aim to spatially index either a two-dimensional capture surface (Slide-Seq<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>, HDST<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>, Seq-Scope<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>, Stereo-Seq<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>, Sci-Space<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>) or the biomolecules directly. In the latter case, barcode sequences can be incorporated onto biomolecules through in situ hybridization (ISH) of combinatorially barcoded probes, or enzymatically by reverse transcription (RT) or ligation (for example, after microfluidic delivery of the barcodes into defined sample positions as in DBIT-Seq<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>). These barcodes can then be read out in situ by iterative imaging (for example, SeqFISH<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup> or MERFISH<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>, HybISS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>), by in situ sequencing (FISSEQ<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>, CARTANA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>) or by ex situ sequencing after they are retrieved from the sample (DBIT-Seq<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>, IGS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>). Alternative approaches have used spatially restricted (1) iterative photo-cleavage and collection of ISH probe barcodes from target regions of interest (ROIs) (DSP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>) or (2) collection of target cells themselves by selective immobilization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>, suction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup> or laser capture microdissection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup> for subsequent barcoding and sequencing.</p>
    <p id="Par6">Existing spatial profiling methods currently rely on one or several of expensive instrumentation (closed box systems costing $100,000–1,000,000, high-end custom microscopes or fluorescence sorters), complex multi-round optical deconvolution of barcoded arrays or barcode sequences in situ and custom microfluidics systems or arrays with rigid sample format restrictions. Many of these methods also use targeted ISH probes rather than whole transcriptome sequencing or are partially or completely destructive to the sample. This creates a high need for accessible and scalable visual selection methods that can directly link multi-dimensional and high-resolution cellular phenotypes (including morphology, protein markers, spatial organization) to transcriptomic profiles for diverse sample types. Recent methods in this direction have adopted an ultraviolet (UV)-uncaging approach to allow spatial barcoding of RNAs (PIC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>) or whole cells (via DNA-barcoded antibodies or lipids as in ZipSeq<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>), but the connection to the sequencing output requires destruction of the samples.</p>
    <p id="Par7">Here, we present a different paradigm, named Light-Seq, for light-directed in situ spatial barcoding of target molecules in desired ROIs for ex situ NGS without sample destruction (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). We achieve this by two innovations: (1) Building on our previous work of light-controlled rapid crosslinking of nucleotides<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>, we utilize an ultrafast crosslinking chemistry<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup> and parallelized photolithography<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup> for light-controlled enzyme-free covalent attachment of pre-designed barcode sequences onto biomolecules in situ. (2) Developing a cross-junction synthesis reaction to integrate DNA barcodes onto biomolecules for ex situ sequencing. We combine this barcoding strategy with a nondestructive workflow to enable imaging and whole transcriptome sequencing of selected cells in fixed samples with the possibility to revisit the sample for further assays such as protein stainings. We benchmark and demonstrate the applicability of Light-Seq on mixed cell cultures and mouse retina tissue sections, and utilize the approach for rare cell transcriptomics, where we identify biomarkers for the very rare dopaminergic amacrine cells (DACs) in the mouse retina.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><title>Light-Seq overview.</title><p>Light-Seq enables selective barcoding of custom selected cells or tissue regions in situ for transcriptomic sequencing. Step (1): Target ROIs can be selected based on phenotypic factors including spatial location, morphology or protein biomarkers in automated or manual fashion after imaging. Custom selection allows large or small regions, and contiguous or disjointed cell groups to be flexibly labeled by photocrosslinking of DNA barcodes, which are then converted into sequenceable indices. For multiplexed targeting of different cell groups or regions, the process can be iterated using different barcode sets. Step (2): After light-directed labeling, barcoded cDNAs are released and prepared into pooled sequencing libraries which are read by standard NGS platforms. The obtained profiles can be analyzed to identify differentially expressed genes. Optionally, the same sample can be revisited after sequencing to perform follow-up assays, such as high-resolution imaging, morphology or protein labeling.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="41592_2022_1604_Fig1_HTML" id="d32e565"/></fig></p>

      <title>Light-Seq overview and barcoding chemistry</title>
      <p id="Par8">Light-Seq employs a light-controlled DNA barcode attachment strategy to enable custom indexing of ROIs in imaged samples. To achieve this capability, we use barcode strands that contain the ultrafast photocrosslinker 3-cyanovinylcarbazole nucleoside (CNVK)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. Hybridized CNVK can form an interstrand crosslink upon short UV illumination (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>). Our general strategy is to hybridize CNVK-containing barcodes to complementary docking sequences and then direct UV light to an ROI to photocrosslink the barcode strands only in that area, and then wash away noncrosslinked barcode strands. This process can be iteratively performed to label multiple ROIs with orthogonal barcode strands.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><title>Light-controlled DNA photocrosslinking.</title><p><bold>a</bold>, Schematic for light-directed barcode attachment on glass slides. Biotinylated single-stranded DNA oligos are immobilized onto glass surfaces with biotin–streptavidin binding.

      <p id="Par9">To set up the Light-Seq platform, we optimized the crosslinking exposure time and light intensity and found that 1–10 s produced efficient crosslinking, similar to previous in vitro results<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. To create custom photomasks in a parallelized manner, we use a digital micromirror device (DMD)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup> attached to a standard widefield imaging setup. Using a ×10 objective, a single mirror in our DMD setup can yield a practical resolution &lt;2 µm based on estimating the full-width at half-maximum on a dot array (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">1a,b</xref>). We first validated the barcoding chemistry in vitro on a glass surface coated with immobilized DNA strands. By adding fluorescently labeled barcode strands and using custom photomasks (for example, of a cat) to crosslink them to the surface, we were able to create patterns with a single barcode strand (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>) or use sequential rounds of barcoding with unique strands to pattern multiple regions on the same slide, such as the three-color Penrose triangle (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>). Although we primarily use 365-nm light-emitting diode (LED) epi-illumination with a DMD for the UV crosslinking step, we also demonstrated subcellular spatial labeling with a 405-nm laser<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup> on a confocal point-scanning microscope (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">1c–g</xref>). The laser-scanning system offers higher resolution and contrast but is slower than the DMD and LED illumination.</p>
      <p id="Par10">Next, to read out the sequence of target DNAs with their corresponding crosslinked barcode sequences by NGS, the crosslinked bases must be addressed without loss of either the barcode identity or the barcoded sequence. To this end, we developed a cross-junction synthesis reaction to copy both the barcoded DNA sequence and barcode into a new single strand of DNA without a crosslink (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>). For this we use a strategy similar to our previously developed Primer Exchange Reaction (PER)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. We use a primer with a strand displacing polymerase that copies a new strand until it is halted at the crosslink point. We designed the sequences around the crosslink to have an identical domain so that the extended primer can reach across the junction and be templated on the opposing strand through a branch migration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup> competition between two identical domains. The single-stranded DNA product of this cross-junction reaction can then be amplified and read out with standard NGS pipelines.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><title>Cross-junction synthesis and full in situ protocol with validation on cell mixtures.</title><p><bold>a</bold>, Design of the cross-junction synthesis reaction.

Once displaced, the synthesized P domain (blue) primer can bind across to form a three-way junction and then continue to be extended (step 3).

      <title>Utilizing Light-Seq for whole transcriptome sequencing</title>
      <p id="Par11">To use Light-Seq for whole transcriptome sequencing, we first perform in situ RT<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup> on fixed and permeabilized cells or tissue sections to synthesize complementary DNA (cDNA) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>, step 1). To label RNAs regardless of polyadenylation, we use a degenerate primer with five N and three G bases on the 3′ end<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup> and a barcode docking site on the 5′ end. After RT, the 3′ ends of the generated cDNAs are A-tailed to create a 3′ handle for ex situ primer binding. A CNVK- and unique molecular identifier (UMI)-containing barcode strand is then hybridized to the 5′ docking site on all cDNAs. We then direct UV light to the ROI to photocrosslink the barcode strands in that area and then wash away noncrosslinked barcode strands. This process can be iteratively performed to label multiple ROIs with orthogonal barcode strands (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>, step 2).</p>
      <p id="Par12">After all ROIs have been barcoded, barcoded cDNAs are collected from the sample with a mild RNase H treatment and prepared for sequencing (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>, step 3). We then apply our cross-junction synthesis reaction to stitch the cDNAs and barcode sequences together into a single readout strand with one enzymatic reaction step (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>, step 4). This direct attachment of spatial barcodes onto transcriptomic sequences allows a straightforward transition to ex situ sequencing of the readout sequences after PCR amplification and NGS library preparation (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>, steps 5–6). While developing the protocol, we made several critical design choices to minimize the potential artifacts of the in situ RT reaction that have been previously observed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>, as we discuss in detail in Supplementary Note <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>.</p>
      <p id="Par13">To validate the capability to select and barcode cells based on phenotypic profiles, we performed a cell mixing experiment where mouse 3T3 cells were mixed with human HEK cells that stably express eGFP (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>). We targeted each cell type with distinct barcode sequences (coupled to different fluorophores for visualization purposes) by manually selecting them based on eGFP expression and cellular morphology (Supplementary Figs. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref> and <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>). Out of a total of ~4,500 cells in the same well, we barcoded ~25 human and ~25 mouse cells and confirmed the targeted cell type was barcoded correctly by a fluorescent scan (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3d–f</xref>). Sequencing reads were mapped to a merged human and mouse genome, and unique maps were further analyzed. We were able to validate the barcode integration by cross-junction synthesis by matching the reads to our expected sequence output (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3a–c</xref>). We observed a good discrimination ratio of mouse and human maps to their respective barcode sequences (89.1 ± 0.7% of mouse reads, 87.3 ± 0.7% of human reads, <italic>n</italic> = 3 technical replicates, mean ± s.d.), and notably 93 ± 0.5% of eGFP reads were correctly attributed to the human-specific barcodes (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3g</xref>). After sequence extraction, we performed multiplexed immunofluorescence (IF) to validate the integrity of the sample for secondary assays (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3h</xref>).</p>
      <p id="Par14">Next, we estimated the abundance of transcripts that Light-Seq can capture. Because the barcoding area of Light-Seq can be arbitrarily set by the user, we chose to normalize the number of transcripts that can be captured with Light-Seq as the number of UMI sequences per ‘unit area’ that was roughly the size of a bead in Slide-Seq<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup> or a barcoded square in DBIT-Seq<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>, which we define as 10 × 10 µm<sup>2</sup>. We obtained the number of UMIs per unit area by estimating the total cell or tissue area that was subject to UV illumination for each barcode based on microscopy images of ROIs via segmentation (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>) and calculating the average UMI count (for correctly barcoded and uniquely mapped reads) for a 100-µm<sup>2</sup> barcoded area. At a sequencing depth of ~30 million reads per replicate and with only ~1/2 of the sample amplified for library preparation and sequencing, we observed an average of 1,959 ± 453 and 1,170 ± 207 UMIs per unit area for HEK and 3T3 cells, respectively (Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>, mean ± s.d.). We note that the read depth of ~30 million was subsaturating (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>), and a single ~200 million read dataset from half of the sample yielded 3,328 and 2,029 UMIs per unit area for HEK and 3T3 cells, respectively (Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>).</p>
      <p id="Par15">Normalized gene expression levels (expressed as log<sub>2</sub>-transformed transcripts per kilobase per million reads (TPM)) displayed good correlation across technical replicates (Pearson correlation coefficient &gt; 0.8). The top 200 expressed genes correlated highly across technical replicates (Pearson correlation coefficient &gt; 0.9; Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">2c,d</xref>) and comprised various protein coding genes, as well as short transfer RNAs and long noncoding RNAs (Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref> and source data), illustrating the range of transcripts that can be targeted with the barcoding strategy.</p>
      <p id="Par16">With Light-Seq, we were able to successfully recover species-specific transcriptomes of targeted cells, despite only selecting 1–2% of cells within the whole well. We hypothesized that the Light-Seq background, reflected here by the small portion of species-specific transcripts harboring the barcode corresponding to the other species (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3g</xref>), could arise from three potential sources: (1) diffusion of RNAs or cDNAs before photocrosslinking, (2) incomplete removal of uncrosslinked barcode strands during stringent washing and (3) light-scattering inducing out-of-ROI barcoding. To mitigate (1) and (2), we added blocking and crowding agents to our barcode hybridization step for all of the following experiments, which substantially improved signal-to-noise (<xref rid="Sec8" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref> and Supplementary Note <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>). To mitigate light-scattering effects, we seeded the cells below confluence. For higher density labeling (for example, in tissues), we suggest optimization of the optical setup and sample preparation and slight erosion of ROI boundaries (~1–3 µm) to account for scatter (<xref rid="Sec8" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref> and Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).</p>

      <title>Spatial sequencing with Light-Seq in tissue sections</title>
      <p id="Par17">RNA sequencing of specific cell populations within tissue samples remains challenging, especially when target cells are rare or difficult to isolate. We therefore tested Light-Seq on fixed sections from the mouse retina to capture biomarkers from cell populations of interest based on in situ identification. First, in situ RT was performed in fixed 18 µm retinal cryosections to synthesize cDNAs for spatial barcoding. We then manually selected three cellular layers of the retina, each known to have unique function and cellular composition: the outer nuclear layer (ONL), containing rod and cone photoreceptors; the bipolar cell layer (BCL), containing bipolar cells, horizontal cells and Müller glia; and the ganglion cell layer (GCL), containing retinal ganglion cells and displaced amacrine cells (ACs) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>). After photocrosslinking fluorescently labeled barcodes to all cDNAs within each layer, the targeted ROIs were imaged using a confocal microscope to verify layer-specific labeling (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref> and Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">3a–c</xref>).

      <p id="Par18">Since the cellular composition of each retinal layer is well-established<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>, we verified the specificity of spatial barcoding based on the levels of cell-type-specific markers associated with each barcode. We used DESeq2 (ref. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>) to perform differential expression analysis on exon-mapped barcoded sequencing reads to look for layer-specific markers. Based on the size of barcoded areas, we labeled an estimated 1,112 ± 199, 298 ± 29 and 91 ± 14 (mean ± s.d., <italic>n</italic> = 4 technical replicates) cells for the ONL, BCL and GCL layers, respectively. UMI yields varied for different retinal layers depending on cell and RNA content of each layer, ranging from ~1,200 to 5,000 UMI’s per 10 × 10 µm<sup>2</sup> unit area (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">3d</xref> and Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>).

      <p id="Par19">Technical replicates showed consistent read filtering throughout the sequence-processing pipeline (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">4a,b</xref>) and were well correlated based on principal component analysis for each layer (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">4c</xref>), and we discovered &gt;3,400 genes with significant differential expression between pairs of barcoded populations (3,430 genes for ONL versus BCL; 3,434 for BCL versus GCL; 6,165 for ONL versus GCL, <italic>P</italic><sub>adj</sub> &lt; 0.05; Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c,d</xref> and accompanying source data), including many known markers of rod and cone photoreceptors in the ONL, of bipolar cells and Müller glia in the BCL and of retinal ganglion cells in the GCL.</p>
      <p id="Par20">To further benchmark Light-Seq data, we simulated pseudo-bulk RNA sequencing of the retinal layers using published single-cell Drop-Seq data of ONL and BCL cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup> (<xref rid="Sec8" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref>). We saw strong correlation for the genes enriched between the ONL and BCL (98.6% of genes significantly enriched in both assays were enriched in the same layer; Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">4d</xref>). For all BCL-enriched genes, the ratios of Light-Seq to Drop-Seq reads show higher correlation and comparable sensitivity for longer genes and lower correlation and sensitivity for shorter genes (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">4e–g</xref>), consistent with Light-Seq’s internal priming strategy versus Drop-Seq’s polyA-targeted transcript capture.</p>

      <p id="Par22">To assess the sensitivity of Light-Seq for detecting mRNAs, we compared both Light-Seq and Drop-Seq directly with single molecule FISH (smFISH<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>) data. Our previous work used quantitative multiplexed SABER-FISH<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup> to co-detect 16 mRNA markers of bipolar interneuron subtypes in age-matched mouse retinas<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>. From these data, we estimated the average number of transcripts per cell within the pooled bipolar cell population. Multiplying this by the number of cells within the barcoded Light-Seq BCL (ROI2) and pseudo-bulked Drop-Seq data, we estimated the expected number of detectable transcripts for each gene in the sequenced populations. Relative to smFISH, we find that the sensitivity of Light-Seq was 4.29 ± 3.39% (mean ± s.d., <italic>n</italic> = 16 genes, 4 replicates) and sensitivity of Drop-Seq was 3.97 ± 4.38% (mean ± s.d., <italic>n</italic> = 16 genes, 6 replicates) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4e</xref> and Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">4h–j</xref>).</p>

      <title>Rare cell transcriptomics with Light-Seq</title>
      <p id="Par25">For applications where only a small number of cells of interest are present and/or where spatial context is critical for their identification, capturing transcriptomes remains a major challenge. To test Light-Seq’s utility for imaging, barcoding and sequencing of rare cells, we targeted the extremely rare and difficult to isolate DACs in the mouse retina. DACs comprise ≤0.01% of retinal cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup> and are interspersed among diverse types of neurons. Previous works aimed at profiling DACs with single-cell RNA-seq<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup> or microarray capture after dissociation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup> have seen limited success. To find subtype-specific biomarkers of DACs, we fixed and sectioned mouse retinas and first performed in situ RT (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a</xref>, step 1). Then, IF was done to detect tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), a known marker of DACs, to locate them for barcoding (step 2). Next, two rounds of barcoding were guided by the TH IF signal (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5b</xref> and Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig11" ref-type="fig">6a</xref>), to barcode cDNAs within TH<sup>−</sup> DACs with FITC-labeled barcode strands (roughly 500 cells per section) and cell bodies of all TH<sup>+</sup> DACs with Cy3-labeled barcode strands (4–8 cells per section, <italic>n</italic> = 5 section replicates) (step 3).

      <p id="Par27">Sequencing at a subsaturating sequencing depth of 3.5–5 million reads per replicate (one pooled MiSeq run for five successfully amplified section replicates; Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig11" ref-type="fig">6d</xref>) yielded 6,000–10,000 UMIs per 10 × 10-µm<sup>2</sup> unit area for TH<sup>+</sup> DACs, with an average of 7,800 UMIs per cell (Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref>). We again observed good gene body coverage and consistent RPKM across replicates (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig12" ref-type="fig">7a–c</xref>). Differential expression analysis revealed 36 significantly enriched genes in the TH<sup>+</sup> population (<italic>P</italic><sub>adj</sub> &lt; 0.05, log<sub>2</sub>(fold enrichment) &gt; 1), including the known markers TH (<italic>P</italic><sub>adj</sub> = 1.32 × 10<sup>−24</sup>) and CARTPT (<italic>P</italic><sub>adj</sub> = 4.98 × 10<sup>−65</sup>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup> (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5c</xref> and accompanying source data). To validate the top biomarker (<italic>Cartpt</italic>) after sequencing, we revisited the stored samples and performed IF for CARTPT on the same cells, revealing specific labeling (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5d,e</xref>).</p>
      <p id="Par28">For further validation, RNA-FISH was performed in new retinal sections to detect the top differentially expressed genes (<italic>P</italic><sub>adj</sub> &lt; 0.05 and log<sub>2</sub>(fold enrichment) &gt; 3). In all cases, the RNA-FISH confirmed the Light-Seq results, showing marker enrichment in TH<sup>+</sup> DACs relative to neighboring TH<sup>−</sup> ACs (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5f</xref>). As controls, we detected <italic>Gad1</italic> mRNA, with known expression in both TH<sup>+</sup> DACs and TH<sup>−</sup> ACs, and <italic>Vsx2</italic> mRNA, which is not expressed in either population. Importantly, FISH data suggest that some markers had high expression levels (<italic>Cartpt</italic>, <italic>Slc18a2</italic>), while others were expressed more moderately (<italic>Gabre</italic>, <italic>Gabrq</italic>, <italic>Stra6</italic>), demonstrating that Light-Seq can accurately detect moderately expressed RNAs.</p>

    <title>Discussion</title>
    <p id="Par30">Here, we present Light-Seq, a method to attach sequenceable spatial indices onto biomolecules in intact samples using light. By directly integrating two powerful domains, microscopy and NGS, Light-Seq enables linking of morphological and spatial parameters of target cells to their transcriptomic profiles. Capture of morphology, tissue context, transcriptome and protein expression in the same cells provides a more comprehensive measurement of the state of cells and their interactions.</p>
    <p id="Par31">We demonstrated that Light-Seq can be used for full-transcriptome profiling of populations of 4–1,000+ cells within fixed tissue sections, with sensitivity similar to existing methods. Light-Seq produced UMI yields of 1,000–10,000 per 10 × 10-µm<sup>2</sup> unit area depending on the target cell type, comparable to DBIT-Seq (~5,000 UMIs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup> and Slide-SeqV2 (500–1,000 UMIs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup> for tissue areas of the same size (Supplementary Tables <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref> and <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref>). Light-Seq sensitivity for transcript detection ranged between 1% and 10% for individual genes when compared with smFISH measurements, with a mean of 4.29 ± 3.39%, similar to single-cell RNA sequencing sensitivity for the same set of genes (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4e</xref> and Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">4h–j</xref>). Even with our conservative pipeline which includes only reads that mapped uniquely to the genome and exonic features, the sensitivity of Light-Seq is in line with existing spatial sequencing methods (0.005–15.5% (refs. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref></sup>), as reviewed before<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>). We note that both sensitivity and UMIs per unit area measurements are generally highly impacted by the particular cell and tissue type, genes assayed and sequence-processing pipelines, which makes direct comparisons across technologies and applications imperfect.</p>
    <p id="Par32">We expect that Light-Seq’s sensitivity can be further improved with optimization of the in situ RT and barcoding, such as by protease treatment, antigen retrieval or changes to fixation/permeabilization conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref></sup>, use of targeted ISH probes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref></sup> and targeted ribosomal RNA depletion. These improvements, combined with the flexibility of custom photomasks, could ultimately enable profiling of single cells or subcellular compartments with higher efficiency. We will continue to update detailed protocols for applying Light-Seq at <italic>lightseq.io</italic>, including suggestions for optimization in different types of tissues.</p>
    <p id="Par33">Despite using different methods for RNA detection, we observed strong agreement between differentially enriched genes in single-cell Drop-Seq and Light-Seq data from the same cell types, such that 98.6% of significantly differential genes were enriched in the same retinal cell population in both datasets (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">4d</xref>). While the Drop-Seq data originated from dissociated cells among many retinas, Light-Seq requires far less cellular input (selected cells from only four 18 µm sections) and is not subject to loss of cells upon dissociation and the selection biases that this can produce.</p>
    <p id="Par34">Many existing spatial transcriptomics methods are complex and expensive to implement, regardless of the biological question of interest. Using standard NGS, Light-Seq circumvents many challenges associated with in situ sequencing and FISH approaches, which are limited by tissue autofluorescence and image deconvolution. The sequencing output of Light-Seq enables detecting not only RNA presence, but precise sequence information such as single nucleotide polymorphisms and splice isoforms, offering a major advantage over most ISH approaches (Supplementary Note <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>). This approach could be particularly useful for tracking mutations and clonality in cancers or resolving microbial species in tissue samples. The cost for RT, A-tailing, three rounds of barcoding, displacement, cross-junction synthesis and PCR, on each section, is only ~$34.50 (Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5</xref>) per section. Photocrosslinking is feasible to perform with any standard optical imaging setup that can focus UV light on specified areas (for example, a microscope with a 365-nm UV LED and a DMD attachment, or a 405-nm laser on a confocal scanning or even light-sheet microscope for three-dimensional applications).</p>
    <p id="Par35">The DSP platform offers similar flexibility for spatial targeting by using iterative UV-cleavage and microcapillary collection of released barcodes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>, but this platform requires expensive equipment and targeted hybridization-based barcoding of mRNAs, and currently offers lower sensitivity, requiring a minimum of 20–300 cells for sequencing. Another approach, PIC, similarly takes advantage of light-directed ROI targeting and shows higher sensitivity with single-cell barcoding, but is single-plex and destructive to the sample. These methods include differences in sample preparation and UMI recovery protocols which may be useful to consider for future variations of Light-Seq.</p>
    <p id="Par36">By spatially restricting the barcoding to targeted cDNAs and selectively amplifying them for library generation, Light-Seq allows the sequencing reads to be focused on cells of interest. Thus, unlike surface capture or microfluidic channel-based methods, sequencing depth and cost can be flexibly optimized, particularly for experiments targeting very few cells. This advantage is evident with our rare cell experiment (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>) where we used a single pooled MiSeq run (20 million reads) for all replicates. Experimentally decoupling the imaging and sequencing also makes the workflow highly flexible, and the light-directed barcoding allows addressing ROIs of different scales (from subcellular structures to large super-cellular regions) with the same reagents and experimental strategy.</p>
    <p id="Par37">We demonstrated how Light-Seq offers a simple and customizable workflow for studying very rare cell populations. We discovered and validated previously unknown biomarkers of TH<sup>+</sup> DACs, which have not been captured by previous attempts to transcriptionally profile this population<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup>. Our data confirm previously known markers, such as <italic>Th</italic>, <italic>Cartpt</italic> and <italic>Slc18a2</italic>, but also provide new leads for understanding the biology of dopaminergic retinal neurons. Several of these, such as <italic>Arpp21</italic> (ref. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref></sup>), <italic>Vgff</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref></sup> and <italic>Gpx3</italic> (ref. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref></sup>), are suggested to play a role in dopaminergic neurons or related diseases elsewhere in the nervous system, but many remain unstudied. Among the novel markers is <italic>Stra6</italic>, encoding a transmembrane vitamin A transporter that bidirectionally traffics retinol. Interestingly, this gene is additionally expressed in the retinal pigment epithelium and has been implicated in retinal disease, but the role of TH<sup>+</sup> DACs in disease phenotypes remains unexplored<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref></sup>. The discovery of the tetrodotoxin-resistant voltage-gated sodium channel, <italic>Scn5a</italic>, is surprising and interesting. <italic>Scn5a</italic> encodes the main cardiac sodium channel, <italic>Nav1.5</italic>, and has been detected very rarely in neuronal populations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref></sup>. Here, we report that <italic>Scn5a</italic> is highly expressed in TH<sup>+</sup> DACs, but its function in these cells remains to be shown.</p>
    <p id="Par38">The nondestructive nature of Light-Seq leaves the sample intact after sequencing, potentiating multi-omic measurements from the same cells. We also envision that Light-Seq could be adopted for landmark-based transcriptomics (such as APEX-Seq<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref></sup>), without genetic intervention and sample destruction. While the combination of sensitivity, spatial resolution and ease of adoption of Light-Seq is collectively advantageous over existing technologies, the number of addressable regions is currently limited compared with other spatial methods. We expect that increasing the multiplexing would be highly feasible, as other published methods (for example, SABER<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref></sup>, CycIF<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref></sup> or CODEX<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref></sup>) perform much longer (up to 60) serial cycles with repeated labeling, imaging and dehybridization/bleaching, and provide strong preceding evidence for good tissue preservation across more barcoding rounds. Scaling to combinatorial barcode construction and to labeling of other biomolecules (for example, proteome, epigenome) in future applications could support high-throughput barcoding and screening of hundreds to thousands of cells or regions with minimal increase in cost and is of great interest for further development.</p>

      <p id="Par43">Neural retinas were dissected from postnatal day 18 mice in 1× PBS (Invitrogen AM9625, diluted in ultrapure water, Invitrogen cat. no. 10977) and immediately fixed for 25 min at room temperature in 1× PBS with 4% paraformaldehyde (diluted from 16% solution, Thermo Scientific cat. no. 28908) and 0.25% Triton X-100 (Sigma Aldrich T8787). Retinas were then washed 3 × 5 min in 1× PBS and once for 10 min in 7% sucrose in 1 × PBS (40-µm filter-sterilized), before getting embedded in a 1:1 solution (v:v) of OCT (Tissue-Tek 4583) and 30% sucrose in 1× PBS for freezing in cryomolds and subsequent storage at −80 °C. Cryosectioning was performed to cut 18 µm sections onto poly-<sc>l</sc>-lysine-coated 18-well ibidi chamber slides (ibidi custom order cat. no. 81814, #1.5 polymer). For comparing retinal layers (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>), four technical replicates were prepared by cutting four distinct retinal sections from the same animal into different wells. To promote tissue adhesion, chamber slides were coated before cryosectioning with an additional layer of poly-<sc>d</sc>-lysine (PDL) (Sigma P6407) dissolved at 0.3 mg ml<sup>−1</sup> in 2× Borate Buffer (diluted in water from Thermo Scientific PI28341, aliquoted and stored −20 °C). PDL coating was performed by covering the chambers with sterile PDL solution for 2 hours at 4 °C, removing the solution and drying completely and washing once with UltraPure water. After cryosectioning, retinas were dried briefly (~10 min) and washed three times in 1× PBS with 0.1% Tween-20 (vol/vol, Sigma Aldrich cat. no. P9416-50ML) (PBST).</p>
      <p id="Par44">The buffer was then replaced with an RT mix composed of 300 µM dNTPs (NEB N0447S), 0.5% Triton X-100 (vol/vol), 6 mM RNaseOUT (Invitrogen cat. no. 10777019), 1 µM RT primer and 8 U µl<sup>−1</sup> Maxima RT H Minus enzyme (Thermo Scientific cat. no.

After A-tailing, samples were washed in PBST for 3 × 1 min and stored overnight at 4 °C in  PBST. Next day, before barcoding, the PBST was removed and fresh PBST with 1 M NaCl was added. For barcode hybridization, a barcoding solution consisting of PBST with 2 mg ml<sup>−1</sup> sheared salmon sperm DNA (Invitrogen AM9680), 10% dextran sulfate (wt/vol, Sigma Aldrich cat. no. S4030), 250 nM Barcode 1 strand (GATE.D12.B1) and 500 mM NaCl was applied for 30 min. Samples were then washed with PBST with 1 M NaCl (3 × 1 min). Last wash buffer was replaced with fresh PBST with 1 M NaCl before proceeding to the barcoding. Slide was then transferred to the microscope for light-directed barcoding. Desired regions were visually identified in the brightfield images and hand-drawn masks were set as photostimulation regions (see the <xref rid="Sec12" ref-type="sec">Barcoding setup</xref> section). After photostimulation in the regions of interest, the chamber was removed from the microscope for washing. Samples were then washed with PBST with 60% deionized formamide (vol/vol) 8 times (four cycles of two buffer exchanges with 5-min incubation in between) and with PBST with 1 M NaCl (2 × 2 min). Last wash buffer was replaced with fresh PBST with 1 M NaCl for the next barcoding round. The same tissue area was then manually found on the microscope, and two additional barcoding rounds were performed with Barcodes 2 (GATE.D12.B2) and 3 (GATE.D12.B3).

To maximize yield of recovery, a low-retention pipette tip was first coated with primer by pipetting up and down in a 20 nM solution, and then the same empty tip was used to pipette the displacement mix up and down several times within the well before collection.

Donkey anti-rabbit-Alexa647 secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch cat. no. 711-605-152, RRID:AB_2492288) was added at 1:250 dilution in the same Blocking Solution for 30 min at room temperature and then washed 5 × 3 min with PBST.</p>
      <p id="Par50">Barcoding was then performed as described above with minor changes, listed here. The first round targeted the FITC-barcode strand (Barcode 3, GATE.D12.B3 sequence, annotated as Barcode 1 in Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a</xref>) to TH<sup>−</sup> ACs, and the second round targeted the Cy3-barcode strand (Barcode 2, GATE.D12.B2) to TH<sup>+</sup> DACs (see Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6</xref> for barcode sequences). The <italic>z</italic> focal plane for barcoding TH<sup>+</sup> DACs was guided by the anti-TH antibody signal with an additional 5-µm adjustment away from the well surface. Stringent washes after light-directed barcoding in PBST with 60% formamide were doubled in number (four cycles of 5-min incubations, where each cycle consisted of four buffer exchanges, rather than two buffer exchanges as done for the retinal layers). All TH<sup>+</sup> DACs in the same section were addressed individually across multiple fields of view and were crosslinked with Barcode 2 after manual selection. Of the six section replicates prepared, five yielded enough material for sequencing during the PCR amplification of the extracted sequences. For all replicates, the number of TH<sup>+</sup> DACs was between four and eight, and therefore the TH<sup>+</sup> DAC transcriptomes came from a pool of four to eight cells per technical replicate.</p>

      <p id="Par78">To estimate the sensitivity of Light-Seq, we compared sequencing read counts with published smFISH data for a set of 16 bipolar cell markers, which were captured in the BCL Light-Seq data<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>. From this previous publication, we used the smFISH puncta-per-cell counts to estimate the expected number of total transcripts detected, based on the number of bipolar cells captured in the Light-Seq BCL area and the known average transcript per cell counts within the BCL. To estimate the number of bipolar cells captured within the Light-Seq BCL area, we overlaid the ROI outline with the DAPI-stained barcode image. First, the full arclength of the region, arc<sub>total</sub>, was measured in FIJI using the <italic>Segmented Line</italic> tool followed by <italic>Analyze</italic> → <italic>Measure</italic>. Then, a small portion of the arclength, arc<sub>small</sub>, was measured (~200 μm) in the same way, and the number of DAPI-stained nuclei within the ROI were counted for the arc<sub>small</sub> area (cells<sub>small</sub>). The total number of nuclei in the ROI was predicted by scaling: (no. of total cells) = (arc<sub>total</sub> × cells<sub>small</sub>)/arc<sub>small</sub> (Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>).</p>
      <p id="Par79">With an estimate of the number of bipolar cells within the BCL, we then used the smFISH data for the 16 marker genes with single-cell expression counts published in West et al. 2022 (ref. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>) to predict how many transcripts should be present within a bipolar cell population of the measured size. Since the published data were single-cell transcript (smFISH puncta) counts for each of the 16 marker genes for all bipolar subtypes (at their measured ratios), we chose to exclude all cells of type BC1B from the smFISH data and the Drop-Seq data because their cell bodies are located within the AC layer and would not be within the Light-Seq BCL (as shown in previous work, particularly in Fig. 3 of Shekhar et al. 2016 (ref. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>)). To exclude BC1B from the smFISH single-cell gene expression matrix from West et al. 2022 (ref. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>), we removed all rows from ‘Retina1.csv’ (available on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/ewest11/Bipolar-Serial-SABER-FISH-Analysis">https://github.com/ewest11/Bipolar-Serial-SABER-FISH-Analysis</ext-link>) with ‘Subtype’ = 2. For Drop-Seq data, the cells belonging to the BC1B cluster were similarly removed.</p>
      <p id="Par80">With the remaining gene expression counts across all other bipolar subtypes, we averaged across all cells to obtain an ‘average transcript per cell count’ for the BCL. This average was then scaled by our estimated cell numbers (listed in Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref> for each replicate) to obtain the expected number of transcripts per Light-Seq BCL replicate and per Drop-Seq replicate. Sensitivity was plotted with MATLAB 2018a’s <italic>boxplot</italic> function, with default settings.</p>
      <p id="Par81">We note that the mice in West et al. 2022 (ref. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>) were injected with EdU and BrdU for cellular birth dating and the Drop-Seq cells were dissociated for sequencing, which should be considered as potential sources of variance.</p>

      <p id="Par82">R1 and R2 reads for each replicate from the TH<sup>+</sup> DAC experiment were mapped and deduplicated separately. The R1 and R2 deduplicated read files were then merged, sorted by read name and iterated through to identify pairs where both R1 and R2 mapped to transcripts. The numbers of pairs that mapped to the same transcript versus different transcripts are reported in Supplementary Note <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>.

Box plots were then generated to show transcript counts for transcripts within different length ranges, with bins chosen based on mouse embryonic stem cells full-length comparisons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87">87</xref></sup> in R (v.4.1.3).
