      <title>Summary</title>
      <sec>
        <title>Background</title>
        <p>Comprehensive characterization of exposures and immune responses to viral infections is critical to a basic understanding of human health and disease. We previously developed the VirScan system, a programmable phage-display technology for profiling antibody binding to a library of peptides designed to span the human virome. Previous VirScan analytical approaches did not carefully account for antibody cross-reactivity among sequences shared by related viruses or for the disproportionate representation of individual viruses in the library.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>Methods</title>
        <p>Here we present the AntiViral Antibody Response Deconvolution Algorithm (AVARDA), a multi-module software package for analyzing VirScan datasets. AVARDA provides a probabilistic assessment of infection with species-level resolution by considering sequence alignment of all library peptides to each other and to all human viruses. We employed AVARDA to analyze VirScan data from a cohort of encephalitis patients with either known viral infections or undiagnosed etiologies. We further assessed AVARDA's utility in associating viral infection with type 1 diabetes and lupus.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>Findings</title>
        <p>By comparing acute and convalescent sera, AVARDA successfully confirmed or detected encephalitis-associated responses to human herpesviruses 1, 3, 4, 5, and 6, improving the rate of diagnosing viral encephalitis in this cohort by 44%. AVARDA analyses of VirScan data from the type 1 diabetes and lupus cohorts implicated enterovirus and herpesvirus infections, respectively.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>Interpretation</title>
        <p>AVARDA, in combination with VirScan and other pan-pathogen serological techniques, is likely to find broad utility in the epidemiology and diagnosis of infectious diseases.</p>

        <title>Evidence before this study</title>
        <p id="para0008">Anti-viral antibody profiling has the potential to enable unbiased diagnosis of infectious diseases and to uncover novel epidemiologic associations. VirScan is a programmable bacteriophage display system developed to profile serum antibodies using overlapping 56 amino acid peptides that tile across all human viruses. Interpreting data from VirScan or related assays is difficult, in large part due to signals associated with antibody cross-reactivity. The lack of an approach to deconvolute antibody profiles has limited the utility of VirScan and related technologies in both clinical and research settings.</p>

      <sec id="sec0002sss">
        <title>Added value of this study</title>
        <p id="para0010">Here we present a novel analytical framework, the AntiViral Antibody Response Deconvolution Algorithm (AVARDA), which enables deconvolution of VirScan data and provides a probabilistic assessment of species-level antibody responses. AVARDA was established using a set of samples from an encephalitis cohort and then applied to a longitudinal type 1 diabetes cohort, as well as a cross-sectional lupus cohort. AVARDA significantly improved the rate of diagnosing viral encephalitis and identified biologically plausible associations between viral responses and these autoimmune diseases.</p>

    <title>Introduction</title>

VirScan provides excellent performance characteristics, but interpretation of assay results has been limited by underdeveloped analytical approaches.</p>
    <p id="para0014">Our previously published approach suffers from three critical limitations. The number of unique, non-overlapping, virus-associated antibody specificities (a measure of response "breadth" or “clonality”) conveys important biological information and determines the confidence of a predicted exposure. Previously, non-overlapping specificities were defined using a rudimentary heuristic that typically underestimated response breadth. Second, a significantly reactive peptide was considered only in the context of the specific virus it was designed to represent. This ignored sequence homology between related viruses, and any potential for antibody cross-reactivity. Further, the VirScan library was designed to cover single representative proteins from UniProt clusters of 90% identity. Relying solely upon the intended viral representations of reactive peptides to diagnose infections will therefore result in both false negative results (“missing” proteins from highly similar organisms) and false positive results (reactivity due to unappreciated cross-reactive antibodies). Third, we previously relied on each virus's proteome “size” to establish virus-specific thresholds for seropositivity. This approach ignored the proportional representation of each virus within the reactive set of peptides and the overall representation of each virus in the library. Additionally, using a binary threshold for seropositivity is far less informative than a probabilistic assessment of a viral infection.</p>
    <p id="para0015">Here we introduce the AntiViral Antibody Response Deconvolution Algorithm (AVARDA), a systematic framework for probabilistic analysis of highly multiplexed antiviral antibody epitope reactivity data. AVARDA integrates three key modules to generate a conservative and probabilistic assessment of antibody responses. The first module uses sequence alignment to define each reactive peptide's relationship to a comprehensive database of all human viral genomes, which have been translated in all six reading frames. This permits a conservative elaboration of all peptide reactivities that could be associated with each potential viral infection. The second module constructs a sequence homology-based network graph for each virus's reactive peptides, so as to define the minimum number of independent specificities (response breadth) required to produce the graph. The third module iteratively assigns each peptide to its most likely associated viral infection(s), according to a null model that considers the overall representation of each virus in the VirScan library. We permit individual peptides to be associated with multiple distinct infections, provided there is sufficient evidence for each viral infection on its own (i.e. in the absence of the shared peptides). AVARDA also indicates uncertainty in peptide-virus assignments when there is insufficient evidence to discriminate between infections by related viruses, but when there is sufficient evidence to conclude that an infection has indeed occurred. Linking these modules, the final output of AVARDA provides p-values adjusted for multiple hypothesis testing for exposure to each virus, along with the associated breadths of the antibody responses and the relationships between the reactive peptides.</p>
    <p id="para0016">The utility of antibody-based diagnostics has been constrained by an inability to robustly discriminate among infections by closely related viruses.<xref rid="bib0010" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> Highly multiplexed analyses of antiviral antibodies provides the potential to distinguish among related viruses, but requires a robust consideration of cross-reactivities. Quantifying an individual's change in IgG specificities over time can provide clear evidence for an evolving immune response to a single virus. We have therefore developed and tested the AVARDA algorithm using acute and convalescent VirScan data from patients with viral encephalitis. The predictions of the algorithm were found to agree with clinical nucleic acid or serologic testing in the majority of cases. Utilizing VirScan/AVARDA analysis in conjunction with traditional nucleic acid testing resulted in a 44% increase in the diagnosis of viral encephalitis. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of AVARDA for investigating the association of viral infections with development of autoimmune type 1 diabetes (T1D) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).</p>

The SNIP study aims to describe the epidemiology of CNS infections in Singapore; improve the diagnosis of etiologies of CNS infections through a systematic clinical, laboratory and neuroradiological evaluation and extensive diagnostic testing; evaluate the prognosis, long-term outcomes and socio-economic costs of CNS infections; and establish an archive of biological tissues from patients with encephalitis and CNS infections that can be utilized for future testing for emerging pathogens or non-infectious etiologies.</p>
        <p id="para0018">Subjects were enrolled from 6 hospitals in Singapore (Singapore General Hospital, Tan Tock Seng Hospital, National University Health System, Changi General Hospital, Khoo Teck Puat Hospital, Kandang Kerbau Hospital). Individuals, both male and female, more than one month of age, were enrolled upon admission to the hospital with clinical suspicion for CNS infections, or one or more of the following: fever or history of fever (≥ 38 °C) during the presenting illness; seizures; focal neurological deficits; CSF white cell count pleocytosis (&gt; 4 WBC/ µL); abnormal neuroimaging suggestive of CNS infection; abnormal electroencephalogram suggestive of CNS infection; depressed or altered level of consciousness, or no alternative etiology for acute paralysis identified. Patients with indwelling ventricular devices such as EVD and ventriculo-peritoneal shunts were excluded from the study. Blood samples were be obtained on enrollment into the study and then at 2 weeks after enrollment or at time of discharge. Informed consent was obtained from all patients.</p>

Robust regression of the top 1000, by abundance, Day 1 read counts was used to calculate the ‘expected’ Day 14 read counts.

Peptides were grouped in bins and a standard deviation was calculated between all peptides in each bin. From these binned standard deviations, a linear regression was developed and used to assign each peptide an expected standard deviation. Each peptide's residual was normalized to its expected standard deviation, in order to calculate a 'pairwise z-score'; z-scores &gt; 10 were considered differentially reactive.

Viruses with less than three reactive evidence peptide alignments are assumed insignificant. Evidence alignments are defined as bit score alignments ≥ 80, an adjustable user-defined threshold. As the bit score threshold is increased, fewer peptides are considered evidence for a given virus, reducing sensitivity but increasing specificity.

        <title>Viral comparisons, shared alignment removal, and indistinguishability tags</title>
        <p id="para0028">N is first initialized to the number of reactive, independent peptides. All viruses are then ranked in order of significance based on binomial testing of each virus's reactive evidence peptide alignments as described in Module 2. Next, the most significant, "index" virus is compared to every other virus which shares peptide alignments as described in Module 3. In these comparisons, if either virus is found to have a statistically significant number of non-shared peptides while the other does not, the shared alignments are removed from the latter virus (case i in <xref rid="fig0002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref><bold>c</bold>). If both viruses are found to have statistically significant numbers of non-shared peptides, the shared alignments remain associated with both viruses, thus contributing to the significance of both infections (case <bold>ii</bold> in <xref rid="fig0002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref><bold>c</bold>). If neither virus is found to have a statistically significant number of non-shared peptides, binomial testing is performed on non-shared and shared peptides to determine whether there is sufficient evidence for infection by at least one of the two viruses. If the viruses have a significant number of shared alignments, a numerical “indistinguishability tag” is annotated to the results to indicate that the algorithm was unable to accurately distinguish between infection by one or both of the viruses (case <bold>iii</bold> in <xref rid="fig0002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref><bold>c</bold>). Once the pairwise comparisons with the most significant virus have been completed, the index virus is then removed from consideration and N is decreased by the number of peptides that were uniquely assigned to the index virus. This procedure of updating N thus removes peptides associated with significant infections from consideration in subsequent tests of peptides using the null model. The <italic>p</italic>-values for each remaining virus are recalculated, and the new top ranking index virus<sub>k</sub> is selected for the next round of comparisons until all virus<sub>k,m</sub> pairs have been evaluated. Finally, all p-values are adjusted for multiple hypothesis testing using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure considering all infections. Ancillary relevant data are also printed to file.</p>

We detected sequences from 99.7% of the 106,678 unique clones in the VirScan library, and found they were drawn from a relatively uniform distribution (Figure S1). We performed VirScan analysis on paired serum samples from an encephalitis cohort, collected at hospital admission and fourteen days later. To quantify changes in the antiviral antibody repertoire over time, we utilized a pairwise z-score based approach (Methods). Changes in antibody binding over time were considered significant when the day 0 versus day 14 pairwise z-scores were greater than 10. <xref rid="fig0001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref><bold>a</bold> shows the results of one patient's (Pt1) pairwise VirScan analysis.

      <p id="para0032">In previous studies, each VirScan peptide has been defined simply by the specific viral protein it was intended to represent. However, in order to exhaustively consider sequence similarity and thus potential for antibody cross reactivity, we have constructed a comprehensive genomic database of all known human viral species. To exclude any potential open reading frame annotation bias, all VirScan peptide sequences were aligned via tblastn against a protein sequence database formed by translating these viral genomes in all 6 reading frames.<xref rid="bib0021" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref> The relationship of all VirScan peptides to all human viruses can thus be represented as a matrix of alignment scores. This alignment score matrix naturally features a broad distribution of alignment strengths. Here, we dichotomize alignments by a bit score threshold of 80, considering alignments greater than 80 to be potential “evidence” for an infection, while alignments below 80 are considered potentially “cross-reactive” alignments. Evidence peptides can be used in support of an infection, whereas cross-reactive alignments can be used in support of a “false positive” reactivity. <xref rid="fig0001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref><bold>b</bold> compares the number of total alignments versus evidence alignments to each virus associated with at least 3 reactive peptides.

      <title>Module 3: deconvoluting viral reactivity profiles</title>
      <p id="para0036">Conceptually, by associating all reactive peptides with all possible viral infections, Module 2 increases the sensitivity, but decreases the specificity of the VirScan assay. Module 3 therefore seeks to weigh the evidence for each infection on its own, given the relationship of all evidence peptides to all viruses. The most significant virus (‘virus<sub>k</sub>’), as determined by Module 2, is iteratively compared with viruses that share peptide alignments (‘virus<sub>m</sub>’); viruses must have at least 3 reactive independent evidence peptides to be evaluated. Peptides are considered as either shared or non-shared: shared peptides align to both virus<sub>k</sub> and virus<sub>m</sub> and non-shared peptides align exclusively to either virus. Peptides that are cross-reactive for one virus and evidence for the other are considered shared. Detailed in the Methods, the non-shared peptides in a given virus<sub>k</sub>-virus<sub>m</sub> comparison are first evaluated for significance using a binomial test.</p>

In this case, the peptides aligning to both viruses are no longer associated with virus<sub>m</sub>. In scenario <bold>ii</bold>, the number of non-shared evidence peptides are significant for both viruses, suggesting that the observed reactivities can be attributed to infections by both virus<sub>k</sub> and virus<sub>m</sub>. In this case, we allow the shared evidence peptides to serve as evidence for each infection separately. In scenario <bold>iii</bold>, the number of shared evidence peptides is significant, but the number of non-shared evidence peptides associated with either virus alone is not significant. In this scenario we assume the reactivities are most likely due to an infection with at least one of the two viruses, but there is insufficient evidence to distinguish an infection from <italic>either one</italic> or <italic>both</italic> viruses. Both viruses are therefore assigned a unique numeric tag to indicate that their potential infections could not be distinguished. After the probabilistic assessment of virus<sub>k</sub>’s shared peptide-virus associations, all peptides associated exclusively with virus<sub>k</sub> are removed from further consideration. Module 2 is called again to provide updated p-values for each remaining virus, and the process is repeated until all virus pairs with shared peptide alignments have been analyzed.

Closer investigation of Pt5’s clinical history revealed previous Ganciclovir treatment for CMV infection, suggesting a long-term prior infection.

      <p id="para0040">Single timepoint AVARDA analyses (Table S1) and clinical antibody testing both detected high but unchanging HSV and enterovirus specific IgG levels in Pt10 and Pt11, respectively. This suggests that either (i) these were chronic or prior infections potentially unrelated to their encephalitis, (ii) these patients’ initial sera were collected too late in the course of their illness to see longitudinal antibody changes, or (iii) VirScan did not detect the changing antibody specificities/titers. Clinical antibody testing detected increasing VZV-specific IgG levels in Pt13, which was not detected by AVARDA using longitudinal analysis; however, AVARDA using single timepoint analysis did detect VZV reactivity at both timepoints for Pt12 and Pt13 (in both cases a small number of additional reactivities were detected at the second time point). Pt13’s longitudinal VirScan results revealed several VZV aligning peptides that appeared to be increasingly reactive over time, but the changes were below our threshold. This finding indicates that our default threshold may be too stringent in some cases. In individuals with undiagnosed encephalitis, AVARDA detected infections with HPIV3 (Pt4), CMV (Pt6), and Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV, Pt8 and Pt9). Confirmatory clinical serology detected increasing viral IgG for two of these cases (CMV for Pt6 and EBV for Pt8). We were unable to conduct clinical antibody tests for Pt4, Pt9 and Pt11, due to insufficient remaining serum volume. Overall, AVARDA analyses of longitudinal VirScan data were largely concordant with clinical test results. AVARDA analyses of single timepoint VirScan data may provide additional information in some cases, but doesn't distinguish active from latent or historic infections.</p>

    <title>Discussion</title>
    <p id="para0045">The diagnostic and epidemiologic utility of antibody analyses has been limited in large part due to the difficulty in accounting for antibody cross reactivities among closely related organisms.<xref rid="bib0010" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> Coupling of pan-viral peptide level profiling technologies with an analytical framework that systematically accounts for cross reactivity can therefore expand the utility of serologic profiling. Our current study has demonstrated that AVARDA can be used to accurately deconvolute unbiased VirScan data.</p>
    <p id="para0046">We have examined the performance of AVARDA in diagnosing viral encephalitis, a setting in which it is often challenging, yet critical, to distinguish infectious from autoimmune etiologies.<xref rid="bib0028" ref-type="bibr"><sup>28</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib0029" ref-type="bibr"><sup>29</sup></xref> As such, pan-viral IgG analysis may provide information complementary to nucleic acid testing, thus improving diagnostic sensitivity for low abundance or unexpected viruses, and for distinguishing active from latent infections. These analyses can also identify peptide reactivities that improve the performance of traditional serological testing formats. In this study, combining VirScan/AVARDA analysis with traditional diagnostic methods increased the rate of diagnosis by 44.4%. Pan-viral IgM analyses, while not explored here, may also be informative in differentiating acute from chronic infections, without the need for pairwise comparisons. Like any antibody test, however, VirScan/AVARDA still requires the development of an adaptive immune response, which takes valuable time and may not occur in patients with suppressed immune systems. Furthermore, AVARDA only interprets antibody reactivities identified by VirScan and, as such, cannot detect antibodies targeting viruses absent from the VirScan library and may be less sensitive in detecting antibodies targeting viruses that tend to elicit antibodies primarily to conformational epitopes.</p>
    <p id="para0047">We have additionally explored the utility of using AVARDA to link viral infections with two autoimmune diseases, T1D and in lupus. In both cases, AVARDA identified a set of viral associations that expand upon prior studies. Our key findings were related to antibody breadths, which reflect the polyclonality – and thus the robustness–of the immune response. Enhanced polyclonality could reflect elevated antigenic exposure (due to increased viral load or persistence) or rather a more intense inflammatory milieu. Adaptation of the maximal vertex set to antibody clonality thus provides a powerful summary statistic for epidemiological studies.</p>
    <p id="para0048">We propose four general areas in which future iterations of AVARDA could more effectively incorporate VirScan information. First, peptides reactive above a threshold are considered binary hits. If the contribution of each peptide to the final results were to be weighted according to the magnitude of its reactivity score, the confidence of the associated infection(s) could potentially be calculated more accurately. Second, reactive sets of peptides that share sequence homology are currently treated as a single independent data point. However, the confidence associated with the reactivity of related peptides is, conceptually, higher than for single peptides reactive in isolation. If Module 2 attributed greater confidence to these peptide clusters, the sensitivity of AVARDA may be increased. Third, it may be possible to develop a statistical test that can distinguish among infections which are currently found to be indistinguishable by AVARDA. One can envision pairwise comparisons of homologous peptides that might discern the more likely of two highly related species (or even strains), when there is a consistent preference for antibody recognition of one organism's peptides over those of another. If such an approach were successful, it would enable expanding the taxonomic reference database beyond the virus species level, potentially enhancing the specificity of AVARDA. Even at the species level, AVARDA frequently cannot distinguish highly interrelated viruses, particularly enteroviruses and adenoviruses in our experience. Finally, it may be possible to utilize structural similarity, rather than sequence-based alignment, for associating peptides with viruses and identifying potential cross-reactive epitopes. Recent advances in protein folding may soon make such an approach computationally tractable.<xref rid="bib0035" ref-type="bibr"><sup>35</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib0036" ref-type="bibr"><sup>36</sup></xref> We expect that these, and other iterations not contemplated here, will enhance the performance of future versions of AVARDA.</p>
    <p id="para0049">The conceptual paradigm underlying AVARDA may find applications beyond analysis of species-level VirScan data. For example, AVARDA could be adapted to data from a library focused on multiple strains of a specific virus, potentially considering differential strengths of reactivity to strain-defining variant peptides. In any study involving library redundancy and potential antibody cross reactivity, any or all of AVARDA's modules may enable deconvolution of the data. For instance, libraries of bacterial, parasitic, or fungal pathogen peptidomes may be analyzed analogously to VirScan data. Additionally, incorporating the conceptual framework of AVARDA into the design of peptide libraries may enhance their ultimate discriminatory power. Beyond peptide library screening, full-length protein library screening (e.g., via protein microarrays, PLATO, MIPSA etc.) may also benefit from AVARDA's consideration of shared sequences and potential cross-reactivity.</p>
    <p id="para0050">PhIP-Seq analysis of the human proteome is often performed in conjunction with VirScan. In the setting of undiagnosed encephalitis, for example, a combined human proteomic and pan-viral analysis could prove particularly informative. Bayesian interpretation of the joint data sets could potentially be performed under an assumption of either autoimmunity or infection, which may further improve diagnostic sensitivity. Viral infections associated with specific autoantibody reactivities may also be readily detected in longitudinal and cross-sectional studies. AVARDA is therefore an important new tool for linking human health with environmental exposures in a variety of settings.</p>
