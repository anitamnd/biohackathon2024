      <p>The LOMETS2 server (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://zhanglab.ccmb.med.umich.edu/LOMETS/">https://zhanglab.ccmb.med.umich.edu/LOMETS/</ext-link>) is an online meta-threading server system for template-based protein structure prediction. Although the server has been widely used by the community over the last decade, the previous LOMETS server no longer represents the state-of-the-art due to aging of the algorithms and unsatisfactory performance on distant-homology template identification. An extension of the server built on cutting-edge methods, especially techniques developed since the recent CASP experiments, is urgently needed. In this work, we report the recent advancements of the LOMETS2 server, which comprise a number of major new developments, including (i) new state-of-the-art threading programs, including contact-map-based threading approaches, (ii) deep sequence search-based sequence profile construction and (iii) a new web interface design that incorporates structure-based function annotations. Large-scale benchmark tests demonstrated that the integration of the deep profiles and new threading approaches into LOMETS2 significantly improve its structure modeling quality and template detection, where LOMETS2 detected 176% more templates with TM-scores &gt;0.5 than the previous LOMETS server for Hard targets that lacked homologous templates. Meanwhile, the newly incorporated structure-based function prediction helps extend the usefulness of the online server to the broader biological community.</p>

    <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
    <p>Template-based modeling (TBM) represents the most accurate and reliable approach to protein structure prediction. The core procedure of TBM is fold-recognition, also known as threading, which aims to identify correct templates from the PDB with similar folds to the target protein and correctly align the target and template sequences. There is evidence that indicates the structural space of the current PDB library is complete and that TBM can be used to solve the protein structure prediction problem, at least for single-domain proteins (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). In reality, however, identification of ideal templates with correct alignments remains a major challenge, especially for protein targets that have no closely homologous templates in the PDB (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). To address this challenge, a large variety of threading methods have been developed over the last two decades based on various scoring functions and alignment algorithms (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4–12</xref>). Because each threading algorithm has its own inherent advantages and disadvantages, there is no method that outperforms all others for every target protein (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Thus, to improve the quality and reliability of TBM, several meta-server approaches were developed to combine threading results from multiple complementary algorithms (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15–17</xref>). Early attempts at developing meta-threading-webservers, such as 3D-jury (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>), submitted prediction jobs to different online servers and then combined the output results from each server after-the-fact. Such dependency on external online servers made these meta-servers difficult to maintain, especially when the external servers updated their APIs or stopped operating.</p>
    <p>To improve the reliability of the meta-threading approach, we proposed LOMETS (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>) which combined 9 locally-installed threading programs for protein structure prediction. Due to the robustness of the server's operation and the advantages associated with combining the results of multiple complementary algorithms over individual threading programs for fold-recognition, LOMETS has been one of the most widely used meta-threading servers for protein structure prediction. Since its initial release in 2007, LOMETS has generated fold-recognition and full-length structure modeling for more than 30,000 protein sequences submitted by 15,201 users. With rapid developments in the field, however, the previous LOMETS server no longer represents the state-of-the-art in protein threading. In particular, the recent CASP experiments (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>) have witnessed significant new progress in TBM, where contact-maps predicted through deep neural-network training, in conjunction with metagenomic sequencing, have been found to be vitally useful for modeling distant- and non-homologous protein sequences. Thus, integration of the new threading methods and sequence and structural data resources is urgently needed to further improve the quality of the meta-threading approach. This is the major motivation for the development of the second generation meta-threading server, LOMETS2, in this work.</p>
    <p>Compared to the previous LOMETS server, LOMETS2 introduces three major new extensions: (i) the server now integrates a new and more comprehensive set of state-of-the-art threading programs, including contact-guided threading approaches; (ii) it utilizes deep profiles which are generated using a novel deep Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA) construction method to improve the profile-based alignment accuracy; (iii) it adopts a re-designed, user-friendly interface and adds structure-based function annotations for a more comprehensive results report. The benchmark tests demonstrated that the LOMETS2 structure model quality is significantly better than any of its component threading programs as well as the previous meta-threading approach, LOMETS (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>).</p>

      <title>Overview of the LOMETS2 pipeline</title>
      <p>The LOMETS2 server pipeline consists of four consecutive steps: generation of deep sequence profiles, fold-recognition through its component threading programs, template alignment selection, and full-length model construction (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Starting from a target protein sequence provided by the server user, a deep MSA is generated by iterative sequence homology searches against multiple sequence databases. The resulting deep MSA is used to calculate deep profiles in the form of sequence profiles (or position-specific scoring matrices) and profile Hidden Markov Models (HMMs). The deep profiles are then used by the 11 LOMETS2 threading programs, which are all locally installed on our computer cluster, to identify template structures from the template library, where deep profiles are pre-built for each template. Next, 220 templates (the top 20 templates per program) are combined to give the final LOMETS2 threading results. These 220 templates are ranked by a scoring function that integrates Z-score, confidence score for each method, and sequence identity between the identified templates and query sequence (see the detailed description in Text S1 in the Supporting Information, SI). Meanwhile, the function annotations associated with each template are collected from the BioLiP structure-function database (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). Finally, full-length models are constructed by MODELLER (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>) utilizing the multiple distance restraints collected from the top-ranked templates identified by LOMETS2.</p>

      <sec id="SEC2-2-1">
        <title>DeepMSA method</title>
        <p>The profiles (sequence profiles or profile HMMs), which are derived from MSAs for the query/template sequences, are one of the most important features for template recognition and threading-based sequence alignment. General MSA generation methods, such as PSI-BLAST (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>) and HHblits (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>), sometimes cannot collect a sufficient number of homologs in an MSA, especially for Hard targets, which can result in poor alignment quality when using profile-based threading algorithms. LOMETS2 employs a new composite approach, called DeepMSA, to create sensitive MSAs with higher numbers of diverse sequences than general MSA generation methods.</p>
        <p>Starting from a query sequence, a deep MSA is generated by a three stage procedure (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S1</xref>). In Stage 1, HHblits from the HH-Suite package is used to search the query against UniClust30 (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>) to generate the first-level MSA. If the number of effective sequences (<italic>Neff</italic>, defined in Text S2) generated by Stage 1 is &lt;128, Stage 2 will be performed. In Stage 2, Jackhmmer from the HMMER package (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>) is used to search the query sequence against UniRef90 (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>) to extract full-length sequences (hits). These hits are then converted into a custom HHblits-formatted database. Jump-starting it from the first-level MSA, HHblits is again applied to search this custom database to generate the second-level MSA. If the <italic>Neff</italic> of the second-level MSA is still &lt;128, Stage 3 will be performed, where the second-level MSA is converted into a profile HMM by HMMbuild from the HMMER package. This HMM is then searched against the Metaclust (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>) metagenome sequence database by HMMsearch from HMMER to extract full-length hits. Similar to Stage 2, hits from HMMsearch are built into a custom HHblits database. The second-level MSA is used to jump-start an HHblits search against this new custom HHblits database to get the third-level MSA. Using these three Stages, we generate deep MSAs, which in turn are utilized to build the final sequence profiles used by each of the LOMETS2 threading methods.</p>

      <sec id="SEC2-2-2">
        <title>New threading methods</title>
        <p>The LOMETS2 server integrates predictions from 11 different state-of-the-art threading algorithms, which can be classified into three types: the contact-based method CEthreader; sequence profile-based methods, including FFAS3D (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>), MUSTER (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>), Neff-MUSTER, PPAS (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>), PROSPECT2 (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>), SP3 (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>) and SparksX (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>); and profile HMM-based methods, consisting of HHsearch (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>), HHpred (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>) and PRC (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). Among them, CEthreader, FFAS3D, HHpred, MUSTER, Neff-MUSTER and SparksX are newly added to the LOMETS2 server. HHpred is a profile HMM-based threading method extended from HHsearch. SparksX and FFAS3D are both based on profile-profile comparison and use similar features, but FFAS3D employs a template re-ranking strategy. MUSTER, Neff-MUSTER and CEthreader are our in-house threading programs. MUSTER and Neff-MUSTER are profile-profile alignment algorithms that use dynamic programming together with a myriad of features, including sequence profiles, secondary structures, structure fragment profiles, solvent accessibility, dihedral torsional angles, and hydrophobic scoring matrices for fold-recognition. The major difference between MUSTER and Neff-MUSTER is that MUSTER uses a set of fixed weights for the sequence profile term while Neff-MUSTER employs dynamic weights derived from the <italic>Neff</italic> of the MSA used to build the sequence profile. Lastly, CEthreader is a contact-driven threading method, which first predicts the contact-map for a query sequence using our in-house, deep learning-based contact-map prediction method, ResPRE (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>) (see Text S3). From the predicted contact-map, CEthreader generates single-body contact eigenvectors through the eigen-decomposition technique, and finally searches and aligns the query to templates using dynamic programming based on the contact eigenvectors as well as secondary structure and sequence profile comparison (see Text S4). A more detailed description for each of the 11 LOMETS2 threading methods is provided in Text S5.</p>

      <sec id="SEC2-2-3">
        <title>A unified deep profile-based template library</title>
        <p>In the previous version of the LOMETS server, the template libraries were collected from the original developers of each individual threading program, which negatively impacted its performance since some libraries were not comprehensive or were not updated regularly. In LOMETS2, a unified library of non-redundant protein structure templates is regularly collected for each of the threading methods. This library currently consists of 71 684 structures with a pair-wise sequence identity &lt;70%. In addition to the structures and structure-based feature files, the DeepMSA program is used to create MSAs and then pre-build the deep sequence profiles and deep profile HMMs for each template. The library is updated weekly in accordance with the update cycle of the PDB database and has been made publicly available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://zhanglab.ccmb.med.umich.edu/library/">https://zhanglab.ccmb.med.umich.edu/library/</ext-link>.</p>

      <sec id="SEC2-2-4">
        <title>Re-designed server output</title>
        <p>The output page of the LOMETS2 server was re-designed to make the server more convenient to use and to incorporate more comprehensive function annotations. The 3Dmol (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>) applet is used to visualize the modeled structures. Moreover, we added function annotations derived from threading templates, including Gene Ontology (GO) terms for Molecular Function (MF), Biological Process (BP) and Cellular Component (CC) as well as the Enzyme Commission (EC) numbers.</p>

      <p>To test the LOMETS2 server, we constructed a non-redundant benchmark set of 614 proteins from the PDB with pairwise sequence identities &lt;30%.

To make it relevant to TBM, each target protein was required to have at least one template with sequence identity &lt;30% and TM-score &gt;0.5 to the target as identified by TM-align structural alignment searches through the template library (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). Based on LOMETS classification, which categorizes proteins into different classes based on the significance scores of multiple threading programs, this dataset contained 403 Easy targets (for which at least one threading program in LOMETS detected a significant template hit) and 211 Hard targets (for which no program in LOMETS identified a significant hit). To remove bias caused by homologous sequences, a uniform sequence identity cutoff of &lt;30% between the target and template sequences was enforced when the threading tests were conducted for each of the programs.</p>

      <title>Overall comparison between LOMETS and LOMETS2</title>
      <p>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref> presents a head-to-head comparison between the TM-scores of the first templates identified by LOMETS and those identified by LOMETS2. The average TM-scores for the first templates identified by LOMETS2 for All, Easy and Hard targets were 0.62, 0.71 and 0.46, respectively, which were 9%, 4% and 31% higher than those identified by LOMETS. Out of the 614 targets, LOMETS2 successfully detected correct templates with a TM-score &gt;0.5 for 479 targets, which was 17% higher than the number of targets with correct templates identified by LOMETS. For Hard targets in particular, LOMETS2 detected correct templates for 94 targets, while LOMETS only successfully detected correct templates for 34 targets. In Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>, we show a comparison between the average TM-scores for the full-length models constructed by MODELLER based on templates identified by either LOMETS or LOMETS2. The average TM-scores of the first models generated by LOMETS2 for All, Easy and Hard targets were 11%, 5% and 35% higher than those by LOMETS.</p>

      <title>Why does LOMETS2 outperform LOMETS?</title>
      <p>The data in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> demonstrates that LOMETS2 significantly outperforms LOMETS in terms of identifying higher quality templates and generating better full-length models, especially for Hard targets that lack homologous templates. This improvement can be mainly attributed to three new developments in LOMETS2. First, the newly developed DeepMSA program detects more homologous sequences compared to traditional methods, thereby improving the accuracy of profile-based alignment algorithms. In <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S2</xref>, we list a comparison between the number of effective sequences detected by DeepMSA for the 614 targets versus the numbers detected by PSI-BLAST and HHblits, where the latter (PSI-BLAST and HHblits) were used as the default profile construction methods for the previous threading programs in LOMETS. On average, DeepMSA detected 6,500 sequences per protein (or <italic>Neff</italic> = 307), which is 8 (or 5) times higher than the number detected by HHblits and 10 (or 9) fold higher than the number identified by PSI-BLAST. In Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, we present a comparison of the performance of each individual threading program using either the deep or default profiles, where the performance is improved by deep profiles for all threading programs. The specific TM-score values for each threading program are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S1</xref> in the SI, which shows that the improvements are statistically significant (with <italic>P</italic>-values &lt; <inline-formula><tex-math id="M4">\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

Since the only difference between the two sets of programs was the sequence and HHM profiles that were used, the data demonstrates that the deep MSA generation method has a remarkable impact on improving the performance of nearly all individual methods as well as the overall meta-threading approach.</p>

        <graphic xlink:href="gkz384fig3"/>
      </fig>
      <p>Second, the introduction of the new threading programs improves the overall quality of the LOMETS2 server results. In total, six new programs (CEthreader, HHpred, SparksX, FFAS3D, MUSTER and Neff-MUSTER) were added to LOMETS2 and four programs were retired due to poor performance. As shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>, all of the new programs performed better, in terms of average template TM-score, than the ones inherited from the LOMETS server. In particular, the new CEthreader program identified templates with the highest TM-scores and detected more correct templates than any other threading program. Due to the utilization of <italic>de novo</italic> contact-map prediction, CEthreader is especially useful for Hard targets that lack homologous templates. This is demonstrated by the fact that the average TM-score of the first templates identified by CEthreader for Hard targets was at least 19% higher than any other LOMETS2 threading program, including the best sequence profile-based method SparksX (average TM-score = 0.378) and the best profile HMM-based method HHpred (average TM-score = 0.374). Meanwhile, the number of targets for which CEthreader identified correct first templates (TM-score &gt; 0.5) was 61% and 74% more than the number of targets for SparksX and HHpred, respectively. The integration of the contact-guided threading method is particularly important for improving the overall ability of LOMETS2 to recognize distant-homology templates.</p>
      <p>Finally, the new template-ranking score, which combines <italic>Z</italic>-score, program-specific confidence scores and sequence identity (Eq. S2 in Text S1), helps to select correct templates. Although CEthreader significantly outperforms other individual programs, on average, the LOMETS2 meta-server strategy still selects templates with higher TM-scores than any of its individual programs, including CEthreader. In <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S2</xref>, we list the average TM-scores for the first full-length models constructed by MODELLER using templates from different threading programs, where the average TM-score for LOMETS2 (TM-score = 0.6753) was 5.7% higher than its best threading program, CEtheader (TM-score = 0.6391), with a <italic>P</italic>-value of <inline-formula><tex-math id="M5">\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

\usepackage{mathrsfs}
\setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}
\begin{document}
}{}$2.9\ \times {10^{ - 61}}$\end{document}</tex-math></inline-formula>. This demonstrates the efficacy of the composite ranking score for template selection. Here, we note that the difference in performance between LOMETS2 and its best component program is more pronounced for full-length model production (shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S2</xref>) than for raw template selection/alignment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>). This is because LOMETS2 ranks the templates from CEthreader as first in most cases due to the high confidence score given to the CEthreader program, which results in a modest difference between LOMETS2 and CEthreader when only considering the TM-scores of the first template alignments. For the full-length model construction, however, the consensus distance restraints collected from multiple complementary template alignments from different threading programs help MODELLER construct much more reliable full-length models than those produced by the restraints from individual threading programs; the use of such complementarity of different threading algorithms represents one of the major advantages of the meta-server approach (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>).</p>

      <title>Performance on recent Critical Assessment of Structure Prediction (CASP) experiments</title>
      <p>The community-wide CASP experiments provide a unique opportunity to stringently test structure prediction methodologies (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). A preliminary version of LOMETS2 (without deep profiles) was used as the template identification component of the ‘Zhang-Server’ and ‘QUARK’ groups, which were ranked as the top two structure prediction algorithms in the automated Server Section in CASP13 in terms of the <italic>Z</italic>-score of the GDT-TS score (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.predictioncenter.org/casp13/zscores_final.cgi?model_type=first&amp;gr_type=server_only">http://www.predictioncenter.org/casp13/zscores_final.cgi?model_type=first&amp;gr_type=server_only</ext-link>). However, LOMETS2 did not participate in the CASP experiment as an independent server.</p>
      <p>To examine its performance, we ran the LOMETS2 program (with deep profiles) for the CASP13 targets, where all templates released after May 1, 2018 were excluded. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S3</xref> lists the average TM-score of the new LOMETS2 models for the 121 released domains, in comparison to the top server groups in CASP13. Overall, LOMETS2 ranked No. 4, following ‘Zhang-Server’ and ‘QUARK’, which used LOMETS2 templates as input templates, and ‘RaptorX-DeepModeller’. ‘RaptorX-DeepModeller’ is an integration of two pipelines, namely, ‘RaptorX-TBM’, which generates models using a distance-guided threading program DeepThreader (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>), and ‘RaptorX-Contact’, which is a distance-based <italic>ab initio</italic> folding method (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). In <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S4</xref>, we show a head-to-head comparison between models produced by LOMETS2, RaptorX-TBM and CEthreader for the 121 CASP13 domains. While LOMETS2 showed an overall comparable performance with RaptorX-TBM, RaptorX-TBM outperformed CEthreader; this latter difference probably reflects the advantage of distance over contact prediction for the improvement of threading performance. Additionally, RaptorX-TBM uses a combination of MODELLER and Rosetta for full-length model construction, while CEthreader and LOMETS2 only use MODELLER here.</p>
      <p>In <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S3</xref>, we further present a comparison of the models produced by LOMETS2 and its component threading programs for the 121 CASP13 domains. While CEthreader again outperformed other individual programs, LOMETS2 had a significantly higher TM-score than all of its component threading programs, with <italic>P</italic>-values &lt;10<sup>−6</sup> for all the TM-score differences. This result is consistent with the large-scale benchmark tests shown above (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>) and demonstrates the robustness and effectiveness of LOMETS2 for template identification and model construction.</p>

      <title>Server input</title>
      <p>The input to the LOMETS2 server is a single-chain amino acid sequence file in FASTA format. After submitting a job, a URL link with a random job ID is generated which allows the user to view the results while maintaining the user's data privacy. The user can optionally provide an email address and LOMETS2 will automatically send a notification email with a link to the results page upon job completion. This email address can also be used to retrieve the list of all previously submitted jobs by the user through <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://zhanglab.ccmb.med.umich.edu/LOMETS2/check.html">https://zhanglab.ccmb.med.umich.edu/LOMETS2/check.html</ext-link>. Users will usually receive the prediction results in less than 24 h after submitting a sequence (protein size ≤ 1500 AA). However, the running time depends on the protein size, where a smaller protein takes less time than a larger protein. Additionally, if too many sequences are accumulated in the queue, the procedure may take a longer time (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S5</xref> for the practical response time of the LOMETS2 server for 1,433 recently processed jobs).

    <title>CONCLUSION</title>
    <p>In this work, we report a significantly extended version of the LOMETS server for template-based protein structure prediction and function annotation. The new LOMETS2 server contains 11 state-of-the-art threading programs, which are powered by a new deep MSA pipeline for enhanced profile- and HMM-based template alignment. To provide a solid foundation for template-based modeling, a unified template library has been developed which helps facilitate the maintenance and upkeep of the library for all component threading methods. Meanwhile, the output interface was re-designed to enable interactive visualization of the structure models and function annotations.</p>
    <p>The large-scale benchmark tests showed that the new developments significantly improve the accuracy of the meta-threading server, especially for Hard targets that lack homologous templates, where LOMETS2 detected 176% more templates with correct folds (TM-score &gt; 0.5) (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>) than LOMETS. Detailed data analyses showed these improvements are mainly due to the integration of the new cutting-edge threading algorithms, including those that incorporate deep convolutional network-based contact-map predictions. Meanwhile, the deep MSA-based profiles systematically improve the alignment accuracy for nearly all of the component threading algorithms.</p>
    <p>The LOMETS2 server indirectly participated in the CASP experiment as it was used as the template identification component of the top-ranking ‘Zhang-Server’ and ‘QUARK’ groups in the Server Section of the most recent CASP13 experiment. Although LOMETS2 represents one of the most accurate servers for structure prediction, it is still outperformed by I-TASSER and QUARK, which implement far more intensive structure assembly simulations. Nevertheless, LOMETS2 has unique value to serve as a robust resource for entry-level template recognition and template-based function annotation with reasonable modeling accuracy; this is particularly important for large-scale structure and function modeling for which folding and refinement simulations are prohibitively expensive. Moreover, based on the feedback from our server system users, many biological users are interested in knowing the original templates used to construct the final structural models. This knowledge is often useful in order to better interpret and understand the characteristics and functional implications of the structural models. The detailed template information is typically lost in the composite models produced by I-TASSER and QUARK, but is well-preserved in the LOMETS server models and the output data, which include the rich functional annotations for the templates and multiple template alignments from the different threading programs. Overall, with constant effort on the development and extension of the methodology, we expect LOMETS2 will continue to serve as an important, unique and reliable structure and function modeling resource for the broader biological community.</p>
