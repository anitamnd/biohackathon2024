      <p>As long as the structural
study of molecular mechanisms requires
multiple molecular dynamics reflecting contrasted bioactive states,
the subsequent analysis of molecular interaction networks remains
a bottleneck to be fairly treated and requires a user-friendly 3D
view of key interactions. Structural Interaction Network Analysis
Protocols (SINAPs) is a proprietary python tool developed to (i) quickly
solve key interactions able to distinguish two protein states, either
from two sets of molecular dynamics simulations or from two crystallographic
structures, and (ii) render a user-friendly 3D view of these key interactions
through a plugin of UCSF Chimera, one of the most popular open-source
viewing software for biomolecular systems. Through two case studies,
glucose transporter-1 (GLUT-1) and A2A adenosine receptor (A2AR),
SINAPs easily pinpointed key interactions observed experimentally
and relevant for their bioactivities. This very effective tool was
thus applied to identify the amino acids involved in the molecular
enzymatic mechanisms ruling the activation of an immunomodulator drug
candidate, P28 glutathione-S-transferase (P28GST). SINAPs is freely
available at <uri xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://github.com/ParImmune/SINAPs">https://github.com/ParImmune/SINAPs</uri>.</p>

    <title>Introduction</title>
    <p>Molecular
dynamics (MD) simulations are advanced methods for studying
the evolution of a system of particles over time. Applied to biological
macromolecules, these methods allow the study of their functional
mechanism, the binding kinetics of molecular modulators such as small
organic or macromolecular partners, as well as the identification
of new druggable pockets for the discovery of new active compounds
through some computational drug design processes.</p>
    <p>The recording
interval of the frames of MD simulations is a parameter
that must be optimized. A too long interval can lead to missing valuable
information. A too short interval will increase the quality and quantity
of information generated but lead to a drastic increase of the weight
of MD trajectories.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref></sup> As these simulations generate
a huge amount of data, the analysis phase is a bottleneck.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref></sup> The use of several tools is therefore mandatory to optimize the
analysis,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref></sup> seeking, among others, to highlight
differences in the interactions during the simulation.</p>
    <p>Some
tools take as input molecular dynamics trajectories and calculate
the interactions but do not have an adequate display of the results.
This is the case of tools proposed directly with the molecular dynamics
software, such as GROMACS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref></sup> or AMBER via
cpptraj,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref></sup> which propose textual results. The 3D viewer
VMD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref></sup> provides analysis of hydrogen and
ionic bonds over time with the timeline utility but only gives general
statistics in the form of graphs. A third-party plugin called PyContact<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref></sup> improves the flaws of VMD in the calculation
of interactions but does not provide a visual representation either.
RIP-MD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref></sup> displays its results in Cytoscape<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref></sup> but loses the information of the three-dimensional
structure of the protein. MDcons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref></sup> provides
intermolecular contact maps from molecular dynamics trajectories of
protein complexes but does not provide information on intramolecular
interactions. CONAN<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref></sup> produces contact
maps along trajectories as well as visual output through the creation
of heatmap images or animations but without representations of 3D
structures. G_contacts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref></sup> proposes a set-decomposition
algorithm to detect all contacting atoms or residues during MD simulations,
faster than traditional brute-force methods. Finally, NAPS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref></sup> is an online web server that does not perform
molecular interaction networks but centrality-based networks and thus
does not take into account nonbonded interactions.</p>
    <p>Other tools
offer interesting graphical representations but are
not adapted to molecular dynamics trajectories as they only take PDB
structures as input. This is the case of the interaction calculation
tools proposed by the main visualization software such as UCSF Chimera<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref></sup> or PyMOL,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref></sup> or more
specific to ligand–protein interactions such as LigPlot+.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref></sup> In addition, some tools offer a link between
Cytoscape and UCSF Chimera, such as structureViz<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref></sup> and RINspector,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref></sup> but only perform
centrality interaction networks.</p>
    <p>Tools hosted online on web
servers are generally to be avoided,
as they may disappear at any time and may cause privacy issues for
confidential research subjects.</p>
    <p>There is, therefore, no perfect
tool available offline that performs
both analysis and visualization. The SINAPs tool presented in this
paper achieves a balanced compromise. The SINAPs analyzer tool evaluates
the differences in interactions between two molecular systems. Then,
the SINAPs visualization tool provides a simplified visualization
of the results taking into account the structural context through
an extension to the UCSF Chimera visualization software.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref></sup></p>
    <p>To assess its usefulness, SINAPs was applied
to several case studies
covering most of its applications. The first simplest case was to
compare two molecular interaction networks from two crystallographic
structures exhibiting contrasted bioactivities—here, the class-A
A2AR GPCR complexed with agonist or antagonist ligands. The second
more sophisticated case was based on the differential study of two
multiconformational sets, each carried out from MD trajectories of
GLUT-1. In addition, an exploratory study was performed using the
classical MD of a protein drug candidate, P28GST, to assist the study
of its molecular mechanism of action.</p>

      <title>Software Overview</title>
      <p>SINAPs includes
two separate programs
working together. The first component is a Python3 program analyzing
the differences between two interaction networks. It takes as input
two single structures (i.e., PDB crystallographic structures) with
the same number of residues or two multiconformational subsets from
AMBER<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref></sup> and GROMACS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref></sup> MD trajectories (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref></xref>A). A MD trajectory may be divided into several parts to study
the conformational changes occurring during the simulation.</p>

      </fig>
      <p>The software first extracts the two structural templates,
fits
them according to α-trace, and only keeps the backbone atoms
to facilitate the future visualization within UCSF Chimera.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref></sup> Concerning the two multiconformational MD subsets,
the structural templates are by default the first frame of both MD
trajectories. The particularity of multiconformational analysis is
based on the exhaustive exploration of interactions over all trajectory
frames to calculate the frequency of nonbonded interactions formed
over time while allowing precise control of the defined parameters
of each type of interaction.</p>
      <p>SINAPs’ default settings
have been set from the literature,
but the distance and angle criteria are easily editable. Detection
of hydrogen bonds is computed from a native pytraj function, search_hbonds.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref></sup> This function searches for bonds by geometric criteria according
to the maximum distance between the donor hydrogen and the acceptor
(set at 3.5 Å), as well as the minimum angle between the donor,
its hydrogen, and the acceptor (set at 135°).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref></sup> Detection of salt bridges is computed with the same function,
limiting donor residues to LYS and ARG, acceptor residues to GLU and
ASP, and increasing the maximum bonding distance compared to hydrogen
bonds from 3.5 to 5 Å.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref></sup></p>
      <p>Detection of
aromatic–aromatic interactions is computed
from a homemade function based on geometric criteria for TYR, PHE,
HIS, and TRP residues.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref></sup> From the centroid and the normal
vector of aromatic rings, several values are calculated: the distance
between two centroids in Ångström, the planar angle describing
the tilt of one aromatic ring relative to the other, and the orientation
angle describing the offset of one aromatic ring relative to the other,
both expressed in degrees modulo 90°.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref></sup> Then, based on the following parameters:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>A Pi-stacking between two aromatic rings is defined
if the distance between these two rings is within a defined range
(set from 3 to 5 Å), if the planar angle is between 0° and
20° degrees, and if the orientation angle is between 0 and 30°
(customizable value).</p></list-item><list-item><p>A T-shape is defined
if the distance between the two
rings is within a defined range (set from 4.5 to 7 Å), if the
planar angle is between 0 and 60°, and if the orientation angle
is between 0 and 30° or 60 and 90°.</p></list-item><list-item><p>An L-shape is defined if the distance between the two
rings is within a defined range (set from 4.5 to 7 Å), if the
planar angle is between 0 and 60°, and if the orientation angle
is between 30 and 60°.</p></list-item></list></p>
      <p>The output
of the analysis tool is a list of interactions observed
in the different input files, including the number of the residues
involved in a given interaction, its type and frequency in each file,
and the chosen representative frames extracted in the PDB format.</p>
      <p>The second component is a Python2 add-on to USCF Chimera,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref></sup> which allows the visualization of the results
calculated by the first SINAPs Python3 tool. It takes as input the
directory containing the results of the molecular interaction network
analysis tool. After loading, this extension allows the observation
of the representative frame of each simulation by displaying each
type of nonbonded molecular interactions via a user-defined frequency
lower limit and finely controlled mode of representation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref></xref>B).</p>

R′ state with the presence of a ligand, and a G-protein-bound
R* active state<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>).</p>

considers the input structures by having the same number of residues
in each structure, the residues 8–146, 159–208, and
225–305 were kept. Finally, the prepared structures were compared

(PDB ID: 4GC0), based on the work of Sun et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34">34</xref></sup> Then, using
UCSF Chimera, all of the ligands were removed to facilitate the preparation
of MD. To have the same number of amino acids, only residues 10–455
were kept. The hydrogen atoms were added via the AddH tool of UCSF
Chimera using the method considering the possible hydrogen bonds.</p>
        <p>MD simulations were performed using Amber18 software, with the
ff14SB force field at a constant pressure of 1 atm maintained with
a Berendsen barostat, at a constant temperature of 300 K with a Langevin
thermostat, and with periodic boundary conditions in an orthogonal
box with TIP3P water and Na<sup>+</sup> counterions to neutralize
the system.</p>
        <p>The systems were minimized by 1000 steps of the
steepest descent
algorithm, followed by 1000 steps of the conjugate gradient algorithm
with restraints on α carbons. Afterward, the systems were brought
to the simulation temperature with a Langevin thermostat at a constant
volume and restrained α carbons, from 0 to 300 K for 9000 steps
and 300 K for another 1000 steps. Then, 2 ns equilibrium simulations
were performed using the production conditions with restraints of
alpha carbons to allow the correct positioning of the side chains
of the protein and water molecules. The last frame of each equilibration
step was used to launch three replicas of 50 ns of MD simulation for
each system. An integration step of 2 fs was used, with the SHAKE
algorithm constraining bonds involving hydrogen due to the use of
TIP3P water, PME with a cutoff of 8 Å, and effective Born radii
of 14 Å in the generalized Born approximation. Finally, the water
molecules were removed, and then the frames were aligned on the position
of α carbons of the first frame for each trajectory using cpptraj
utility, before the trajectories were compared using SINAPs.</p>

Application to a Drug Candidate: 28 kDa Glutathione-S-transferase</title>
        <p>The 28 kDa glutathione-S-transferase protein (P28GST), a schistosome

by Par’Immune for the treatment of chronic inflammatory bowel

the enzymatic activities remain to be elucidated, in particular the
involved amino acids. Up to now, only the tyrosine residue in position

via the activation of glutathione, either into a cosubstrate of GST
or into a cofactor of PGDS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref40">40</xref></sup> Upon glutathione activation,
two conformations of Tyr10 are observed from crystallography:<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref40">40</xref></sup> an IN conformation, where it points toward the
catalytic site and the glutathione, and an OUT conformation, where
it points toward the outside of the protein and is exposed to the

        <p>To study the molecular interaction networks ruling the P28GST function
and to investigate the main differences between these two conformations,
three classical MD replicas of 1.5 μs each were performed, starting
from a crystallographic structure in its dimeric form (PDB ID: 1OE8)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref40">40</xref></sup> and modified to exhibit the Tyr10 IN conformation in one
monomer and the Tyr10 OUT conformation in the other one. In addition,
to overcome the defects of the crystallographic structure, the side
chain of Phe38 was restored and the last four amino acids of each
monomer were reconstructed using UCSF Chimera.</p>
        <p>MD simulations
were performed using Amber18 following the protocol
described previously. After removing the water molecules and fitting
the protein to the t0 α trace, the three replicas were merged
as 225 000 trajectory frames. One-tenth of this trajectory
was sampled and submitted as a reasonable input set to the SINAPs
program. The first SINAPs analysis compared the whole trajectory against
itself to study the intramolecular interaction network ruling the
quaternary protein state. After separating the two monomers to generate
separate sets of trajectories, the second SINAPs analysis was related
to the differential interaction network occurring in each monomer
and depending on the conformational state of Tyr10.</p>

Crystallographic structures of A2AR (in the PDB format) were studied
by changing several parameters. To compensate for the resolution of
the crystallographic structures, the hydrogen bonds and salt bridges
parameters were upped by a 15% tolerance around the usual distance
and angle limits. The lower limit angle taken into consideration was
set at 115°, and the maximum distance was set at 4 for a hydrogen

        </fig>
        <p>An interaction network can be detected with stable
salt bridges
between Asp101 and Arg102, between Lys227 and Glu228, and between
Glu228 and Lys233, found in all conformations. However, a salt bridge
can be observed between Arg102 and Glu228 only in the inactive conformation
and replaced by another salt bridge between Arg205 and Glu228 only
in the active conformation, through the TM6 tilt.</p>
        <p>A second interaction
network made of hydrogen bonds was highlighted
between TM6 and TM7 helices in R and R′ conformations. This
network involves the Lys227, His230, Ser234, and Phe242 on TM6 and
the Asn280, Arg291, and Arg293 on TM7. This network also involves
interactions between TM7 and TM3/TM5 helices depending on the studied
conformation. A hydrogen bond between the Tyr288 from TM7 and the
Arg102 from TM3 is observed in the R′ conformation, replaced
by a bond between the Tyr288 and Tyr197 from TM5 in R*.</p>
        <p>In the
literature, the amino acids described in this study are
part of the structural pattern preserved in the vast majority of GPCRs.
Asp101, Arg102, and Glu228 are described as part of the E/DRY motif<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref41">41</xref></sup> and amino acids ranging from Asp284 to Tyr288
as part of the NPxxY motif.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref42">42</xref></sup></p>
        <p>The
E/DRY motif plays a pivotal role in regulating GPCR conformational
states.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref41">41</xref></sup> The salt bridge between Arg102
and Glu228 is described as forming an ionic lock that stabilizes the
receptor in an inactive form. This ionic lock allows the intracellular
end of TM6 to be bent toward TM3 in the inactive conformation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref43">43</xref></sup></p>
        <p>In the intermediate-active conformation, Arg102 of the E/DRY
motif
no longer participates in the ionic lock but interacts with Tyr288
of the NPxxY motif, bringing TM3 closer to TM7.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref44">44</xref></sup> TM6 is still held in place near TM7 by a network of hydrogen
bonds involving residues on either side of the NPxxY motif, but it
is no longer interacting with TM3 with the deflection of the ionic
lock.</p>
        <p>Finally, the interaction found only in the active conformation
between Tyr288 of the NPxxY motif and Tyr197 is described as critical
for forming the active state, as it operates as an activation-associated
microswitch,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref45">45</xref></sup> which enables the tilting of TM6 to allow a G-protein to interact.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref46">46</xref></sup> Since water molecules were removed, it would
be relevant to evaluate their involvement in this interaction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref44">44</xref></sup> Moreover, after tilting, TM6 is maintained against
TM5 by a salt bridge between Glu228 of the E/DRY pattern with Arg205.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref45">45</xref></sup></p>
        <p>It is also worth mentioning that other
observed phenomena are not
covered in depth in this paper. These include the involvement of Asp52,
Ser91, and Ser281 in the formation of a dense hydrogen bond network
in the intermediate-active and active conformations, supposed to be
significant in the signal transduction mechanism of class-A GPCR.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref48">48</xref></sup> Differences in hydrogen bonds network of the E/DRY motif with Ser41
and Tyr112 are also observed and may have direct implications in G-protein
activation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref49">49</xref></sup></p>

Modes between the A2AR Conformational

        <p>The second observation made was to compare the binding
mode of studied crystallized ligands within their active sites. The
ligand of the active form, NECA, as well as that of the intermediate-active
form, adenosine, spread identically into the binding site and interact
by hydrogen bonds with Glu169, Asn253, Ser277, and His278. Due to
the additional methylamide group of NECA, this allows an additional
hydrogen bond with His250 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref></xref>A). The ligand of the inactive form, ZM241385, only
binds by two hydrogen bonds with Glu169 and Asn253 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref></xref>B).</p>

      <p>Two aspects
of the conformational
changes of GLUT-1 were examined. The first one was the extracellular
gate, which occludes the ligand-binding site from the extracellular
environment and promotes opening to the intracellular side in the
inward-open conformation. The second aspect was the intracellular
gate, with a dense network of salt bridges and hydrogen bonds at the
intracellular side working as a door closer.</p>
      <p>Both examined conformations
of GLUT-1 exhibit alternatively the closed extracellular ligand-binding
gate (EG) with the closed intracellular gate (IG) and then the closed
EG with the open IG (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref></xref>).</p>

of transmembrane helices TM1, TM5, TM7, and TM8 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref></xref>). A common salt bridge is
found between Lys38 on the TM1 helix and Glu299 on the TM7 helix.
A clear difference exists at the level of the interaction network
between open and closed EG. In open EG, hydrogen bonds exist between
Gly31 and Asn34 on the TM1 helix, Gln172 on the TM5 helix, Phe291,
Ser294, and Thr295 on the TM7 helix, and Thr310 on the TM8 helix,

to stabilize the IC1 to IC3 helices together. This helix bundle is
then connected by other salt bridges to TM3 with the participation

      <p>Furthermore, notable
differences were identified between the two
studied conformations.</p>
      <p>In the open IG conformation, the exclusive
interactions bring the
helices IC1 to IC3 closer to the N-domain, with a salt bridge between
the Glu243 of IC3 and the Arg153 of TM4 and with two backbone–side
chain hydrogen bonds, between the Arg212 of IC1 and the Glu146 of
TM4, and between the Arg232 of IC2 and the Val147 of TM4. Interactions
also bring the IC4 helix closer to the C-domain, with a hydrogen bond
between the side chains of Ser396 of TM10 and Glu254 located on the
coil before IC4. Glu254 also interacts by a backbone–backbone
hydrogen bond with the Gln250 of IC3, lengthening the IC3 helix and
positioning the IC4 coil in the direction of the cell membrane (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref></xref>C).</p>
      <p>In the
closed IG, the exclusive interactions have the opposite
effect, as they bring the helices IC1 to IC3 closer to the C-domain,
with a salt bridge between the Glu247 of IC3 and the Arg400 of TM10,
and two hydrogen bonds connecting the Glu247 of IC3 and the Asn217
of IC1 with the Gln397 of TM10. This helix complex is still linked
to the C-domain with a hydrogen bond between the Asp240 of IC3 and
the Thr150 of TM4. The two domains are also close together, with a
dense interaction network between the Ser148 of TM4, the Arg153 and
Gly154 of TM5, the Glu393 of TM10, and the Arg333 of TM9. Finally,
the interactions between IC4 and TM10 are no longer present, as they
are replaced by a strong interaction between the Arg249 of IC3 and
the Glu254 located on the coil before IC4, positioning the IC4 coil
in the direction of the intracellular medium (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref></xref>C).</p>
      <p>GLUT-1 has several interaction
networks found to be stable and
unchanged regardless of the state or evolving during the passage between
the different conformations of the protein during glucose transport.</p>
      <p>A first interaction network mainly composed of hydrogen bonds is
only found at the open EG. This network allows transmembrane helices
TM3, TM4, TM9, and TM10 to be brought together close to the extracellular
side in the open IG. This hydrogen bond network is also described
in the literature as allowing to tag the ligand-binding site in the
open IG.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref52">52</xref></sup></p>
      <p>A second interaction network of stable
salt bridges, found in the
two oEG/cIG and cEG/oIG studied conformations, stabilizes helices
IC1 to IC3 together, as well as these helices with the N-domain through
interactions with TM3 and TM4. However, additional interactions, hydrogen
bonds and salt bridges, are observed depending on the conformation
of the protein, allowing varying the distance between the helices
IC1 to IC3 and the C-domain, as well as the change in the geometry
of the coil containing IC4. The inward-open conformation sees IC1
to IC3 helices interacting with the N-domain, when they rather interact
with the C-domain in the occluded conformation. These differences
are found in the literature, where all of the cited substructures
form a “door closer,” which restrains the opening degree
of the two domains toward the intracellular side.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref54">54</xref></sup></p>
      <p>However, nothing in the literature refers to the involvement
of
Glu254 observed in this study. Differences in its interactions can
explain the variation in the positioning of the IC4 helix coil in
the studied conformations. Further studies are needed to minimize
the biases present in this study, to confirm the presence of these
interactions and to assess the contribution of Glu254 in the change
of the geometry of IC4 during glucose transfer.</p>
      <p>Furthermore,
as the E329Q mutation has not been restored, its involvement
has not been measured. However, its proximity to the Gly154 and Lys155
residues allows hypothesizing the involvement of this amino acid in
the dense interaction network bringing together the two domains in
the occluded conformation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref></sup></p>
      <p>Despite
the simplifications made in this study, it is possible
to retrieve the very specific interaction networks of GLUT-1 described
in the literature. From advanced MD simulations such as steered MD
by simulating the passage of glucose from the extracellular to the
intracellular side, it is conceivable to analyze the different conformations
obtained by creating subtrajectories for each conformation and analyze
them with SINAPs tools. This analysis would easily identify from a
simplified tridimensional representation the major differences in
the interaction networks, thus accelerating the studies conducted
in the framework of a research project.</p>

by other proteins of the same enzyme family,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref55">55</xref></sup> but this cation has not been described in the crystal structures

        <title>Tertiary Structure of P28GST—Common
Interactions</title>
        <p>The tertiary organization of P28GST is ruled
by a very high number
of salt bridges stabilizing the different secondary structures and
coils together (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">10</xref></xref>). At a frequency higher than 90%, nine salt bridges covering
the whole structure are observed, with the contribution of Lys7, Glu18,
Arg21, Glu32, Asp33, Glu34, Arg76, Glu96, Glu108, Lys131, Lys149,
Asp154, Asp168, and Arg206. At a frequency higher than 50%, seven
other salt bridges are found, with the contribution of Arg14, Arg16,
Glu18, Arg52, Glu70, Glu103, Glu106, Asp168, Asp172, and Arg189. In
addition, a few hydrogen bonds supplement the dense salt bridges’
interaction network with the participation of Glu18, Asp160, His188,
and Tyr202.</p>

        <p>In the Tyr10 IN conformation,
Tyr10 is stabilized by an aromatic
bond with Phe11, which is stabilized by another aromatic bond with
Trp41. Salt bridges hold Asp33, Glu34, and Arg35 together. Lastly,
the loop following Tyr10 is maintained by hydrogen bonds between Asn12
and Arg21, Arg14 and Arg21, and between Gly15 and Glu18.</p>
        <p>In
the Tyr10 OUT conformation, due to its position and close neighbors,
Tyr10 is no longer stabilized. The salt bridges maintaining the polar
amino acid chunk in place are no longer present, allowing Asp33 to
perform a salt bridge with Lys7. Finally, the loop is no longer held
in place, and there is a backbone hydrogen bond between Gly15 and
Ser19, allowing the subsequent helix-α to be lengthened.</p>

      <sec id="sec3.3.4">
        <title>Discussion</title>
        <p>Numerous intramolecular and intermolecular
interaction networks are found in P28GST, organizing its structure.</p>
        <p>The quaternary structure is composed of a symmetrical interaction
network, including very stable salt bridges and hydrogen bonds. These
numerous interactions at the interface suggest the biological stability
of P28GST as a dimer, corroborating the physical stability observable
with crystallographic methods. As the SINAPs tool currently does not
consider water molecules and ions, it would be worthwhile to study
their impact in the formation of a hypothetical interaction network
of protein–water, or protein–water–cation.</p>
        <p>The tertiary structure of P28GST is mostly supported by a dense
salt bridge interaction network that holds the architecture of the
protein. Further interaction networks are specific to the activation
states of the protein conditioning its activity.</p>
        <p>In the literature,
no information was found on the involvement
of the coil organization of amino acids Ser146 to Thr154 in proteins
of the same family. In addition, no information is found when searching
for specific interactions at a long range induced by the different
conformations of Tyr10 down to the minimum possible frequency of 1%.
The purpose of this structure, including its potential role in the
mechanism of action of P28GST and in the movement of Tyr10, remains
to be elucidated.</p>
        <p>Depending on the IN or OUT conformations of
Tyr10, specific interactions
are found in its surroundings, governing its activation state. In
the literature, site-directed mutagenesis and X-ray crystallography
have highlighted the importance of the amino acids Arg21 and Arg35
in the enzymatic function of P28GST.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref37">37</xref></sup></p>
        <p>Arg21 was identified by SINAPs as being essential for the global
architecture of P28GST through salt bridges with Glu18 and Asp33.
When it is mutated to leucine, thus no longer allowing the realization
of salt bridges and hydrogen bonds, only the OUT conformation of Tyr10
is populated in crystallography.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref37">37</xref></sup> This
observation is explained by the results of SINAPs, which show the
presence of specific side chain–backbone hydrogen bonds with
Asn12 and Arg14 in the loop after Tyr10 in its IN conformation and
thus having a possible stabilizing role of this loop.</p>
        <p>The combined
observations point to the importance of Arg21 in the
motion of Tyr10 by playing a switch role, conditioning the IN and
OUT conformations.</p>
        <p>Asp33, maintained by Arg35 in the IN conformation
but interacting
with Lys7 in the OUT conformation, was described as a proton acceptor
and could be involved in the deprotonation of Tyr10, which is then
able to perform its glutathione deprotonation function after switching
to its IN conformation.</p>
        <p>Arg35, found with SINAPs to perform
salt bridges with Asp33 and
Glu34 only when Tyr10 is in its IN conformation, was described in
the literature as performing concerted movements with the latter,
allowing the formation of a ″gate″ conditioning the
conformational switch of Tyr10.</p>
        <p>Through this example, the SINAPs
tool helps to find molecular interactions
described in the literature within classical MD, allowing the validation
of the biological reality of the simulation, and to support the hypotheses
on the enzymatic mechanism of glutathione activation in P28GST. SINAPs
also permits the validation of the method: as the features found here
are proven by experimental evidence described in the literature, we
can assume that new observations made in the future will also be valid.</p>

    <title>Conclusions</title>
    <p>We presented here SINAPs, a dual analysis-visualization
series
of tools coded in Python, which allows a user-friendly study of the
similarities and differences in nonbonded interaction networks between
molecular systems. These systems may be drawn from crystallographic
datasets or come from MD trajectories, thereby helping greatly in
the analysis of the large amount of data generated. The visualization
part is offered via an add-on to UCSF Chimera and permits a high level
of user customization of the representation. Its most important advantage
is to link the interactions and the structure of the proteins in a
single view, while keeping the information about the type and the
frequency of the interactions. It currently takes into account the
intramolecular salt bridge, hydrogen bonds, and aromatic interactions
as well as intermolecular hydrogen bonds, which permits to study both
protein internal interaction networks throughout their conformational
changes and ligand–receptor interactions, as exemplified with
GLUT-1 dynamics and A2AR crystallography. The SINAPs software also
enables the validation of classical MD simulations by facilitating
the search for very specific interaction networks, as described here
with examples from the literature, to facilitate the understanding
of the mechanism of action of a target of interest and to characterize
new structures, as seen with the exploratory study of P28GST.</p>
    <p>Its integration as an easy-to-implement plugin to one of the most
widely used free 3D molecular viewer opens it to both chemoinformatics
experts and less experienced users from different backgrounds. This
software is also scalable, with the future addition of the detection
of intermolecular protein–small molecules salt bridges and
aromatic interactions. Other improvements are also considered, such
as hydrophobic interactions, the detection of intermolecular protein–ligand
interactions in addition to the detection of hydrogen bonds already
implemented, the optimization of the calculation algorithm, the current
one running only on one CPU, or the improvement of the display of
the results, in particular in the form of a list of interactions in
UCSF Chimera, to enhance its running speed and improve the friendliness
and depth of the representation.</p>
