        <title>Background</title>
        <p>Biomedical research often involves contextual integration of multimodal and multiomic data in search of mechanisms for improved diagnosis, treatment, and monitoring. Researchers need to access information from diverse sources, comprising data in various and sometimes incongruent formats. The downstream processing of the data to decipher mechanisms by reconstructing networks and developing quantitative models warrants considerable effort.</p>

        <p>MetGENE is a knowledge-based, gene-centric data aggregator that hierarchically retrieves information about the gene(s), their related pathway(s), reaction(s), metabolite(s), and metabolomic studies from standard data repositories under one dashboard to enable ease of access through centralization of relevant information. We note that MetGENE focuses only on those genes that encode for proteins directly associated with metabolites. All other gene–metabolite associations are beyond the current scope of MetGENE.

    <title>Introduction</title>
    <p>Recent advances in high-throughput technologies have led to many high-resolution multiomic measurements available to biomedical researchers. However, obtaining biological insights remains challenging since considerable effort is required to find and access data from diverse sources, deal with diverse and sometimes incomplete data formats, and tease out the connections within those high-dimensional datasets. This has led to an initiative by the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) called the Common Fund Data Ecosystem (CFDE), which aims to provide a single portal that makes data findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR) across the data repositories maintained by Data Coordination Centers (DCCs). Some examples of DCCs include the Metabolomics Workbench (MW), which is a national metabolomics data repository [<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]; Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) Project, a comprehensive resource to study tissue-specific gene expression and regulation [<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]; and the Library of Integrated Network-Based Cellular Signatures (LINCS) with the goal of generating a large-scale and comprehensive catalog of perturbation–response signatures by utilizing a diverse collection of perturbations across many model systems and assay types [<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The MW is a comprehensive resource hosting more than 2,000 curated metabolomics studies and provides an integrated environment for data analysis and visualization through a suite of tools and interfaces to facilitate gaining biological insights.</p>
    <p>A gene is a fundamental unit of query in the multiomics data hierarchy. One of the goals of CFDE is to make every DCC support gene-centric querying within their repositories. Currently, the MW supports a limited capability to perform gene-centric queries on the studies. MetGENE was designed to bridge this gap and enhance the capability by allowing a user to specify a gene or a set of genes that code for the metabolic enzyme(s) as a search term and, in return, fetch the relevant information from sources like the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) [<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] and the MW. Given one or more genes, the MetGENE tool identifies associations between the gene(s) and the metabolites (biosynthesized or catabolized) through the reactions and pathways involving these metabolites. For each metabolite, studies containing the metabolite are identified from the MW. The results are organized as a gene landing page or a Dashboard, with all the information presented in a user-friendly manner to enable further analyses. There are many other ways a gene may have an “association” with a small-molecule metabolite, such as via gene regulation (e.g., Transcription Factor (TF)–target relationship) or its protein product, gene expression–metabolite association, protein–protein–metabolite association, and so on. However, in MetGENE, we only focus on those genes that encode for proteins directly associated with metabolites, namely, metabolic enzymes.</p>
    <p>While other databases such as GeneCards [<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] provides extensive gene-related information (although not in a readily accessible format for metabolites, despite the presence of hyperlinked ChEBI IDs), and MetaCyc [<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] provides information on genes, their associated pathways, and reactions, to the best of our knowledge, there exists no other tool that establishes a link between a gene and its relevant metabolomic studies like MetGENE does. This is important for several reasons. Consider a scenario where a biomedical researcher aims to uncover therapeutic targets for a gene like <italic toggle="yes">IDH1</italic>, which plays a crucial role in the early stages of tumorigenesis across various cancers. Given its metabolic significance, the researcher may want to find specific metabolomic studies and their findings (e.g., statistical and biological insights) relevant to cancer. Currently, apart from conducting searches on the MW, the only viable option would entail painstakingly combing through scientific literature to locate relevant information. MetGENE simplifies this process by employing targeted anatomy and disease filters and seamlessly connects genes with the precise metabolomic studies of interest. This not only drastically reduces the time and effort required by users but also streamlines the exploration of relevant data on a single, accessible platform. Furthermore, MetGENE goes beyond offering information about individual genes; it extends its capabilities to cover entire gene sets in one seamless process. In scenarios where users identify a specific subset of genes within a particular context, MetGENE stands out by efficiently processing the entire list. This differs from the practice of fetching information individually, as commonly seen in platforms like GeneCards, MetaCyc, or KEGG.</p>

    <title>Methods</title>
    <p>MetGENE (<ext-link xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/RRID:SCR_023402" ext-link-type="uri">RRID:SCR_023402</ext-link>) is a hierarchical, knowledge-based gene-centric information retrieval tool. Given a gene or a set of genes as a search term, MetGENE returns entities associated with the gene(s)—namely, pathways, reactions, metabolites, and metabolomic studies in the MW, as shown in Fig. <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. MetGENE contextualizes the search by allowing the users to specify filters based on organism name, anatomy or tissue name (broadly, sample source), and disease/phenotype as a part of its query interface, as shown in Fig. <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1A</xref>. A knowledge graph represents a network of entities, such as objects or concepts, and depicts their relationship. The knowledge graph that underlies information retrieval in MetGENE is depicted in Fig. <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1B</xref>. Further, for the human species, the number of metabolic genes, gene–pathway, gene–reaction, gene–metabolite, and gene–metabolomic study associations found in the MW is enumerated in Fig. <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1C</xref>.</p>

    </fig>
    <p>MetGENE is designed as a web-based application using PHP and JavaScript as the front-end. The back-end contains R scripts with wrapper functions to retrieve information from various data repositories, such as KEGG [<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] (for reaction and metabolite/compound IDs) and MW (for metabolite study IDs and RefMet names), as shown in Fig. <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>. The KEGG database provides the KEGG REST API to access information from the KEGG database. For any given gene, MetGENE supports SYMBOL, ENTREZ ID, RefSeq, UniProt, Ensembl, and ALIAS (SYMBOL_OR_ALIAS) formats and converts IDs using an in-house Gene ID Conversion Tool (GICT). The GICT uses R Bioconductor packages, org.Xy.eg.db (e.g., org.Hs.eg.db for human), and NCBI gene_info table to convert the gene IDs. If the ID type for the input term is SYMBOL_OR_ALIAS, then the term is first searched in SYMBOL. If not found, then it is searched in ALIAS. Given the 3-letter KEGG organism code and the ENTREZ gene ID (of the input gene term from the GICT), the R KEGGREST API provides a way to access all the information, such as pathway IDs, reaction IDs, and compound (metabolites) IDs as a data frame object, which is parsed further to display relevant information. The KEGG compound ID, along with the filter information pertaining to the species, anatomy, and disease/phenotype, is used to extract information such as RefMet names and study IDs using the MW REST API. RefMet names provide a standardized reference nomenclature for both discrete metabolite structures and metabolite species identified in metabolomic experiments. This is an essential prerequisite for comparing and contrasting metabolite data across different experiments and studies. For efficiency and to speed up the display, MetGENE caches the number of pathways, reactions, metabolites, and studies associated with a particular gene, which is updated weekly to accommodate new studies being deposited into the MW.</p>

    <p>MetGENE maintains session variables for species ID and organism name, ENTREZ gene ID and gene symbol, anatomy, disease/phenotype terms, and the previous values of these terms to enable server-side caching of pages and thus avoid unnecessary and time-consuming fetching of data across the network. The MetGENE source code is available on GitHub for download. For programmatic ease of access, we provide REST APIs that output each information table displayed in JSON or CSV formats. The REST APIs are developed using Smart/Open API format [<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p>

    <title>Results</title>
    <p>In this section, we describe the user experience starting from the MetGENE Query Page and ending with the MetGENE Studies Page containing metabolomic studies corresponding to the gene in the MW, incorporating various intermediate views of interest based on the knowledge graph described earlier.</p>
    <sec id="sec3-1">
      <title>MetGENE query interface</title>
      <p>The user can input the gene information as a gene ID in any one of the formats described in the previous section. The format of the query page is as shown in Fig. <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>. The gene search input is validated on the client side to allow only alphanumeric symbols. Invalid gene IDs are recognized, and appropriate error messages are displayed. MetGENE uses terms (e.g., Human, Mouse) for taxonomy filtering as per the NCBI taxonomy database [<xref rid="bib22_1697632244449" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Currently, MetGENE supports human (<italic toggle="yes">Homo sapiens</italic>), mouse (<italic toggle="yes">Mus musculus</italic>), and rat (<italic toggle="yes">Rattus norvegicus</italic>) species, and we plan to add <italic toggle="yes">Escherichia coli</italic> (K12), <italic toggle="yes">Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, common fruit fly (<italic toggle="yes">Drosophila melanogaster</italic>), and mosquito (<italic toggle="yes">Anopheles gambiae</italic>) in the near future. For filtering the information on metabolites and studies by anatomy/tissue (e.g., Liver, Blood) and disease/phenotype (e.g., Diabetes, Fatty liver disease), terms from the MW are used. Internally, the MW database records disease and phenotype under the metadata field, <italic toggle="yes">disease</italic>. Hence, the phenotype is searched as a disease term within the MW. The JSON files for each filter/category are curated and updated regularly and used to generate a pull-down menu. For the disease/phenotype filter, a 2-step selection menu with slim (or disease class) terms in the first level and fine-grained terms in the second level is used for ease of presenting the options to the user. The user inputs from this page (main landing page) are submitted as a form, and a second page for MetGENE (as shown in Fig. <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>) is populated with the context-specific filtering terms. The second page comprises tabs for the search term–associated entities, “Genes,” “Pathways,” “Reactions,” “Metabolites,” “Studies,” and “Summary.” The Summary tab displays the total number of pathways, reactions, metabolites, and studies corresponding to each gene in the query. As MetGENE supports only those genes that encode proteins directly associated with metabolites, a warning is issued if the queried gene or a set of queried genes does not encode for such proteins.</p>

This tool generates a report for any given metabolite in the MW, comprising all the unique studies containing that metabolite and their median value of the relative standard deviation (RSD) across all those studies. The KEGG compound IDs that do not have RefMet names in the MW database display only the KEGG compound name and reaction IDs. The KEGG compound IDs are hyperlinked to their corresponding KEGG compound information pages. MetGENE allows users to download the tables directly from the displayed page in JSON or CSV formats for further analysis.

      <title>Case study: exploring gene <italic toggle="yes">PNPLA3</italic> using MetGENE</title>
      <p>Here, we demonstrate a use case that shows the utility of MetGENE as a 1-stop tool to obtain all metabolomic information associated with a gene(s) in a specific disease condition. The protein adiponutrin, encoded by the gene <italic toggle="yes">PNPLA3</italic>, is a multifunctional enzyme that belongs to the IPLA2/lipase family, which has both triacylglycerol lipase and acylglycerol O-acyltransferase activities. <italic toggle="yes">PNPLA3</italic> is predominantly expressed in adipocytes and liver cells. It regulates the development of adipocytes and the metabolism of fats (lipogenesis and lipolysis). Diseases associated with <italic toggle="yes">PNPLA3</italic> mutations include fatty liver disease and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) [<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">16–19</xref>].</p>
      <p>To obtain information about a gene(s) and associated entities like enzymes, reactions, pathways, and existing metabolomic studies in MW for a given context (fatty liver disease in humans), a user needs to identify precise key terms, perform a search on the Internet, sift through the results to identify literature about various metabolomic studies, and download the studies to perform downstream analyses. These steps are sometimes time-consuming and misleading, depending on the search terms’ specificity. However, with MetGENE, the user can specify a gene ID(s) in any popular format and apply the filters on organism, anatomy, and disease/phenotype to obtain genes, pathways, reactions, metabolites, and study information consolidated from various data resources at one go. <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S1</xref> shows the Gene tab for the <italic toggle="yes">PNPLA3</italic> gene. Links to various online resources (GeneCards, KEGG, NCBI, Uniprot, and Marrvel) with genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, clinical, and functional information (via GeneCards link); module and pathway information (via KEGG); transcript and region information (via NCBI link); sequence, variant, and gene expression information (via Ensembl link); protein sequence and functional information (via Uniprot link); and gene variants associated with <italic toggle="yes">PNPLA3</italic> (via Marrvel link) are provided in the gene information table. <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S2</xref> represents the Pathway tab for the <italic toggle="yes">PNPLA3</italic> gene with links to interactions with and pathways that involve <italic toggle="yes">PNPLA3</italic> (via Pathway Commons), protein and reaction location information (via Reactome), pathway definitions (via KEGG), and pathway-related collaborative information (via Wikipathways). <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S3</xref> represents the Reactions and Metabolites tabs for <italic toggle="yes">PNPLA3</italic>. It delineates 2 hydrolysis reactions where diacylglycerol (DAG) is hydrolyzed to 2-monoacylglycerol (2-MAG), and triacylglycerol (TAG) is hydrolyzed to DAG by <italic toggle="yes">PNPLA3</italic>. Three generic compounds (TAG, DAG, and fatty acid) participate in the reactions. The Metabolites tab for <italic toggle="yes">PNPLA3</italic> lists all the metabolites (with substitutions for TAG and DAG) along with corresponding RefMet names or KEGG metabolite names (in the absence of RefMet names) along with a MetStat link that points to metabolite statistics information such as a histogram of the RSD metabolite data, and analysis of variance results for the metabolite with a cutoff p-value in the MW via MetStat, with the anatomy and disease filters applied. <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S4</xref> depicts the Studies tab in MetGENE for the gene <italic toggle="yes">PNPLA3</italic>. Each metabolite displays the corresponding Study IDs if measured/listed in any studies deposited in the MW, hyperlinked to the study description. A hover text displays the study title. The tool provides the user with the ability to combine studies for metabolites of interest to a consolidated view, as shown in <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S4</xref>. <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S5</xref> serves as an informative visual aid, providing an overview of the information flow network within MetGENE for the <italic toggle="yes">PNPLA3</italic> use case. It simplifies the complexity of the underlying technical details of MetGENE, facilitating comprehension of the query-to-results process. All MetGENE tables can be downloaded in formats such as JSON and CSV directly from the respective pages in the browser or via the REST API. The REST API supports JSON and text formats. They are deposited in the Smart API repository along with the accompanying documentation.</p>

    <title>Discussion</title>
    <p>Given a gene(s), the MetGENE tool identifies associations between the gene(s) and the metabolites that are biosynthesized or catabolized by proteins coded by those gene(s). It is a knowledge-based data aggregator, accessing and integrating data from resources such as the KEGG and MW. The gene(s) link to metabolites, the chemical transformations involving the metabolites through gene-specified proteins/enzymes, the functional association of these gene-associated metabolites, and the pathways involving these metabolites with context-based filtering based on anatomy (sample source) and disease/phenotype. The user can specify the gene using a multiplicity of IDs, and the gene ID conversion tool translates these into harmonized IDs that are the basis for metabolite associations. Further, all studies involving the metabolites associated with the gene-coded proteins, as present in the MW, will be accessible to the user as a stand-alone tool or via the portal interface for the NIH Common Fund National Metabolomics Data Repository. The user can begin their journey either from the main webpage for MetGENE (see Availability) or from the NIH CFDE portal (<ext-link xlink:href="https://app.nih-cfde.org/" ext-link-type="uri">https://app.nih-cfde.org/</ext-link>; the steps are: Data Browser → Vocabulary → Gene).</p>

  <sec id="sec5">
    <title>Potential Implications</title>
    <p>Features from MetGENE will contribute to the integration of other omics data to draw metabolomics perspectives and with metabolomics data, with genes serving as the bridging nodes. For example, tools such as MetGENE will assist a researcher in interpreting the results of multiomics data integration holistically, where they can consider both gene-related and metabolomics data in a metabolic pathway. We are also in the process of integrating MetGENE with tools from other DCCs as a part of a broader NIH-CFDE initiative. Through that, we can provide support for persistent and shareable MetGENE-based workflows.</p>
