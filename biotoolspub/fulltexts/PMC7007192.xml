      <p>Predicting
the assembly of multiple proteins into specific complexes
is critical to understanding their biological function in an organism
and thus the design of drugs to address their malfunction. Proteins
are flexible molecules, which inherently pose a problem to any protein
docking computational method, where even a simple rearrangement of
the side chain and backbone atoms at the interface of binding partners
complicates the successful determination of the correct docked pose.
Herein, we present a means of representing protein surface, electrostatics,
and local dynamics within a single volumetric descriptor. We show
that our representations can be physically related to the surface-accessible
solvent area and mass of the protein. We then demonstrate that the
application of this representation into a protein–protein docking
scenario bypasses the need to compensate for, and predict, specific
side chain packing at the interface of binding partners. This representation
is leveraged in our de novo protein docking software, JabberDock,
which can accurately and robustly predict difficult target complexes
with an average success rate of &gt;54%, which is comparable to or
greater
than the currently available methods.</p>

    <title>Introduction</title>
    <p>Most functions in an
organism are governed by interactions of proteins
with specific substrates. To achieve their task, proteins often form
homo- and heteromultimeric complexes. A plethora of genetic diseases
is connected to mutations altering protein structures and consequently
their capacity to interact with their binding partners.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref></sup> Consequently, a great body of research and development
focuses on methods for the elucidation of protein structures. In this
context, computational techniques devised to predict the complex formed
when two proteins bind can be of great help. In silico techniques
can often be significantly cheaper and quicker than experimental methods,
and their predictive capability can be harnessed to guide subsequent
targeted experiments.</p>
    <p>Protein–protein docking is a highly
complex optimization
problem, requiring the generation of a considerable number of candidate
arrangements. To accurately discriminate between correct and incorrect
docked poses, an accurate scoring function is essential. Typical scoring
functions used in this context involve a set of nontrivial physical
or empirical terms, combined with custom weightings. An ideal scoring
function should feature minimum mathematical uncertainty while accounting
for protein structure and dynamics. In order to navigate the landscape
of possible conformations in search of the specific arrangements that
minimize this scoring function, a highly efficient exploration method
is also required. The two are intimately linked, with the scoring
function guiding the behavior of the navigator.</p>
    <p>The simplest
and most widespread approaches for protein–protein
docking involve a global, systematic, rigid-body docking search. Typically,
a large number of solutions are generated from a pair of static molecular
structures,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>−<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref></sup> and a scoring function is then used to identify the
most favorable arrangement. Treating proteins as fully rigid objects,
while simultaneously using a scoring function that accounts for the
specific position of each atom, leads to a modeling process that is
excessively sensitive to the specific packing of atoms at the interface.
In order to cater to protein dynamics, alterations to how models are
built or how the scoring function assesses a protein arrangement are
required. Possible strategies include rigid-body docking of ensembles
of structures,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>−<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref></sup> additional refinement stages that take place after
rigid-body docking,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref></sup> scoring functions that feature
soft potentials to allow minor molecular overlaps,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref></sup> pseudo-coarse-grained protein representations,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref></sup> docking subunits connected by potentials,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref></sup> matching protein surfaces represented as a collection of
patches,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref></sup> using normal modes to account
for flexible conformational switches,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref></sup> and relaxing the interface of docking poses using techniques such
as molecular dynamics (MD), Monte Carlo (MC), or simulated annealing.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref></sup> Some methods, such as HADDOCK<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref></sup> and IMP,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref></sup> feature
scoring functions that utilize a combination of terms that describe
physical interactions and penalize models that do not recapitulate
the available experimental data. Overall,
two approaches are used to describe amino acid side chains at the
interface. They are either represented explicitly, thus requiring
the docking method to determine their correct packing, or their presence
is described by means of pseudo-coarse-grained representations. The
first method requires highly sophisticated optimization procedures
that may still yield suboptimal arrangements, whereas the second method
usually ignores the uncertainty in the position of the side chains
that comes naturally with any time dynamics.</p>
    <p>In this work, we
describe a new protein volumetric representation,
named spatial and temporal influence density (STID) maps, capable
of simultaneously describing protein shape, electrostatics, and local
dynamics (see <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref></xref>c). We demonstrate that the complementarity of these isosurfaces
can help create suitable solutions in a protein–protein docking
scenario. While surface complementarity techniques have been used
for many years,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref></sup> the representations from
STID maps are superior to any surface method used to date. STID maps
inherently consider any side chain flexibility by using the general
motion of atomic point charges in time as a building block for the
model. We demonstrate that the key consequence of this is the retention
of accuracy between identified docking models regardless of their
difficulty.</p>

    <p>Our STID map-based scoring method is embodied in JabberDock, a
protein de novo docking software. JabberDock explores the surface
complementarity space of two binding partners by means of a particle
swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm supplied by the POW<sup>er</sup> optimization environment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref></sup> POW<sup>er</sup> features a modified version of the PSO algorithm, explicitly adapted
to prevent premature convergence and maximize the diversity of solutions.</p>
    <p>Hereafter, we first outline the theory behind our protein representation
method and then present a set of benchmarks aimed at testing the accuracy
of our protein–protein docking method in line with the CAPRI
blind docking competition guidelines.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref></sup> Results demonstrate that JabberDock can return models matching the
quality of top de novo docking algorithms currently available.</p>

    <p>The following theory is built upon the principle that a volumetric
map can consider both the structural and dynamical properties of a
protein. It is constructed from the inherent motion of charged atoms
via the time-averaged dipoles forming within a localized space. The

      <title>From Protein
Structure to Dipole Map</title>
      <p>The overall dynamics
of a protein emerge from a combination of slow large-scale motions
and fast local rearrangements. We start by sampling the fast motions
of the side chains by means of a short MD simulation. Consistent with
experimental NMR evidence,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref></sup> we have found
that 500 ps is enough for this purpose (see the <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.jctc.9b00474/suppl_file/ct9b00474_si_001.pdf">Supporting Information</ext-link> and Figures S1 and S2). We align the
resulting protein trajectory according to the center of mass of the
molecule and arrange it within a stationary, cubic grid, wherein each
voxel is 1 Å across in <italic>x</italic>, <italic>y</italic>, and <italic>z</italic> (a parameter determined quantitatively in
a benchmark shown in <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.jctc.9b00474/suppl_file/ct9b00474_si_001.pdf">Figures S3–S5</ext-link>). We use this information to calculate the local dipoles on each
grid point. To this end, we are expanding upon the theory laid out
by Kirkwood,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref></sup> Fröhlich,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref></sup> and Neumann et al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref></sup> which describes the fundamental theory of dielectrics.</p>
      <p>Following
the Onsager theory of dielectric polarization, we represent each voxel, <italic>v</italic>, as a spherical solute with volume, <italic>V</italic><sub>v</sub>, with an internal permittivity, ε<sub>v</sub>,
embedded within a uniform dielectric continuum with permittivity ε<sub>Ex</sub>. The charge distribution inside the voxel is that of several
point charges, with a dipole associated with the center. Point charges
within the neighboring voxels on each Cartesian edge and corner (i.e.,
a total of 26 neighbors, a quantity determined in a benchmark shown
in <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.jctc.9b00474/suppl_file/ct9b00474_si_001.pdf">Figures S3–S5</ext-link>) are also associated
with the central voxel. A sliding window is applied spatially such
that a point charge at a time, <italic>t</italic>, will contribute
to 27 different voxels in total. Given the fluctuations of the dipole
moment of the solute, <bold>M</bold><sub>v</sub>, observed over the
simulation in a voxel, it is possible to calculate ε<sub>v</sub>.</p>
      <p>The Fröhlich–Kirkwood model states that ε<sub>v</sub> is a function of the probability distribution of the total
dipole’s second moment, with <bold>M</bold><sub>v</sub> given
by<disp-formula id="eq1"><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="ct9b00474_m001" position="anchor"/><label>1</label></disp-formula>where <italic>q</italic><sub><italic>i</italic>,v</sub> is the charge
of atom <italic>i</italic> at distance <bold>r</bold><sub><italic>i</italic>,v</sub> from the geometrical center
of voxel <italic>v</italic>. <italic>N</italic> is the number of atoms
that contribute to a voxel’s dipole moment. The charges are
obtained from the force field used for the simulation. For a solute
with a net charge, which most voxels have, <bold>M</bold><sub>v</sub> is dependent on the origin; thus, the grid is fixed in time and
space. Therefore, we can produce a dipole map delivering a representation
of local vectorial electrostatic characteristics of a region of space
occupied by a molecule (see <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref></xref>b).</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec2.2">
      <title>From Dipole Map to STID Map</title>
      <p>We can
now leverage on
the obtained dipole map to derive volumetric information on a molecule,
i.e., a quantity that is easy to visualize and to use in a protein–protein
docking context. To this end, it is necessary to convert its dipolar
vectorial representation into a scalar quantity. Under the Fröhlich–Kirkwood
model, we can relate the fluctuations of each dipole moment, <bold>M</bold><sub>v</sub>, to the voxel’s dielectric, ε<sub>v</sub><disp-formula id="eq2"><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="ct9b00474_m002" position="anchor"/><label>2</label></disp-formula>where <italic>T</italic><sub>v</sub> is the
temperature in a voxel, which we approximate as the temperature of
the system. Solving for ε<sub>v</sub><disp-formula id="eq3"><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="ct9b00474_m003" position="anchor"/><label>3</label></disp-formula></p>
      <p>Each ε<sub>v</sub> value derived
from the dipole map now encodes information on the local dynamics
and atomic charges. Our next step is to convert the resulting dielectric
map into a quantity that relates to a pseudo-electron density. To
do so, we place a pseudo-atom at the center of each voxel and calculate
its polarizability, α<sub>v</sub>, using the Clausius–Mossotti
equation<disp-formula id="eq4"><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="ct9b00474_m004" position="anchor"/><label>4</label></disp-formula>where <italic>N</italic><sub>v</sub> is the
number density inside the voxel. Because <italic>N</italic><sub>v</sub> is derived from the number of pseudo-atoms inside a voxel; that
is, 1, we can simply set it as the inverse of <italic>V</italic><sub>v</sub>. The α<sub>v</sub> values can then be related to the
van der Waals radii <italic>R</italic><sub>vdW</sub> by a scaling
relationship identified by Fedorov et al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref></sup> based on the quantum Drude oscillator model<disp-formula id="eq5"><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="ct9b00474_m005" position="anchor"/><label>5</label></disp-formula>where the constant 2.54 is a universal
scaling
factor between electron density and atomic volume at <italic>R</italic><sub>vdW</sub> in atomic units. Although Fedorov et al. note that
a full derivation of this constant is still incomplete, they demonstrate
that the relationship in <xref rid="eq5" ref-type="disp-formula">eq <xref rid="eq5" ref-type="disp-formula">5</xref></xref> gives theoretical quantities closer to experimental data
than previous models based on classical hard-sphere representations.</p>
      <p>The electrostatic and dynamic information encapsulated in the local <italic>R</italic><sub>vdW</sub> values is now suitable to be transformed
into a quantity encoding a pseudo-electron density. To this end, we
assume that each pseudo-atom radius is equal to the full width at
half-maximum of a decaying function, here defined as a three-dimensional
Gaussian, with the maximum at the voxel’s center. This allows
each pseudo-electron density to “leak” into neighboring
voxels, which is reasonable given that a central voxel’s behavior
is characterized by the atoms in its neighborhood.</p>
      <p>Contributions
from any Gaussians with a nonzero value present within
a voxel are then summed, and the resulting map is finally normalized
(an isosurface example is shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref></xref>c), yielding a molecular representation called
spatial and temporal influence density (STID) maps. Because of this
methodology, the regions inside the protein’s conformational
space that are visited often or are highly charged will have greater
associated STID values. This property makes STID maps a useful representation
in a protein–protein docking scenario, with the electrostatics
arising from rapid side chain motions, often ignored with other docking
software, now accounted for.</p>

      <title>STID Map Cutoff
Values and Solvent-Accessible Surface Area of
the Protein Are Related</title>
      <p>The global average STID, <italic>D</italic><sub>avg.</sub>, provides us with a direct comparison between
the different structural and dynamic characteristics of a protein.
The presence of both rigid and highly charged regions within a protein
contributes greater STID values to their respective voxels than a
flexible or apolar residue. This is shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>a, where only the core regions of the protein
are observed at greater isosurface cutoffs, but the more flexible
regions can be seen at lower isovalues. Furthermore, we found that,
while having a greater relative quantity of charged or polar residues
did indeed increase the <italic>D</italic><sub>avg.</sub>, time-averaged
dynamics and the structure had a considerably larger impact on the
maps’ topography.</p>

      </fig>
      <p>We sought to determine whether a link exists between the characteristic <italic>D</italic><sub>avg.</sub> of each protein and any of their physical
quantities that are easily measurable. For this test, we select 118
proteins with various sizes, shapes, and secondary structures and
observed that the ratio between SASA and molecular weight, <italic>S</italic><sub>m</sub>, is anticorrelated with <italic>D</italic><sub>avg.</sub> (see <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>b). The relationship could be fitted via a linear least-square
fit (Pearson correlation coefficient equal to −0.80)<disp-formula id="eq6"><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="ct9b00474_m006" position="anchor"/><label>6</label></disp-formula></p>
      <p>Thus, each STID map is associated with a characteristic cutoff
value, determined by the SASA and molecular weight of the protein.
Important topographical features of the STID maps are entirely independent
of the protein: core secondary structure features are always visible
in and around an isovalue of 0.8, and highly charged atoms become
isolated from the body of the protein at more stringent cutoffs beyond
0.9. This direct link between the structural characteristics of a
protein and its associated volumetric isosurface’s shape makes
STID maps an appropriate way of representing how a protein will be
perceived by its immediate surroundings, such as a binding partner.</p>

      <title>STID Maps are Effective to Score Protein–Protein Interactions</title>
      <p>STID maps encapsulate information on the local dynamics of the
atomic charges in a protein. This feature is particularly attractive
in a protein–protein docking context, as it circumvents the
need of determining the specific atomic position of each side chain
at the interface between two binding partners. We, therefore, used
this representation within a docking protocol, where the scoring function
is determined by the surface complementarity of ligand and receptor
STID map isosurfaces (see <xref rid="sec5" ref-type="other">Methods</xref> section).
Benefitting from the fact that the structural characteristics reported
by each STID map isovalue are protein-independent, we determined that
an isovalue of 0.43 is the most appropriate to report on all electrostatic
and dynamic features of any protein within our surface complementarity
scheme (see the benchmark in <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.jctc.9b00474/suppl_file/ct9b00474_si_001.pdf">Figures S6 and S7</ext-link>).</p>
      <p>We implemented this calibrated STID map-based scoring into
our de novo protein docking algorithm: JabberDock. The program utilized
the PSO algorithm within the POW<sup>er</sup> environment to explore
the energy landscape associated with the arrangement of two binding
partners, in search of the arrangement maximizing our complementarity
score. We assessed the performance of JabberDock against all the 230
test cases featured in the most recent iteration of the standard protein–protein
interaction benchmark<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref></sup> (six cases excluded
for the presence of nonstandard amino acids). According to the root-mean-square
deviation (rmsd) between unbound and known bound state, 151 of these
cases are classified as rigid-body (easy), 45 as medium, and 34 as
difficult (see <xref rid="sec5" ref-type="other">Methods</xref> section). To gather
further information on the relationship between docking quality and
the conformational change proteins undergo upon binding, we selected
a diverse subset of 32 cases (20 easy, 7 medium, and 5 difficult)
that were also treated as bound cases. In these cases, the subunits
used to predict the assemblies were proteins extracted from the known
complex. We classified the quality of all our modeling runs according
to the three CAPRI categories—acceptable, intermediate, and
high (see the definition in <xref rid="sec5" ref-type="other">Methods</xref> section).
Hereon, we qualify a test case as a success if at least one model
in the top 10 ranked solutions is at least of acceptable quality.</p>
      <p>Against the 32 bound cases, JabberDock was successful in 85.0%
of the easy, 71.4% of the medium, and 20.0% of the difficult cases.
Challenged with the full unbound benchmark set, JabberDock yielded
successful predictions for 56.3% of the easy, 60.0% of the medium,
and 54.9% of the difficult cases. Although no high-quality predictions
were found for any of the test cases, intermediate quality results
were found for 29.2% of the easy, 22.2% of the medium, and 25.8% of
the difficult cases. Overall, these results indicate that JabberDock
performance is mostly unaffected by the case difficulty (full details
are provided in <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.jctc.9b00474/suppl_file/ct9b00474_si_002.xlsx">Table S1</ext-link>). These results
compare favorably against four of the most commonly used protein–protein
docking algorithms: SwarmDock,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref></sup> pyDock,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref></sup> ZDOCK,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref></sup> and HADDOCK.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref></sup> As reported by Vreven et al. while setting the
benchmark set used in this work,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref></sup> their
acceptable success rate for rigid-body cases ranges between 31 and
50%, whereas for the medium and difficult cases, substantially lower
success rates (between 4 and 22%) are observed. Regarding intermediate
success rates, 13–18% success rates are reported. It is only
when considering the percentage of high-quality models, where success
rates &lt;6% are reported, that JabberDock is outperformed.</p>
      <p>The reason behind JabberDock’s consistent performance throughout
cases of different difficulties lies in its ability to correctly identify
interfacial amino acids. Indeed, while the rmsd of models versus the
known complex is lower for cases with more flexible subunits, the
average ratio of correct contact residues (<italic>f</italic><sub>nat</sub>) remains nearly unaltered (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref></xref>b and <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.jctc.9b00474/suppl_file/ct9b00474_si_001.pdf">S8</ext-link>). The
relationship between the number of candidate models selected from
JabberDock’s ranked solutions and the resulting success rate
features an initial steep gradient (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref></xref>c). This indicates that the ranking of JabberDock’s
first successful model is most likely to be high. Still, by increasing
the number of candidate models to 100, results with significantly
smaller rmsd and higher <italic>f</italic><sub>nat</sub> can be found
(<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.jctc.9b00474/suppl_file/ct9b00474_si_001.pdf">Figure S8</ext-link>). Thus, while most successful
models usually rank high according to our scoring function, better
models may well be available when we consider a larger pool of solutions.
For instance, in 98.6% of easy cases, our full data sets of 300 solutions
always contain at least one acceptable pose (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref></xref>c).</p>

      <p>By aligning each monomeric subunit to their counterpart in the
complex and assessing the score achieved by such a pose, we observed
that four of the easy and one of the difficult cases yielded scores
higher than anything found by JabberDock (see <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.jctc.9b00474/suppl_file/ct9b00474_si_002.xlsx">Table S1</ext-link>). One example is the xyloglucan-specific endo-β-1,4-glucanase
(PDB: 3VLB),
where the two binding partners are highly interlocked. In this case,
failure was not caused by an unsuitable scoring function, but by an
underperforming optimizer, which was unable to navigate into the complex
binding site. Many of the successful unbound cases feature interlocked
arrangements. In such cases, if the optimizer can identify the narrow
set of roto-translation allowing the binding partners to interlock,
the resulting model will have a high score. A successful example is
that of the β-lactamase TEM1 (PDB: 1BTL)—ribonuclease A (PDB: 9RSA) complex, involving
a significantly large and complex contact region, whereby almost the
entire circumference of β-lactamase’s STID map is buried
(see <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref></xref>a).</p>
      <p>Unsuccessful cases, such as the profilin−β-actin complex
(PDB: 2BTF),
most often feature a flat binding site. In these cases, the surface
complementarity score alone struggles to discriminate between binding
and nonbinding regions because of a lack of characteristic surface
features, and thus successful models do not rank high. Addressing
these cases requires capturing additional properties of protein–protein
interactions. To this end, we explored the possibility of reranking
JabberDock models accounting to the vectoral alignment of neighboring
dipoles at the interface via the dipole maps used to build the STID
maps (see the <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.jctc.9b00474/suppl_file/ct9b00474_si_001.pdf">Supporting Information</ext-link>).
Preliminary results indicate that such a post-processing reranking,
while not increasing the overall success rate, significantly improved
the quality of poses for 12% of the data set.</p>
      <p>The most flexible
model for which we had a successful prediction
was the histone chaperone CIA/ASF1-double bromodomain complex (PDB: 3AAD), with an rmsd between
the known unbound and bound state of 4.37 Å. The 46 kDa complex
formed by thioredoxin reductase (thioredoxin) and the NADP+ analogue
AADP+ (PDB: 1F6M) was more flexible, exhibiting domain movements associated with
an rmsd of 4.9 Å. As no top 10 model produced by JabberDock had
an rmsd lower than 10 Å from the known bound state, this case
was declared unsuccessful. However, a top 10 model featured an <italic>f</italic><sub>nat</sub> of 0.419 (rank 7, see <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.jctc.9b00474/suppl_file/ct9b00474_si_002.xlsx">Table S1</ext-link>), indicating that the binding site was partially
identified. Thus, while in terms of rmsd several cases were unsuccessful,
JabberDock could still identify their binding site (see <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref></xref>b).</p>
      <p>Following from this,
an interesting unbound case is that of the
UBA domain from Cbl-b ubiquitin ligase (PDB: 2OOA), a small 11 kDa
protein. Although it is crystallized as a homodimer, it is its monomer
that participates in the formation of a heteromultimer (PDB: 2OOB) with ubiquitin.
Simulating a 2OOA monomer and using its associated STID map within JabberDock to predict
the 2OOB complex
yielded no successful results. On the other hand, generating a STID
map using a monomer extracted from the simulation of its dimer gave
intermediate quality results. This indicates that the dynamics of
a Cbl-b ubiquitin ligase as part of a homodimer or a heteromultimer
were similar, and this similarity could be harnessed to improve the
predictive power of our surface complementarity scoring. This approach
was also tested with the significantly larger integrin I domain of
complement receptor 3 complex (PDB: 4M76), but in this scenario, no good pose
was found. Thus, protein docking involving small proteins, and possibly
very flexible ones, may benefit from the information about their bound
dynamics extracted from other known complexes these proteins are part
of.</p>

    <title>Discussion and Conclusions</title>
    <p>We have presented STID maps,
a strategy to represent how a molecule
is perceived by its immediate surroundings. Our physical formalism
encompasses the localized electrostatic nature of the space occupied
by a molecule, and the dynamics of the protein itself, into a series
of local dipole vectors, which is ultimately cast into a volumetric
representation.</p>
    <p>We have demonstrated that the average STID quantity
of each protein
is linearly anticorrelated with the ratio between protein SASA and
molecular weight, <italic>S</italic><sub>m</sub>, and that typical
structural elements are always discernible at the same isovalue, independently
from the protein under study (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>b). This means that proteins with a similar mass and
aspect but a different secondary structure will have a different <italic>D</italic><sub>avg.</sub> value. This is because different secondary
structure elements contribute to the STID voxel system in different
ways, determined by their characteristic structure and dynamics. For
instance, a greater number of unstructured coils will produce a greater
number of occupied voxels as the protein explores a relatively greater
region of the available space, but these will have smaller associated
nonzero STID values, decreasing <italic>D</italic><sub>avg.</sub>.
In previous electron density modeling and 3D reconstruction software
yielding volumetric representations, the choices of isovalue cutoff
to display isosurfaces have been arbitrary.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref></sup> Their choice is often chosen based on what is deemed by the authors
to be most appropriate for the work, with no clear link made between
a defining characteristic of a protein and the isosurface shown. In
contrast, this work has shown that our STID map-based representations
can be directly related to a physical and easily measurable quantity.</p>
    <p>We have then shown that STID map representations are suitable for
the definition of an accurate protein–protein docking scoring
function. To this end, we have performed a comprehensive set of benchmarks
to determine the optimal value of each parameter required for the
construction and usage of STID maps for protein docking. The results
show that JabberDock can provide predicted complexes on par with a
competitive range of blind protein–protein docking software
and is highly robust across a range of difficult cases—an achievement
not observed in other docking algorithms. The strength of JabberDock
to yield comparable results across the data set indicates that the
ability of the STID maps to encapsulate high-frequency atomic motions
accommodates for different amounts of flexibility in interacting proteins.
In the case of complexes characterized by flat and relatively featureless
binding sites, the surface complementarity function is likely to fail
in highlighting a single most suitable docking position. On the other
hand, when an interface is exceedingly complex, small perturbations
about the docked pose are likely to lead to clashes, hindering the
optimizer in its exploration of this region of the energy landscape.
These represent JabberDock’s boundary conditions. The successful
(and most typical) docking cases feature topographical complexities
that enable both the scoring function and the optimizer to work harmoniously
and effectively. This is the significant middle ground where the coupling
of POW<sup>er</sup> and STID maps provides excellent results, as indicated
by the prediction of accurate protein complexes for most of the benchmark.
These observations are expected to hold for any complex not requiring
refolding or domain-level movements at the interface between binding
partners.</p>
    <p>JabberDock utilizes two individual PDB files with
a well-parameterized
force field to generate STID maps. These are used to guide the docking
process, at the end of which all candidate models, typically several
thousand, are clustered and returned to the user (in this work, 300
solutions are returned). The models themselves are built using the
last snapshot from the pool of conformations explored by the binding
partners in their respective MD simulations. Combinations of other
conformations within the monomers’ simulations (see <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.jctc.9b00474/suppl_file/ct9b00474_si_001.pdf">Figure S9</ext-link>) and dimeric arrangements within the
full collection of candidate assemblies may be closer to that found
in the crystallized bound state. In future versions of JabberDock,
we will explore the possibility of leveraging on this additional source
of structural information to provide the user with more accurate models.</p>
    <p>We have observed that using a protein’s STID map reporting
on its dynamics when bound to an alternative complex can improve JabberDock’s
performance. While our benchmark shows that docking proteins represented
by the STID map of their monomeric state yield a good number of successes,
more accurate predictions may be obtained by harnessing the dynamics
of the bound complex. Other areas of future investigation will include
the adoption of different functions as a model for the pseudo-electron
density (e.g., a Lorentzian), using JabberDock for rescoring models
predicted by other protein docking methods, a reranking process building
upon our preliminary results on the usage of a dipole complementarity
score, the use of a different atomistic force field (including a polarizable
one) to explore the impact on the STID maps, and an additional post-processing
step based on MD or MC techniques to refine the best docking poses.
In this context, we also foresee that the use of optimization algorithms
requiring no weighting could be beneficial.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref></sup> Overall, enhancements in the scoring function and solutions reranking
will help improve the performance of JabberDock against cases with
low interface complexity, while refining the optimization engine will
reinforce its performance against cases with highly complex ones.</p>

      <p>An initial starting point
with the two input monomers’ center of mass centered at the
origin is used prior to generating any models. JabberDock uses a seven-dimensional
space for implementation comfort when roto-translating the STID maps:
three dimensions define ligand translation in the Cartesian space,
three dimensions define an axis of rotation for this ligand, and one
dimension defines a rotation angle around this axis. The translation
values are limited by the size of the receptor, the axis of rotation
is normalized (and thus has values ranging from −1 to 1), and
the rotation angle in radians ranges between 0 and 2π.</p>
      <p>In order to navigate the potential energy surface (PES) associated
with the scoring function (see the next section) and produce an ensemble
of possible docked poses, JabberDock leverages a distributed heuristic
global optimization algorithm featured in the POW<sup>er</sup> optimization
environment—PSO “kick and reseed” (PSO-KaR).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref></sup> PSO-KaR was used to explore the PES over 300
iterations using 80 randomly initialized agents (“particles”).
According to the “kick and reseed” procedure, particles
converging to a local minimum (i.e., with a velocity decaying to less
than 4% of the search space dimension in each direction) were randomly
restarted, and a repulsion potential placed at their convergence location.
The whole optimization process was repeated three times, with the
memory of previous repulsion potentials retained from one repetition
to the next. In sum, this docking procedure requires the evaluation
of 72 000 docking poses. To
obtain a diverse ensemble of solutions, 300 poses were finally selected
as representatives from the pool of poses having a positive score

      <title>Case Difficulty
Classification</title>
      <p>Protein–protein
docking cases are classified under three levels of difficulty which
is associated with their flexibility and the rmsd difference between
the Cα atoms at the interface after superposing the bound and
unbound interfaces. Cases can be classified as either rigid-body (or
easy), medium difficulty, or difficult. Easy cases are those with
minimal difference between the unbound crystallized structures and
the bound: usually &lt;1 Å difference. In medium cases, the rmsd
difference is between 1 Å and ∼2.5 Å. Finally, difficult
cases can be anything greater than 2.5 Å. Thus, the difficult
cases are accordingly significantly more difficult than the other
two, particularly given that the requirements for an acceptable success
are close to the upper boundaries that define the difficult cases.</p>

      <title>Assessment of Model Accuracy</title>
      <p>We use three metrics to
determine the quality of a model: the ratio of correct contact residues
(a valid contact defined as an atom within 5 Å of the binding
partner) to the number of residues in the predicted complex, <italic>f</italic><sub>nat</sub>, the rmsd between the α carbons of
the known crystal pose and the predicted pose, and the rmsd of the
two poses between the α carbons at the interface (defined as
within 10 Å of the binding partner). CAPRI guidelines specify
four levels of possible success criteria: (1) incorrect, where rmsd
&gt; 10.0 Å and interfacial rmsd &gt; 4.0 Å OR <italic>f</italic><sub>nat</sub> &lt; 0; (2) acceptable quality, where rmsd ≤
10.0 Å or interfacial rmsd ≤ 4.0 Å and 0.1 ≤ <italic>f</italic><sub>nat</sub> &lt; 0.3 OR <italic>f</italic><sub>nat</sub> ≥ 0.3 and rmsd &gt; 5.0 Å and interfacial rmsd &gt;
2.0 Å;
(3) intermediate quality, where rmsd ≤ 5.0 Å or interfacial
rmsd ≤ 2 Å and 0.3 ≤ <italic>f</italic><sub>nat</sub> &lt; 0.5 OR <italic>f</italic><sub>nat</sub> ≥ 0.5 and rmsd
&gt; 1.0 Å and interfacial rmsd &gt; 1.0 Å; and (4) high
quality,
where rmsd ≤ 1.0 Å and interfacial rmsd ≤ 1.0 Å
and <italic>f</italic><sub>nat</sub> ≥ 0.5. The protocol for
applying this list of inequalities follows the order provided, beginning
with defining the incorrect predictions. In the text, we qualify the
result of a test as of high, intermediate, or acceptable quality if
at least one in the top 10 ranked models matches the criteria above.</p>

      <title>Software Implementation</title>
      <p>Software to generate STID maps
is developed in Python, using numpy, scipy, and cython packages. An
automated bash script that prepares all the necessary GROMACS files
and runs them is used to generate the trajectories. JabberDock is
implemented as a POW<sup>er</sup> Python module. All software is freely
available at <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://github.com/degiacom/JabberDock">github.com/degiacom/JabberDock</ext-link>.</p>
