      <title>Abstract</title>
      <p>A major challenge in single-cell biology is identifying cell-type-specific gene functions, which may substantially improve precision medicine. Differential expression analysis of genes is a popular, yet insufficient approach, and complementary methods that associate function with cell type are required. Here, we describe scHumanNet (<ext-link xlink:href="https://github.com/netbiolab/scHumanNet" ext-link-type="uri">https://github.com/netbiolab/scHumanNet</ext-link>), a single-cell network analysis platform for resolving cellular heterogeneity across gene functions in humans. Based on cell-type-specific gene networks (CGNs) constructed under the guidance of the HumanNet reference interactome, scHumanNet displayed higher functional relevance to the cellular context than CGNs built by other methods on single-cell transcriptome data. Cellular deconvolution of gene signatures based on network compactness across cell types revealed breast cancer prognostic markers associated with T cells. scHumanNet could also prioritize genes associated with particular cell types using CGN centrality and identified the differential hubness of CGNs between disease and healthy conditions. We demonstrated the usefulness of scHumanNet by uncovering T-cell-specific functional effects of <italic toggle="yes">GITR</italic>, a prognostic gene for breast cancer, and functional defects in autism spectrum disorder genes specific for inhibitory neurons. These results suggest that scHumanNet will advance our understanding of cell-type specificity across human disease genes.</p>

    <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
    <p>Genes do not act in isolation, because the proteins they encode interact with each other and with other molecules. From the perspective of network biology, molecular interactions determine the function of each cell type (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). However, cell-type-specific molecular interactions are difficult to identify and interpret due to context dependency. The advent of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has enabled the characterization of distinct cell types from complex tissues, as well as the determination of their interactions within mixed-cell populations (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>).</p>
    <p>A major difficulty in cell-type-specific gene network (CGN) inference from single-cell transcriptome data is the lack of a gold standard for cell-type-specific gene interactions. Accordingly, researchers often use simulated synthetic networks (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). An evaluation using reference protein-protein interactions showed that most methods for network inference, including those developed for bulk RNA-seq data and scRNA-seq, were not capable of reconstructing accurate networks of gene interactions from scRNA-seq data (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). This poor performance is likely due to elevated sparsity (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>) and spurious technical variation (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>) among scRNA-seq data. To overcome this problem, an accurate network modeling method that uses scRNA-seq data to study cell-type-specific gene functions should be developed.</p>
    <p>Two approaches to network construction using single-cell transcriptome data exist: reference-free and reference-guided inference. The former, which is more popular, enables the discovery of gene interactions directly from single-cell transcriptome data, but it suffers from a generally high false-positive rate (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). In contrast, the reference-guided approach builds a network by filtering the reference interactome for a given transcriptome of context-associated single cells. Filtered interactions are highly likely to exist in a given cell type.</p>
    <p>Here, we describe scHumanNet, a computational platform for the reference-guided construction of CGNs using single-cell transcriptome data. As the reference interactome, we used HumanNet (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>), one of the best-performing human gene networks for disease gene predictions. We utilized a modified version of the SCINET algorithm (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Along with CGN construction, scHumanNet provides several analytical tools to aid the study of cell-type-specific effects of disease genes. Through network centrality analysis, we found that scHumanNet outperformed other single-cell network inference methods in retrieving cell-type-specific genes, suggesting it was suitable for the study of gene cell-type specificity. We demonstrated that genes relevant to the same cell type showed higher within-group connectivity (i.e. compactness) within the network. Utilizing network compactness across CGNs, we deconvolved breast cancer prognostic signatures into cell types and identified those associated with immune cells rather than cancer cells. We also found that the prognostic value of a known signature gene, <italic toggle="yes">GITR</italic>, was linked to T cells owing to its T-cell-specific centrality. Furthermore, we developed a statistical framework for differential centrality analysis that revealed cell-type-specific functional defects in disease genes. Applying this analytical framework to brain scRNA-seq data from autism studies, we found elevated dysregulation of the interaction networks in inhibitory and excitatory neurons of disease condition.</p>

    <title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title>
    <sec id="SEC2-1">
      <title>Single-cell transcriptome data for network construction</title>
      <p>To construct CGNs, we used scRNA-seq data generated from biopsy samples of breast, lung, colorectal, and ovarian cancers with cell type annotations obtained from Qian <italic toggle="yes">etÂ al.</italic> (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). For pan-cancer comparative network analysis, we focused on five major cell types in the tumor microenvironment: T cells, B cells, myeloid cells, cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), and endothelial cells (ECs). For the study of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), we constructed CGNs for cell types found in the brain using scRNA-seq data obtained from Velmeshev <italic toggle="yes">etÂ al.</italic> (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). The pre-annotated cell types were merged with more granular representations to include ECs, oligodendrocytes, astrocytes (AST-FB and AST-PP), microglia, inhibitory cells (IN-PV, IN-SST, IN-SV2CÂ and IN-VIP), excitatory cells (L2/3, L4, L5/6Â and L5/6-CC), and others (Neu-mat, Neu-NRGN-IÂ and Neu-NRGN-II).</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="SEC2-2">
      <title>Reference-free CGN construction with single-cell transcriptome data</title>
      <p>For network construction, we only considered protein-coding genes defined by the consensus coding sequence (CCDS) database. We built four variants of the co-expression networks, each of them based on each scRNA-seq dataset. In the first co-expression network, we calculated Pearson correlation coefficients (<italic toggle="yes">PCC</italic>) between gene pairs using a count matrix of single-cell transcriptome data, which was log-normalized by the <italic toggle="yes">NormalizeData()</italic> function of the Seurat package. Only links with <italic toggle="yes">PCC</italic>Â &gt;Â 0.8 were retained for the rawPCC network. The second type of co-expression network was based on the de-noised count matrix from MetaCell (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). To calculate the <italic toggle="yes">PCC</italic> between gene pairs, we used metacells generated with unified threshold and parameters. We discarded cells with fewer than 500 UMIs and used the parameters <italic toggle="yes">K</italic>Â =Â 30 and alphaÂ =Â 2 for <italic toggle="yes">mcell_mc_from_coclust_balanced()</italic>. The third type of co-expression network was based on a count matrix with imputation of dropouts by SAVER (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>) and exclusion of genes withÂ &gt;99% zero values. The last type of co-expression network was based on data transformation using bigSCale2 (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). The <italic toggle="yes">recursive</italic> method was used for the clustering parameter of <italic toggle="yes">compute.network()</italic>, and the PCC was calculated using the transformed <italic toggle="yes">Z</italic>-score matrix.</p>
      <p>The accuracy of co-expression networks based on metacells, SAVER, and bigSCale2 was evaluated using a Bayesian statistical framework and log likelihood score (<italic toggle="yes">LLS</italic>) (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). In this scheme, gold standard gene pairs were used to evaluate the likelihood of data-driven gene pairs such as co-expression links. In brief, for the prioritized gene pairs inferred from the given data (<italic toggle="yes">D</italic>), we calculated <italic toggle="yes">LLS</italic> for every 1,000 links sorted by the data intrinsic score using the following equation:<disp-formula><tex-math id="M0001" notation="LaTeX">\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

We used a set of 260 962 gold standard positive gene pairs obtained from HumanNet (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). A set of gold standard negative gene pairs was inferred as being composed of all links not included among gold standard positives.</p>
      <p>For the construction of CGNs using GRNboost2 (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>), 2416 transcription factors (TFs) gathered from previous publications (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>) were used as input, and the top 0.1% of links were retained for the final networks.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="SEC2-3">
      <title>Reference-guided CGN construction with single-cell transcriptome data</title>
      <p>scHumanNet was developed by modifying the SCINET framework (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>) which utilizes imputation, transformation, and normalization of scRNA-seq data. Single-cell gene expression data were pre-processed using the ACTIONet package (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). By identifying the archetypes within the scRNA-seq dataset, ACTIONet learns the dominant transcriptional patterns representative of cell types and states. This approach produces a transformed gene activity score matrix, which is the basis for inferring gene-pair interactions. For each gene pair from the gene score activity matrix, a minimum activity score threshold is applied to assess the strength of the interactions in a group of cells. If each gene in the examined interaction passes the threshold determined by the transformed cell type activity score and a link exists in the reference interactome, it is deemed cell-type-specific and retained in the resultant CGN. Although the SCINET package provides edge weights based on the aggregated <italic toggle="yes">P</italic>-value of a likelihood score, we used the <italic toggle="yes">LLS</italic> from our reference interactome, HumanNet, as the edge weight. The <italic toggle="yes">LLS</italic> for HumanNet edges was also calculated by Bayesian statistics as described above and in Supplementary Methods. We measured the network centrality of each gene based on the sum of <italic toggle="yes">LLSs</italic> to all its neighbors. Because the human interactome is biased towards the ribosome complex (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>), we excluded ribosomal proteins from the final candidate hub genes. HumanNet provides three-tire interactome models (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). We have tested all tiers of interactome models and found that the most extensive one, HumanNet-XC, gives best results in general. Therefore, we used the HumanNet-XC for scHumanNet.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="SEC2-4">
      <title>Significance test for network hubness</title>
      <p>The statistical significance of hub genes was calculated using the <italic toggle="yes">FindAllHub()</italic> function in the scHumanNet package. For each CGN, randomized networks were generated by swapping edges with equal probability using the <italic toggle="yes">igraph</italic> package function <italic toggle="yes">rewire()</italic>, and the centrality scores of all genes were collected. This process was iterated until at least 10 000 centrality scores were gathered, which were then used to generate a null distribution. By default, BenjaminiâHochberg correction was applied for each <italic toggle="yes">P</italic>-value, and hub genes with false discovery rate (FDR) &lt;0.05 were selected for each CGN.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="SEC2-5">
      <title>Predicting cell-type-specific genes for B and T cells</title>
      <p>To test the cell-type relevance of genes, we compiled T- and B-cell-associated genes from the Gene Ontology (GO) database. We used reliable annotations by considering only evidence based on traceable author statement (TAS), inferred from direct assay (IDA), inferred from mutant phenotype (IMP), or inferred from genetic interaction (IGI). By selecting GO term descriptions that contained either âT cellâ or âB cellâ, we obtained 289 genes associated with T cells and 89 with B cells. We conducted a similar compilation for other cell types but could not obtain enough associated genes for statistical testing. We identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs) using the function <italic toggle="yes">FindAllMarkers()</italic> from the Seurat v3.2.3 package with default parameters âwilcoxâ for <italic toggle="yes">test.use</italic>, â0.25â for <italic toggle="yes">logfc.threshold</italic>, and â0.1â for <italic toggle="yes">min.pct</italic>. We selected protein-coding DEGs with positive log-fold changes for B or T cells (<italic toggle="yes">q</italic>-valueÂ &lt;Â 0.05) as cell-type-specific genes. Finally, we measured the weighted degree centrality of genes using the sum of edge scores for other network construction methods: <italic toggle="yes">PCC</italic> (rawPCC, MetaCell, SAVERÂ and bigSCale2), importance score (GRNboost2), and weighted score (SCINET). Only significant DEGs and hub genes were used to compare cell-type relevance.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="SEC2-6">
      <title>Predicting cell-type-specific TFs</title>
      <p>TFs specific for B and T cells were obtained from the TF-Marker database (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>) and subsequently filtered using the TRRUST database (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>), resulting in 42 T-cell-associated TFs and 14 B-cell-associated TFs. The top 100 hub genes identified by scHumanNet were extracted from each cell type and filtered using the 2416 TFs collated from previous publications (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). The top 100 DEGs based on log-fold change values were selected and filtered using the same TF gene list. Hypergeometric tests were performed with all genes in HumanNet (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,593) as the gene space.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="SEC2-7">
      <title>Compactness analysis of gene sets to identify relevant cell types</title>
      <p>We implemented the <italic toggle="yes">Connectivity()</italic> function in scHumanNet to evaluate network compactness of a group of genes. Briefly, 10,000 random gene sets with the same number of genes as the test gene set were selected to generate a null model. To preserve the network topological properties for the random gene sets, we used rejection sampling, whereby we selected a gene withÂ Â±20% degree of connectivity for each real gene when permuting. Significance was measured using the rank of observed within-group connectivity in the null distribution. Genes that exert their function in a specific cell type tend to be connected to each other in a network specific to the cell type. The degree of compactness was measured using the significance of within-group connectivity. We performed compactness analysis for a set of immune checkpoint molecule (ICM) genes (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>) and 33 breast cancer prognostic signature gene sets collected from Huang <italic toggle="yes">etÂ al.</italic> (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). For the GGI97 signature, only 76 out of 97 genes were evaluated in this study because the others had been either discontinued or deprecated in the NCBI gene database (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table S1</xref>). Their relevance to the cell cycle was assessed using manual curation and accepted databases. Genes that were included in âCell Cycleâ of KEGG 2021, âG2-M Checkpointâ of MSigDB 2020Â and âCell Cycle Homo sapiensâ of Reactome DB 2016 were considered cell cycle-related. Other genes were curated manually, and those that included âDNA replicationâ and âmitotic spindleâ were also included. Of the 76 signature genes, 24 were detected in the breast cancer T-cell networkÂ and their functional connectivity was assessed through <italic toggle="yes">Connectivity()</italic> with default parameters.</p>

      <p>Only direct neighbors of the <italic toggle="yes">GITR</italic> gene in the T-cell network for breast cancer were considered connected to GGI97 signatures. TCGA data were downloaded through the GDC portal using the <italic toggle="yes">TCGAbiolinks</italic> R package.

The data were subsequently normalized using <italic toggle="yes">TCGAanalyze_Normalization()</italic>. The preprocessed count data were normalized with sample-specific size factors calculated using DESeq2. To identify genes indicative of good patient outcomes, we considered 23,192 genes from TCGA-derived expression matrix, of which 1,078 BRCA samples were separated based on the top 30th and bottom 30th percentile of test gene expression. <italic toggle="yes">P</italic>-values from the KaplanâMeier log test were corrected using the BenjaminiâHochberg method, yielding 236 genes with FDRÂ &lt;0.05, which were regarded as predictive of good prognosis. For survival analysis, samples were separated into high and low groups based on median <italic toggle="yes">GITR</italic> expression. The correlation between <italic toggle="yes">GITR</italic> expression for each bulk sample and the composition of T cells was calculated using the geometric mean of <italic toggle="yes">CD3D</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">CD3E</italic>Â and <italic toggle="yes">CD3G</italic>. The survival group was divided into high and low groups based on the median of either single gene expression or geometric mean expression of the gene set.

      <title>Differential centrality analysis for ASD genes</title>
      <p>For each CGN, the degree of centrality was assessed based on the sum of edge weights (<italic toggle="yes">LLS</italic>). Because network size affects the degree of centrality score, we used percentile ranks, whereby the most central gene had a value of 1 and the least central one had a value of 0. We assigned a value of 0 to genes that were not included in at least one of the networks. For each gene, we calculated the differential percentile rank of centrality (diffPR) by subtracting the percentile rank in the control network from the percentile rank in the disease network.<disp-formula><tex-math id="M0001a" notation="LaTeX">\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

      <title>scHumanNet effectively retrieves genes specific for each intratumoral cell type</title>
      <p>To evaluate whether CGNs obtained by scHumanNet (Figure <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">1A</xref>) were more suitable than those generated by other inference methods for the study of cell-type-specific gene functions, we compared various reference-free and reference-guided approaches. Using published breast cancer scRNA-seq data (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>), we constructed networks for T cells, B cells, myeloid cells, ECs, CAFs, and cancer cells using five reference-free methods, including rawPCC, MetaCell (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>), SAVER (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>), GRNboost2 (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>), and bigSCale2 (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>), as well as one reference-guided method, SCINET (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>) based on PCNet (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). Network size across cell types and network inference methods varied widely (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table S2</xref>). Although GRNBoost2 is a network inference method restricted to TF-target regulatory interactions, we included the method in our comparison because it is the base algorithm for SCENIC (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>), a widely applied network modeling method in single-cell biology. The network construction methods compared vary in terms of what types of interactions they consider, and we found that for scHumanNet a wide definition of interactions, which includes evidence based on functional relations, allowed for the best results.</p>

      <p>The functional importance of network nodes is measured by their centrality. Cell-type-specific genes presumably play important roles in the corresponding cell types. Therefore, we expected that genes with high centrality values in each CGN were enriched for cell-type-specific genes. Using weighted degree centrality based on the edge scores of each network, we compared the top 100 genes from each network. In this way, we could disregard differences in network size. Interestingly, not much overlap was observed between any of the six network construction methods when assessing the top 100 hub genes for each cell type (Figure <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">1B</xref>, <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S1</xref>), and this pattern remained the same with top 50 and 200 hub genes (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S2</xref>) To determine if the hub genes were prioritized for cell-type-specific functions, we assessed the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) score for each cell-type-specific entry. Using the Azimuth celltype database (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>), which contains signature marker genes extracted from large scRNA-seq datasets, we observed a higher retrieval rate of cell-type signature genes by centrality in reference-guided CGNs than in reference-free CGNs (Figure <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">1C</xref>). Similarly, the association between the top 100 hub genes and each of the Azimuth cell-type signature genes tended to be stronger in CGNs generated via reference-guided methods than in those that relied on reference-free methods (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S3</xref>). Among reference-guided CGNs, scHumanNet prioritized cell-type-specific genes better than SCINET, especially among B and T cells. These results suggest that scHumanNet is superior to other CGN construction methods in retrieving cell-type-specific functions of human genes. We also found that scHumaNet prediction for cell-type-specific genes is robust against contamination of other immune cell subsets from the same dataset (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Methods</xref> and <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S4</xref>).</p>

      <title>scHumanNet reveals commonality and differences among CGNs across cancer types</title>
      <p>The function of tumor-infiltrating cells in cancer is often investigated using cell-type-specific gene expression. Here, we show that network biology can complement expression-based functional studies. To this end, we used scHumanNet to construct CGNs for T cells, B cells, myeloid cells, ECs, CAFs, and cancer cells from breast, colorectal, lung, and ovarian cancers. Next, we examined whether these CGNs could provide functional insights linked to cell type or disease status. Statistics for CGNs relative to each cancer type are summarized in <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table S3</xref>. Network comparisons across different types of non-cancerous cells revealed that only a minor portion of nodes and edges was shared across cell types in all cancers (Figure <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2A</xref>, <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">B</xref>); whereas a large portion was shared across cancer types (Figure <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2C</xref>, <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">D</xref>; <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figures 5, 6</xref>). These results indicate that CGNs generated by scHumanNet are shaped primarily by the cellular context rather than the disease or tissue context. Notably, the ratio of unique edges to shared edges across cancer typesÂ was larger than that of unique nodes to shared nodes in all cell types, indicating that networks for the same cell type are rewired in different tissue and disease contexts.</p>

      <title>scHumanNet centrality and compactness predict cell-type specificity of gene functions</title>
      <p>Rewiring gene interactions in different cell types might change the network centrality of genes with differential functional importance across cellular contexts. Given that hub genes with a high degree of centrality interact with many other genes in a given cellular context, we hypothesized that they were more likely to play important roles in maintaining functions specific to the given cell type. Therefore, we investigated whether scHumanNet hub genes for each type of tumor-infiltrating cell could reflect cell context-dependent functional importance across cancer types. To evaluate cell-type specificity, we utilized the GO database to collate genes reliably associated with either B or T cells (Materials andÂ Methods). Next, we assessed the power of scHumanNet to predict genes specific for each cell type based on overlap with genes known to function in B or T cells. Notably, the network-based and expression-based candidate genes specific for each cell type showed low concordance (0.05â0.13 Jaccard similarity index), indicating complementarity of the two predictions (Figure <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3A</xref>, <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S7</xref>). Moreover, the intersection between the two predictions showed strong overlap with known cell-type-specific genes. Interestingly, for the most part, network-based predictions showed a similar or higher overlap with known cell-type-specific genes than expression-based predictions, further confirming that scHumanNet hub genes could effectively identify cell-type-specific genes.</p>

      <p>We anticipated that ICMs would be enriched among genes specific for tumor-infiltrating cells. Hence, we compiled 43 previously identified ICMs (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table S4</xref>) (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>) and compared their overlap with scHumanNet hubs and DEGs across cell types. For all cell types, we observed higher retrieval of ICMs by scHumanNet hub genes than by DEGs (Figure <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3B</xref>). Notably, in all cancer types and cell types, the ICMs retrieved by DEGs were subsets of those retrieved by scHumanNet (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Data S1</xref>).</p>
      <p>We prioritized genes using weighted degree of centrality in the CGNs constructed by scHumanNet and found that it was highly predictive of cell-type-specific hallmark genes (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Data S2</xref>). Based on this observation, we chose to more closely investigate TFs, which are key determinants for the differentiation and maintenance of particular cell identities. Cell-type-specific differential expression analysis is often insufficient to detect TFs for a given cell type because of a generally low basal level of expression. Instead, a network-based approach has been widely used to infer TF-target interactions (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). We hypothesized that network centrality in CGNs could effectively prioritize TFs specific for a certain cell type. To evaluate the prediction of TFs specific for cell types by DEGs and scHumanNet centrality, we retrieved cell-type-specific TFs from TF-Marker (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>), a manually curated cell-type-specific TF database. Because of the limited number of entries, we could analyze only TFs specific for B and T cells. By comparing the enrichment of known cell-type-specific TFs among the top 100 prioritized genes by scHumanNet centrality with those identified by differential expression, we found that the network-based approach was consistently better at prioritizing TFs in both B and T cells across cancer types (Materials andÂ Methods, <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Data S3</xref>).</p>
      <p>We also found that scHumanNet centrality could predict cell-type-specific disease-associated genes. For example, the top 15 hub genes in T cells from all types of cancers included those involved in cell-mediated immunity (<italic toggle="yes">GZMB</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">PRF1</italic>Â and <italic toggle="yes">IFNG</italic>) and immune checkpoint signaling pathways (<italic toggle="yes">TIGIT</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">CTLA4</italic>) (Figure <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3C</xref>, <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S8</xref>, <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Data S2</xref>). Notably, four of the five hallmark genes for T-cell immunity (<italic toggle="yes">PFR1</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">IFNG</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">TIGIT</italic>Â and <italic toggle="yes">CTLA4</italic>) were not found among the top 50 DEGs (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Data S4</xref>). In B cells, <italic toggle="yes">TLR7</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">TLR9</italic> were found to be pan-cancer central genes but were not detected as DEGs. In myeloid cells, the top 50 pan-cancer central genes included seven genes involved in myeloid cell differentiation (<italic toggle="yes">CD4</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">FCER1G</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">IRF8</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">TYROBP</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">TLR2</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">TREM2</italic>Â and <italic toggle="yes">ITGAM</italic>), but only two of them (<italic toggle="yes">FCER1G</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">TYROBP</italic>) were found among the top 50 DEGs. In CAFs from ovarian cancer, but not from other cancer types, 11 aldehyde dehydrogenase genes (<italic toggle="yes">ALDH1L1</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">ALDH1L2</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">ALDH3A2</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">ALDH1A3</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">ALDH1A1</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">ALDH1A2</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">ALDH2</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">ALDH1B1</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">ALDH4A1</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">ALDH9A1</italic>Â and <italic toggle="yes">ALDH6A1</italic>) were prioritized in the top 100 hub genes by scHumanNet. Aldehyde dehydrogenase has been associated with poor survival as it promotes tumor growth in ovarian cancer (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). Notably, none of the 11 aldehyde dehydrogenase genes were among the top 100 DEGs in CAFs from ovarian cancer. The <italic toggle="yes">NOTCH1</italic> gene is expressed in ECs, where it promotes metastasis (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). We found <italic toggle="yes">NOTCH1</italic> among the top 20 hub genes in endothelial CGNs for all four cancer types (7th for breast, 13th for colorectal, 11th for lungÂ and 19th for ovarian cancers), but not among the top 200 DEGs in all cancer types. These results suggest that network centrality using scHumanNet can be more effective than differential expression analysis in identifying genes that play important roles in a given cellular context. These results also suggest that <italic toggle="yes">FindAllHubs()</italic> in scHumanNet can identify hub genes with cell-type-specific functions in both healthy and disease contexts.</p>
      <p>Rewiring molecular networks across different cell types may result in differential within-group connectivity (or compactness), which can also be used to estimate functional relevance. As a proof-of-concept, we utilized ICM genes and genes specific to B and T cells. The <italic toggle="yes">Connectivity()</italic> function in scHumanNet tests the significance of within-group connectivity against a nonparametric null model using restricted random sampling that does not require the identification of optimal parameters (Methods). As expected, ICM genes and those specific for B and T cells were associated with T-, B-Â and T-cell types, respectively, in all cancer types (Figure <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3D</xref>). This suggests that the network-based approach provides a complementary and intuitive method for assigning gene sets to functionally relevant cell types based on compactness.</p>

      <title>Cell type deconvolution of cancer prognostic signatures using scHumanNet</title>
      <p>ICMs showed the highest compactness in the T-cell network, which is consistent with their cellular role. We hypothesized that we might deconvolve disease-associated gene signatures obtained from bulk tissues into individual cell types using their network compactness across CGNs by scHumanNet. For example, cancer prognostic signatures are presumably associated with cancer cells because they are typically identified in tumor tissues. However, tumor tissues often contain also non-cancerous cells, such as stromal and immune cells, and some prognostic genes may exert their functions in non-cancerous cells of the tumor microenvironment. To test this hypothesis, we examined 33 prognostic signatures reported in breast cancer (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). We measured the normalized within-group-connectivity of each prognostic signature across the CGNs using scHumanNet (Figure <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">4A</xref>). As expected, we observed strong network compactness for many prognostic signatures from non-cancerous cells, particularly from T cells for the âT-cell metagene signatureâ (Tcell) (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>), â97-gene genomic grade indexâ (GGI97) (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>), â127-gene classifierâ (Robust) (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>), and â64-gene expression signatureâ (Pawitan) (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). These results indicate that T-cell function may in part account for the clinical outcomes of breast cancer.</p>

      <p>Next, we focused on the GGI97 signature (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S9A</xref>), which has been extensively studied and clinically validated to have an inverse correlation with survival and a positive association with chemotherapy response (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). GGI97 genes were mostly associated with the cell cycle and G2/M checkpoint pathways (47/76 genes) (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Data S5</xref>). Additionally, the 24 GGI97 genes detected in the T-cell network were closely connected to each other (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic>Â =Â 0.0001) (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S9B, C</xref>) and significantly enriched in cell cycle-related functions (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic>Â =Â 0.0075 by hypergeometric test) (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table S1</xref>), suggesting a role for T cell cycle control in antitumor activity.

In particular, genes directly connected to GGI97 signature genes were enriched in the T cell receptor signaling pathway (Figure <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">4B</xref>), indicating that a high GGI97 score primed the immune system for a better response to chemotherapy (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>).</p>

The GGI97 signature is associated with poor survival, which was confirmed by the median expression of GGI97 genes in TCGA-BRCA samples (Figure <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">4D</xref>). To understand the role of GGI97 genes in T cells, we examined the top 10 hub genes directly connected to GGI97 genes in the T-cell network.

Importantly, the expression of <italic toggle="yes">GITR</italic> did not correlate with the abundance of T cells (Methods), ensuring that we observed the cellular effect of <italic toggle="yes">GITR</italic> regardless of T-cell composition in each tumor sample (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S9E</xref>). <italic toggle="yes">GITR</italic> has a co-stimulatory role (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>) which is essential for CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells to mount an antitumor immune response. When T cells bind to the ligand <italic toggle="yes">GITRL</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">GITR</italic> promotes the proliferation of effector T cells and dampens the suppressive activity of regulatory T cells (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). The GGI97 signature is predictive of chemotherapy responses. Chemotherapy can promote the cancer-immunity cycle by releasing neoantigens from dead cancer cells. Thus, the beneficial effect of <italic toggle="yes">GITR</italic> can be explained in terms of antitumor immunity. Moreover, we believe that the prognostic effect of the GGI97 signature in chemotherapy is tied to T-cell function via <italic toggle="yes">GITR</italic>. Consistent with our results, <italic toggle="yes">GITRL</italic> combined with anti-PD1 immunotherapy was shown to be effective against breast cancer, resulting in enhanced T-cell activation, proliferation, and memory differentiation (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>). Taken together, our findings demonstrate that scHumanNet can deconvolve cancer prognostic signatures into cell types and identify key targets for therapeutic approaches in specific cell types.</p>

      <title>Identification of disease-associated cell types using differential hubness analysis in scHumanNet</title>
      <p>Another application of scHumanNet is the identification of differential hubs, that is, genes whose centrality changes significantly between two biological contexts, such as disease and healthy conditions. The <italic toggle="yes">FindDiffHub()</italic> function in scHumanNet assigns ranks to the genes based on the degree of centrality in each context-specific network, and then identifies those genes whose percentile rank has changed significantly compared to a null model. In addition, the <italic toggle="yes">TopDiffHub()</italic> function allows users to extract the top <italic toggle="yes">n</italic> differentially ranked genes (Materials andÂ Methods). Using differential hubness analysis with scHumanNet, we investigated ASD, a neurodevelopmental disorder with strong heritability (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>). ASD is characterized by difficult social interaction and communication, repetitive behavior, and/or sensory susceptibility, and is likely to have many different genetic and environmental causes. A large cohort study by the SFARI consortium identified 1231 genes (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>). However, the mechanisms of action of most genes remain poorly understood. We hypothesized that, in the disease condition, perturbation of SFARI genes could result in cell-type-specific loss of wild-type molecular interactions. Thus, a decrease in network centrality could point to disease-associated cell types. Using a published dataset containing 104 559 cells from 15 donors diagnosed with ASD and 16 matching controls (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>), we constructed seven CGNs for both healthy and disease conditions (Figure <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">5A</xref>, <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table S5</xref>, Materials andÂ Methods). We found that the scHumanNet hub genes for each cell type were relevant to cell-type-specific functions (Figure <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">5B</xref>). For example, the NMDA receptor subunit <italic toggle="yes">GRIN2B</italic> is a hub gene in both excitatory and inhibitory neurons, and the TF <italic toggle="yes">SOX9</italic> is a hub gene in astrocytes (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>). We also observed <italic toggle="yes">CD163</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">FCER1G</italic>Â and <italic toggle="yes">CD14</italic> as hub genes in microglia (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>). Interestingly, unlike the immune cell dataset, whereby a few hub genes were also detected as marker genes via DEGs, most hub genes of the brain scHumanNets were not prioritized via differential expression analysis (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Data S6</xref>) and, indeed, showed minimal overlap with cell-type-specific DEGs (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S10</xref>).</p>

      </fig>
      <p>Our analysis also revealed that many genes differed significantly in terms of network centrality between the control and disease conditions, despite modest fold changes (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S11A</xref>). By assessing genes with the highest differences in centrality rank via <italic toggle="yes">FindDiffHub()</italic> with default parameters (Methods), we found that differential hubs from excitatory and inhibitory neurons were significantly enriched with SFARI genes, which contrasted with DEGs being found mostly in ECs and astrocytes (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Data S7, S8</xref>). In particular, the highest overlap between differential hub genes and SFARI genes was observed in excitatory neurons (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Data S8</xref>), although several key ASD genes, including <italic toggle="yes">GRIN2B</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">MECP2</italic> (<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>), were found as differential hubs in inhibitory neurons. Even though <italic toggle="yes">GRIN2B</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">MECP2</italic> are expressed in both excitatory and inhibitory neurons, they were found to be differential hubs only in the latter (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S11B</xref>), implying that they may be functionally more important in inhibitory neurons. This finding has been experimentally validated in a mouse model (<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>) and suggested by a human study (<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>), in which inhibitory neurons were enriched for overexpressed SFARI genes. Similarly, for <italic toggle="yes">CACNA1A</italic>, we found that although it was not differentially expressed in inhibitory neurons (Figure <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">5C</xref>), there was a significant difference in terms of network centrality (Figure <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">5D</xref>), and many of the functional interactions were lost in the ASD inhibitory neuron network. The interacting genes were mostly associated with ion channels (Figure <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">5E</xref>), suggesting that the function of neural regulation, especially in inhibitory neurons, might be impaired by <italic toggle="yes">CACNA1A</italic> loss-of-function mutations (<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>). These results demonstrated that differential hubness analysis using scHumanNet could reveal disease-associated cell types.</p>
      <p>Finally, we investigated whether genes with high centrality in healthy conditions but low centrality in disease conditions might provide insights regarding cell-type-specific disease mechanisms (Methods). We found that excitatory neurons, inhibitory neurons, and oligodendrocyte progenitor cells had the highest frequency of loss-of-function genes compared to other cell types (Figure <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">5F</xref>). Notably, genes with high centrality in disease but low centrality in healthy controls were less frequent across all cell types (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S12A</xref>). Gene set enrichment analysis of hubs lost in neurons revealed that their function was primarily associated with neuronal activity (Figure <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">5G</xref>). For inhibitory neurons, the hub genes lost under healthy conditions were enriched in âincreased anxiety-related responseâ (MGI Phenotype), âanterograde trans-synaptic signalingâ (GOBP), and âligand-gated cation channel activityâ (GOMF). In excitatory neurons, the genes that lost centrality were enriched in âchemical synaptic transmissionâ (GOBP), âdopamine receptors signalingâ (Elsevier Pathway Collection)Â and âprotein secretionâ (MSigDB Hallmark). These results imply that, in disease conditions, these hub genes lost most of their interactions with other genes, resulting in the dysregulation of neuronal function in ASD. In contrast, genes that became more central in ASD networks were not enriched in pathways related to neuronal function (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S12B</xref>).</p>

    <title>DISCUSSION</title>
    <p>An important goal of single-cell biology is resolving the cellular heterogeneity of human diseases. Single-cell gene expression analysis may enable the identification of disease-associated cell types based on the differential expression of disease-associated genes in specific cell types. In the present study, we described scHumanNet, a computational platform for network-based analysis of cell-type specificity, which can complement expression-based approaches. The core component of this platform is the reconstruction of CGNs, gene network specific to distinct cell types. Single-cell transcriptome data have been utilized to construct CGNs with either reference-guided or reference-free network inference methods. The evaluation of inferred CGNs is not a trivial task because of the lack of high-quality and experimentally validated gene-gene interactions for particular cell types. In fact, because of the high false positive rate of inferred gene-gene interactions from single-cell transcriptome data, functional hypotheses from these networks are generally based on a group of edges rather than individual ones. Here, we validated the quality of CGNs by the retrieval of cell-type-specific genes among hub genes and network compactness of functional genes in the corresponding cell types. In the present study, we compared various approaches for CGN inference from single-cell transcriptome data and found that reference-guided methods outperformed reference-free methods. These results can be explained by the noisy and sparse nature of single-cell transcriptome data, which generate many false-positive gene-gene interactions (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Furthermore, among the two reference-guided CGN analysis platforms, scHumanNet was superior to SCINET. Although they utilized the same network inference algorithm, they employed different reference interactomes. Previously, we demonstrated that HumanNet, the reference interactome of scHumanNet, performed significantly better than other human gene networks, including the reference interactome of SCINET, in predicting disease genes (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). This indicates that the quality of the reference interactome is key to the performance of reference-guided CGNs, and future improvement of the former will further ameliorate CGNs.</p>
    <p>In this study, we have demonstrated two applications of CGNs in the investigation of cell-type specificity of human disease genes. First, the effects of disease genes can be deconvolved into cell types based on the network compactness of a group of disease genes across CGNs. For example, cell-type deconvolution of breast cancer prognostic signatures showed high compactness not only in cancer cells but also in other tumor-infiltrating cells such as immune cells. The importance of T cells in antitumor activity may account for the large functional bias of prognostic genes towards T cells. Indeed, one of the identified hub genes was <italic toggle="yes">GITR</italic>, a T-cell-specific regulator that plays an important role in the survival of patients with breast cancer. We believe that our network-based approach for associating gene sets with cell types can complement expression-based methods, such as GSVA (<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>) and scfind (<xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>). In the future, we may expand the scHumanNet platform to systematic cell type deconvolution of disease gene sets for all cell types of each tissue and thus generate CGNs for human cell atlas data. Second, we utilized CGNs to identify disease-associated cell types based on differential hubness between disease and healthy conditions across cell types. Therefore, the scHumanNet platform allows the analysis of differential hub genes. Using the scHumanNet pipeline, we identified inhibitory neurons as a major cell type associated with ASD. These results suggest that a network-based approach can complement an expression-based approach to identify disease-associated cell types using single-cell transcriptome data.</p>
    <p>There are some limitations to scHumanNet. Although our results suggest that the reference-guided method yields more biologically relevant CGNs, it comes at the expense of being unable to discover novel interactions specific for the cell type. In addition, cell type deconvolution may be unreliable with a small group of genes (e.g. a set of three genes) because a statistical test for network compactness requires a relatively large number of genes to ensure a sufficient degree of confidence. Further studies are required to address these shortcomings.</p>
    <p>In conclusion, we present scHumanNet, a computational platform for single-cell network biology, capable of resolving the cellular heterogeneity of disease-related gene functions. We demonstrate that scHumanNet can deconvolve the functional effect of disease gene sets into cell types and identify disease-associated cell types via topological analysis of CGNs. These results suggest that scHumanNet will boost our understanding of cell-type specificity of human disease genes and thus advance precision medicine.</p>
