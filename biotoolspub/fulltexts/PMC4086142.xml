      <p>High-throughput experimental technologies gradually shift the paradigm of
                    biological research from hypothesis-validation toward hypothesis-generation
                    science. Translating diverse types of large-scale experimental data into
                    testable hypotheses, however, remains a daunting task. We previously
                    demonstrated that heterogeneous genomics data can be integrated into a single
                    genome-scale gene network with high prediction power for ribonucleic acid
                    interference (RNAi) phenotypes in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, a
                    popular metazoan model in the study of developmental biology, neurobiology and
                    genetics. Here, we present WormNet version 3 (v3), which is a new
                    network-assisted hypothesis-generating server for <italic>C. elegans</italic>.
                    WormNet v3 includes major updates to the base gene network, which substantially
                    improved predictions of RNAi phenotypes. The server generates various gene
                    network-based hypotheses using three complementary network methods: (i) a
                    phenotype-centric approach to ‘find new members for a pathway’;
                    (ii) a gene-centric approach to ‘infer functions from network
                    neighbors’ and (iii) a context-centric approach to ‘find
                    context-associated hub genes’, which is a new method to identify key
                    genes that mediate physiology within a specific context. For example, we
                    demonstrated that the context-centric approach can be used to identify potential
                    molecular targets of toxic chemicals. WormNet v3 is freely accessible at

    <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
    <p><italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> has many advantages, such as genetic
                manipulability, as a model organism for the study of development, neuroscience, and
                other complex metazoan phenotypes. The study of <italic>C. elegans</italic> has
                provided numerous insights for human disease research because many human disease
                pathways have been conserved in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Mapping gene-to-phenotype associations is widely
                considered to be the first step toward understanding the genetic organization of
                such phenotypes (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Testing loss-of-function
                phenotypes has been a major approach to mapping gene-to-phenotype associations. Gene
                loss-of-function can be tested by either the disruption of coding deoxyribonucleic
                acid (DNA) (knockout) or the inhibition of messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA)
                translation (knockdown). <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> has been a favored
                model in animal genetics research due to an efficient knockdown protocol based on
                RNA interference (RNAi) (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). In addition,
                recently developed CRISPR-Cas9 systems enable high-throughput gene knockouts in
                    <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Testing
                all ∼20 000 genes of the <italic>C. elegans</italic> genome, however, is
                expensive and may require years of screening experiments with potentially many false
                negatives. Bioinformatics tools to prioritize candidate genes or phenotypes are
                therefore highly desired. </p>
    <p>Gene networks are useful for identifying novel genes that are associated with
                specific phenotypes, including for human diseases, because genes for the same
                loss-of-function phenotypes (e.g. diseases) tend to be proximal in a co-functional
                network (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Network-assisted hypothesis
                generation has proven effective in the identification of genes associated with
                phenotypes in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. The gene network model, WormNet (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>), and
                network-assisted prediction methods have been previously implemented as a web
                server. Since the publication of the last version of the WormNet web server, WormNet
                version 2 (v2) (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>), major updates to publicly
                available genomics data as well as algorithms for mapping co-functional gene links
                have occurred. For example, while WormNet v2 contains co-expression links derived
                mainly from low quality spotted microarray platforms, the publicly available Gene
                Expression Omnibus (GEO) database (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>)
                currently contains more than 1600 <italic>C. elegans</italic> expression profiles
                derived from Affymetrix DNA chips, a platform that provides more statistically
                controllable data. An update of WormNet to incorporate these new data and algorithms
                would therefore further improve the prediction power of our network-assisted
                prediction server.</p>
    <p>Here, we present the web server, WormNet v3, which updates the base gene network as
                well as the prediction methods from previous versions. The updates in WormNet v3
                substantially improve the prediction power for RNAi phenotypes. A new prediction
                method, ‘find context-associated hub genes’, that can identify key
                player genes that mediate physiology within a particular biological context,
                including chemical intoxication, is also introduced in WormNet v3.</p>
  </sec>
  <sec id="SEC2">
    <title>UPDATES TO THE BASE GENE NETWORK</title>
    <p>The base gene network for our network-assisted prediction server is constructed by
                training heterogeneous genomics data using machine learning techniques. The
                prediction power of this server is determined mainly by the quality of the base gene
                network. There are three major components that influence the quality of gene
                networks constructed by machine learning approaches: the training data, the raw
                input data and the linkage mapping algorithms. We have revised all three components
                in WormNet v3. These changes are summarized in Supplementary Table S1; a few of
                these changes are highlighted below.</p>
    <p>To develop the training data for WormNet v3, we excluded gene pairs that share gene
                ontology biological process (GO-BP) terms based on the IMP (inferred from mutant
                phenotype) evidence code. Many GO-BP annotations for <italic>C. elegans</italic>
                genes have been inferred from mutant phenotypes. We noticed that most GO-BP terms
                for <italic>C. elegans</italic> phenotypes are related to the organism-level
                morphology. We presumed that identical organism-level morphology may result from
                perturbations of genes in unrelated molecular pathways. For example, defects in
                embryo development, larval development, growth, reproduction, locomotion and body
                morphogenesis may result from dysfunctions in functionally unrelated molecular
                pathways. Pairing genes by mutant phenotypes would therefore generate many
                between-pathway links. Because the ultimate aim is to reconstruct molecular pathways
                via co-functional gene networks, these gene pairs that share GO-BP terms based on
                IMP were excluded from the training data for the new gene network. Using this
                modification on the training data, we generated 78 739 positive and 2 909 054
                negative gold standard gene pairs. The likelihood scores for co-functional links
                between genes were calculated using a Bayesian statistics approach in which each
                link was assigned a log likelihood score (LLS) as for the previous network (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>).</p>
    <p>The most notable update to the raw input data is the use of new gene expression data
                for the co-expression networks. Over the past several years, a large amount of
                expression data has been generated by commercial DNA chips, which provide more
                robust signals and more sophisticated statistical analysis packages. We analyzed 34
                expression sets that contained no less than 10 gene expression samples (862 samples
                in total) from Affymetrix DNA chips (GPL200 platform of GEO) and constructed
                co-expression networks as for the previous network (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>) from 12 sets containing 456 samples in total (GSE numbers are listed
                in Supplementary Table S1). Similar co-expression networks were constructed for
                    <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Drosophila melanogaster</italic>,
                    <italic>Danio rerio</italic> and <italic>Homo sapiens</italic>, and these
                co-expression links were transferred to <italic>C. elegans</italic> by orthology
                    (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). The number of
                protein–protein interactions in the raw input data also was increased
                significantly due to the improved databases and newly reported large-scale
                interaction data (summarized in Supplementary Table S1). We also improved methods
                for linkage mapping based on gene neighborhood (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>) and phylogenetic profiles (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>) as described in the Supplementary Online Methods.</p>
    <p>A total of 19 different data types derived from five different species were
                integrated by a weighted sum method as for the previous network (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>), which resulted in a gene network of 762 822 links
                that cover 16 347 <italic>C. elegans</italic> genes [i.e. 80.2% of the 20 389 coding
                genome in WormBase220 (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>)]. The list of
                edges in the integrated network as well as details about all 19 individual networks,
                which have been derived from different data types, are available for download from
                the ‘network download’ page. Compared with the previous gene
                network, the genome coverage of the new network increased from 74.5 to 80.2% (1208
                additional genes) while the number of network links was reduced. We also found that
                171 291 links and 13 469 genes were common between WormNet v2 and v3, 822 076 links
                and 1670 genes from WormNet v2 were excluded from WormNet v3 and 591 531 new links
                and 2878 new genes were added to WormNet v3 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1a</xref>). To test whether these changes improved the overall prediction power
                of our server, we measured network precision by computing the proportion of the
                network gene pairs that share the same RNAi phenotypes for different coding genome
                coverage. We used a total of 478 RNAi phenotype sets, which contained between 5 and
                500 genes, collected from WormBase239 (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>).
                From this assessment, we found that the network precision is significantly improved
                in WormNet v3 and that this improvement is largely attributable to the new links
                included in WormNet v3 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1b</xref>). This large
                change in network links but not in prediction power may be explained by the fact
                that pathway genes can remain well-connected by different sets of links.</p>

                        which contain between 5 and 500 genes, collected from WormBase239 (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Network precision was measured by
                        calculating the percentage of gene pairs that share RNAi phenotypes for
                        different coverage of the coding genome. WormNet v3 shows superior
                        performance over the entire range of the genome coverage. The assessment of
                        new links in WormNet v3 (WormNet v3 specific links) and the excluded old
                        links (WormNet v2 specific links) confirmed that the improved precision of
                        WormNet v3 is attributable to the new network links that have been included
                        in this update.</p>

    <title>NETWORK-ASSISTED PREDICTION METHODS</title>
    <p>The WormNet v3 server generates new hypotheses using three complementary network
                methods, which are illustrated in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2a</xref>.
                For each prediction method, WormNet v3 server provides a toy example for a test run.
                The first method, ‘find new members for a pathway’, is a
                phenotype-centric method. This approach predicts new candidate genes for a phenotype
                using known genes for that phenotype, namely seed genes, which are submitted by the
                user. The server returns the top 200 ranked candidate genes for the phenotype of
                interest using the sum of the network edge weights (i.e. the LLS) on all the
                submitted seed genes. The WormNet v3 server also reports the network prediction
                power for the submitted seed genes using a receiver operating characteristic (ROC)
                curve, the results of which are summarized as a single score, the area under the ROC
                curve (AUC). Perfect prediction power results in an AUC equal to 1 and predictions
                that represent random chance result in an AUC equal to 0.5. Generally, an AUC that
                is &gt;0.7 indicates good prediction power. If a high AUC is observed for the
                submitted seed genes, then the predicted candidate genes are more likely to show the
                mutant phenotype upon perturbation.</p>

                        that are returned by the ‘find context-associated hub genes’
                        method. The analysis returned a table of hub genes that are predicted to be
                        associated with the biological context characterized by the submitted
                        differentially expressed genes (DEGs). If a user clicks a candidate hub
                        (e.g. C14C10.1 shown in the table), a new web page displays the network of
                        the hub gene and its neighbors. The network shows all links among the
                        submitted DEGs as well as links from the hub to its neighbors that overlap
                        with the given DEGs. By clicking a node or an edge of the network, users can
                        also view in the lower panel detailed information about the gene or the
                        co-functional link.</p>

      <graphic xlink:href="gku367fig2"/>
    </fig>
    <p>The second prediction method, ‘infer functions from network
                neighbors’, is a gene-centric approach that predicts GO-BP functional terms
                for a query gene that is submitted by the user. The server collects all annotated
                GO-BP terms for the query gene from connected network neighbors and ranks the GO-BP
                terms using the sum of the network edge weights (i.e. the LLS) on genes annotated by
                each GO-BP term. The server returns the top 10 GO-BP terms as candidate functions
                for the query gene.</p>
    <p>These two methods existed in previous versions of WormNet. A new network prediction
                method has been incorporated in WormNet v3. This method is based on a
                context-centric approach, ‘find context-associated hub genes’ that
                can predict important genes for a given biological context. For this analysis, the
                server uses pre-defined subnetworks, which are composed of a hub gene and its
                connected neighbors. These hub genes are hubs for each of the subnetworks, not for
                the whole gene network. In the new base gene network, we considered only subnetworks
                for hub genes that have no &gt;15 neighbors connected by LLS &gt; 1, which
                resulted in 7025 hub genes for the subsequent analyzes. Users initiate a prediction
                by submitting a set of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) that characterize the
                biological context. For example, the DEGs of <italic>C. elegans</italic> that have
                been exposed to toxic chemicals can characterize the context of intoxication for the
                organism. The server measures the association between the hub genes and the context
                by statistical enrichment of the hub's neighbors among the submitted DEGs using
                Fisher's exact test, and returns all hub genes that are significantly associated
                with the context (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2b</xref>). In addition, the
                expression level of some of the important genes for a particular biological context
                may change. Therefore, the context-centric prediction method often ranks DEGs
                highly, which highlights the ability of this method to predict important genes. A
                more detailed description of the concepts underlying the context-centric prediction
                method is provided in the Supplementary Online Methods (Supplementary Figure
                S1).</p>

    <title>CASE STUDIES</title>
    <p>To demonstrate the feasibility of useful hypothesis generation by the three
                network-assisted methods in WormNet v3, we performed a case study for each
                prediction method with query genes as toy examples in the server. First, we
                simulated the prediction of 372 genes for ‘extended life span’
                collected from WormBase239 (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>) using the
                phenotype-centric method. For this simulation, we submitted genes for life span
                extension that have been identified from genome-scale RNAi screens by Hansen
                    <italic>et al</italic>. (29 genes) (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>),
                Hamilton <italic>et al</italic>. (85 genes) (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>) and Curran <italic>et al</italic>. (61 genes) (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>) to the server, and then measured the success rate of
                the predictions as the percentage of recapitulated non-seed genes from the 372 known
                genes among the top candidates. We found that the success rates ranged from 24 to
                38% among the top 50 candidates for the three query sets; this success rate was
                slightly lower among the top 100 or 200 candidates (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3a</xref>). Given that the random discovery rate for these 372 genes
                from the pool of 20,389 genes is less than 2% (372/20 389 = 1.82%), this
                network-assisted prediction in WormNet v3 achieved a more than 10-fold enrichment.
                In addition, the success rate on this same set of 372 genes was significantly
                reduced when the base network in WormNet v2 was used, which confirms the improved
                quality of the base network in WormNet v3.</p>

        <p>(<bold>a</bold>) A bar graph that shows the success rates of the predictions
                        for the ‘extended life span’ genes. To assess the
                        effectiveness of the phenotype-centric prediction, we performed a simulation
                        in which 372 genes for ‘extended life span’ collected from
                        WormBase239 (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>) were predicted by
                        network connectivity to the seed genes derived from each of three
                        independent genome-wide RNAi screens: 29 genes from Hansen <italic>et
                            al</italic>. (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>), 85 genes from
                        Hamilton <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>)
                        and 61 genes from Curran <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). For each seed gene set, the WormNet server
                        prioritized new candidate genes for extended life span. The efficiency of
                        each prediction was measured by the success rate, which was computed as the
                        percentage of recapitulated non-seed genes of the 372 known genes for
                        extended life span among the top 50, 100 and 200 candidates. The success
                        rates ranged from 24 to 38% among the top 50 candidates for the three query
                        sets. This range was slightly lower among the top 100 or 200 candidates.
                        Notably, the success rate was significantly reduced when the base gene
                        network in WormNet v2 was used, which demonstrates the significant
                        improvement in network quality in WormNet v3. (<bold>b</bold>) A performance
                        is measured by the number of correctly predicted RNAi phenotype annotations
                        (y-axis) for the given rank threshold (x-axis). WormNet v3 performs slightly
                        but consistently better than WormNet v2. Both versions of WormNet outperform
                        randomized predictions (the curve represents the average performance of 100
                        random predictions). (<bold>c</bold>) A ROC curve that shows high

    <p>Next, we systematically assessed the gene-centric prediction method. In WormNet v3,
                this method is designed to predict GO-BP terms. To test the predictive power of this
                method, however, we used RNAi phenotype annotations, which are independent from the
                GO-BP annotations that were used for the original training of WormNet. We collected
                42 831 annotations for 505 RNAi phenotypes from 6743 genes in WormBase239 (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). We used a leave-one-out analysis method in
                which the known RNAi phenotype annotations of a gene were masked and then newly
                predicted by the enriched RNAi phenotypes among its network neighbors for each round
                of simulated prediction. A total of 17 915 known gene-phenotype associations (42% of
                all known associations) were correctly predicted within the top 20 predicted
                phenotypes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3b</xref>). We performed the same
                analysis for WormNet v2 (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>) as well as 100
                randomized networks, and found that performance was improved in WormNet v3 compared
                with WormNet v2 (17 539, 41%) and the randomized networks (12 432, 29%).</p>
    <p>The effectiveness of the gene-centric prediction method was also demonstrated using
                recently updated GO-BP annotations. WormNet v3 uses the GO-BP annotations that were
                downloaded on November 2011. Since November 2011, many new GO-BP annotations have
                been added to <italic>C. elegans</italic> genes. We found that 169 genes have been
                newly annotated by GO-BP terms with reliable GO evidence codes (IDA, inferred from
                direct assay; IMP, inferred from mutant phenotype; IGI, inferred from genetic
                interaction; IPI, inferred from physical interaction; IEP, inferred from expression
                pattern; TAS, traceable author statement; ISS, inferred from sequence or structural
                similarity) and that 42 of these genes were correctly predicted as top 10 candidate
                functions (∼25% success rate). These successful predictions can be
                demonstrated by running toy examples of 11 genes that were newly annotated by the
                GO-BP term for ‘reproduction’ after November 2011, which were
                correctly predicted as top10 candidates by WormNet v3.</p>
    <p>Finally, we tested a new context-centric prediction method, ‘find
                context-associated hub genes’, using toxicogenomics data derived from the
                exposure of <italic>C. elegans</italic> to the organophosphate pesticide, dichlorvos
                    (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). The principle mechanism of acute
                toxicity by organophosphate pesticide is the inhibition of acetylcholinesterase.
                Molecular mechanisms for the observed persistent and delayed toxic effects, however,
                have remained largely unknown. We hypothesized that an important gene for dichlorvos
                intoxication will be functionally connected with many DEGs upon exposure to the
                pesticide. By testing DEGs that have been detected from prolonged exposure to a low
                concentration of dichlorvos, the hub genes that are tightly connected to the
                context-associated DEGs may emerge as target genes that mediate the delayed toxic
                effect. We therefore conducted an analysis with 32 up-regulated genes (defined by
                &gt;1.5-fold increase of expression levels after 26 h) and identified gene
                C14C10.1, which is a putative mitochondrial carrier protein, as the top candidate
                gene associated with prolonged intoxication by dichlorvos. Mitochondrial dysfunction
                has been suggested as a mechanism of intoxication (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>) and many human diseases, such as metabolic disorders,
                neurodegenerative diseases, and muscle dystrophy, are associated with mutations of
                the mitochondrial carrier proteins (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>).
                C14C10.1 may therefore represent a potential target for dichlorvos. Taken together,
                these results suggest that WormNet v3 can predict target genes for a chemical when
                appropriate toxicogenomics data are used as input. We provided the 32 DEGs used in
                this case study as a toy example to simulate the context-centric prediction. Given
                the increasing use of <italic>C. elegans</italic> in toxicology (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>), this context-centric prediction of WormNet v3 may
                prove to be useful in the identification of potential targets or key modulators for
                intoxication in the study of many toxic chemicals.</p>
    <p>A more quantitative assessment of the context-centric prediction method was performed
                using three contexts for which both genome-wide expression data from GEO (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>) and RNAi phenotype annotations are available:
                hypoxia response, heat response and dauer development (see Supplementary Online
                Methods for detailed descriptions). To generate a set of DEGs for each context, we
                ranked genes by the expression change compared with control experiments, and
                collected the top 200 genes for each context. We then calculated probability of
                context-association of a gene for each context using corresponding 200 DEG sets.
                Finally, genes were prioritized for each context by either probability of expression
                change for the context (i.e. DEG) or probability of being context-associated hub
                (i.e. CAH). Genes relevant to each context as annotated by the RNAi phenotypes were
                used to measure the true positive rate and false positive rate of the ROC curve
                analysis (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3c</xref> and Supplementary Figure
                S2). For all three tested contexts, CAH outperformed DEG in retrieving genes known
                to be associated with the context by RNAi phenotypes.</p>

    <title>SUMMARY</title>
    <p>WormNet v3 is a new network-assisted hypothesis-generating server for <italic>C.
                    elegans</italic>. Both the base gene network and the prediction methods have
                been updated from previous versions. The improved quality of the base gene network
                was validated by testing the prediction of RNAi phenotypes. In addition to the two
                pre-existing prediction methods, ‘find new members for a pathway’
                and ‘infer functions from network neighbors’, a new context-centric
                prediction method, ‘find context-associated hub genes’, was added to
                WormNet v3. This new method may be useful in the study of molecular mechanisms of
                intoxication given related toxicogenomics data. WormNet v3 therefore provides a
                comprehensive network-assisted prediction platform with three complementary
                approaches to facilitate genetic dissections of complex phenotypes in <italic>C.
