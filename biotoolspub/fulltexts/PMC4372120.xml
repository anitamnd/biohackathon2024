      <p>There
is an ever increasing resource in terms of both structural
information and activity data for many protein targets. In this paper
we describe OOMMPPAA, a novel computational tool designed to inform
compound design by combining such data. OOMMPPAA uses 3D matched molecular
pairs to generate 3D ligand conformations. It then identifies pharmacophoric
transformations between pairs of compounds and associates them with
their relevant activity changes. OOMMPPAA presents this data in an
interactive application providing the user with a visual summary of
important interaction regions in the context of the binding site.
We present validation of the tool using openly available data for
CDK2 and a GlaxoSmithKline data set for a SAM-dependent methyl-transferase.
We demonstrate OOMMPPAA’s application in optimizing both potency
and cell permeability and use OOMMPPAA to highlight nuanced and cross-series
SAR. OOMMPPAA is freely available to download at <uri xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="http://oommppaa.sgc.ox.ac.uk/OOMMPPAA/">http://oommppaa.sgc.ox.ac.uk/OOMMPPAA/</uri>.</p>

    <title>Introduction</title>
    <p>In recent years approaches such as high-throughput
crystallography
and Fragment Based Drug Design have reached maturity, resulting in
a rapidly increasing number of available crystal structures and particularly
more liganded structures for a given protein. In the pharmaceutical
industry it is now common to have access to many tens of liganded
crystal structures within a drug discovery program. At the same time,
improvements in small-molecule screening throughput and initiatives
to consolidate activity data from disparate sources have made thousands
of high-quality small-molecule activity data points available for
many biologically important protein targets both in the public domain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref></sup> and within the pharmaceutical industry. This
data is a key resource in the early stages of drug discovery as it
provides information that may aid in the design of small-molecules
as part of lead-discovery and lead-optimization.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref></sup> However,
despite the availability of this wealth of new data, there are few
computational tools that are able to systematically exploit it. There
is a clear need for novel automated methods that can use these data
sets to assist medicinal and computational chemists in the directed
synthesis of small-molecules.</p>
    <p>Probably the best known method
for relating trends in biological
data to 3D structure is 3D Quantitative Structure Activity Relationships
(3D QSAR).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref></sup> 3D QSAR attempts to build statistical models
that relate small-molecule bioactivity data with 3D compound properties.
There are however well-documented problems with 3D QSAR. The generation
of relevant bioactive conformations and dealing with varied binding
modes poses a significant problem.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref></sup> Simple
models using, for example, linear regression are unable to detect
complex and nuanced features of the data.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref></sup> More elaborate models, which include many descriptors or complicated
statistical methods, often require large data sets, can be prone to
overfitting,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref></sup> and can be hard to interpret.
Attempts, however, have been made to improve the interpretability
of 3D QSAR by developing simplified models, for example by using pharmacophore
based abstractions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref></sup></p>
    <p>One way to move beyond the
generalizations of typical regression-based
QSAR models, to probe the underlying data in more detail, is to carry
out the analysis in a pairwise fashion. This strategy is adopted in
2D matched molecular pair analysis (2D MMPA).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref></sup> A matched molecular pair (MMP) consists of two compounds that are
identical apart from one small structural alteration, known as a transformation
(the shared part of the molecules is commonly referred to as the context).
The impact of a given transformation upon a particular property can
be assessed from this. Beneficial transformations can then be applied
to a compound series of interest with the aim of improving that property.</p>
    <p>Recent work by Geppert and Beck<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref></sup> has
extended this concept by using pharmacophore-based clustering in “Fuzzy”
2D MMP analysis. This approach enables the clustering of multiple
chemically different but pharmacophorically conserved transformations
or contexts. This improves the number of observations in each subset.
Pharmacophore retyping aims to transfer SAR from chemically different
but pharmacophorically identical contexts. However, pharmacophore-based
matching overlooks compounds with shared binding modes but slightly
different pharmacophores. Further it is possible for compounds with
identical pharmacophores to possess different binding modes.</p>
    <p>The MMP concept can also be extended to carry out the analysis
on biologically relevant 3D conformations. This approach is known
as 3D MMPA. A key benefit of 3D MMPA is that SAR can be transferred
between structurally and pharmacophorically dissimilar series but
with analogous binding modes. Furthermore, it includes information
about the local protein environment. This is important since this
environment directly affects the nature and magnitude of a given transformation’s
effect. 3D MMPA also presents a number of key advantages over 3D QSAR.
First it offers a simple and easily implemented method for 3D conformation
generation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref></sup> Most importantly it produces
models that are directly related to simple pairwise compound transformations.
3D MMPA can thus be used to investigate confounding factors in analysis
and show nuanced information in a way that even the most interpretable
3D QSAR models cannot.</p>
    <p>Two recent works<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref></sup> have developed the 3D MMPA field.
Both incorporate experimental data on compounds tested in activity
assays, but for which no complexed structure is available. They operate
on the assumption that similar ligands will have similar binding modes.
This is a central tenet of cheminformatics and has recently been shown
to be useful in solving complexed ligand crystal structures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref></sup> and docking.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref></sup> The
first method, VAMMPIRE,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref></sup> combines data
from PDBBind<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref></sup> and ChEMBL<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref></sup> by aligning MMPs using their shared core. It is presented
as a Web application and takes as input (a) a substituent or (b) a
transformation or (c) a protein environment. It then displays the
effect of this transformation, in the appropriate environment across
all available data. VAMMPIRE aggregates data from multiple targets
giving the user an overview of commonly tolerated modifications. The
method does not, however, look at target-specific trends.</p>
    <p>Posy
et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref></sup> take an alternative approach
from VAMMPIRE. They use a target(s)-specific method primarily focusing
on the protein kinase p38α. MMPs are used to identify preferred
functional groups for a given region of the binding pocket. For example
they demonstrate that the addition of cyclopropyl amides in a particular
region improves activity in the majority of transformations. They
then demonstrate that the addition of this moiety improves the potency
of a different compound series. However, considering functional groups
(e.g., cyclopropyl amides) limits the applicability of this method
to existing chemistry that has been <italic>frequently</italic> explored
before. Furthermore, the investigation of average trends across groups
and without reference to individual transformations may, as we will
show later, miss nuanced effects.</p>
    <p>In this work, we present the
OOMMPPAA method. OOMMPPAA is a 3D
MMPA tool for analyzing target specific features at the pharmacophore
level. OOMPPPAA diverges from the 3D MMPPA method of Weber et al.
by considering each target’s data separately. OOMMPPAA is designed
to investigate a particular target’s data not a protein environment.
In this way target-specific trends in data can be observed. Further,
OOMMPPAA differs from the target based 3D MMPA method of Posy et al.
in two key ways. First, OOMMPPAA bases its analysis on pharmacophoric
changes, not chemical changes, between small-molecules. As demonstrated
by Geppert and Beck<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref></sup> but for 2D MMPA,
the consideration of pharmacophoric features allows for an increase
in the number of equivalent substitutions. Second, it considers the
differences between molecules not just the destination fragment.</p>
    <p>Finally, OOMMPPAA does not aggregate activity changes into general
trends but, rather, considers positive and negative activity changes
separately. This is a key distinction from many other 3D QSAR and
3D MMP methods and allows for nuanced descriptions of complex data
and deeper analysis into confounding factors in possible trends. This
makes OOMMPPAA a useful complementary tool for exploration of large
and complex structural and activity data. OOMMPPAA is, to our knowledge,
the first freely available 3D MMP tool providing an intuitive user
interface to interact with the available data and tools to apply the
method to a user’s own data sets. Here we demonstrate the OOMMPPAA
methodology and the tool’s application, using examples from
publically available cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2) data and data
for a SAM-dependent methyl-transferase from GlaxoSmithKline (GSK).</p>
  </sec>
  <sec id="sec2">
    <title>Methods
and Data Sets</title>
    <p>Data is input via a user interface or command-line
in MacOSX, Windows,
or Linux; it is processed by OOMMPPAA and presented as a visual application.</p>
    <sec id="sec2.1">
      <title>Input
of Data</title>
      <p>The input required for OOMMPPAA consists
of the 3D coordinates of ligands from aligned cocomplexed structures
and bioactivity data for all small-molecules of interest for each
protein target. Ligand structural coordinates are input as an SD file
containing the 3D structures of all cocomplexed ligands. The input
ligand structures must be aligned into the same coordinate frame by
aligning their complexed proteins. They should also be set to a physiologically
relevant protonation state (pH 7.4). Activity data is accepted as
a comma-separated variable (CSV) file containing at least two columns;
chemical structures as SMILES<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref></sup> and activity
data as the negative base 10 logarithmic value. If a compound has
more than one activity value associated with it, the highest value
(most potent) will be chosen for later analysis. Compound SMILES should
be entered in the tautomeric form appropriate for the complexed ligands.
Currently, the MMP implementation in OOMMPPAA carries out direct string
comparisons on SMILES. Since SMILES do not canonicalize tautomeric
forms, it is important that consistent tautomeric forms are used;
otherwise the tool is likely to miss the affected pairs.</p>
      <p>Inactive
small-molecules are an important component of the data sets used.
Inactive compounds are annotated in the CSV file by adding an “Operator”
column. A “&lt;” sign in this column indicates an inactive
compound; the activity value is the reported assay tolerance. An “=”
sign indicates a compound for which the activity is known. If the
“&lt;” sign is used, the corresponding small molecule
can only be less active than other small molecules. For example a
small-molecule with activity &lt;5.3 will be assigned 1.1 log unit
less active than a small-molecule with activity = 6.4. However, it
will not be seen as more active than a small-molecule with activity
= 5.0. Combining IC<sub>50</sub> and <italic>K</italic><sub>i</sub> data from ChEMBL is also important to maximize the power of this
data source. Kalliokoski et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref></sup> recently
demonstrated that combining these data sources from ChEMBL did not
reduce data quality. We do not apply the scaling factor suggested
in their work (0.35 log units) but do highlight the activity source
in the interactive viewer. This allows the user to exercise their
own discretion when using the tool. Since the output is easily scrutinized,
disparate data sources can be used, but only the most appropriate
comparisons considered in analysis - a clear advantage of the 3D MMP
method over conventional regression-based 3D QSAR.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec2.2">
      <title>Data Model</title>
      <p>OOMMPPAA uses a bespoke Python<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref></sup> Django<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref></sup> data model
to store all data in an SQLite database. The data model does not allow
the entry of duplicate data meaning that input files can be appended
and re-entered to OOMMPPAA, and only new data will be added. This
model enables rapid local access, curation, and connection of large
quantities of information.</p>

    <p>The OOMMPPA method is implemented in four steps, as shown
in Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. First, the matched molecular pair
database is
formed using the method of Hussain and Rea.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref></sup> Second all relevant matched molecular pairs are found where one
compound of each pair is represented in a crystal structure and the
other is not. These pairs are used to predict coordinates of compounds
for which no crystal-structure is available. Third, each pair is searched
for pharmacophore differences between compounds. Finally the differences
found in this last step are displayed and can be queried via an intuitive
Web-based and desktop application.</p>
    <sec id="sec3.1">
      <title>Stage 1: Matched Molecular Pair Database</title>
      <p>To find matched
molecular pairs we use the method developed by Hussain and Rea.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref></sup> All acyclic single bond breaks are exhaustively
enumerated, and the pairs formed are stored as canonicalized SMILES.
Only single breaks are considered since double and triple cuts would
complicate conformation generation. To reduce the total number of
pairs, the nonmatching part of the pair does not consist of more than
10 heavy (non-hydrogen) atoms. OpenBabel<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref></sup> is employed to assign physiologically relevant protonation states
to the compounds (pH 7.4). Matched molecular pairs are found by querying
this data model.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec3.2">
      <title>Stage 2: Creating Bioactive and -Inactive
Coordinates</title>
      <p>Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> shows the OOMMPPAA
method for generating
coordinates for compounds with no crystal structure from each matched
molecular pair found in stage 1. The shared core between these two
compounds is used as a rigid template to derive 3D coordinates of
the compound for which no structural information is available.</p>

(MMFF)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref></sup> using the shared core template
as a rigid constraint. Hydrogens are added to the molecule before
minimization. Conformations within 0.35 Å RMSD from an existing
conformation are rejected as not <italic>different</italic>. This
is in accordance with the protocol presented by Ebejer et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref></sup> using RDKit<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref></sup> for
varied and accurate conformer generation. The conformation from these
local energy minima that maximizes the shape overlap between the two
compounds is chosen. Shape overlap is calculated using the RDKit Tanimoto
shape distance implementation.</p>

          <p>Energy minimization using the protein

      </fig>
      <p>In contrast to previous methods<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref></sup> we do not
consider the contribution of the protein when performing energy minimization
of the generated conformer. While inclusion of the protein during
this minimization process might produce more accurate compound conformations,
it would reduce both the ability to make direct comparisons and the
interpretability of the results. For example, Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> shows an example where energy minimization would lead to
missing an important comparison. In this example replacing a ligand
H-bond acceptor for an H-bond donor would result in a clash between
the protein and ligand H-bond donors and lead to a loss of activity.
Minimizing the ligand to circumvent this might lead to a ring flip
forming an interaction with an H-bond acceptor on the protein. This
would mean the two groups (H-bond donor and acceptor) would not be
directly compared in the analysis outlined in the next section, and
so this feature would be missed. When minimization is not carried
out, not only is the comparison made, but the unfavorable interaction
responsible for the feature can be observed. In this way the OOMMPPAA
method presents such extra information from inactive compounds.</p>
      <p>It is however important to note that, for active compounds without
crystal structure, the pose produced may not be representative of
the native binding mode. As such, for these compounds, protein–ligand
interactions presented should be treated with caution and considered
representative of interaction regions, rather than specific interactions.
Furthermore, important protein–ligand interactions may be missed.
However, this problem can also persist for compounds minimized within
the protein.</p>

      <p>The above method is able to produce thousands of
matched molecular
pairs using the data sets tested in this work. In order to highlight
important pairs within this data we search both compounds in each
pair for compound transformations that are likely to impact protein–ligand
binding. In this current work pharmacophoric changes between compounds
are considered. SMARTS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref></sup>-based RDKit pharmacophore
definitions (H-bond donors, H-bond acceptors, hydrophobic groups,
and aromatic groups) are used. Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> shows
the process for finding pharmacophoric differences between two compounds.
Pharmacophore points for both molecules are generated. All pharmacophore
points found on one molecule in the matched molecular pair but not
found within a Euclidean distance of 1.5 Å of an equivalent point
on the second molecule are identified. These pharmacophore points
are stored in the OOMMPPAA database along with the following associated
data; the number of pharmacophore point differences between the two
molecules and the activity change between the two molecules. This
data is then available to be queried by the interactive OOMMPAA visualization
tool. Other distances were trialed, and 1.5 Å was qualitatively
determined as most appropriate by visual inspection. A greater distance
led to points that could be seen to make different interactions being
counted as the same. Conversely a smaller distance seemed to lead
to like interactions being counted as different.</p>

      <title>3D Visualization
of Available Data</title>
      <p>Interactive visualization
of the matched molecular pair differences and their associated information
in 3D is an important component of OOMMPPAA. Two types of points are
shown in the viewer. First, the centers of mass of the nonmatching
parts of each MMP are displayed as spheres. They are colored on a
heat-scale representing the change in activity per heavy-atom difference.
As discussed below, these points can summarize the distribution and
nature of data available. Second, points representing a pharmacophoric
difference between two compounds are shown. Each point is shown as
a star if it has improved activity and as a cube if it has reduced
activity. They are colored by their pharmacophoric feature.</p>
      <p>Each pharmacophore difference point possesses information based on
the matched molecular pair from which it is derived: 1) the number
of pharmacophoric differences between the two compounds and 2) the
log-change in activity between the compounds. We propose, in accordance
with Stumpfe et al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref></sup> that these two values,
similarity and activity change, are related to how impactful each
pharmacophoric difference is on activity. A larger change in activity
is a direct indicator of a greater impact on activity. A smaller total
number of pharmacophore point differences suggest that this particular
pharmacophoric change is more likely to be responsible for the activity
change.</p>
      <p>The appropriate values to choose as cut-offs for activity
and pharmacophoric
differences are dependent on the assay used, the target involved,
and the quantity of data considered. Indeed they will most likely
differ within regions of the same binding site. The OOMMPPAA interface
provides sliders to alter the threshold for each of these values and
thus increase the number of points at the expense of noise or <italic>vice versa</italic>.</p>

      <title>Highlighting Key Features</title>
      <p>To aid in directed synthesis
we provide 2D feature maps for a query compound. These maps highlight
1) compound features that have been shown to reduce activity, 2) regions
of the compound from which synthesis might be attempted to improve
potency, and 3) compound features that are pharmacophorically conserved
across the complexed ligands. The user may enter a compound’s
SMILES or name, as provided in the input SD file. OOMMPPAA then searches
for this ligand. If a SMILES is entered and no exact match is found,
the most similar ligand based on Morgan fingerprint<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref></sup> similarity (radius 2) is found. The ligand is shown in
the 3D display along with two feature maps, as shown in Figure <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>. These are colored based on per-atom scores which
can be depicted using the RDKit “Similarity Map” compound
visualizations recently developed by Riniker and Landrum.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref></sup> The Activity Change map (Figure <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>a) provides a qualitative visualization of locations around
the query compound that confer changes in activity within the data
provided to OOMMPPAA. All pharmacophore differences conferring an
activity difference greater than 0.5 log units and a number of pharmacophore
differences less than 4 are used. Extension points to the compound
that could be made to increase the compound’s potency are highlighted
in blue. These are currently defined as hydrogen atoms. A darker blue
indicates a hydrogen is near to more pharmacophoric changes that have
led to an increase in activity. Atoms in the compound that might be
reducing the compound’s potency are highlighted in red. A darker
red indicates an atom is near to more pharmacophoric changes of the
atom’s type(s) that have led to any loss in activity.</p>

      <title>Data Sets</title>
      <p>OOMMPPAA has been tested and developed using
multiple internal GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) and SGC data sets. Here, we
demonstrate the application of this tool using two data sets. First,
publically available cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2) data from ChEMBL
version 16 consisting of <italic>in vitro</italic> IC<sub>50</sub> and <italic>K</italic><sub>i</sub> data was used. We extracted all
nonredundant ligands cocomplexed to CDK2 with a resolution less than
3.3 Å from the PDB<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">32</xref></sup> to use as structural
data. Electron density maps for all structures with resolution greater
than 3.0 Å were visually inspected to ensure the ligand was correctly
modeled. We aligned the ligands into the same coordinate frame via
the protein structures using Pymol<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">33</xref></sup> and
visually inspected the alignment. In total this data set consisted
of 1,632 unique compounds with activity data and 261 unique cocomplexed
ligands. The second data set consisted of internal GSK data for an <italic>S</italic>-adenosyl methionine (SAM)-dependent methyl transferase
where all crystallographic data is under 2.5 Å and all activity
data was generated using the same IC<sub>50</sub> bioactivity assay.
In total this data set consisted of 2,212 unique compounds with activity
data and 92 unique complexed ligands. We suggest this order of data
quantity is necessary for undertaking the following depth of analysis.
However, we have tested the tool using a smaller data set (15 complexed
ligands and ∼1000 activity points from Tm shift). The analysis
produced was not as rich; however, useful insights were generated.</p>

    <title>Results and Discussion</title>
    <p>OOMMPPAA can be used to demonstrate
key features in available activity
information and use that information to generate evidence-based hypotheses
for compound development. In the following sections we demonstrate
its use in both of these areas. The examples used are derived from
CDK2 and a SAM-dependent methyl-transferase.</p>

      </fig>
      <p>In Figure <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref> an OOMMPPAA visualization shows
ATP surrounded by points representing each matched molecular pair
for CDK2. Three important features can be seen here. First, there
are few points surrounding the adenine core (blue box) indicating
that OOMMPPAA finds no matched molecular pairs with transformations
in these regions. This might suggest that the compounds available
in ChEMBL present highly conserved substructures in this conserved
region of kinase binding. However, interrogation of the data shows
a number of hinge binding groups are represented, but there are very
few MMPs where that group varies and the rest of the molecule is conserved.
Second, in the red box there are two lines of points. Each line indicates
an SAR series from the same scaffold. These points are predominantly
in red indicating that changes in this region have a large effect
on activity. Finally, in the green box are a cluster of points largely
in blue and purple. These indicate a collection of changes which have
generally altered activity only weakly. This cluster sits toward the
outside of the protein, and thus groups here may be expected to interact
only weakly.</p>
      <p>These three examples demonstrate OOMMPPAA’s
ability to present large quantities of data in a manner which allows
the user to identify the nature of and trends in available activity
data. Systematically assessing the nature and scale of pairwise compound
alterations in different regions of the binding pocket in this way
is a novel and useful feature of 3D MMPA.</p>

      <title>Lead Development Using
CDK2</title>
      <p>OOMMPPAA’s interactive
visualizations can be used to suggest changes that may improve the
potency of a given compound series. In Figure <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref> we demonstrate, retrospectively, how OOMMPPAA could have been used
to suggest modifications to the original lead (PDB code 1H1P) from a compound
series developed by Davies et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref35">35</xref></sup> The Activity
Change map highlights that changes improving activity could be made
from the terminal amine, circled in Figure <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>a. Investigating these points in the 3D viewer indicates they are
aromatic pharmacophores, and thus adding an aromatic group in this
area has previously improved activity. The relevant SAR for these
transformations is shown in 2D and is from two different series, as
shown in Figure <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>b. Davies et al. extended
the lead compound by adding an aryl ring in this area leading to an
increase in <italic>in vitro</italic> potency from 13 μM to
2.3 μM. This extended ligand was cocrystallized by them and
is shown in Figure <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>c; the additional aryl
group is placed over the cluster of cyan stars, as expected. Further
additions surround the aryl group, suggesting future synthetic work
that could be performed. The compound comparisons from Davies et al.
were not included in this analysis.</p>

      </fig>
      <p>In this example the advantage
of 3D over 2D MMPA is demonstrated.
First, 3D MMPA allows for SAR from one series, binding in the same
region of the binding pocket, to be transferred to another pharmacophorically
and structural different series. Second, unlike 3D QSAR, OOMMPPAA’s
model is directly related to pairwise transformations. This allows
confounding factors to be scrutinized. For example it can be directly
observed whether the aromatic group is simply favored as a linker
group for another substituent or whether it is broadly favored irrespective
of substitution. Finally it is important to note that OOMMPPAA’s
focus on pharmacophoric changes, unlike existing 3D MMP methods, means
that the different patterns of aryl group substitution in this data
set were accurately deconvoluted, spatially.</p>

      <title>Improving Cellular Activity
against CDK2</title>
      <p>OOMMPPAA can
be used to assist in the optimization of properties other than potency.
Figure <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">9</xref> demonstrates the use of OOMMPPAA to
suggest ways to improve the cell permeability of a compound series
generated by D’Alessio et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref37">37</xref></sup> against
CDK2. Compound 1 from this work possesses high potency (0.3 nM) against
the isolated enzyme but low potency in cells (8.74 μM) probably
due to its low computed log partition coefficient (cLogP) (0.09),
as shown in Figure <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">9</xref>a. The sulfonamide group
contributes strongly to this low cLogP, and so altering this group
might improve the cellular activity for this compound series. However,
structural data indicates that the sulfonamide forms favorable interactions
with the protein.</p>
      <p>The pharmacophoric changes that have been
explored in this region of the protein pocket that have led to a greater
than 0.5 log unit increase in activity with less than four pharmacophoric
changes between compounds are shown in Figure <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">9</xref>a. These points indicate features that have improved activity in
this region of the binding site. Figure <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">9</xref>b
shows the 3D display and demonstrates these scaffolds have similar
predicted binding modes to the series being developed. First the substitutions
in this region indicate, from two other series, that the sulfonamide
is indeed favorable as potency against the isolated enzyme is lost
when replaced with other groups (not shown). However, OOMMPPAA also
indicates alternative functional groups, fluoride and hydroxyl, that
improve activity in this region. Further these groups might also improve
cell based potency due to their increased cLogP. D’Alessio
et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref37">37</xref></sup> demonstrated that replacing the
sulfonamide with a fluoride did indeed lead to a 6–7-fold increase
in cellular potency while maintaining a reasonabl<italic>e</italic> activity (36 nM) against the isolated enzyme. The hydroxyl analogue
was not synthesized; however, we postulate it would lead to a similar
increase in activity.</p>
      <p>In this example OOMMPPAA’s methodology
presents significantly
different insights to 2D MMPA or 3D QSAR. OOMMPPAA’s analysis
allows the user to explore SAR from different series, binding in the
same region of the binding pocket to develop hypotheses for compound
alterations. 3D QSAR does not allow exploration of the data in this
direct manner. Equally 2D MMPA does not allow facile transfer of SAR
between structurally and pharmacophorically different series based
on shared binding location. Finally by considering pharmacophoric
differences, unlike existing 3D MMP methods, OOMMPPAA is able to highlight
pertinent functional changes that have led to improved potency.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec4.4">
      <title>Highlighting Nuanced SAR with a SAM-Dependent Methyl-Transferase</title>
      <p>OOMMPPAA can be used to identify nuanced SAR. In Figure <xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">10</xref>a the Activity Change and Pharmacophore Conservation
maps for a SAM-dependent methyl-transferase are shown. They indicate
contrasting features, within the context of the data provided. In
the left-hand map of Figure <xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">10</xref>a the N3 atom
within the adenine ring (circled) is shown to be at a position at
which an H-bond acceptor results in a reduced activity. Yet in the
right-hand map, it is also highly conserved, pharmacophorically, and
thus putatively important for protein–ligand binding. This
suggests that this H-bond acceptor is beneficial in some series but
not in others. Investigating this further using OOMMPPAA showed that
the compounds responsible for the loss of activity feature possess
a terminal amide group forming H-bonding interactions with the protein.</p>
      <p>In Figure <xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">10</xref>c we show that introduction
of an H-bond acceptor in the highlighted position (in Figure <xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">10</xref>b) for a compound series containing a terminal
amide would cause an intramolecular H-bond to form. This would alter
the energetically preferred conformation of the terminal amide to
one resulting in a mismatch of H-bonding features with the protein
(as shown in Figure <xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">10</xref>d). We postulate that
this is responsible for the net-loss in binding affinity for this
compound series.</p>
      <p>The information shown by OOMMPPAA would therefore
dissuade future
lead development from using this particular combination of amide and
H-bond acceptor. Since the overall trend in this region is for H-bond
acceptor groups to improve activity (there are more activity improving
“stars” than “cubes” in this region),
this would have been obscured if the effects had been aggregated into
a trend, as is carried out in existing 3D MMP and 3D QSAR methodologies.</p>

      <title>Highlighting Potential Dead-Ends with SAM-Dependent Methyl-Transferase</title>
      <p>OOMMPPAA can also identify areas of compound design that have consistently
led to a reduction in activity. Figure <xref rid="fig11" ref-type="fig">11</xref> shows
SAM in its bound conformation to the SAM-dependent methyl-transferase,
surrounded by all points that are associated with a loss of activity,
colored by their pharmacophore type. A cluster of acceptors is visible
around the ribose ring of the SAM molecule. Investigation of the underlying
matched molecular pairs of this cluster showed that adding a carbonyl
group to compounds in this region consistently saw greater than 0.5
log unit activity losses, and hence future analogous alterations may
have a similar consequence.</p>
      <p>The carbonyl groups were added with
the aim of forming H-bonding interactions with the protein. By looking
at one compound series, or multiple compound series in 2D, this feature
may not have been apparent. However, OOMMPPAA produces flexible 3D
visualizations of composite activity data within the context of the
protein environment, generating the above hypothesis and informing
prospective compound design. 3D QSAR methodologies may have indicated
this feature of acceptors reducing activity. However, OOMMPPAA provides
this analysis transparently, based on simple pairwise comparisons
allowing simple analysis of potentially confounding factors and nuanced
SAR, as discussed in the previous example.</p>

    <title>Comparison to Existing
Methods</title>
    <p>In each of the above examples OOMMPPAA highlights
interesting features
in existing SAR that could be used to inform future compound design.</p>
    <p>In these examples the advantage of 3D over 2D MMPA is shown. 3D
MMPA allows SAR information from one series to be transferred to another
pharmacophorically and structurally different series, binding in the
same region of the binding pocket. Furthermore, OOMMPPAA differentiates
itself from existing QSAR methods. The models produced are directly
related to simple pairwise SAR. As a consequence hypotheses inferred
from OOMMPPAA can be directly scrutinized. This transparency enables
rationalization of otherwise potentially confounding factors. A key
example of this is the influence of the amide group combined with
an H-bond acceptor in the examples above. Finally OOMMPPAA develops
upon existing target specific 3D MMP methods by clustering changes
into pharmacophoric groupings and by not aggregating changes into
trends. The use of pharmacophores is crucial in the hypotheses generated
in each of the above examples, thus demonstrating the value of this
approach. The pharmacophore approach also provides a broader range
of suggested modifications for future compounds than a more specific
functional group analysis. Further, by not aggregating into trends,
nuanced features were observed.</p>

    <p>By design, OOMMPPAA currently takes a simple view of protein–ligand
binding, considering only four pharmacophore features. This approach
enables OOMMPPAA to present simple, user-friendly visualizations.
However, the method can be readily extended to consider any group
that can be expressed by a SMARTS pattern. It would be possible to
assess OOMMPPAA’s ability to use other groups (e.g., methyl
groups, halogens and basic/acidic groups) to aid in lead optimization.</p>
    <p>Further to this, OOMMPPAA is currently a ligand-centric tool. It
implicitly incorporates protein information by aligning complexed
ligands. Future development will consider potential protein–ligand
interactions. This will allow OOMMPPAA to assess whether an overlaid
compound, which has not been cocrystallized, might be sterically hindered
by the protein itself. If such a clash consistently leads to an activity
decrease, this would indicate an inflexible region of the protein.
Conversely a region where this is not the case might indicate the
protein is conformationally flexible in this region.</p>
    <p>We propose
OOMMPPAA could be extended to be used for experimental
design. A number of current methodologies propose novel ligands, focusing
on increasing compound potency.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref39">39</xref></sup> However, OOMMPPAA is
perhaps more powerful if used to improve knowledge regarding protein–ligand
binding. First OOMMPPAA could be used to propose experiments that
would enhance the information density of the model. For example it
might highlight whole SAR series that currently have no X-ray structure
available and thus suggest which compounds should be prioritized for
cocrystallization. Second it might highlight available, untested,
compounds to probe underexplored regions of the protein binding site.
In the example of CDK2 little information was available around the
adenine core. OOMMPPAA might find compounds from a large (for example,
corporate) database that are matched pairs with complexed ligands
and would produce structural variations in this region. Since the
MMP method used is optimized for large data sets, this would be computationally
inexpensive.</p>
    <p>Finally OOMMPPAA could be further extended to test
proposed hypotheses.
As demonstrated above, OOMMPPAA is able to visualize regions of conflicting
data, e.g. where addition of an acceptor both increases and decreases
activity in different compound series. It might then be able to find
all untested compounds that would probe this area and suggest these
as future experimental candidates.</p>

    <title>Conclusion</title>
    <p>OOMMPPAA
is a novel and freely available computational tool to
aid in directed synthesis by analysis of large structural and activity
data sets, comprising tens of liganded structures and hundreds of
activity data points from <italic>K</italic><sub>i</sub> and IC<sub>50</sub> data. OOMMPPAA uses 3D MMP analysis to infer possible binding
geometries of compounds for which crystal structures are not available.
Structural changes that alter the compound binding mode are not predicted
in this method. This means poses produced should be used with caution.
However, the method has the advantage of providing more relevant comparisons
of transformations, particularly when considering those that are activity
reducing.</p>
    <p>OOMMPPAA then builds upon existing 3D matched molecular
pair methods
by including pharmacophore based concepts from 2D MMP and 3D QSAR
analysis. Critically, OOMMPPAA considers the pharmacophoric differences
between fragments not just the final molecule and does not aggregate
activity changes into general trends but, rather, considers positive
and negative effects separately. An intuitive and interactive interface
plays an integral role within OOMMPPAA, providing an easy-to-use tool
for analyzing large quantities of structural and bioactivity data.
Diverse examples of OOMMPPAA’s use have been given, supporting
our belief that OOMMPPAA is an important new tool in any computational
and medicinal chemist’s arsenal.</p>
    <p>OOMMPPAA is freely available
released under the Apache Version
2.0.</p>
