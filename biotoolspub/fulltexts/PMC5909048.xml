      <p>Inference of copy number variation presents a technical challenge because variant callers typically require the copy number of a genome or genomic region to be known <italic>a priori</italic>. Here we present a method to infer copy number that uses variant call format (VCF) data as input and is implemented in the R package <italic>vcfR</italic>. This method is based on the relative frequency of each allele (in both genic and non-genic regions) sequenced at heterozygous positions throughout a genome. These heterozygous positions are summarized by using arbitrarily sized windows of heterozygous positions, binning the allele frequencies, and selecting the bin with the greatest abundance of positions. This provides a non-parametric summary of the frequency that alleles were sequenced at. The method is applicable to organisms that have reference genomes that consist of full chromosomes or sub-chromosomal contigs. In contrast to other software designed to detect copy number variation, our method does not rely on an assumption of base ploidy, but instead infers it. We validated these approaches with the model system of <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> and applied it to the oomycete <italic>Phytophthora infestans</italic>, both known to vary in copy number. This functionality has been incorporated into the current release of the R package <italic>vcfR</italic> to provide modular and flexible methods to investigate copy number variation in genomic projects.</p>

    <title>Introduction</title>
    <p>Investigations into the variation in the number of copies of genes, chromosomes, or genomes are well-established research topics, yet they continue to present technical challenges to molecular genetic analysis. Many examples provide evidence of how copy number affects the phenotype. For example, schizophrenia in humans is thought to be caused by variation in copy number of certain genes (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Sekar et al., 2016</xref>). Presence of an additional chromosome (aneuploidy) results in Down syndrome in humans (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Hassold and Hunt, 2001</xref>). Existence of an extra copy of all chromosomes (triploidy) is used in agriculture to produce sterile organisms such as seedless watermelons (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Varoquaux et al., 2000</xref>) or sterile salmon (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Johnstone, 1992</xref>; <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Cotter et al., 2000</xref>). Whole genome duplication (polyploidy) results in every chromosome being duplicated, a phenomenon observed throughout plants, animals, and fungi (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Todd et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Van de Peer et al., 2017</xref>). Although this phenomenon is well established, it presents a challenge to high throughput sequencing projects in that most popular genomic variant callers, such as the GATK’s (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">DePristo et al., 2011</xref>) or FreeBayes (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Garrison and Marth, 2012</xref>), require the <italic>a priori</italic> specification of how many alleles to call. While the inference of copy number may be an important precursor to point mutation discovery, many authors argue that copy number variation may be more abundant throughout a genome than point mutations (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Katju and Bergthorsson, 2013</xref>) making it an important facet in the investigation of genomic architectures.</p>
    <p>Existing software for determining the number of copies at a locus from high throughput sequencing data can be broadly classified into two categories: copy number variation detection and whole genome ploidy inference. The important difference among these categories is the form of data they use. Copy number variation detection software uses per position sequence depth (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Yoon et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Abyzov et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Klambauer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2012</xref>) while whole genome ploidy inference software uses the relative frequency of the two most abundant alleles sequenced at a locus (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Zohren et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Gompert and Mock, 2017</xref>; <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">Weiß et al., 2018</xref>). Copy number variation detection methods group the per position sequence depth into windows and attempt to sort these into base-ploid (typical depth) windows or windows that deviate from base-ploid. They generally require the investigator to specify <italic>a priori</italic> what copy level the base-ploid state is. If the research question is to determine how many copies occur at the base-ploid state, these methods will not be appropriate. Whole genome ploidy inference methods use the frequency that the two most abundant alleles were sequenced at for heterozygous positions, or allele balance, and summarize this information throughout the genome. (Here we use the term ‘allele balance’ where other authors have used ‘allele frequency’ to distinguish the measure from the use of ‘allele frequency’ in population genetics.) For example, for heterozygous alleles we would expect to observe an approximate frequency of one half for diploids, ratios of thirds for triploids, and ratios of quarters for tetraploids (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref></bold>). Whole genome ploidy inference uses all of the genomic information to infer a single copy number for the entire genome. A third hybrid method uses allele balance (referred to as allelic ratio) and heterozygosity to assign copy number to populations of data (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">McKinney et al., 2017</xref>). However, if the research question is to explore copy number variation within a population this method will not be relevant. Therefore, there are at least two distinct approaches to determine the number of copies present in genomes, and more currently being proposed, each with different strengths and limitations.</p>

        <p>Allele balance (e.g., the distribution of the frequency at which the most abundant allele and the second most abundant allele were sequenced) at heterozygous positions in three <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> genomes. For each heterozygous genotype the frequency at which the most abundant allele was sequenced at (light blue) and the frequency at which the second most abundant allele was sequenced at (dark blue) were recorded. This information was then summarized with a histogram. Expectations for allele balance are 1/2 for diploids, 1/3 and 2/3 for triploids, and 1/4, 1/2, and 3/4 for tetraploids. This approach provides a dominant copy number for each genome but no information about variation within each genome. Expectations and critical values for binning allele balance information are presented below the histograms.</p>

    <p>Our research presented us with the need to determine if copy number varied throughout genomes, where we did not have prior knowledge of what the actual base-ploidy might be. We therefore combined the windowing functionality from copy number variation detection methods with the allele balance concept from whole genome ploidy inference methods. We use a non-parametric approach to infer copy number given that empirical explorations of available data indicated that common distributions, particularly at low sequence depth, do not fit well. Our method is implemented in a new update to the package <italic>vcfR</italic> in the R software environment (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">R Core Team, 2018</xref>). R is an established and growing language facilitating the analysis of population genetic and genomic data (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Paradis et al., 2017a</xref>,<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">b</xref>). We demonstrate the utility of this method using genomes from the model fungus <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> and our ongoing work with the oomycete plant pathogen <italic>Phytophthora infestans</italic>. Both of these organisms show variation in ploidy across individuals as well as within regions within a genome.</p>

      <p>Data from high throughput sequencing (HTS) projects on populations typically results in calling variants that might include single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), indels, and inversions. Output from popular variant callers is presented in files that adhere to the variant call format (VCF) specification (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Danecek et al., 2011</xref>). This specification provides the option to include counts for how many times each allele was sequenced for each genotype. For example, in the GATK’s HaplotypeCaller (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">McKenna et al., 2010</xref>) output includes allele depth (AD) as a comma delimited string of counts. This VCF data can be imported into R using our function read.vcfR(). Once any desired quality control steps have been performed on the data (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Knaus and Grünwald, 2017</xref>), such as omitting variants of unusual sequence coverage, this allele depth data can be extracted using the <italic>vcfR</italic> function extract.gt(). We then use the function is_het() to set homozygous positions in the allele depth matrices as missing data (NA) so we can focus our analysis on the heterozygous positions. The allele depth is reported as a comma delimited string, the individual elements of which can be isolated with the function masplit(). Dividing the count for each allele by the sum of the counts for the two most abundant alleles, results in the frequency at which each allele was sequenced, or allele balance. This data can now be plotted as histograms for visualization.</p>
      <p>Determining copy number for sub-genomic regions requires the genome to be divided into sub-genomic windows and, because this typically results in many windows per sample, it requires a numeric method of summarizing this data. This goal is accomplished with the function freq_peak(). This function takes as input a matrix of allele balance data, as described above, a vector of chromosomal positions for each variant, a window size, and a bin width for summarizing the allele balance values. The vector of chromosomal positions is used to assign variants to windows. The window size specifies how large the genomic windows should be. This will in part be based on the frequency of heterozygous positions observed in the target sample as well as a balance between the conflicting desires for small windows that provide fine scale resolution and large windows that provide a large number of variants (i.e., support) for a determination. Within each window the allele balance values are summarized by bins from 0 to 1 and of the width specified by the bin width parameter. The bin with the greatest number of variants is selected as the peak location. Here, again, a balance must be found between resolution (small bins) and support (large bins). Default values are provided based on what we have determined to work in our study systems, but we highly encourage adjusting the parameters based on the specifics of each project. These parameters are expected to be context specific to each study system. This function returns three matrices, one containing the window coordinates, one containing the peak locations and one containing the count of variants that resulted for each window. The matrix of variant counts per window can be used to help determine optimal window size and to censor windows that resulted in a low number of variants. The peaks can then be assigned to their nearest expected value (1/5, 1/4, 1/3, 1/2, 2/3, 3/4, 4/5) using the function peak_to_ploid(). This is accomplished by using critical values that are half way between each expected value (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref></bold>). Once a copy number has been assigned its confidence is measured by creating a distance from expectation. The distance from expectation is the observed value subtracted by the expectation it was assigned to which is then divided by the critical value on the side of the expectation where the observed value was (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref></bold>). Dividing the critical value scales the difference from expectation from zero (exactly at our expectation) to one (half way between expectations). This can also be used to remove border cases where observed value is intermediate to the expected values and we therefore have low confidence in the determination. The results from the function freq_peak() can be visualized using freq_peak_plot(). This last function was inspired in part by BAF plots (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Laurie et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
      <p>Theoretical population genetics is based largely on haploid and diploid organisms. Investigations into populations that consist of higher ploidy individuals, or populations with a mixture of copy numbers, present a methodological challenge in that few applications are available to analyze them. We have extended Nei’s <italic>G</italic><sub>ST</sub> (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Nei, 1973</xref>, <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">1987</xref>) and Hedrick’s <italic>G</italic>’<sub>ST</sub> (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Hedrick, 2005</xref>) to address this challenge. These measures of population subdivision are based on ratios of heterozygosity. Because heterozygosity is based on the number and type of alleles found in a population it provides a convenient way to analyze populations of mixed copy number. Our implementation is inspired by the implementation in <italic>adegenet</italic> (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Jombart, 2008</xref>) which weights the heterozygosities by their sample size. This is an attempt to correct for unbalanced sample sizes, situations where a different number of individuals were sampled from different populations. We instead weight the heterozygosities by the observed number of alleles in each population to correct for both unbalanced samples as well as instances where individuals may vary in copy number as well. An unbalanced design occurs when different amounts of data are collected for different populations. For example, one sample may have consisted of 20 individuals while another may have only consisted of 10. This imbalance may have occurred due to logistical reasons or technical issues in sample preparation. When copy number is unknown, the investigator may sample the same number of individuals in the populations, but if one population turns out to have four copies where the other has only two, the population with four copies will have twice as much information as the other. Weighting each population by the number of alleles observed is an attempt to mitigate these issues. The function genetic_diff() uses a <italic>vcfR</italic> object and a factor that indicates population membership (VCF data typically does not include population information) and returns a table including heterozygosities, Nei’s <italic>G</italic><sub>ST</sub>, and Hedrick’s <italic>G</italic>’<sub>ST</sub>.</p>

      <title>Example Data</title>
      <p>To demonstrate our method, we tested it on three data sets. The first data set consisted of three samples of <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> (CBS7837, CBS2919, and CBS9564) from <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Zhu et al. (2016)</xref> that were reported as diploid, triploid and tetraploid by <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">Weiß et al. (2018)</xref>. We also included an additional sample (YJM1098) that was reported by <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Zhu et al. (2016)</xref> as being predominantly diploid but demonstrating aneuploidy for chromosome XII. These samples represent an organismal system where the genome is of relatively small size (12 Mbp), high quality (in its 64th revision; <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Engel et al., 2014</xref>) and where the samples were sequenced with a goal of attaining 80X sequence depth with Illumina GAII reads.</p>
      <p>A second data set consisted of two samples of the plant pathogen <italic>Phytophthora infestans</italic> (99189 and 88069) that were reported by <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">Weiß et al. (2018)</xref> as being diploid and triploid. The <italic>P. infestans</italic> system represents a more modestly sized genome (240 Mbp) that remains in its first draft (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Haas et al., 2009</xref>), but where the samples were sequenced with the intent of attaining 100X sequence depth for each haplotype using Illumina HiSeq 3000 sequencing (<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">Weiß et al., 2018</xref>).</p>
      <p>The third dataset included 17 samples of <italic>P. infestans</italic> and one sample of <italic>P. mirabilis</italic> collected from the literature, subset to Supercontig_1.50, and made available as an R package (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Knaus and Grünwald, 2017</xref>). This represents a set of samples that were of more typical sequence depth for genomics projects than we might expect from investigations that were specifically interested in copy number.</p>
      <p>For the first two datasets, the data were downloaded from the NCBI sequence read archive and FASTQ data were extracted using the sratoolkit. These reads were mapped to the yeast genome (S288C) or the <italic>P. infestans</italic> genome (T30-4) using bwa 0.7.10-r789 mem (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Li, 2013</xref>). The resulting SAM file had mate pair information updated, was sorted and converted to BAM format using samtools 1.3.1 (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2009</xref>). Duplicates were marked using picard-tools-2.5.0 and the files were indexed using samtools. For each sample, a g.VCF file was created from its BAM file using the GATK’s (3.5-0-g36282e4) HaplotypeCaller (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">McKenna et al., 2010</xref>). Read processing for the pinfsc50 was described previously (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Knaus and Grünwald, 2017</xref>). Briefly, the reads were mapped using bwa mem and variants were called using the GATK’s HaplotypeCaller resulting in VCF data. The g.VCF and VCF data were processed in <italic>vcfR</italic> (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Knaus and Grünwald, 2017</xref>) using the methods described above using the functions freq_peak(), peak_to_ploid(), and freq_peak_plot(). For the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> samples, a window size 40 kbp was used while a window size of 200 kbp was used for the <italic>P. infestans</italic> samples.</p>

      <title>Performance</title>
      <p>We assessed performance of our method over a range of genome sizes. Data used for the benchmarking were subset from the 99189 <italic>P. infestans</italic> sample including the entire data set (240 Mbp genome) and subsets of this dataset to represent genomes of 100, 10, and 1 Mbp. Each data set was processed 20 times and this processing was implemented using an R markdown script. The use of R markdown, as opposed to a pure R script, likely incurred a performance cost as our timing included the compilation of the R markdown to a web page. We advocate that using tools like R markdown should be considered a best practice and hope that this will characterize typical use. Benchmarking was performed on an Intel© Core<sup>TM</sup> i7-4790 CPU at 3.60 GHz with 32 GB of RAM running Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. Results were visualized in R and a linear regression was performed using the R function stats::lm().</p>

      <title>Implementation</title>
      <p>A new update for the R package <italic>vcfR</italic> was recently released including several new functions (<bold>Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref></bold>). The function freq_peak() returns the peaks called for each window as well as diagnostic information. The data in VCF files only includes information for the variable positions. This means that all positions in a window will not be present in VCF data. A lookup table is created and returned that includes the genomic coordinates for each window, the row number of the first and last rows of VCF data that were analyzed, and the genomic position of the first and last variant in each window. This information is intended to coordinate comparisons among data extracted from VCF files and genomic windows. A matrix of variant counts per sample and window is also provided. Because heterozygosity may not be known and some windows may have mapping issues (e.g., high variant counts) or regions of loss of heterozygosity or a high number of missing or ambiguous nucleotides in the reference (low variant counts), this information can be used to help determine optimal window size for a particular organism. Furthermore, this approach can help identify anomalous regions in the genome that may require further scrutiny. Lastly, a matrix of frequencies of allele balance is generated.</p>
      <p>Results of the above process can be visualized and post-processed to obtain copy number calls and quality assessment. The function freq_peak_plot() can be used to visualize the combined VCF derived data and the results of the windowing and peak calling operations. Because the result is a simple data structure (a list of matrices) the universe of R packages that can be used with matrix data are also available to explore the data. The data can also be post processed with the function peak_to_ploid() that converts the allele balance frequency data to an integer copy number as well as distances from expectation:</p>

      <p>The distance from expectation is the observed allele balance frequency subtracted by the frequency expected based on the final determination. This value is then divided by its bin width (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref></bold>) in order to scale it from zero to one where zero represents an allele balance that is exactly on our expectation (e.g., 1/4, 1/3, 1/2, etc.) and one is half way between two expectations. This value can then be used as a measure of confidence in our copy number determination and to omit border cases (instances where the observed allele balance is close to one).</p>

      <title><italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> Dataset</title>
      <p>Analysis of the <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> dataset validated previous reports and revealed new features. The <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> samples were sequenced at about 100X at variable positions (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref></bold>) making it a high coverage dataset. The samples were determined to consist of individuals that were predominantly diploid (CBS7837), triploid (CBS2919), and tetraploid (CBS9564), confirming previous reports (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref></bold>; <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">Weiß et al., 2018</xref>). The samples had a heterozygosity of around 0.003–0.008 heterozygous positions per site (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref></bold>). Because the variant caller (the GATK’s HaplotypeCaller) tends to aggressively call variants, this estimate may include false positives and therefore may be an overestimate of the true biological value. We have previously discussed strategies we feel may improve the quality of called variants to attain a production data set (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Knaus and Grünwald, 2017</xref>). Current functionality in <italic>vcfR</italic> allowed for convenient reproduction of figures previously reported (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref></bold>; <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Zhu et al., 2016</xref>) that indicated intragenomic variation in copy number. This copy number variation was demonstrated to be minor relative to the entire genome (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref></bold>), indicating that while sample YJM1098 may be predominantly diploid, it still contains variation that would not be apparent from whole genome summaries. The use of the <italic>vcfR</italic> functions freq_peak() and peak_to_ploid() provided a sliding window analysis that revealed intragenomic variation in copy number. <bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref></bold> demonstrated the results of the function freq_peak_plot() that revealed a sample that appeared diploid, but contains regions of low heterozygosity such that inferences cannot be made (CBS7837 chromosome XI at around 200 kbp and around 350 kbp). The sample CBS2919 appeared predominantly triploid, consistent with previous findings (<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">Weiß et al., 2018</xref>), but also included a region on chromosome VII from its origin to around 400 kbp that appeared to have four copies. The sample CBS9564 was reported by <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">Weiß et al. (2018)</xref> to be tetraploid, which is in agreement with our results, but also appeared to have regions on chromosome IX that had three or five copies. These findings confirm previous reports and also reveal that new information can be found by investigating specific regions within each genome.</p>

    <title>Discussion</title>
    <p>Numerous studies have used high throughput sequencing to study genetic diversity in populations based on genotypes, or single nucleotide polymorphisms, inferred by variant callers. To our knowledge there is currently no variant caller that can infer the number of alleles to call. Instead, the investigator must specify the number of alleles to call <italic>a priori</italic>. Here we present novel methodologies to infer genomic and subgenomic copy number using HTS data as well as to visualize these data in the R environment.</p>
    <p>Our method builds on existing methods by using a sliding window approach to infer copy number based on the frequency that the most abundant and second most abundant alleles were sequenced at. While we designed this method to work with VCF data (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Danecek et al., 2011</xref>) using the R package <italic>vcfR</italic> (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Knaus and Grünwald, 2017</xref>), we feel an important role of our method is to help make this data available to the existing universe of R packages. VCF data only includes information on variable positions within the genome. We therefore produce a lookup table to identify which genomic windows variants belong to. Other functions convert the VCF data into numeric matrices. In theory, this information could be used to implement other functionality, such as applying mixture models (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Leisch and Gruen, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Fraley et al., 2012</xref>) to the data. It also means that other visualization tools available to the R environment can be used beyond those provided here. Because characterization of copy number may be challenging in certain regions of the genome, e.g., regions rich in transposable elements or problematic assemblies, we provided the count of heterozygous positions for each window as well as the distance from expectation. These metrics provide tools to help judge whether certain regions may have well predicted copy numbers or which regions may require further investigation.</p>
    <p>The existing methods most similar to ours include those of <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Zohren et al. (2016)</xref>, <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Gompert and Mock (2017)</xref>, and <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">Weiß et al. (2018)</xref> because they are all based on the frequency that alleles were sequenced at. Zohren and colleagues used allele balance (which they referred to as allelic ratio) and fit beta-binomial distributions to model diploid individuals and beta-binomial mixture models (the fitting of multiple distributions to a population of data) to model triploid and tetraploid individuals. Likelihoods for each ploidy model were compared using AIC (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Akaike, 1974</xref>), resulting in a single ploidy call for each sample. R code to implement their method is available at Dryad. Gompert and Mock model the ratio of the abundance of the non-reference allele (from biallelic SNPs) to the total number of reads sequenced at each variant using binomial distributions in a Bayesian framework resulting in a single ploidy call for each sample. Their method is implemented in R using <italic>rjags</italic> (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Plummer, 2016</xref>) and is available on CRAN as the package <italic>gbs2ploidy</italic>. The method of Weiß and colleagues is similar to that of Zohren and colleagues in that it employs mixture models; however, it differs in that it uses Gaussian components. It also differs in that it is written in C and designed to work on the BAM files as opposed to heterozygous positions determined by a variant caller. Because it is implemented in a compiled language it is very fast relative to the R implementations. It is also unique in that it employs a uniform noise component. The sample CBS7837 in <bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref></bold> has a well-defined peak, yet the base of the peak varies almost from zero to one indicating a substantial amount of data that deviates from any of our expectations. Similarly, the sample CBS2919 in <bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref></bold> has two well defined peaks but the data does not go to zero between these peaks. This phenomenon can be seen in Zohren and colleagues’ <bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref></bold> and <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Yoshida et al. (2013)</xref>
<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref></bold> and is part of our justification for the use of a non-parametric method. Weiß and colleagues fit this uniform component in an attempt to capture the noise in the data leaving the putatively cleaner data for their Gaussian mixture model. Their software is available on GitHub in the repository named nQuire.</p>
    <p>The method presented has been designed to work with VCF data (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Danecek et al., 2011</xref>) that contains the number of times each allele was sequenced for each variant. In theory, any method that produces a valid VCF file, or the counts of times the most abundant and second most abundant allele were sequenced in a format that can be read into R, can be analyzed. While the examples presented here are based on whole genome sequencing our method should be applicable to data generated with reduced representation libraries. For example, we’ve also used the method with genotyping-by-sequencing data (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Elshire et al., 2011</xref>) processed with TASSEL (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Bradbury et al., 2007</xref>). However, there are some practical matters to consider. This is an analysis of heterozygous positions. Homozygous positions will appear similar regardless of copy number and are uninformative. Organisms that are inbred or have a mode of reproduction that includes selfing may have a low density of heterozygous positions making inferences using our method challenging. The use of reduced representation libraries may also contribute to a lower number of observed heterozygous positions requiring use of larger windows ultimately resulting in a lower resolution to the inference of copy number variation.</p>
    <p>There is currently a diversity of methods available for the analysis of high-throughput sequencing that demonstrates a diversity of performance. This diversity in performance exists in <italic>de novo</italic> assembly software (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Earl et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Bradnam et al., 2013</xref>), variant callers (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Pabinger et al., 2014</xref>), copy number variation callers (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Duan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Pabinger et al., 2014</xref>), and metagenomic pipelines (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Edgar, 2017</xref>). This diversity is likely due to the nascent nature of the data and methods used to analyze it. We hope our method will contribute to the analysis of CNV, but also hope it will stimulate the development of new tools or the integration of these existing methods into new tools to explore copy number variation. Perhaps future improvements can be found by integrating sequence coverage and allele balance data as some authors have already done graphically (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Zhu et al., 2016</xref>).</p>
