    <title>Introduction</title>
    <p>Proteomics technologies
seek to characterize the full complement
of proteins in complex mixtures and have become invaluable for fields
ranging from precision medicine to systems biology. Mass spectrometry
is often the chosen method to detect and quantify the peptides derived
from the enzymatic digest of complex protein mixtures, yielding insights
into the abundance of the original proteins and their post-translational
modifications. Critical to the success of mass spectrometry-based
proteomics experiments is the accurate assignment of peptide sequences
to the acquired mass spectra. The resulting peptide-spectrum matches
(PSMs) are the foundation for inferring and quantifying the detected
peptides and proteins.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref></sup></p>
    <p>The most
common method to assign peptides to mass spectra is through
a database search.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref></sup> Proteomics search engines
compare the theoretical fragments of peptide sequences from a sequence
database against the acquired mass spectra, yielding one or more scores
for each putative peptide-spectrum match (PSM). These scores quantify
the quality of each PSM. Importantly, the incorporation of shuffled
or reversed decoy peptide sequences into the sequence database allows
for the accurate assignment of statistical confidence estimates to
the selected set of PSMs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref></sup> Although many
search engines perform well when PSMs are ranked by the search engine’s
score function, often the sensitivity of peptide detection can be
improved by integrating complementary scores and properties—“features”—that
characterize a PSM.</p>
    <p>Machine learning has been immensely successful
at providing adaptable
and unbiased methods to aggregate multiple features into a single
score that greatly increases the sensitivity of peptide detection.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>−<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref></sup> One such method, Percolator, introduced a method to learn models
directly from the PSMs being analyzed. Percolator uses a set of confident
PSMs as positive examples and decoy PSMs as negative examples to iteratively
learn a support vector machine (SVM) that discriminates between them.
The method is semisupervised because the decoys have negative labels
but the target labels must be inferred. Since its introduction, Percolator
has been widely used and has demonstrably improved the ability to
detect peptides with a wide variety search engines.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref></sup></p>
    <p>Despite its success, analyses conducted with Percolator
are relatively
rigid and may be suboptimal for certain types of experiments. For
example, Percolator is limited to learning linear models, although
it has been demonstrated that nonlinear models can be beneficial.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref></sup> Additionally, Percolator is intended to analyze
each experiment independently; thus, to share a model across multiple
experiments—such as when combining many experiments in a single-cell
proteomics study—an external training data set must be used
to learn a static model.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref></sup></p>
    <p>Here we
present mokapot, a fast and extensible Python implementation
of Percolator’s semisupervised algorithm that provides immense
flexibility for highly customized analyses. We demonstrate the benefits
of this flexibility in two vignettes: the detection of modified peptides
from proteins cross-linked to RNA using an open modification search
and the analysis of single-cell proteomics experiments.</p>

    <title>Methods</title>
    <sec id="sec2.1">
      <title>Benchmarking</title>
      <p>We used the Kim et al. draft map of the
human proteome data set<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref></sup> to benchmark
the performance of mokapot. This data set consists of approximately
25 million mass spectra from LTQ-Orbitrap Elite and Velos mass spectrometers.
The raw data files were downloaded from PRIDE<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref></sup> (PXD000561) and converted to ms2 format using msconvert<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref></sup> with peak-picking and deisotoping filters (“peakPicking
vendor msLevel = 2” and “MS2Deisotope Poisson”).</p>
      <p>We searched the converted files against the canonical UniProt<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref></sup> human proteome using the Tide search engine<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref></sup> with the combined p-value score function.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref></sup> Trypsin without proline suppression was used,
allowing for two missed cleavages. Variable methionine oxidation and
protein N-terminal acetylation modifications were allowed. Additionally,
carbamidomethylation of cysteine was specified as a static modification.
We selected the precursor <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> window
using Param-Medic<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref></sup> and set a fragment
ion tolerance of 0.02 Da. The protein database was processed using
Tide to generate a shuffled decoy peptide sequence for each peptide
sequence in the target database, preserving both termini.</p>
      <p>We
compared the scores and confidence estimates of mokapot to Percolator
v3.05 when used to analyze the same random sample of 1 million PSMs
from the full Kim et al. data set. Additionally, we benchmarked the
speed and memory usage of mokapot and Percolator on various sets of
PSMs sampled from the full data set across logarithmically spaced
intervals. We used the GNU time application to record the total run
time and the maximum memory used (the maximum resident set size) for
both applications run as command line tools. We repeated this process
three times for each set of PSMs and reported the minimum. These analyses
were conducted on a cluster node running CentOS7 and equipped with
12 CPU cores (Intel Xeon E5–2680v3) and 96 Gb of memory.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec2.2">
      <title>Cross-linked RNA-Binding Proteins</title>
      <p>Kramer et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref></sup> provide multiple data sets created from RNA-binding
proteins cross-linked to interacting RNA molecules using ultraviolet
radiation. We chose to reanalyze the yeast experiments from this study
as an example of how mokapot can enhance the detection of modified
peptides. The raw data files were downloaded from the PRIDE Archive
(PXD000513) and converted to mzML format using ThermoRawFileParser,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref></sup> with vendor peak-picking enabled.</p>
      <p>We searched
the converted files against the canonical UniProt yeast (<italic>Saccharomyces
cerevisiae</italic> [strain ATCC 204508/S288c]) reference proteome
concatenated with decoy sequences (6,721 target protein sequences,
downloaded November 4, 2020) using MSFragger v3.1.1.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref></sup> Decoy sequences were generated with mokapot by shuffling
nonterminal amino acids within each tryptic peptide sequence. We performed
an open modification search using a precursor mass window from −150
to 1000 Da, with mass calibration and modification localization enabled.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref></sup> We used trypsin without proline suppression
as the enzyme specificity and allowed for two missed cleavages. Carbamidomethylation
of cysteine was not enabled. Methionine oxidation and protein N-terminal
acetylation were specified as variable modifications. We allowed the
top five matches per spectrum to be reported, so that mokapot would
have the opportunity to rerank them, resulting in 382,148 total PSMs.</p>
      <p>We made minor modifications to the Percolator input files that
were generated by MSFragger. First, the original <italic>ExpMass</italic> column was renamed to <italic>CalcMass</italic>, because it contained
the theoretical peptide mass. The neutral precursor mass was then
added as a new <italic>ExpMass</italic> column. These changes were
necessary to ensure that target–decoy competition resulted
in a single match per spectrum after mokapot analysis. The observed
mass shifts were binned into 0.01 Da increments and appended to the
sequence string in the <italic>Peptide</italic> column to define modified
peptides for confidence estimation. Additionally, we removed the <italic>delta</italic>_<italic>hyperscore</italic> feature out of an abundance
of caution for excluding potential bias, particularly for our nonlinear
models. Finally, we added a <italic>group</italic> column to indicate
whether a peptide was modified—which we defined as having a
mass shift greater than 50 ppm—to serve as the groups for grouped
confidence estimation within mokapot. The features used for mokapot
are detailed in <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.jproteome.0c01010/suppl_file/pr0c01010_si_001.pdf">Table S1</ext-link>.</p>
      <p>Ranking
PSMs by the MSFragger E-value was used as a baseline to
compare against mokapot’s performance using a linear SVM or
a nonlinear XGBoost classifier.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref></sup> For the
XGBoost classifier, mokapot allowed us to perform a hyperparameter
grid search using the nested cross-validation strategy proposed by
Granholm et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref></sup> over the following parameters: <italic>scale</italic>_<italic>pos</italic>_<italic>weight</italic> (1, 10,
100), <italic>max</italic>_<italic>depth</italic> (1, 3, 6), <italic>min</italic>_<italic>child</italic>_<italic>weight</italic> (1, 10,
100), and <italic>gamma</italic> (0, 1, 10). The feature importance
values for both models were estimated by randomly permuting each feature
and observing the average effect on the score for all modified PSMs,
repeated five times.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref></sup> These values were
then normalized such that the sum of all features was one, providing
a relative scale to compare the two models.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec2.3">
      <title>Single-Cell Proteomics</title>
      <p>We chose to analyze the Specht
et al. single-cell proteomics data set<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref></sup> to demonstrate the benefits that joint modeling provides. This data
set consists of two sets of experiments: a set of 76 mass spectrometry
acquisitions for quality control and a set of 69 mass spectrometry
acquisitions assessing macrophage differentiation. All of the acquisitions
were performed on a Q-Exactive mass spectrometer, where a single acquisition
is a multiplexed experiment analyzing multiple single cells using
tandem mass tag (TMT) 10-plex reagents. The raw data files were downloaded
from MassIVE<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref></sup> (MSV000083945) and converted
to mzML format using ThermoRawFileParser, with vendor peak-picking
enabled.</p>
      <p>We searched the converted files against the canonical
UniProt/Swiss-Prot human proteome (20,416 protein sequences, downloaded
September 6, 2019) using Tide with the combined p-value score function.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref></sup> Trypsin without proline suppression was used,
allowing for two missed cleavages. The protein database was processed
using Tide to generate a shuffled decoy peptide sequence for each
peptide sequence in the target database, preserving both termini.
We selected the precursor <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> window
using Param-Medic<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref></sup> and set a fragment
ion tolerance of 0.02 Da. We included the TMT 10-plex modification
of lysine and the peptide N-terminus as a static modification, but
carbamidomethylation of cysteine was not included. Additionally, we
considered the oxidation of methionine, protein N-terminal acetylation,
and deamidation of asparagine as variable modifications. Four of the
macrophage differentiation experiments resulted in no PSMs at a 1%
false discovery rate (FDR) threshold and were excluded from further
analysis.</p>
      <p>We analyzed the macrophage differentiation experiments
with mokapot
using three approaches: treating each experiment independently, learning
a joint model from all of the macrophage differentiation experiments,
or learning a static model from the quality control experiments and
applying it to the macrophage differentiation experiments.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec2.4">
      <title>The Mokapot
Algorithm</title>
      <p>The algorithm for the primary
mokapot workflow begins by dividing the provided PSMs into cross-validation
splits as proposed by Granholm et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref></sup> and implemented in Percolator. Each split is comprised of a disjoint
training set and test set, where the training set is used to train
the model. The final score for each PSM is derived from the score
assigned by the learned model to that PSM only when it is a member
of the test set; thus, no PSMs are scored by the same model that they
were used to train. Given this approach, a single analysis with mokapot
requires multiple models to be trained, one for each training set.
The cross-validation approach used by mokapot—and likewise,
Percolator—is critical for preventing individual models from
overfitting to a collection of PSMs, which otherwise could result
in biased confidence estimates.</p>
      <p>Model training occurs in accordance
with the Percolator algorithm. First, positive examples are defined
as PSMs in the training set that meet a prescribed FDR threshold using
the best feature—that is, the feature that yields the largest
number of discoveries at the FDR threshold provided when used to rank
the PSMs. Likewise, negative examples are defined as decoy PSMs in
the training set. Optionally, a hyperparameter optimization method
can be employed within each split before proceeding to train the model.
By default, mokapot uses a linear SVM as its model and employs a hyperparameter
grid search to determine the cost of positive and negative misclassifications,
emulating the approach used by Percolator. However, any model and
hyperparameter optimization approach compliant with the Scikit-learn
interface can be used in mokapot.</p>
      <p>Model training then proceeds
in an iterative manner. In each iteration,
the model learns to separate the positive and negative examples it
is provided. Once complete, the model is used to rescore all of the
PSMs in the training set, and a new set of positive examples is defined
by assessing which PSMs meet the prescribed FDR threshold when ranked
by the new score. This process is repeated, aggregating more PSMs
into the positive examples with each iteration for typically ten iterations
or until the selected set of positives stops changing.</p>
      <p>After
a model is trained with each cross-validation split, the
learned models are used to score their respective test sets. When
the model does not already output a calibrated score—such as
a probability—mokapot calibrates the score between cross-validation
splits, again according to Granholm et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref></sup> Finally, confidence estimation is performed with PSMs ranked by
the scores provided by the new models. When a joint model is used,
confidence estimates are assigned independently for each experiment.
Furthermore, if groups are defined, then confidence estimates are
assigned independently within each group as well.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref></sup></p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec2.5">
      <title>Confidence Estimation</title>
      <p>Mokapot provides two forms of
confidence estimates: <italic>q</italic>-values and posterior error
probabilities (PEPs). The <italic>q</italic>-value is defined as the
minimal false discovery rate (FDR) threshold at which a discovery
would be accepted. In mokapot, the FDR for a collection of PSMs and
peptides is estimated using target-decoy competition. Formally, we
denote the number of target discoveries as <italic>m</italic><sub><italic>t</italic></sub> and the number of decoy discoveries as <italic>m</italic><sub><italic>d</italic></sub>. Likewise, we denote scores
of target discoveries as <italic>t</italic><sub>1</sub>, <italic>t</italic><sub>2</sub>, ..., <italic>t</italic><sub><italic>m</italic><sub><italic>t</italic></sub></sub> and the scores of decoy discoveries
as <italic>d</italic><sub>1</sub>, <italic>d</italic><sub>2</sub>,
..., <italic>d</italic><sub><italic>m</italic><sub><italic>d</italic></sub></sub>. For each spectrum, we retain only the best scoring
peptide, with ties broken randomly so as not to impose a bias toward
target or decoy PSMs. For peptide-level confidence estimation, we
retain only the best scoring PSM per peptide. The estimated FDR at
a threshold τ is computed as the number of decoy discoveries
that meet the threshold—which provide an estimate for the number
of false positives accepted at this threshold—divided by the
number of target discoveries that meet the threshold. We add one to
the number of decoy discoveries, so as to prevent liberal FDR estimates
for smaller collections of discoveries:<disp-formula id="eq1"><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="pr0c01010_m001" position="anchor"/><label>1</label></disp-formula>Thereafter, the <italic>q</italic>-value is
defined as<disp-formula id="eq2"><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="pr0c01010_m002" position="anchor"/><label>2</label></disp-formula></p>
      <p>Protein-level <italic>q</italic>-values
are estimated using the picked-protein approach.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref></sup> Briefly, protein sequences are assigned to protein groups
if the enzymatic peptides form a formal subset of those generated
by another protein. The best PSM for each protein group is then retained,
and target proteins compete against their decoy counterparts, eliminating
the lower scoring of the pair. The protein groups are then assigned <italic>q</italic>-values using <xref rid="eq1" ref-type="disp-formula">eqs <xref rid="eq1" ref-type="disp-formula">1</xref></xref> and <xref rid="eq2" ref-type="disp-formula">2</xref>.</p>
      <p>The PEP is the probability
that the observed discovery is incorrect.
In mokapot, we use the qvality method<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref></sup> as implemented in triqler<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref></sup> to estimate
the PEP for each PSM, peptide, and protein group after the competition
procedures described above.</p>

      <title>Nonlinear Models and Grouped Confidence Estimates
Improve the
Detection of Modified Peptides</title>
      <p>Many proteomics experiments
aim to characterize the post-translational modifications borne by
proteins in a sample, and open modification searching<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">32</xref></sup>—where a peptide sequence is assigned to a mass spectrum
while allowing for unspecified modifications—has become a popular
method to accomplish this task. In this type of analysis, every PSM
has an associated mass shift that indicates the difference between
the observed precursor mass and the theoretical mass of the peptide.
To demonstrate the utility of mokapot in this context, we analyzed
a data set where RNA-binding proteins were cross-linked to interacting
RNA and subsequently analyzed by mass spectrometry.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref></sup> After performing an open modification search with MSFragger,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref></sup> we were interested only in the modified peptides
where we expected to find mass shifts corresponding to cross-linked
RNA polymers. This analysis provided the opportunity to demonstrate
two features of mokapot: grouped confidence estimates and the ability
to use any type of machine learning classifier.</p>
      <p>Grouped confidence
estimates have proven to be useful when a subset of peptides are of
interest or there is an expected shift in the score distribution between
sets of PSMs in the experiment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref></sup> In mokapot, PSMs can
be easily assigned to groups, such that a model is learned from all
of the PSMs, but confidence estimates are calculated separately within
each group. For our analysis of the RNA-binding protein data set,
we were only interested in discovering modified peptides; hence, we
designated PSMs with a mass shift greater than 50 ppm to be our group
of interest.</p>
      <p>The mass shift presents an interesting potential
feature for models
to learn from in mokapot. Although the mass shift can take any continuous
value within the mass tolerance of our database search, we expect
the correctly assigned PSMs to exhibit a discrete set of mass shifts
corresponding to the masses of possible chemical moieties. Unfortunately,
a linear model, such as the linear SVM employed by Percolator, cannot
fully exploit the discrete nature of the mass shifts. However, we
designed mokapot with a Scikit-learn interface<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">33</xref></sup> that makes it compatible with any type of machine learning
classifier, allowing us to use nonlinear models that can fully exploit
the mass shift feature.</p>
      <p>We analyzed the RNA-binding protein
data set using both the default
linear SVM and a nonlinear gradient boosting classifier implemented
by XGBoost.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref></sup> The two models were evaluated
using the <italic>q</italic>-values estimated by mokapot, which indicate
the minimum false discovery rate (FDR) at which a discovery is accepted.
We found that the XGBoost classifier increased our sensitivity, enabling
us to detect an additional 2,161 modified PSMs (15%, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref></xref>a), 881 peptides (19%, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref></xref>b), and 82 proteins
(11%, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref></xref>c) at
1% FDR. Furthermore, when we inspected the relative importance of
each feature, we found that the XGBoost classifier relied more heavily
on the mass shift feature than did the linear SVM (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.jproteome.0c01010/suppl_file/pr0c01010_si_001.pdf">Figure S1</ext-link>). We then investigated the mass shifts associated
with PSMs gained or lost by the XGBoost classifier. We found a notable
increase in the number of putative phosphorylated and carbamylated
peptides detected (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref></xref>c), consistent with the employed sample preparation procedure.
More importantly, we also observed an increase in the number of PSMs
with mass shifts corresponding to putative AU and ACU RNA cross-links.</p>

      <title>Joint Modeling Increases the Power and Consistency of Peptide
Detection from Single-Cell Proteomics Experiments</title>
      <p>Another
common task for proteomics studies is the quantitative comparison
of peptides and proteins detected from multiple experimental conditions.
Although each experiment can be analyzed independently with mokapot,
we previously observed increased variability and loss of power to
detect PSMs and peptides when the individual experiments consist of
relatively few total or confident PSMs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref></sup> One solution is to learn a static model from a large training data
set and then use the learned model to evaluate the small-scale experiments
of interest. However, this static modeling approach relies on the
availability of a training data set that is independent of the experiments
of interest, thereby restricting this approach to cases where a training
set is available. Alternatively, mokapot offers a joint modeling approach:
learn a joint model from the aggregate of all PSMs in a data set,
then assign confidence estimates within each experiment. We hypothesized
that this joint modeling approach would offer a similar gain in power
and consistency as observed with the static model but without the
need for an external training data set.</p>
      <p>We tested the joint
modeling approach in mokapot by analyzing the single-cell proteomics
data set from Specht et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref></sup> We sought
to evaluate whether joint models improved the consistency of peptide
detection across 65 experiments when compared to analyzing each experiment
independently or using a static model. We found that the joint modeling
approach consistently increased the numbers of confidently detected
PSMs, peptides, and proteins at 1% FDR over analyzing each experiment
independently (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>A). However, we also observed a loss of detections in several experiments
when using a joint model. Specifically, we found that experiments
with many accepted PSMs before mokapot analysis tended to benefit
less from the joint modeling approach in comparison to experiments
with relatively few accepted PSMs, which is consistent with our previous
observations from static models in Percolator.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref></sup> Despite these losses, we find that the joint modeling approach is
valuable for the single-cell proteomics setting: the joint models
increased the number of peptides and proteins detected across multiple
experiments (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>B and C), which is critical for reducing missing values in downstream
quantitative analyses.</p>

PSMs, peptides, and proteins at 1% FDR than when experiments are analyzed
individually. The detected (b) peptides and (c) proteins are more
consistent across experiments using joint models in comparison to

are comparable to using a static model but without the requirement
of a training data set.</p>

      <p>To be practically useful,
mokapot must be fast. We profiled the
runtime and memory usage of mokapot to assess its scalability. To
accomplish this, we ran mokapot and Percolator on increasing numbers
of PSMs sampled from the Kim et al. human proteome data set.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref></sup> These benchmarking experiments revealed that
the run time and memory usage of mokapot, like Percolator, scale approximately
linearly with the number of PSMs when a linear SVM is used (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.jproteome.0c01010/suppl_file/pr0c01010_si_001.pdf">Figure S2</ext-link>). Additionally, we found that mokapot
can reliably reproduce Percolator results when both are provided the
same set of PSMs to analyze (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.jproteome.0c01010/suppl_file/pr0c01010_si_001.pdf">Figure S3</ext-link>).</p>
      <p>Mokapot is an open-source Python package (<uri xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://github.com/wfondrie/mokapot">https://github.com/wfondrie/mokapot</uri>) and can be readily extended to new types of proteomics data as
they arise.</p>
