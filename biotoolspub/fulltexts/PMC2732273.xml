    <title>1 INTRODUCTION</title>
    <p>Historically, three factors have led to a significant overhead in developing proteomics software. The first challenge of writing analysis tools is supporting data generated by different vendors; each vendor typically encodes their data in a vendor-specific, proprietary, closed format, with access restricted to a particular operating system. To simplify cross-vendor software development two open formats were created (Pedrioli <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">2004</xref>), which led to the second challenge: reading and writing of these open formats. No single, natively-compiling cross-platform, open-source software library, has emerged to allow academic and commercial groups to encode or access encoded data. Despite this, the existence of open standards greatly simplified development, and numerous open source software projects, such as the Trans-Proteomic Pipeline (TPP) (Keller <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">2005</xref>), the OpenMS Proteomic Pipeline (TOPP) (Kohlbacher <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2007</xref>) and the Computational Proteomics Analysis System (CPAS) (Rauch <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">2006</xref>) were built upon the open formats. More recently, the HUPO-PSI and Institute for Systems Biology have taken an important step in simplifying proteomics software development by creating the mzML data format standard to be released in June 2008 (Orchard <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">2007</xref>). The third challenge is the lack of a single, standard cross-platform library that performs common calculations, such as protein digestion, mass computation, peak integration, charge state detection and isotope deconvolution. Consequently, these calculations have been repeatedly implemented in the course of developing more sophisticated tools.</p>
  </sec>
  <sec id="SEC2">
    <title>2 DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION</title>
    <p>ProteoWizard has been designed from the ground-up with testability in mind. Each code module has a unit test that runs automatically during the build process. In addition, the data model has âdiffâ calculations built in, for validating data after format conversion or preprocessing.</p>
    <p>As illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>, ProteoWizard is built from many independent libraries, grouped together in dependency levels. Each library depends only on libraries in lower levels of the hierarchy. The lowest layer, the utility layer, contains independent classes that perform computations applicable in a wide variety of situations such as binary to text encoding, XML parsing and mathematical calculations that are common in data analysis. Abstract interfaces are used in analysis modules to facilitate comparison between different algorithms. Below we describe the data and analysis layers in greater detail.
<fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Fig. 1.</label><caption><p>ProteoWizard architecture.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="btn323f1"/></fig></p>
    <sec id="SEC2.1">
      <title>2.1 The data layer</title>
      <p>The ProteoWizard data layer abstracts the source data file, hiding any format-specific details. The underlying data model of the data layer is a one-to-one translation from mzML data elements to C++ data structures. This mapping is shown in the data model details in the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/btn323/DC1">Supplementary Material</ext-link>. Metadata fields are encoded in &lt;cvParam&gt; elements, which refer to terms (by their accession number) in a controlled vocabulary (CV) maintained in a central repository by the HUPO-PSI. ProteoWizard parses the CV file at compile time and generates C++ code, which allows convenient, typesafe handling of the CV terms.</p>
      <p>The data model uses a virtual interface for accessing spectrum lists, to allow lazy evaluation when accessing the spectra contained in a data file, improving data access time, as files can be read incrementally as needed.</p>
      <p>Vendor proprietary formats are handled with a plug-in reader interface. ProteoWizard currently supports reading of mzML, mzXML and Thermo RAW files. As vendor libraries are subject to platform restrictions some features of ProteoWizard may only be available if a vendor library is found at runtime. Collaboration with other labs (Vanderbilt, Nashville, TN, ISB, Seattle, WA) are underway to implement readers for all vendor formats.</p>
      <p>Data writing is also handled in a modular, extensible manner, with C++ iostream serialization currently supported for mzML and mzXML. Because ProteoWizard has been released with a permissive license, it can be incorporated in commercial software projects.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="SEC2.2">
      <title>2.2 The analysis layer</title>
      <p>The analysis layer contains all scientific computation, in reusable modules that are independent of platform and data format. Currently available are modules for convenient access to the underlying data model, spectrum data caching, data and metadata extraction, selected ion chromatogram calculation and pseudo-2D-gel image creation. There are also independent modules for handling chemical formulas, peptide calculations and isotope envelopes. More analysis modules are currently in development, with an emphasis on establishing standard interfaces for common proteomics computations, such as peak picking, isotope de-convolution and precursor estimation. Our goal is to work collaboratively to create an analysis infrastructure in which experts in a particular area will be able to contribute a module that can then be plugged into various software tools. This will allow, for example, an expert in signal processing to create and contribute a peak picker, without having to handle details about file formats, operating system or command line configuration.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="SEC2.3">
      <title>2.3 The tools layer</title>
      <p>The tools layer code is responsible only for regulating interaction between the user and the analysis modules. Several tools have been implemented using the ProteoWizard Library including:
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p><italic>msConvert</italic>: data format conversion from vendor proprietary formats to mzML and mzXML.</p></list-item><list-item><p><italic>msDiff</italic>: comparison of two data files, for validation of conversion and preprocessing.</p></list-item><list-item><p><italic>msAccess</italic>: command line access to mass spec data files, including spectrum binary data and metadata, selected ion chromatograms. The modular layout of msAccess is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>.</p></list-item><list-item><p><italic>msPicture</italic>: pseudo-2D gel image creation tool. msPicture can read from a variety of formats to generate dataset images. In addition, if given a pepXML file, msPicture can denote triggered MS/MS, colored by peptideProphet score. We show an example output in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>.</p></list-item></list>
The hello_analyzer program has been provided in the code example supplement as a demonstration of how easily one can use Proteowizard for creating analysis tools.

    <title>3 SUMMARY AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS</title>
    <p>As the proteomics field continues to grow, an increasing number of research groups are writing custom software for data analysis. Our goal is for ProteoWizard to become a repository where proteomics software developers can share their work, and benefit from the work of others. We welcome contributions of existing code, or new projects that will benefit the proteomics community. Already, the TPP tools will be using ProteoWizard to support mzML in the next major release, in advance of the formal release of mzML at ASMS 2008. SWIG bindings are currently being developed to allow access to the ProteoWizard Library from JAVA, Python, PERL and R.</p>
