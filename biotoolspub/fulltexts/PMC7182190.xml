    <abstract>
      <p>The software programs STRUCTURE and NEWHYBRIDS are widely used population genetic programs useful in addressing questions related to genetic structure, admixture, and hybridization. These programs usually require a large number of independent runs with many iterations to provide robust data for downstream analyses, thus significantly increasing computation time. Programs such as Structure_threader and parallelnewhybrid were previously developed to address this problem by processing tasks in parallel on a multi-threaded processor; however some programming knowledge (e.g., R, Bash) is required to run these programs. We developed EasyParallel as a community resource to facilitate practical and routine population structure and hybridization analyses. The multi-threaded parallelization of EasyParallel allows processing of large genetic datasets in a very efficient way, with its point-and-click GUI providing ready access to users who have little experience in script programming. Performance evaluation of EasyParallel using simulated datasets showed similar speed-up and parallel execution time when compared to Structure_threader and Parallelnewhybrid. EasyParallel is written in Python 3 and freely available on the GitHub site <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/hzz0024/EasyParallel">https://github.com/hzz0024/EasyParallel</ext-link>.</p>

    <title>1. Introduction</title>
    <p>Recent advances in next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies and the decreased cost of NGS have led to a rapid accumulation of genetic data for both model and non-model organisms [<xref rid="pone.0232110.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. To accommodate this data explosion, new tools and computation platforms were developed to perform parallelized data analyses [<xref rid="pone.0232110.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0232110.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. However, most of these programs were compiled and executed in command-line based environments (e.g., Linux, R), which could make them less accessible and appealing to users who have little programming background. Moreover, some programs require independent runs with many iterations to provide robust data for downstream analysis, making it time-consuming when the dataset includes a large number of individuals and genetic markers.</p>
    <p>One such example is STRUCTURE [<xref rid="pone.0232110.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. This Bayesian-based clustering approach utilizes individual genotypes and population allele frequencies to cluster individuals, with the assumptions of Hardy–Weinberg and linkage equilibrium of marker loci within populations [<xref rid="pone.0232110.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Since its publication, STRUCTURE has been widely applied to address questions related to population structure, species or individual assignment, hybridization and introgression [<xref rid="pone.0232110.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0232110.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Because STRUCTURE requires to minimize the effect of the starting configuration, many iterations are needed during the burnin process [<xref rid="pone.0232110.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. More importantly, STRUCTURE is usually run with many iterations for different genetic cluster values (<italic>K</italic>) to determine the optimal number of populations [<xref rid="pone.0232110.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], thus significantly increasing computational times.</p>
    <p>Another program requiring a large number of independent runs is NEWHYBRIDS [<xref rid="pone.0232110.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Using Bayesian model-based clustering and MCMC simulation, NEWHYBRIDS computes the posterior probability of each individual that falls into distinct hybrid classes [<xref rid="pone.0232110.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Although both programs were designed with graphical interfaces and cross-platform compatibility (Linux, Windows, and MacOS), the native GUIs do not facilitate multiple independent analyses. Additionally, parameters and input files must be copied and edited manually between runs, which introduces the potential for human errors [<xref rid="pone.0232110.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. To increase the efficiency and speed of running these programs, strategies such as parallel processing and script programming on multiple cores/threads have been previously proposed for STRUCTURE or NEWHYBRIDS analyses [<xref rid="pone.0232110.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0232110.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Although these strategies are invariably more convenient and efficient, some knowledge of programming languages is still needed.</p>
    <p>The program EasyParallel presented in this article is provided as a free cross-platform tool that utilizes a multi-thread parallel algorithm for processing multiple iterations of STRUCTURE and NEWHYBRIDS analyses. EasyParallel employs a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) and multi-core parallelization for multiple independent runs of a dataset.</p>

      <title>2.1 Overview</title>
      <p>EasyParallel is freely available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/hzz0024/EasyParallel">https://github.com/hzz0024/EasyParallel</ext-link> with installation instructions and a brief demo provided in the <italic>Documentation</italic> site. EasyParallel requires the command-line version of STRUCTURE and NEWHYBRIDS programs. Thus, a user must download the correct version of the target program and load the main directory (with executable files) to EasyParallel. Python is used for directory creation, data processing, parallel runs, and file writing operations. At present, EasyParallel can perform parallel replication runs for STRUCTURE and NEWHYBRIDS across MacOS and Windows operating systems, with all source code packaged for the direct run without installation. However, the open-source design of EasyParallel can be extended to other compatible software that requires multiple iterations or simulations for data analysis.</p>

      <title>2.2 Parallel scheme</title>
      <p>In order to achieve parallelism, one intuitive approach is to copy the entire folder <italic>n</italic> times (<italic>n</italic> is the number of the run) and run each copy in parallel. On the contrary, we use a “single executable multiple working directories” scheme–i.e., each subprocess executes the same executable file, but in different working directories. The “multiple working directories” design is implemented with the subprocess management (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/subprocess.html">https://docs.python.org/2/library/subprocess.html</ext-link>) of Python Standard Library, a module which is able to set the child working directory before it is executed. The benefit of our design is two-fold: 1) we execute the software <italic>n</italic> times in parallel without the necessity to make <italic>n</italic> copies of the executable file. All the child processes share the same executable file, and produce the outputs in an independent directory; 2) EasyParallel platform is not confined by output constraints (e.g., NEWHYBRIDS does not allow specification of an output directory and generates outputs into the working directory instead). In our design, such constraints are addressed by designated working directories.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec005">
      <title>2.3 User-friendly GUI</title>
      <p>For the EasyParallel graphical user interface (GUI), we provide a progress bar and a window to show the status of parallelization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0232110.g001">Fig 1</xref>). Because both STRUCTURE and NEWHYBRIDS require specific parameters for data running, the software interface for each module was designed to support parameter modification (e.g., number of repeats and threads used for parallel execution). In addition, the user could specify the location of additional datasets and parameter input files in an intuitive and convenient manner (e.g., drag <italic>mainparams</italic> and <italic>extraparams</italic> files directly to the EasyParallel GUI for STRUCTURE analysis).

      <title>2.4 Execution time analyses</title>
      <p>We used two datasets available in Pina-Martins et al., [<xref rid="pone.0232110.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] and Wringe [<xref rid="pone.0232110.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] to evaluate the execution time and speed gain of EasyParallel in STRUCTURE and NEWHYBRIDS analyses, respectively. We used the GUI version for execution time analyses. Four laptops with various core architectures (2, 4, and 6 physical cores) and different operating systems (Windows and MacOS) were used for performance comparison: Lenovo Y510, Windows 10, 2.4 GHz Intel Core i7- 4700MQ with 8 GB RAM, 4 physical cores with 8 logical threads (i7 4700MQ); Lenovo Y700, Windows 10, 2.6 GHz Intel Core i7-6700HQ with 8 GB RAM, 4 physical cores with 8 logical threads (i7 6700HQ); MacBook Pro, OS 10.14, 2.7 GHz Intel Core i5 with 16 GB RAM, 2 physical cores (MacPro i5); MacBook Pro, OS 10.14, 2.6 GHz Intel Core i7 with 16 GB RAM, 6 physical cores (MacPro i7). The test file used for STRUCTURE analysis consisted of 100 individuals and 80 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) loci (total 8,000 genotypes with no missing data). This dataset was initially crafted based on data from the 1,000 Genomes Project (The 1,000 Genomes Project Consortium, 2015) and is available in the program’s repository. STRUCTURE was run using the admixture model with correlated allele frequencies and 5 × 10<sup>4</sup> burn-in period followed by 1 × 10<sup>6</sup> Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) repeats. These settings were applied for values of <italic>K</italic> ranging from 1 to 4, with four independent runs for each K (a total of 16 STRUCTURE runs). For NEWHYBRIDS, eight independent analyses were run on a simulated data set with 100 loci and 200 individuals for each of the six genotype frequency classes (pure1, pure2, F1, F2, BC1, and BC2), with an initial burn-in of 500 replicates and 1,000 MCMC sweeps afterward (following the same settings as Wringe et al, [<xref rid="pone.0232110.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]). To assess the execution time obtained by parallelization in EasyParallel, we computed the “speed up” values using the equation of S<sub>p</sub> = T<sub>1</sub>/T<sub>p</sub>, where S<sub>p</sub> is the speed-up obtained by distributing one analysis on <italic>p</italic> threads, T<sub>1</sub> is the execution time on a single thread (sequential run), and T<sub>p</sub> is the execution time of the task on <italic>p</italic> threads [<xref rid="pone.0232110.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. We also compared the parallel performance between EasyParallel and two existing software, Structure_threader and Parallelnewhybrid, by using the same parameter settings and datasets for parallel analyses. Structure_threader was previously proven to be more efficient and faster than similar multiple-thread methods for performing multiple STRUCTURE runs (StrAuto and ParallelStructure), and therefore was considered an optimal target for performance comparison [<xref rid="pone.0232110.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0232110.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Parallelnewhybrid was the only known R package designed to execute multiple NEWHYBRIDS runs in parallel [<xref rid="pone.0232110.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p>

    <title>3. Results and discussion</title>
    <p>For all STRUCTURE and NEWHYBRIDS analyses, the parallel computational time in EasyParallel was faster than a sequential run using a single thread in general (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0232110.g002">Fig 2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0232110.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). However, we note that the speed gain of parallelization was not linear with the increased number of threads. This phenomenon has been previously reported in other parallel programs [<xref rid="pone.0232110.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0232110.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0232110.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. One potential explanation for this nonlinearity is that the operating system and processor must deal with computation resources utilized by intensive tasks (i.e. STRUCTURE and NEWHYBRIDS parallel runs) and underlying system processes, therefore affecting the performance of parallelization [<xref rid="pone.0232110.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. On the other hand, the occurrence of “Cache trashing” may impact the speed of parallelization when working with larger data sets and when both logical threads (in one physical core) share L2 and L3 caches [<xref rid="pone.0232110.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. However, despite the nonlinearity issue, we observed that the performance of EasyParallel was not limited by the availability of random access memory (RAM), as the usage of RAM was always low during parallelization.</p>

    <p>The runtime and speed gain obtained by EasyParallel, Structure_threader, and Parallelnewhybrid were very similar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0232110.g002">Fig 2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0232110.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), regardless of the number of threads, operating systems, or CPU processors used for the analysis. The same implementation of “multiprocessing” and “subprocess” modules in both EasyParallel and Structure_threader would explain the minimal difference in performance for repeated STRUCTURE running. On the other hand, although EasyParallel and Parallelnewhybrid performed equally well in analyzing multiple simulated data sets, EasyParallel was more efficient in processing the input data, as each thread shared the same executable input file. Parallelnewhybrid, however, needs to duplicate the input data for each thread execution and produce temporary files during parallel computing. Beyond that, the key feature of EasyParallel is its graphical user interface, which facilitates data processing and makes it accessible to users who have limited knowledge in any programming language.</p>

    <title>4. Conclusion</title>
    <p>In summary, we have developed a Python-based software that assists users working with iteration processes in STRUCTURE and NEWHYBRIDS analyses. EasyParallel is a user-friendly and free platform that combines a point-and-click interface and multi-core parallelization for multiple independent runs of the dataset, assisting the user in assessing the most biologically likely <italic>K</italic> and estimating hybrid class assignment accuracy. EasyParallel is also a stand-alone software executable for both MacOS and Windows operating systems, with all modules and the source code packaged for the direct run without installation.</p>

    <p>Reviewer #1: This manuscript has the potential to be useful and talks about one GUI platform for parallelization. Its point-and-click, simple and intuitive platform called EasyParallel. I ran the example data that comes with STRUCTURE and NEWHYBRIDS following the “Demo” available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://webhome.auburn.edu/~hzz0024/web/demo/">http://webhome.auburn.edu/~hzz0024/web/demo/</ext-link> and works pretty well in my computer. However, it’s pretty similar with already exist for parallelization. I really recommend the authors include more functions or tools to let the software more attractive, for example: function to help the users to build the input files for STRUCTURE and NEWHYBRIDS, in other words, a similar approach of questions and answers where the user inform the parameters to get the input files for parallelization. Also, the authors could add a window for results interpretation with, for example graphics and tables, because if the main goal is people with little experience in programming with the actual version of EasyParallel those people still needing other software to process the outputs and make graphics. I tried to insert point-by-point my comments to help in the correction process:</p>
    <p>Line 55-57: Its redundant.</p>
    <p>Line 70: “ … Monte Carlo (MCMC) to resampling …“</p>
    <p>Line 71: I had the impression that the authors are using the word “burnin” as the same idea as total “iterations”. Normally, only the first portion of interactions are called by burnin, where the interaction process exercised the priors. This testing will force failures under supervised conditions and then established the interactions. Could you review this sentence to follow the cited paper Porras-Hurtado et al (2013): “STRUCTURE uses a systematic Bayesian clustering approach applying Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) estimation. The MCMC process begins by randomly assigning individuals to a pre-determined number of groups, then variant frequencies are estimated in each group and individuals re-assigned based on those frequency estimates. This is repeated many times, typically comprising 100,000 iterations, in the burnin process that results in a progressive convergence toward reliable allele frequency estimates in each population and membership probabilities of individuals to a population.</p>
    <p>Measurement of the assumed number of populations uses the MCMC estimation and is performed separately from the burnin.”.</p>
    <p>Line 91-92: This is not one of your objectives. In my opinion EasyParallel is doing only the parallelization process and the other software (STRUCTURE and NEWHYBRIDS) are “assisting the user in assessing the most biologically likely number of clusters (K) and estimating hybrid class assignment accurately.”.</p>
    <p>Line 128: It is not clear if the “Execution Time Analyses” was performed using the GUI version or code line.</p>
    <p>Line 133-138: Why the authors chose these specific machines? Why did not you use computers with i3 or 4GB RAM, that regular people with no experience with programing have?</p>
    <p>Line 143: “MCMC” also is an iteration process as “burnin”, please be consistent.</p>
    <p>Line 162: “always” it is not true for “i7.6700HQ” and “MacPro i5” during the STRUCTURE comparation. Please use terms as “in general” or “majority”.</p>
    <p>Line 171-173: I did not find these results. Could you add a table as a supplementary file with these RAM results? I believe the execution time is being influenced by the fact of MacOS’s computers have twice RAM than Windows’s.</p>
    <p>Line 173-177: This comparation should be made with similar machines, same processor (i3, i5, i7, or i9), RAM, physical cores, etc. Also, the comparation of operating systems is not one of your objectives.</p>
    <p>Line 195-197: Only in this last sentence is clear that the software doesn’t has the option to run in command code or prompt. Please be more specific and move this part for material and methods.</p>
    <p>Figure 1: I confess that I spent a time trying to understand why the EasyParallel logo is a fish. I understand the group works with aquaculture but using a fish as logo is not helping at all to get attention for the software. I really recommend change the logo for some genetic or parallel symbol. In addition, it will be interesting and helpful if the software provides some results visualization as graphics and tables as suggested above.</p>
    <p>Figure 2: The authors are comparing computers and not software, which it is the main idea. I recommend to exchange the position of software and computer where the lines should be the software (EasyParallel, STRUCTURE and NEWHYBRIDS).</p>
    <p>Table 1: Use “-” instead NA.</p>
    <p>The manual is clear and well done. Only one correction in “Step 3” where the mainparams was wrote twice at the link: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://webhome.auburn.edu/~hzz0024/web/doc/">http://webhome.auburn.edu/~hzz0024/web/doc/</ext-link>.</p>
    <p>Reviewer #2: This paper presented a Python-based software named EasyParallel that assists users working with iteration processes in STRUCTURE and NEWHYBRIDS analyses. STRUCTURE and NEWHYBRIDS software are widely used in population genetic structure studies, admixture, and hybridization. The analyzes performed by these programs usually require a large computational time, especially when large genotyped populations with a large number of molecular markers are analyzed. The multi-threaded parallelization of EasyParallel allows processing of large genetic datasets in an efficient way, providing ready access to users who have little experience in script programming. The authors use clear and straightforward language and provide all relevant data and information. Therefore, I recommend accepting the article for publication.</p>

    <p>________________________________________</p>
    <p>Reviewer #1: This manuscript has the potential to be useful and talks about one GUI platform for parallelization. Its point-and-click, simple and intuitive platform called EasyParallel. I ran the example data that comes with STRUCTURE and NEWHYBRIDS following the “Demo” available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://webhome.auburn.edu/~hzz0024/web/demo/">http://webhome.auburn.edu/~hzz0024/web/demo/</ext-link> and works pretty well in my computer. However, it’s pretty similar with already exist for parallelization. </p>
    <p>We appreciate reviewer’s comments here. We agree that programs such as Structure_threader and parallelnewhybrid have been developed to help process tasks in parallel on a multi-threaded processor. However, such software requires minimum programming knowledge (e.g., R, Bash) for program running. To our best knowledge, our program is the first GUI platform that supports parallel running of STRUCTURE and NEWHYBRIDS.</p>
    <p>I really recommend the authors include more functions or tools to let the software more attractive, for example: function to help the users to build the input files for STRUCTURE and NEWHYBRIDS, in other words, a similar approach of questions and answers where the user inform the parameters to get the input files for parallelization. Also, the authors could add a window for results interpretation with, for example graphics and tables, because if the main goal is people with little experience in programming with the actual version of EasyParallel those people still needing other software to process the outputs and make graphics. I tried to insert point-by-point my comments to help in the correction process:</p>
    <p>While we appreciate the reviewer’s suggestion here, we feel that it requires a careful design and lots of efforts to build a function for input manipulations, as the STRUCTURE itself needs two parameter files (mainparams and extraparams) along with the genotype input data. Both STRUCTURE (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.stanford.edu/group/pritchardlab/structure_software/release_versions/v2.3.4/structure_doc.pdf">https://web.stanford.edu/group/pritchardlab/structure_software/release_versions/v2.3.4/structure_doc.pdf</ext-link>) and NEWHYBRIDS (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/eriqande/newhybrids/blob/master/new_hybs_doc1_1Beta3.pdf">https://github.com/eriqande/newhybrids/blob/master/new_hybs_doc1_1Beta3.pdf</ext-link>) did excellent jobs in documenting the input parameters. Besides, some existing programs such as widgetcon (Aydın et al., 2019), and PGDSpider (Lischer and Excoffier, 2012) have been well developed to prepare the input data. Therefore, we feel our way of presenting the front end is the most clear for readers in parallel computing, and in the future we will design such functions as suggested by the reviewer. </p>
    <p>We agree that it would be helpful to develop a window for results interpretation and plotting. However, we found that some existing programs such as CLUMPAK (Kopelman et al., 2015), POPHELPER (Francis, 2017), StructureSelector (Li and Liu, 2017), and KFinder (Wang, 2019) have been widely adopted for output plotting and interpretation. We will consider reviewer’s advice and add this function in our next release.</p>
    <p>Line 55-57: Its redundant.</p>
    <p>We have rephased this sentence to make it simple and clean.</p>
    <p>Line 70: “ … Monte Carlo (MCMC) to resampling …“</p>
    <p>Corrected</p>
    <p>Line 71: I had the impression that the authors are using the word “burnin” as the same idea as total “iterations”. Normally, only the first portion of interactions are called by burnin, where the interaction process exercised the priors. This testing will force failures under supervised conditions and then established the interactions. Could you review this sentence to follow the cited paper Porras-Hurtado et al (2013): “STRUCTURE uses a systematic Bayesian clustering approach applying Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) estimation. The MCMC process begins by randomly assigning individuals to a pre-determined number of groups, then variant frequencies are estimated in each group and individuals re-assigned based on those frequency estimates. This is repeated many times, typically comprising 100,000 iterations, in the burnin process that results in a progressive convergence toward reliable allele frequency estimates in each population and membership probabilities of individuals to a population.Measurement of the assumed number of populations uses the MCMC estimation and is performed separately from the burnin.”.</p>
    <p>We have rephased the sentence as “Because STRUCTURE requires to minimize the effect of the starting configuration, many iterations are needed during the burnin process.</p>
    <p>Line 91-92: This is not one of your objectives. In my opinion EasyParallel is doing only the parallelization process and the other software (STRUCTURE and NEWHYBRIDS) are “assisting the user in assessing the most biologically likely number of clusters (K) and estimating hybrid class assignment accurately.”</p>
    <p>We agree with it. Our manuscript explicitly explains our platform builds upon STRUCTURE and NEWHYBRIDS. What we tried to explain here is that our platform enables running multiple Ks (K within the predefined range) using one-click, thus facilitating the user in assessing the optimal K without running the program multiple times with different K repeatedly. We have addressed reviewer’s comment by deleting this sentence.</p>
    <p>Line 128: It is not clear if the “Execution Time Analyses” was performed using the GUI version or code line.</p>
    <p>The analyses are based on the GUI version, and we revised the manuscript to clarify the setting from line 97-99.</p>
    <p>Line 133-138: Why the authors chose these specific machines? Why did not you use computers with i3 or 4GB RAM, that regular people with no experience with programing have?</p>
    <p>Thank you for your valuable advice. We were trying to test on as many machines as possible, and test our performance in various settings. However, we decided to focus on forward compatibility instead of backward compatibility. We will try to cover more different settings in our next release.</p>
    <p>Line 143: “MCMC” also is an iteration process as “burnin”, please be consistent.</p>
    <p>Corrected</p>
    <p>Line 162: “always” it is not true for “i7.6700HQ” and “MacPro i5” during the STRUCTURE comparation. Please use terms as “in general” or “majority”.</p>
    <p>We have revised the manuscript accordingly.</p>
    <p>Line 171-173: I did not find these results. Could you add a table as a supplementary file with these RAM results? I believe the execution time is being influenced by the fact of MacOS’s computers have twice RAM than Windows’s.</p>
    <p>We appreciate reviewer’s valuable comment here. However, we made this conclusion only by observing the real-time RAM usage and did not record such data. STRUCTURE and NEWHYBRIDS are not memory demanding algorithms, and the size of RAM is not a bottleneck for parallelization. Same observation has been also reported in Besnier et al. (2013) and Wringe et al. (2017). </p>
    <p>Line 173-177: This comparation should be made with similar machines, same processor (i3, i5, i7, or i9), RAM, physical cores, etc. Also, the comparation of operating systems is not one of your objectives.</p>
    <p>We agree with reviewer that such comparisons should be made using same machinery settings. We have revised the manuscript accordingly. </p>
    <p>Line 195-197: Only in this last sentence is clear that the software doesn’t has the option to run in command code or prompt. Please be more specific and move this part for material and methods.</p>
    <p>We appreciate reviewer’s comment here. We have state this in the material and methods part (line 97-99). We hope it clarifies our intention. </p>
    <p>Figure 1: I confess that I spent a time trying to understand why the EasyParallel logo is a fish. I understand the group works with aquaculture but using a fish as logo is not helping at all to get attention for the software. I really recommend change the logo for some genetic or parallel symbol. In addition, it will be interesting and helpful if the software provides some results visualization as graphics and tables as suggested above.</p>
    <p>We appreciate reviewer’s valuable comment and we do hope the software could be used in a broad community. We followed reviewer’s comment and redesigned the EasyParallel logo to make it easy to remember and reflect the parallelization. Again, we appreciate reviewer’s advice about results visualization. Please see our answer at the start of our response.</p>
    <p>Figure 2: The authors are comparing computers and not software, which it is the main idea. I recommend to exchange the position of software and computer where the lines should be the software (EasyParallel, STRUCTURE and NEWHYBRIDS).</p>
    <p>We agree with reviewer and redrew the Figure 1</p>
    <p>.</p>
    <p>Table 1: Use “-” instead NA.</p>
    <p>Corrected</p>
    <p>The manual is clear and well done. Only one correction in “Step 3” where the mainparams was wrote twice at the link: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://webhome.auburn.edu/~hzz0024/web/doc/">http://webhome.auburn.edu/~hzz0024/web/doc/</ext-link>.</p>
