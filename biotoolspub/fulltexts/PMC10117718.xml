      <title>Abstract</title>
      <p><italic toggle="yes">Enterococcus faecalis</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">Enterococcus faecium</italic> are major nosocomial pathogens. Despite their relevance to public health and their role in the development of bacterial antibiotic resistance, relatively little is known about gene regulation in these species. RNA–protein complexes serve crucial functions in all cellular processes associated with gene expression, including post-transcriptional control mediated by small regulatory RNAs (sRNAs). Here, we present a new resource for the study of enterococcal RNA biology, employing the Grad-seq technique to comprehensively predict complexes formed by RNA and proteins in <italic toggle="yes">E. faecalis</italic> V583 and <italic toggle="yes">E. faecium</italic> AUS0004. Analysis of the generated global RNA and protein sedimentation profiles led to the identification of RNA–protein complexes and putative novel sRNAs. Validating our data sets, we observe well-established cellular RNA–protein complexes such as the 6S RNA–RNA polymerase complex, suggesting that 6S RNA-mediated global control of transcription is conserved in enterococci. Focusing on the largely uncharacterized RNA-binding protein KhpB, we use the RIP-seq technique to predict that KhpB interacts with sRNAs, tRNAs, and untranslated regions of mRNAs, and might be involved in the processing of specific tRNAs. Collectively, these datasets provide departure points for in-depth studies of the cellular interactome of enterococci that should facilitate functional discovery in these and related Gram-positive species. Our data are available to the community through a user-friendly Grad-seq browser that allows interactive searches of the sedimentation profiles (<ext-link xlink:href="https://resources.helmholtz-hiri.de/gradseqef/" ext-link-type="uri">https://resources.helmholtz-hiri.de/gradseqef/</ext-link>).</p>

    <title>Introduction</title>
    <p>Enterococci are ubiquitious Gram-positive members of the gut microbiome. Once considered harmless commensals, they have recently been reassigned as nosocomial pathogens because the two Enterococcus species <italic toggle="yes">Enterococcus faecalis</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">Enterococcus faecium</italic> were found to cause life-threatening infections (Hidron et al. <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>, Kristich et al. <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>, Weiner et al. <xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Enterococci often carry intrinsic or acquired resistance to a wide range of antimicrobial agents, which limits treatment options (Mundy et al. <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>, Hollenbeck and Rice <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>, Kristich et al. <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Importantly, they have also been shown to transmit antibiotic resistance genes to other Gram-positive and even Gram-negative species (Courvalin <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">1994</xref>, Weigel et al. <xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>).</p>
    <p>Despite the clinical relevance of <italic toggle="yes">E. faecalis</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">E. faecium</italic> (Arias and Murray <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>, Kristich et al. <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>, Van Tyne and Gilmore <xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>, Fiore et al. <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>), general gene regulatory mechanisms in these bacteria remain poorly understood (DebRoy et al. <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>, Weaver <xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). Given the central function of RNA–protein complexes in gene regulation, the global categorization of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) and their RNA partners provides an important framework to address this question (Holmqvist and Vogel <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>, Gerovac et al. <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">2021a</xref>). RBPs are also known to be important cofactors during post-transcriptional regulation mediated by small noncoding RNAs (sRNAs). Most sRNAs act to repress target mRNAs at the level of translation or affect stability by short base pairing interactions that also involve an sRNA chaperone, as exemplified by most Hfq- and some ProQ-dependent sRNAs in Gram-negative bacteria (Holmqvist et al. <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>, Quendera et al. <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>, Hör et al. <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">2020c</xref>, Ponath et al. <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">2022</xref>). While the physiological importance of this mode of gene regulation is well-established in Gram-negative bacteria, it is still unclear if a similarly broad mechanism exists in Gram-positive bacteria. Indeed, although sRNAs have been identified in Gram-positive bacterial species, including <italic toggle="yes">E. faecalis</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">E. faecium</italic> (Fouquier d’Hérouel et al. <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>, Shioya et al. <xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>, Innocenti et al. <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>, Sinel et al. <xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>, Michaux et al. <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>), an RBP with a global function comparable to the sRNA chaperones Hfq, ProQ, and CsrA present in Gram-negative bacteria has not yet been discovered. More generally, the discovery of RBPs with gene regulatory functions has been hampered by the absence of experimental global data sets to predict the molecular complexes in which transcripts and proteins of enterococci engage.</p>
    <p>Grad-seq is a recently developed approach to discover RBPs and to determine native RNA–protein and protein–protein complexes (Smirnov et al. <xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). The method is based on the separation of soluble cellular complexes by a classical glycerol gradient, followed by high-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and mass spectrometry (MS) analyses of the individual gradient fractions. Potential RBPs are then predicted by searching for correlations between in-gradient behavior of cellular proteins and transcripts. Thus far, Grad-seq has led to the identification of (i) ProQ as a global sRNA-binding protein in <italic toggle="yes">Salmonella enterica</italic> serovar Typhimurium (Smirnov et al. <xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>), (ii) new components of well-established complexes, such as the broadly conserved protein YggL as a factor associated with the ribosome in <italic toggle="yes">Escherichia coli</italic> (Hör et al. <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">2020a</xref>), (iii) a new mechanism of exonucleolytic sRNA activation in <italic toggle="yes">Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> (Hör et al. <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">2020b</xref>), (iv) the RNA complexome of <italic toggle="yes">Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> under bacteriophage infection (Gerovac et al. <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">2021b</xref>), and (v) a new RBP in <italic toggle="yes">Clostridium difficile</italic> (Lamm-Schmidt et al. <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>). In addition, GradR as a new variant of Grad-seq that includes an RNase treatment step helped to discover a hitherto unrecognized¸ plasmid-encoded FinO-domain RBP in <italic toggle="yes">Salmonella</italic> (Gerovac et al. <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>).</p>
    <p>Here, we applied Grad-seq to chart the landscape of RNA–protein and protein–protein complexes in <italic toggle="yes">E. faecalis</italic> V583 and <italic toggle="yes">E. faecium</italic> AUS0004, two clinical isolates of vancomycin-resistant enterococci that are fully sequenced and widely used as reference strains by the scientific community (Paulsen et al. <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>, Lam et al. <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Our analysis of the sedimentation profiles reveals previously hidden sRNAs and predicts new candidate enterococcal RBPs. One of these is the conserved KH domain protein KhpB, which was recently shown to interact with RNAs in <italic toggle="yes">S. pneumoniae</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">C. difficile</italic> (Zheng et al. <xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>, Hör et al. <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">2020b</xref>, Lamm-Schmidt et al. <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>, Riediger et al. <xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>). KH domains have been found in bacterial RBPs with a wide range of functions, such as the enzymes polynucleotide phosphorylase (PNPase) and RNase Y or the transcription elongation factor NusA (Olejniczak et al. <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>). In the present work, a pilot analysis of cellular RNA ligands of <italic toggle="yes">E. faecalis</italic> KhpB suggests that its RNA interactome is mainly composed of sRNAs, tRNAs, and untranslated regions (UTRs), and that this RBP might have an RNA processing function. Our Grad-seq data sets, available in a user-friendly browser (<ext-link xlink:href="https://resources.helmholtz-hiri.de/gradseqef/" ext-link-type="uri">https://resources.helmholtz-hiri.de/gradseqef/</ext-link>), provide a global resource to better understand transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation in <italic toggle="yes">E. faecalis</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">E. faecium</italic>, the two pathogenic species of the <italic toggle="yes">Enterococcus</italic> family.</p>

      <title>Bacterial growth and culture conditions</title>
      <p>Bacteria, <italic toggle="yes">E. faecalis</italic> V583 and <italic toggle="yes">E. faecium</italic> AUS0004, gift from Jean-Christophe Giard, were grown at 37°C on M17 agar plates (Oxoid) supplemented with 0.5% glucose. Single colonies were inoculated each time liquid cultures were needed. 8.3 ml of M17 medium supplemented with 0.5% glucose were inoculated in a 25 ml glass tube, in order to keep the final proportions of one-third of media and two-thirds oxygen. Cultures were grown overnight at 37°C and back diluted 1:100 into fresh media and grown without agitation to late logarithmic/early stationary phase at an OD<sub>600</sub> of 2.0. For the glycerol gradient sample preparation, 200 OD<sub>600</sub> of bacterial culture was used for each strain. 1 ml of the overnight culture was diluted in 100 ml of GM17 and grown to OD<sub>600</sub> of 2.</p>
      <p>Once the desired OD was reached, the cultures were decanted into prechilled 50 ml falcons and incubated on ice for 15 min with rotation of the tubes every 3–5 min to ensure fast and uniform cooling. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4000 <italic toggle="yes">g</italic> at 4°C for 20 min in 50 ml falcon tubes. Pellets were pooled in order to have one tube per strain. Three washes with 25 ml of ice-cold 1x TBS were applied and the pellets were resuspended in a final 1 ml 1x TBS, transferred into a 2 ml tube and centrifuged at 13,000rpm, 4°C, during 2 min. After removing all the TBS, pellets were resuspended in 500 µl of lysis buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM PMSF, 0.2% Triton X 100, 20 U/ml DNase I, 200 U/ml RNase-inhibitor). An equal volume of 0.1 mm glass beads was added, and cells were vortexed for 30 s followed by 15 s cooling on ice. This lysis step was repeated 10 times.</p>
      <p>The lysate was then cleared by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm, 4°C during 10 min. Without disturbing the pellet, all supernatant was collected. A couple of aliquots were saved (Protein: 20 µl lysate + 20 µl of 5x Laemmli buffer; RNA: 10 µl lysate + 1 ml Trizol in 2 ml SafeSeal tube) for subsequent analysis of proteins and RNAs. A volume of 200 µl of the very top part of the gradient was removed and 200 µl of the cleared lysate was gently placed. The gradient used here was a linear 10%–40% (w/v) glycerol gradient. To prepare the gradient, two solutions were made. The 10% (w/v) glycerol solution (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM PMSF, 0.2% Triton X 100, 10% (w/v) glycerol) and the 40% (w/v) glycerol solution (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM PMSF, 0.2% Triton X 100, 40% (w/v) glycerol). Clean ultracentrifugation tubes were divided into two. The first half of the tube was filled up with the 10% solution and using a 70-mm injection needle and a syringe, the 40% solution was then placed underneath the 10% solution until the interphase reached the middle of the tube. The loaded gradients were centrifuged at 100,000 <italic toggle="yes">g</italic> (23,700 rpm) for 17 h at 4°C in a precooled ultracentrifuge. The gradients were then manually fractionated into 590 µl fractions. Following this method, 20 fractions and the pellet were collected for each gradient (separately for <italic toggle="yes">E. faecalis</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">E. faecium</italic>).</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec4-2">
      <title>Protein/MS sample preparation</title>
      <p>From each fraction, 90 µl was mixing with 30 µl of 5x Laemmli loading buffer. The fractions were analyzed in 12% SDS-Page standard gel followed by Coomassie staining (20 µl for the fractions, 3 µl for the lysate and 10 µl for the pellet). KhpB was detected by the αKhpB antibody (2, SY0917 (MA11010) SABC-serum) (rabbit, 1:10,000) and a secondary anti-rabbit-HRP (goat) conjugate antibody ( 1:10,000, Sigma-Aldrich, #31460). The rest of the samples was prepared for mass spectrometric analysis as previously described (Hör et al. <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">2020b</xref>). Briefly, samples were homogenized using ultrasound. Debris were later removed by centrifugation and 20 µl of the cleared protein sample were spiked-in with 10 µl of UPS2 spike-in (Sigma-Aldrich) diluted in 250 µl of 1.25x protein loading buffer. The samples were then reduced in 50 mM DTT, 10 min at 70°C and alkylated with 120 mM iodoacetamide for 20 min at room temperature in the dark. The proteins were precipitated using four times their volume of acetone overnight at −20°C, and later on washed with acetone and dissolved in 50 µl of 8 M urea, 100 mM ammonium bicarbonate. Protein digestion into peptides was performed using Lys-C (Wako) for 2 h at 30°C following by overnight digestion by trypsin. Peptides were eluted with 60% acetonitrile/0.3% formic acid and stored at −20°C until LC-MS7MS analysis.</p>

    <sec id="sec4-3">
      <title>RNA/RNA-seq sample preparation</title>
      <p>From each collected fraction (minus the 90 µl taken for protein preparation), 50 µl of 10% SDS was added (or 25 µl for the pellet as the volume was expectedly lower in the sample). After shaking by hand vigorously for about 20 s, 600 µl of acidic P:C:I was added to each fraction (300 µl for the pellet). 400 µl of chloroform was added also to the Trizol-dissolved lysate and shaken by hand for about 10 s. All the samples were then vortexed for 30 s and let rest for 5 min at room temperature. The samples were centrifuged at 13,000 rpm at 4°C for 15 min. The aqueous phases were collected in 2 ml tubes and 1 µl of Glycoblue, together with 1.4 ml ice-cold 30:1 EtOH:3 M NaOAc pH 6.5 were added. Tubes were put at −80°C for 40 min in order to let the RNA precipitate. The samples were then centrifuged at 13,000rpm, 4°C for 30 min, pellets were washed with 350 µl of ice-cold 70% EtOH and centrifuged again for 10 min at 13,000 rpm, at 4°C. After air-drying the pellets, 40 µl nuclease-free water was added. DNase treatment was performed. For one entire gradient, a master mix was prepared: 115 µl of DNase I buffer with MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 11.5 µl RNase-inhibitor, 92 µl DNase I, and 11.5 µl nuclease-free water. RNA were denaturated at 65°C for 5 min prior to treatment. A volume of 10 µl of the master mix was added to each 40 µl sample, and the now-treated samples were incubated at 37°C for 45 min. A volume of 150 µl of nuclease-free water was then added along with 200 µl of acidic P:C:I. After 5 min of incubation at room temperature, samples were centrifuged at 13,000rpm at 4°C for 15 min, the aqueous phase was placed in the precipitation mix (600 µl ice-cold 30:1 EtOH:3 M NaOAc pH 6.5 with 1 µl of Glycoblue), 40 min at −80°C, centrifuged at 13,000rpm 4°C for 30 min, washed with 350 µl 70% EtOH, and centrifuged at 13,000rpm 4°C for 10 min. The pellets were air-dried and dissolved in 35 µl nuclease-free water. 10 µl of each sample was mixed with 10 µl of GLII RNA loading buffer.</p>
      <p>For quality control of the RNA, a thick 6% PAA gel with 7 M urea was cast with a 25-well comb in order to load the 20 fractions but also the lysate and the pellet. 6 µl of each sample was loaded and run at 300 V for about 1h40. The gel was then stained using Ethidium bromide. The same procedure was followed for northern blot preparation. After the run, RNA was transferred onto a Hybond-XL membrane and hybridized overnight at 42°C with γ<sup>32</sup>P-ATP end-labeled oligodeoxynucleotide probes (listed in <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S3</xref>, <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supporting Information</xref>). Signals were visualized on a Typhoon FLA 7000 Phosphoimager and quantified with ImageJ (EMBL software publicly available).</p>
      <p>For RNA‐seq, 5 µl of the gradient samples was diluted in 45 µl nuclease-free water. A volume of 10 µl of this dilution was mixed with 10 µl of a 1:100 dilution of the ERCC spike‐in mix 2 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and subjected to library preparation for next‐generation sequencing (Vertis Biotechnologie) following the protocol that has been previously described (Hör et al. <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">2020b</xref>).</p>

      <p>Both analyses were conducted as previously described (Gerovac et al. <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">2021b</xref>). For RNA-sequencing analysis, we used the NCBI reference sequences NC_004668.1, NC_004669.1, NC_004670.1, and NC_004671.1 for <italic toggle="yes">E. faecalis</italic> and NC_017022.1, NC_017023.1, NC_017024.1, and NC_017032.1 for <italic toggle="yes">E. faecium</italic>. Annotation files were used from NCBI. ERCC spike-in reference sequences were also included. RNA-sequencing analysis including read mapping, generation of coverage files, gene quantification, and differential gene expression/level analysis (deseq2) were conducted in READemption 0.4.5 (Förstner et al. <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). The relative position of an annotated CDS or UTR was determined by the sum of the read fraction per gradient multiplied with the gradient fraction number (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 21), as described previously (Gerovac et al. <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). Relative positions between CDS and UTRs were correlated and differences of 5 in relative positions indicated independent behavior in gradients.</p>
      <p>For protein searches by MS, we used the UniProt proteome UP000001415 for <italic toggle="yes">E. faecalis</italic> and UP000007591 for <italic toggle="yes">E. faecium</italic>.</p>

The lysate was cleared at 15,000 <italic toggle="yes">g</italic> for 15 min at 4°C. Supernatant was loaded onto an Ni-NTA column (5 ml, HisTrap HP, Cytiva) and washed with 5 column volumes. Protein was eluted with 200 mM imidazole and desalted (PD10 column, GE) in 3C-cleavage buffer (50 mM Tris/HCl pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, 1 mM TCEP). Cleavage of the tag was performed in 2–3 ml with 20 µl 3C protease (1 mg/ml, Sigma-Aldrich, SAE0045) added and incubated over-night at 4°C. The sample was loaded again on an Ni-NTA column for reverse-IMAC and the cleaved product collected in the flow through. Unfortunately, KhpB remained bound to the column, and required to be washed, and eluted again. The sample was diluted with 10 volumes anion exchange buffer A (20 mM HEPES pH6.0, 50 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, 4 mM 2ME) and loaded onto an anion exchange column (5 ml, HiTrap Q HP, Cytiva). Protein was eluted in a gradient up to 1 M NaCl. KhpB eluted as a second peak ∼0.5 M NaCl. The peak was pooled and concentrated by centrifugal filtration (Amicon Ultra-4, 10 kDa cut-off, Merck) rebuffered in storage buffer (20 mM HEPES/KOH pH 7.5, 150 mM KCl, 1 mM TCEP) and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. The concentration of KhpB was estimated by absorption measurement at 280 nm using the extinction coefficient of 10,430/mM/cm.

      <title>Grad-seq recapitulates known RNA–protein complexes in <italic toggle="yes">E. faecalis</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">E. faecium</italic></title>
      <p>To establish an atlas of cellular protein–protein and protein–RNA complexes in <italic toggle="yes">E. faecalis</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">E. faecium</italic>, we performed Grad-seq (see Fig. <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1A</xref> for general workflow) on bacterial lysates obtained at late exponential phase (OD<sub>600</sub> = 2) in M17 rich media. We chose this growth phase based on a previous study (Michaux et al. <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>) in which we had mapped transcription start sites (TSSs) in <italic toggle="yes">E. faecalis</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">E. faecium</italic>, and which showed that the vast majority of genes are expressed in this condition. Whole-cell lysates were analyzed in a glycerol gradient by ultracentrifugation and subsequently fractionated in 20 fractions plus the pellet. The absorbance of each fraction at 260 nm revealed a characteristic global profile [Fig. <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1B</xref> for <italic toggle="yes">E. faecalis</italic>; <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S1A</xref> (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supporting Information</xref>) for <italic toggle="yes">E. faecium</italic>]. Specifically, the bulk peak at the top of the gradient represents low-molecular weight (LMW) fractions in which free proteins and small complexes accumulate. In the high-molecular weight (HMW) fractions, two characteristic peaks around fractions 10 and 15 are observed, which correspond to the small (30S) and large (50S) ribosomal subunits, respectively; this pattern is very similar to the ribosome peaks observed in the closely related Gram-positive species, <italic toggle="yes">S. pneumoniae</italic> (Hör et al. <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">2020b</xref>).</p>

      <p>Total protein and RNA were extracted for each fraction and analyzed by SDS-PAGE or Urea-PAGE to visualize abundant proteins (Fig. <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1C</xref>; <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S1B</xref>, <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supporting Information</xref>) and transcripts (Fig. <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1D</xref>; <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S1C</xref>, <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supporting Information</xref>), respectively. Judging by abundance and size, we observed ribosomal proteins in the HMW fractions, as expected from the absorbance profiles (Fig. <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1B</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">C</xref>). Nonetheless, the most abundant proteins in both species were present in the LMW fractions, such as elongation factors EF-Tu (43 kDa) and EF-G (76 kDa) in fractions 2–5, the glycerol kinase GlpK (55 kDa) in fractions 1–4, or the complex of the chaperone GroEL (60 kDa) in fractions 7–13 (Fig. <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1C</xref>; <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S1B</xref>, <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supporting Information</xref>). Subunits of the RNA polymerase (RNAP) sedimented in fractions 4–8 (Fig. <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1C</xref>; <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S1B</xref>, <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supporting Information</xref>). Regarding transcripts (Fig. <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1D</xref>; <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S1C</xref>, <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supporting Information</xref>), highly abundant tRNAs sedimented in LMW fractions 1–4, whereas the 16S and 23S/5S ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs) occurred in the ribosomal fractions, as expected.</p>
      <p>For additional quality evaluation, we performed independent Northern blot analysis of some well-characterized stable transcripts, such as 6S RNA, 4.5S RNA (<italic toggle="yes">ffs</italic> gene), tmRNA, M1 RNA (<italic toggle="yes">rnpB</italic>), or sRNA_0869, an sRNA previously identified in <italic toggle="yes">E. faecalis</italic> (Fouquier d’Hérouel et al. <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>, Shioya et al. <xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>) (Fig. <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1E</xref>; <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S1D</xref>, <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supporting Information</xref>). Where comparable, these sedimentation profiles resemble reported profiles in <italic toggle="yes">E. coli, Salmonella, S. pneumoniae, P. aeruginosa</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">C. difficile</italic> (Gerovac et al. <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">2021b</xref>, Hör et al. <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">2020a</xref>,<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">b</xref>, Lamm-Schmidt et al. <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>, Smirnov et al. <xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). For example, tmRNA, which forms a ribonucleoprotein complex with the protein SmpB that rescues stalled ribosomes (Huter et al. <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>) sedimented in fractions 3–8, as expected by a predicted complex size of 32 kDa (Fig. <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1E</xref>; <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S1D</xref>, <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supporting Information</xref>). We observed 6S RNA in fractions 5–9, corresponding to the distribution of the protein subunits of RNAP (Fig. <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1E</xref>; <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S1D</xref>, <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supporting Information</xref>); this suggests that enterococci use a 6S RNA-dependent mechanism for global control of transcription, as reported in several other species (Wassarman <xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). M1 RNA, the catalytic RNA subunit of RNaseP (Frank and Pace <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>), appeared in fractions 3–7, as previously seen in <italic toggle="yes">Streptococcus</italic> (Hör et al. <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">2020b</xref>) (Fig. <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1E</xref>; <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S1D</xref>, <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supporting Information</xref>).</p>
      <p>The fractionated gradient was subjected to high-throughput RNA sequencing and MS in order to compile sedimentation profiles for proteins and RNAs and enable global predictions of macromolecular complexes. Protein and RNA abundance was normalized via an external spike-in (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Tables S1 and S2</xref>, <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supporting Information</xref>). To benchmark the quality of the global dataset, high-throughput sedimentation profiles of well-established complexes were evaluated for cosedimentation (Fig. <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). For example, the RNA profiles of 6S, 4.5S RNA, and rRNAs showed correlation with the profiles of proteins with which they are known to form complexes with—the RNAP subunits, the Ffh protein, and the ribosomal proteins, respectively (Fig. <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2A</xref>; <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S2A</xref>, <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supporting Information</xref>). Altogether, the high correlation between the profiles of proteins and RNAs known to form complexes encouraged us to further analyze the data in a high-throughput fashion.</p>

      <p>For cellular RNA species, we used our recent dRNA-seq based single-nucleotide transcriptome annotation in <italic toggle="yes">E. faecalis</italic> (Michaux et al. <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>), and recovered in-gradient distributions of 3246 mRNAs, 67 tRNAs, 151 sRNAs, 291 3'UTRs, and 1456 5'UTRs (Fig. <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2C</xref>). For <italic toggle="yes">E. faecium</italic>, 3049 mRNAs, 47 tRNAs, 129 sRNAs, 342 3'UTRs, and 1470 5'UTRs were detected (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S2C</xref>, <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supporting Information</xref>). The fact that we detected more mRNAs than the total number of annotated proteins in both species can be explained by the incomplete annotation of <italic toggle="yes">E. faecalis</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">E. faecium</italic> proteins; currently, not every coding sequence (CDS) is present in the Uniprot database.

      <title>RNA sedimentation profiles reveal new UTR-derived sRNA candidates</title>
      <p>Global clustering of RNA sedimentation profiles allows the identification of groups of mRNAs or sRNAs that might be part of distinct RNA–protein complexes. While in both species some mRNAs (here designated as CDS) were found in fractions 4–6 (Fig. <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2D</xref>; <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S2D</xref>, <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supporting Information</xref>), many others peaked in the RNAP fractions, in the ribosomal fractions or were found in the pellet, indicating association with the transcription or translation machineries (Fig. <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2D</xref>; <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S2D</xref>, <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supporting Information</xref>). Interestingly, we observed a more pronounced sedimentation of mRNAs in HMW fractions in <italic toggle="yes">E. faecium</italic> (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S2D</xref>, <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supporting Information</xref>) than we did in <italic toggle="yes">E. faecalis</italic> (Fig. <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2D</xref>). This suggests that in the late exponential growth phase, <italic toggle="yes">E. faecium</italic> has a more active protein synthesis compared to <italic toggle="yes">E. faecalis</italic>.</p>
      <p>Focusing on sRNAs, we detected a cluster in LMW fractions, which we predict to correspond to largely protein-free sRNAs (Fig. <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2D</xref>; <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S2D</xref>, <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supporting Information</xref>). A second cluster, more visible in <italic toggle="yes">E. faecium</italic> than <italic toggle="yes">E. faecalis</italic>, is present in fractions 9–12; i.e. these sRNAs occur in the 30S ribosomal fractions. There are two tempting possible explanations for this sedimentation profile: firstly, these sRNAs might be associated with translated mRNAs as part of their regulatory activity; alternatively, these sRNAs themselves might be translated, because they contain small open-reading frames (ORFs), perhaps with noncanonical start codons that have been overlooked so far. The latter phenomenon has recently been established in <italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic> through Grad-seq analysis. RyeG, presumed to be a noncoding sRNA, was found to peak in the 30S fractions of the gradient and was shown to contain a previously unnoticed ORF of 48 amino acids (aa) starting with a GUG start codon (Hör et al. <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">2020a</xref>, Weaver et al. <xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). To address this possibility in <italic toggle="yes">E. faecalis</italic>, we performed sequence alignments for 9 sRNAs (sRNA002; sRNA027; sRNA040; sRNA050; sRNA053; sRNA058; sRNA061; sRNA103, and sRNA120) that are present in the 30S fraction (Fig. <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2D</xref>). In total, six of these sRNAs contain a potential Shine–Dalgarno (SD) sequence, followed by a start codon and, for four of them, a stop codon, revealing possible small ORFs for sRNA002 (15 aa), sRNA040 (14 aa), sRNA058 (20 aa), and sRNA103 (19 aa) (Fig. <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2E</xref>).</p>
      <p>For in-gradient distributions of individual mRNAs, we observed instances of strikingly different sedimentation profiles of annotated CDS compared to their respective UTRs (Fig. <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3A</xref>; <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S2E</xref> and <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S4</xref>, <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supporting Information</xref>). Typically, all regions of an mRNA would be expected to sediment in the same fraction, and this anomaly might therefore indicate the presence of potential 5' or 3'UTR-derived sRNAs (Adams and Storz <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>, Ponath et al. <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">2022</xref>). Searching for such noncanonical in-gradient distributions, we identified 18 and 37 UTR-derived candidate sRNAs for <italic toggle="yes">E. faecalis</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">E. faecium</italic>, respectively (based on the absolute value differences of at least five units between the relative position of the CDS and UTR (see “Methods” for details; <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S4</xref>, <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supporting Information</xref>). As an example, the hypothetical gene <italic toggle="yes">EF_3018</italic> is shown in Fig. <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3B</xref>. Its 5'UTR does not cofractionate with its CDS, indicative of a possible 5'UTR derived sRNA. Additional examples include the 5'UTRs of the polysaccharide lyase <italic toggle="yes">EF_3023</italic> and the small metabolite transporter <italic toggle="yes">EF_0359</italic>. These instances highlight the power of Grad-seq for extended sRNA annotation.</p>

      <title>Grad-seq identifies new and established protein complexes</title>
      <p>Our sedimentation profiles constitute a resource for the identification of molecules that may associate in stable cellular complexes. The strongest indicator of complex formation is the presence of proteins in HMW fractions. Prominent examples include some tRNA synthetases, chaperones such as GroEL, transcription termination factors such as Rho and the subunits of RNAP, as well as numerous metabolic enzymes (Fig. <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4A</xref>); these proteins often peak in fractions &gt;2 with molecular sizes larger than their free form (&gt;200 kDa). To obtain a high-level view of the sedimentation profiles of cellular proteins, we applied principal-component analysis (PCA) to cosegregate the sedimentation profiles by position and complexity in two components (Fig. <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4B</xref> for <italic toggle="yes">E. faecalis</italic>, Fig. <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4C</xref> for <italic toggle="yes">E. faecium</italic>; maximal peak fraction &gt;8 with the principal-component coordinates given in <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S1</xref>, <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supporting Information</xref>). As a result, the sedimentation profile complexity is reduced from 21 fractions to two components (Fig. <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4B</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">C</xref>). A number of well-characterized complexes aggregate, in accordance with their sedimentation profiles. For instance, in <italic toggle="yes">E. faecalis</italic>, three proteins of the pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) complex—PdhA, PdhB, and AceF—cluster together, and so did many ribosomal proteins (Fig. <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4C</xref>).</p>

      <p>This approach is especially valuable for the initial identification of protein complexes in less-studied bacterial species. For example, the protein annotation in <italic toggle="yes">E. faecium</italic> lacks many RNAP-associated sigma factors that are described in <italic toggle="yes">E. faecalis</italic>. To identify factors that might form a complex with <italic toggle="yes">E. faecium</italic> RNAP, we zoomed into the PCA plot to explore which of the factors that share similar sedimentation profiles with RNAP might be potential candidates for RNAP interactors (Fig. <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4C</xref>). As a positive control, we detected EFAU004_02078, which resembles the <italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic> sigma factor RpoN and is so far the only <italic toggle="yes">E. faecalis</italic> protein annotated in UniProt as a sigma factor. In addition, the hypothetical proteins EFAU004_01745 and EFAU004_02048, and the ABC-transporter EFAU004_02010 shared nearly identical sedimentation profiles with RNAP subunits and lend themselve for further investigation as novel sigma or transcription factors (Fig. <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4D</xref>). In summary, evaluation of factors that have a highly correlated sedimentation profile with known protein complexes constitutes a first step to predict function for an unknown protein and establish its involvement in a stable complex. For interactive selection and visualization of proteins of interest in the PCA plot, we include a workflow (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Material S1</xref>) for the upload and use of <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S1</xref> (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supporting Information</xref>) in the data mining tool Orange (<ext-link xlink:href="https://orangedatamining.com/" ext-link-type="uri">https://orangedatamining.com/</ext-link>) (Demšar et al. <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>).</p>

      <title>The emerging RBP KhpB is conserved in enterococci</title>
      <p>RBPs usually accumulate in the first fractions of the gradient (Gerovac et al. <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>) and can be difficult to discriminate between by PCA due to their small molecular weight and their transient interactions with RNAs. Importantly, previous Grad-seq analysis in Gram-negative bacteria often observed tailing toward the central gradient fractions for established global RBPs such as Hfq and ProQ (Hör et al. <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">2020a</xref>, Smirnov et al. <xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>); when the samples were pretreated with RNase, these RBPs would shift toward LMW fractions (Gerovac et al. <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). Of note, <italic toggle="yes">E. faecalis</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">E. faecium</italic> lack CsrA, Hfq, and ProQ, the three major global RBPs associated with sRNA-mediated gene regulation in Gram-negative bacteria (Christopoulou and Granneman <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>). Although other RBPs have been reported in Gram-positive bacteria, e.g. diverse members of the cold shock protein (Csp) family, the ppGpp synthetase RelQ or the ribosomal protein S1, there is currently no evidence for a global sRNA-binding protein in <italic toggle="yes">E. faecalis</italic> or <italic toggle="yes">E. faecium</italic> (Christopoulou and Granneman <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>). Thus, we examined a number of annotated RBPs in these two organisms (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S3</xref>, <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supporting Information</xref>). Interestingly, they all showed tailing toward RNAP and ribosomal fractions, which could be indicative of stable interactions with other cellular partners. Interestingly, we also observed that the putative RBPs KhpA and KhpB (Olejniczak et al. <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>) showed strong tailing toward the RNAP and 30S fractions (Fig. <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5A</xref>). Moreover, their profiles correlate with sRNA clusters (Fig. <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2D</xref>), making them appealing candidates for further characterization.</p>

      <p>KhpA and KhpB behaved similarly in <italic toggle="yes">E. faecalis</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">E. faecium</italic>, with both proteins showing up primarily in the LMW and tailing toward HMW fractions, indicating that they may exist in a free form as well as in a complex, presumably with cellular transcripts (Fig. <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5A</xref>). However, <italic toggle="yes">E. faecium</italic> KhpA and KhpB showed broader distribution than did their counterparts in <italic toggle="yes">E. faecalis</italic>, which had a similar sedimentation profile to <italic toggle="yes">S. pneumoniae</italic> KhpA and KhpB (Hör et al. <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">2020b</xref>) (Fig. <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5A</xref>). By contrast, <italic toggle="yes">E. faecium</italic> KhpA and KhpB appeared more similar to Grad-seq profiles obtained for <italic toggle="yes">C. difficile</italic> KhpA and KhpB (Lamm-Schmidt et al. <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>). All these profiles, despite their distinctions, are compatible with the expectation that KhpA and KhpB form RNA–protein complexes.</p>
      <p>Comparative analysis of <italic toggle="yes">khpB</italic> genes across Gram-positive bacteria (<italic toggle="yes">C. difficile, S. pneumoniae</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">B. subtilis</italic>) suggested a potential conservation of protein function (Fig. <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5B</xref>). The <italic toggle="yes">khpB</italic> gene lies in close proximity to <italic toggle="yes">yidC</italic> (called <italic toggle="yes">spoIIIJ</italic> in <italic toggle="yes">B. subtilis</italic>), which encodes a protein translocase; <italic toggle="yes">rnpA</italic>, which encodes the RNA component of RNase P; and <italic toggle="yes">mnmE</italic>, which encodes a tRNA modifying GTPase. One characteristic feature of KhpB proteins is their shared domain architecture showing conserved Jag-N, KH and R3H RNA-binding domains (Olejniczak et al. <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>) (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S4A</xref>, <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supporting Information</xref>). KhpA proteins, on the other hand, only carry the conserved KH domain. A phylogenetic analysis based on sequence similarity resulted in distinct leaves for KhpA and KhpB, consistent with their overall differences in terms of size and domains (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S4B</xref>, <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supporting Information</xref>). It has been noted before that the linker region between the N-terminal Jag-N and KH-R3H domains is usually unstructured and varies in length between species (Olejniczak et al. <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>) (Fig. <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5C</xref>). Notably, in enterococci and <italic toggle="yes">S. pneumoniae</italic> this linker region harbors a coiled-coil domain that could potentially play a structural role in diversifying the RNA targetome compared to <italic toggle="yes">Clostridium</italic>.</p>

      <title>A glimpse at the potential cellular RNA targets of KhpB</title>
      <p>Based on the interesting sedimentation profile (Fig. <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5A</xref>) and genetic locus (Fig. <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5B</xref>), the high sequence conservation (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figures S4B and C</xref>, <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supporting Information</xref>) and unique linker region (Fig. <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5C</xref>) of KhpB, we sought to obtain a preliminary view of the cellular interactome of this putative RBP. Of the two species in question, we selected <italic toggle="yes">E. faecalis</italic> for further analysis. In order to generate KhpB-specific antisera, we produced the KhpB protein with a C-terminal 3C-cleavage site and a His-tag by heterologous expression in <italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic>. This recombinant KhpB protein was purified via immobilized nickel affinity chromatography, tag cleavage, and anion exchange chromatography (Fig. <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6A</xref>; <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figures S4C and D</xref>, <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supporting Information</xref>) and was used to raise two polyclonal antisera in rabbit that specifically detected KhpB by western blot (Fig. <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6B</xref>). Of note, raising a KhpB-specific antibody for immunoprecipitaion circumvents exogenous expression of an epitope-tagged KhpB protein construct, as previously done for <italic toggle="yes">S. pneumoniae</italic> or <italic toggle="yes">C. difficile</italic> (Lamm-Schmidt et al. <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>, Zheng et al. <xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>), and allows the capture of native KhpB at physiological concentration.</p>

A western blot analysis confirmed the predicted enrichment in LMW fractions 2–6 and a faint signal in HMW fractions 9–11. Next, we performed RNA immunoprecipitation followed by RNA-seq (RIP-seq) using <italic toggle="yes">E. faecalis</italic> cellular lysates obtained at late exponential phase (OD<sub>600</sub> = 2). The experiment was performed twice using one of the two independent α-KhpB antisera per IP.

With the threshold that we applied (log<sub>2</sub> fold-change &gt;2), determined by deseq2; <italic toggle="yes">P</italic>-value &lt; 0.05 (Wald test)), we recovered cDNA reads for 54 RNAs, showing a nearly even distribution across coding, noncoding, and UTRs.

      <p>The limited target suite observed here is in stark contrast to RIP-seq results for KhpB in <italic toggle="yes">C. difficile</italic>, where the IP enriched thousands of different transcripts, including many sRNAs (Lamm-Schmidt et al. <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>). Seeking to validate our RIP-seq data, we probed Northern blots of the KhpB immunoprecipitates for tRNA<sup>Ile</sup> and tRNA<sup>Ser</sup> and included tRNA<sup>Met</sup> as a negative control that was not recovered in RIP-seq. tRNA<sup>Met</sup> was detected in precipitates using both the control and αKhpB immune serum, indicating a nonspecific interaction. tRNA<sup>Ile</sup>, however, was only detected upon precipitation with the α-KhpB immune serum (Fig. <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>). Although the signals in the eluate fractions were generally weak, we did detect bands that correspond to the mature tRNA and to tRNA precursors using probes binding either the 5'UTR of tRNA<sup>Ile</sup> or within tRNA<sup>Ile</sup>. Similar results were obtained for tRNA<sup>Ser</sup>. Importantly, the read coverage of the tRNA transcripts recovered by RIP-seq extended past the mature 5'end into regions that are known to be processed by RNase P (Klemm et al. <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>), hinting at a potential role of KhpB in tRNA processing. Intriguingly, this would be in line with the genomic location of the <italic toggle="yes">khpB</italic> gene proximal to the genes of the RNase P protein component (<italic toggle="yes">rnpA</italic>) and a tRNA modifying GTPase (<italic toggle="yes">mnmE</italic>) (Fig. <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5B</xref>).</p>
      <p>Our RIP-seq data also predicted KhpB to interact with sRNAs and UTRs (Fig. <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). To validate the interaction between KhpB and the three most enriched sRNAs, northern blots were probed for sRNA070; sRNA010, a putative lysin riboswitch-derived sRNA; and sRNA156, which shares sequence homology with the RNA of a type I toxin–antitoxin module (Fig. <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">9A–C</xref>). For all three, a signal was detected in the RNA extracted after elution with the α-KhpB antisera whereas no signal was detected in the control elution. Interestingly, sRNA156 was the only full-sized sRNA detected; the bands observed for sRNA070 and sRNA010 were shorter compared to the respective sRNA annotation (Michaux et al. <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>) and the signals in the supernatant and flow-through. This observation is another hint at a possible role of KhpB in RNA processing, as is their in-gradient distribution according to the high-throughput Grad-seq data (Fig. <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">9D</xref>). Similarly to KhpB, these sRNAs all occur primarily in fractions 1–5.</p>

Based on this protein interactome list, we reinspected the Grad-seq sedimentation profiles of the KhpB interactors (Fig. <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">9E</xref>). KhpB coprecipitated and cosedimented with KhpA, indicating that KhpA and KhpB form a complex, as suggested previously in <italic toggle="yes">S. pneumoniae</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">C. difficile</italic> (Lamm-Schmidt et al. <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>, Zheng et al. <xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>).

    <title>Discussion</title>
    <p>Grad-seq is a powerful method to study native RNA–protein complexes. Here, we have used this approach to provide a global resource for the identification of stable RNA and protein complexes in the human pathogens <italic toggle="yes">E. faecalis</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">E. faecium</italic>.</p>
    <p>Several sRNAs of <italic toggle="yes">E. faecalis</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">E. faecium</italic> have previously been implicated in stress responses and virulence phenotypes (Fouquier d'Hérouel et al. <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>, Innocenti et al. <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>, Michaux et al. <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>, Shioya et al. <xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>, Sinel et al. <xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>), suggesting their importance in post-transcriptional gene regulation in these two bacterial species. Recently, we systematically annotated sRNAs in <italic toggle="yes">E. faecalis</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">E. faecium</italic> based on dRNA-seq data (Michaux et al. <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>), but this approach works less well for the discovery of UTR-derived and processed sRNAs that lack primary transcript ends. Therefore, UTR-derived sRNAs might have been missed in our previous annotation. Using our Grad-seq dataset, we were able to reassign UTRs that showed atypical sedimentation profiles as noncoding RNAs, leading to the identification of multiple additional enterococcal sRNA candidates that are generated from mRNA 5' or 3'UTRs. We are still at the beginning of understanding to what extent mRNA-derived sRNAs differ in regulatory scope and function from canonical sRNAs. Nevertheless, several such UTR-derived sRNAs have been characterized in other species, often revealing unexpected, conserved functions in diverse cellular processes (Adams and Storz <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>, Ponath et al. <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">2022</xref>). Identification of the cellular targets of the UTR-derived sRNAs that we predict based on our Grad-seq data will be the next step for future studies using methods of the bacterial sRNA tool kit (Hör et al. <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>, Jagodnik et al. <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>).</p>
    <p>Interestingly, while sRNAs are enriched in the LMW fractions, they also show a broader distribution in HMW fractions (Gerovac et al. <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). This implies that they exist both in a free form and in larger complexes, indicating that <italic toggle="yes">Enterococcus</italic> sRNAs, like the sRNAs in other bacterial species, interact with other RNAs or with proteins. Like most Gram-positive bacteria, neither <italic toggle="yes">E. faecalis</italic> nor <italic toggle="yes">E. faecium</italic> encode any of the well-known sRNA chaperones such as Hfq and ProQ. Regarding putative new sRNA-related proteins, our Grad-seq revealed similar sedimentation between KhpA, KhpB, and many sRNAs. In addition, both proteins were previously shown to interact with sRNAs in <italic toggle="yes">S. pneumoniae</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">C. difficile</italic> (Lamm-Schmidt et al. <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>, Zheng et al. <xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). Indeed, our preliminary RIP-seq data predict <italic toggle="yes">E. faecalis</italic> KhpB to interact with tRNAs, sRNAs, and 3'UTRs. While sRNAs are common interaction partners of KhpB in all bacterial species studied so far, <italic toggle="yes">C. difficile</italic> KhpB was not seen to interact with 3'UTRs. This may be because <italic toggle="yes">C. difficile</italic> possesses Hfq and ProQ, both known to bind to the 5' and 3' ends of mRNAs. <italic toggle="yes">Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> does not encode Hfq, and the KhpB interactome featured UTRs, like the <italic toggle="yes">Enterococcus</italic> KhpB interactome. This might imply that in bacterial species that lack Hfq and ProQ, UTRs are targeted by KhpB.</p>
    <p>Our data also suggest that KhpB might have a role in tRNA and sRNA processing, but future work is required to establish such a function. Curiously, both tRNA<sup>Tyr</sup> and tRNA<sup>Pro</sup> were also found to be RNA ligands of KhpB in <italic toggle="yes">S. pneumoniae</italic> (Zheng et al. <xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>), but tRNAs do not interact with KhpB in <italic toggle="yes">C. difficile</italic>, despite the much broader interactome of <italic toggle="yes">C. difficile</italic> KhpB (Lamm-Schmidt et al. <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>). At any rate, our RIP-seq data are encouraging and could in future studies be followed up using more stringent RNA–protein interactome methods, foremost those that include UV cross-linking (Holmqvist et al. <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>, Tree et al. <xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>) to detect transient or weak interactions between an RBP and its RNA targets. One major advantage of these methods is that they enable homing in on the transcript region recognized by the RBP of interest; this extra positional information will be important to validate the putative role of KhpB in guiding RNA processing of noncoding transcripts. Other open questions remain: for instance, we show that KhpB interacts with KhpA, as previously reported (Winther et al. <xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>, Zheng et al. <xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>), but whether both proteins interact with RNA cooperatively will need to be further examined. Whether or not KhpB is in fact involved in sRNA pairing with target mRNAs is still unknown as well. Further analysis will be required to dissect the functional role and mode of action of KhpB in enterococci.</p>
    <p>Overall, we believe that our Grad-seq data provides a powerful resource and ample starting points to identify RNA–protein complexes of <italic toggle="yes">E. faecalis</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">E. faecium</italic>. We are confident that this data will aid in the investigation of post-transcriptional regulation in these opportunistic pathogens, an area of molecular microbiology, that is still in its infancy. Of note, we recently expanded the molecular toolkit for the global identification of RNA–protein interactions by developing SEC-seq, a method that couples size exclusion chromatography with RNA-sequencing and mass-spectrometry (Chihara et al. <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">2022</xref>). It is based on a similar concept as Grad-seq, but shows improved resolution in the LMW range, a size range, that is particularly relevant for the analysis of regulatory RNA–protein complexes in bacteria. Therefore, it would be interesting in the future to build on our Grad-seq data for <italic toggle="yes">E. faecalis</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">E. faecium</italic> by performing SEC-seq on these species.</p>
