      <p>Evolve-and-resequence (E+R) experiments leverage next-generation sequencing technology to track the allele frequency dynamics of populations as they evolve. While previous work has shown that adaptive alleles can be detected by comparing frequency trajectories from many replicate populations, this power comes at the expense of high-coverage (&gt;100x) sequencing of many pooled samples, which can be cost-prohibitive. Here, we show that accurate estimates of allele frequencies can be achieved with very shallow sequencing depths (&lt;5x) via inference of known founder haplotypes in small genomic windows. This technique can be used to efficiently estimate frequencies for any number of bi-allelic SNPs in populations of any model organism founded with sequenced homozygous strains. Using both experimentally-pooled and simulated samples of <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, we show that haplotype inference can improve allele frequency accuracy by orders of magnitude for up to 50 generations of recombination, and is robust to moderate levels of missing data, as well as different selection regimes. Finally, we show that a simple linear model generated from these simulations can predict the accuracy of haplotype-derived allele frequencies in other model organisms and experimental designs. To make these results broadly accessible for use in E+R experiments, we introduce HAF-pipe, an open-source software tool for calculating haplotype-derived allele frequencies from raw sequencing data. Ultimately, by reducing sequencing costs without sacrificing accuracy, our method facilitates E+R designs with higher replication and resolution, and thereby, increased power to detect adaptive alleles.</p>

<body>
  <p>A major barrier to understanding the genetic basis of rapid adaptation has been the lack of robust experimental frameworks for assaying allele frequency dynamics. Recently, evolve and re-sequence (E+R) experiments (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Long <italic>et al.</italic> 2015</xref>), which leverage next-generation sequencing technology to track real-time genome-wide allele frequency changes during evolution, have become a powerful step forward in studying adaptation (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Burke 2012</xref>). In most E+R studies, replicate populations are evolved over tens to hundreds of generations in an artificial or natural selection regime and allele frequency measurements from multiple time-points are used to identify genomic targets of selection. To date, E+R approaches have already been successfully applied in a variety of model systems, including RNA molecules, viruses, <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> and <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Barrick <italic>et al.</italic> 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Burke <italic>et al.</italic> 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Pitt and Ferré-D’Amaré 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Orozco-terWengel <italic>et al.</italic> 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Wichman <italic>et al.</italic> 1999</xref>; <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Chandler 2014</xref>). The ability to concurrently observe both phenotypic and genomic changes across multiple systems offers the potential to answer long-standing questions in molecular evolution. Careful analysis of the patterns and magnitude of allele frequency change may reveal the extent of the genome that is under selection, how interacting alleles contribute to adaptive traits, and the speed of adaptation in different evolutionary regimes.</p>
  <p>Crucially, however, the power to address such questions depends on the replication, time-resolution, and accuracy of allele frequency trajectories, with tradeoffs between these often incurred due to high sequencing costs. Recommended E+R schemes with even minimal power to detect selection involve sampling tens to hundreds of individuals from at least three replicate populations over a minimum of ten generations (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Kofler and Schlötterer 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Schlötterer <italic>et al.</italic> 2016</xref>). Since individual-based, genome-wide DNA sequencing at sufficient coverages is generally cost-prohibitive, most E+R studies rely instead on pooled sequencing (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Burke <italic>et al.</italic> 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Illingworth <italic>et al.</italic> 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Graves <italic>et al.</italic> 2017</xref>; <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Barghi <italic>et al.</italic> 2017</xref>) of all individuals sampled from a given time-point and replicate. While this approach sacrifices information about individual genotypes and linkage, pooled sequencing has been shown to provide a reliable measure of population-level allele frequencies (<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Zhu <italic>et al.</italic> 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Fracassetti <italic>et al.</italic> 2015</xref>). Still, forward-in-time simulations suggest that each pooled sample must be sequenced at a minimum of 50x coverage to detect strong selection (s &gt; 0.1) and even higher coverage to detect weaker selection (s = 0.025) (<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Schlötterer <italic>et al.</italic> 2016</xref>). Given that optimized experimental designs often involve &gt;100 samples, total costs for <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> E+R experiments that achieve reasonable detection power can reach well above $25,000 at current sequencing costs. Thus, achieving sufficient accuracy remains a major limiting factor in capitalizing on the promise of E+R.</p>
  <p>The short timescales for which E+R is most appropriate may, however, facilitate ways to reduce sequencing costs without sacrificing experimental power. First, there is a growing body of evidence that in sexual populations, the bulk of short-term adaptation, especially in fairly small populations, relies on standing genetic variation rather than new mutations (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Graves <italic>et al.</italic> 2017</xref>; <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Burke <italic>et al.</italic> 2014</xref>). Many E+R schemes involve experimental populations derived from a fixed number of inbred founder lines (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Orozco-terWengel <italic>et al.</italic> 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Turner and Miller 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Jha <italic>et al.</italic> 2015</xref>), so the identity, starting frequency, and haplotype structure of all segregating variants are often either already well-known or can easily be obtained by sequencing each founder line. Tracking only the frequencies of these validated variants can still provide enough power to detect selection, while no longer requiring the high depths of sequencing needed to differentiate new mutations from sequencing errors.</p>
  <p>Second, at short timescales haplotype structure can be leveraged to provide more accurate allele frequency estimates. In the time frame of most E+R experiments, recombination does not fully break apart haplotype blocks and disrupt linkage, and thus genomes in an evolving population are each expected to be a mosaic of founder haplotypes. In this scenario, recently developed haplotype inference tools (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Cao and Sun 2015</xref>; <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Q. Long <italic>et al.</italic> 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Pirinen 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Jajamovich <italic>et al.</italic> 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Kessner <italic>et al.</italic> 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Franssen <italic>et al.</italic> 2017</xref>) can integrate information from sequencing reads across multiple nearby sites to efficiently infer the relative frequency of each founder haplotype within small genomic windows. These haplotype frequencies can then be used as weights to calculate pooled allele frequencies for local segregating variants. With this approach, the accuracy of an allele frequency estimate depends less on the number of mapped reads at the individual site, and instead relies on the discriminatory power of all mapped reads in the surrounding genomic window when inferring haplotype frequencies. Haplotype inference methods such as harp (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Kessner <italic>et al.</italic> 2013</xref>) have been shown to accurately predict haplotype frequencies at coverages as low as 25x, and simulations of pool-seq data from a small genomic region at fixed read depths indicate that the use of haplotype frequency information increases the power to detect selection compared to raw allele frequencies alone (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Lynch <italic>et al.</italic> 2014</xref>). However, these tools have not yet been used to infer allele frequencies from real pooled samples in an E+R framework, nor has a thorough analysis been performed to fully examine how the accuracy of haplotype-derived allele frequency estimates scales with empirical pooled coverage, across many parameters relevant for E+R.</p>
  <p>Here, we focus on defining the accuracy of haplotype-derived allele frequencies (HAFs) specifically in the context of E+R experiments, in which populations are generally initiated from tens of founder lines and are evolved for tens of generations. Since haplotype inference will be affected by 1) read depths throughout genomic windows, 2) recombination events, and 3) missing founder genotypes, we begin by leveraging both simulated and experimental data from <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> to assess how the accuracy of HAFs scales with each of these parameters. To do so, we introduce a new metric, ‘effective coverage’, that equates the error from HAF estimates to the expected error from binomial sampling during pooled sequencing at a given read depth. We find that haplotype inference can significantly increase the accuracy of allele frequency estimates over multiple generations of recombination with selection and with varying completeness of founder genotype knowledge. Finally, we extend these simulations to accurately predict effective coverage in other model organisms, such as <italic>C. elegans</italic>. We show as a proof of principle that a simple linear model can predict effective coverage with an R<sup>2</sup> value of 0.875 and only requires four parameters: generations of recombination between population founding and sampling, average recombination rate, percent of unknown founder genotypes, and empirical read depth of the sequenced sample. Additionally, to facilitate the use of haplotype inference in E+R experiments, we introduce a software tool to calculate HAFs, HAF-pipe (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/petrov-lab/HAFpipe-line">https://github.com/petrov-lab/HAFpipe-line</ext-link>), and a shiny app for predicting HAF accuracy in any model organism (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://ec-calculator.shinyapps.io/shinyapp/">https://ec-calculator.shinyapps.io/shinyapp/</ext-link>). We conclude our findings by offering recommendations about the most powerful way to integrate haplotype inference into E+R experimental schemes.</p>

      <title>Establishment and sequencing of founder set</title>
      <p>207 iso-female <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> lines were established from wild individuals sampled from Maine and Pennsylvania (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Behrman <italic>et al.</italic> 2018</xref>), and inbred for ∼20 generations of full-sibling mating to produce viable, fertile inbred lines. 30-50 individuals from each line were pooled for DNA extraction. Whole flies were homogenized with lysis buffer and 1mm beads, and DNA was precipitated from the homogenate before resuspension in TE buffer. Libraries were prepared with a modified Nextera protocol (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Baym <italic>et al.</italic> 2015</xref>). All samples were indexed with Illumina’s TruSeq Dual Index Sequencing Primer Kit (PE-121-1003) and pooled equimolarly into 3 sets of ∼70 samples each. Each set of pooled DNA libraries were purified using Ampure XP and size-selected to 450-500 bp with a SizeSelect E-Gel. After an additional 5 rounds of PCR, DNA libraries were purified using Ampure XP beads, quantified, and diluted to the appropriate concentration before sequencing on the HiSeq 3000. All sequences were deposited in SRA (BioProject PRJNA383555). Adapter sequences were trimmed (Trimmomatic v0.33) and overlapping reads were merged (PEAR v0.9.6), then reads were mapped (bwa v 0.7.9) to the <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> reference genome (v5.39) using default parameters. PCR duplicates were removed using PicardTools (v1.12). Base quality score recalibration, indel realignment, and novel SNP discovery were carried out using GATK’s HaplotypeCaller. Only bi-allelic SNPs segregating in the 99 lines pooled for resequencing in this study were used to generate a founder SNP table, simulate reads, and estimate haplotype frequencies.</p>

      <title>Generating experimentally pooled samples</title>
      <p>One male each was selected from each of 99 inbred strains, and all 99 individuals were pooled for re-sequencing. A second biological replicate was constructed from 99 additional individuals. DNA isolation was performed as described above. Three separate libraries were prepared from each of the two biological replicates using different library prep methods: [1] according to protocols described in Nextera DNA Library Prep Reference Guide (15027987 v01); [2] a modified Nextera protocol (as described above) and [3] a Covaris shearing protocol. Final results from the 3 library prep methods were similar. All libraries were size-selected and PCR amplified using two replicate PCR reactions and a high volume of template DNA to prevent PCR-jackpotting. DNA was purified, quantified, and diluted before sequencing on the HiSeq 3000. Raw, 150bp pair-end reads were trimmed for adapter sequences with Skewer (version 0.1.127). Read merging, mapping, and PCR duplicate removal was performed as above.</p>

      <p>150-bp paired end pre-aligned reads were simulated from a table of founder genotypes and the <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> reference genome with simreads, a software tool included with the harp package (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Kessner <italic>et al.</italic> 2013</xref>). All reads were simulated with an error rate of 0.2% (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Schirmer <italic>et al.</italic> 2016</xref>), with simulated sequencing errors receiving a lower simulated base quality score. No read trimming or PCR duplicate removal was done. All SNP tables with missing genotypes were imputed before read simulation.</p>

      <title>Haplotype frequency estimation</title>
      <p>All haplotype frequencies were estimated with harp - Haplotype Analysis of Reads in Pools (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Kessner <italic>et al.</italic> 2013</xref>) in a two-step process in which 1) a likelihood model is built by probabilistically assigning all reads to haplotypes, and 2) maximum likelihood estimates of haplotype frequencies are calculated in discrete chromosomal windows, given local read assignments. An assumption of this method is that there are no recombination breakpoints within a window used for haplotype frequency estimation. However, with a fixed window size, this assumption breaks down as the lengths of unrecombined fragments decrease. The distribution of fragment lengths at a given generation can be modeled as an exponential distribution with rate <inline-formula><mml:math id="me1"><mml:mi>λ</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>, which can be calculated with:<disp-formula id="eq"><mml:math id="me2"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>λ</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mo> </mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:msup><mml:mi>L</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>*</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:msup><mml:msup><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>*</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:msup><mml:mi>G</mml:mi><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mi>L</mml:mi></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula>where <inline-formula><mml:math id="me3"><mml:mi>L</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> is chromosome length, <inline-formula><mml:math id="me4"><mml:mi>R</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> is recombination rate, and <inline-formula><mml:math id="me5"><mml:mi>G</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> is the number of generations of recombination between the initiation of the founding population and sampling. The <italic>q</italic>th quantile of this distribution can then be calculated in R with the function qexp(<italic>q</italic>,<inline-formula><mml:math id="me6"><mml:mrow><mml:mo> </mml:mo><mml:mi>λ</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>).</p>
      <p>We allowed window sizes to shrink over successive generations of recombination, such that only 18% of sampled unrecombined fragment lengths were expected to be smaller than the window length. Various quantiles from 5-25 were tested before choosing this parameter (Figure S4). Note that haplotype frequencies for fully unrecombined chromosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) were evaluated in 1000kb, 100kb and 10kb windows. To further reduce error, we used overlapping inference windows, with a step size equal to 10% of the window size. Thus, the vast majority of sites fall within 10 separate overlapping inference windows. Finally, in order to balance local relevance with maximal information, we created likelihood models in sliding windows 10x the size of frequency estimation windows, with a step size equal to half the likelihood window size.</p>
      <p>For reference, inferring haplotype frequencies for 99 founder lines at 283k segregating sites on chromosome 2L in 1000kb windows took 8 min and required 450Mb RAM for samples sequenced at 5x empirical coverage and took 15 min and required 860Mb RAM for samples sequenced at 10x. Using 100kb windows took 9.5 min / 70Mb and 17.5 min / 132Mb for 5x and 10x samples, respectively.</p>

      <title>Recombination</title>
      <p>Forward-in-time simulations of recombination were performed with the software tool forqs (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Kessner and Novembre 2014</xref>) using a <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> recombination map (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Comeron <italic>et al.</italic> 2012</xref>). forqs simulates recombination of haplotype chunks for chromosomes of user-specified lengths for a randomly mating population, using a user-supplied recombination map, and non-overlapping generations. As a conservative metric, in our simulations we referred to the female <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> recombination rate. Since male <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> do not undergo recombination, our estimates of the number of recombination events per generation are higher than that expected in real populations and our estimates of effective coverage serve as a lower bound on effective coverage for the same number of generations in real populations. Three rounds of simulation were performed for each selection regime. In each round, an initial population of 1,000 individuals was created, with each individual assigned to a randomly selected homozygous founder strain. 5-10 sites were randomly chosen to be under selection and the genotypes of each individual (determined by the genotype of the corresponding founder strain) at these sites was supplied to forqs via an ms file. Homozygous reference, heterozygous, and homozygous alternate genotypes were assigned fitness advantages equal to 0, <italic>s</italic>, or 2<italic>s</italic> respectively, where s was a specified selection coefficient (either s = 0.025 or s = 0.1 in our simulations). The chosen loci each contributed independently to a single additive trait, with environmental variance equal to 0.01. At each generation, a fitness value was calculated by forqs for each individual based on their genotypes at the selected sites, with fitness decaying linearly with distance from the optimum trait value of 1. Individuals were selected to contribute to the next generation probabilistically based on their fitness value. Recombination breakpoints were simulated for evolutionary trajectories up to 50 generations in 5 replicate populations with a constant population size of 1,000 individuals. Within each round, each replicate contained the same selected sites and selection coefficient. At specific generations, 100 sets of recombination breakpoints (each representing a pair of evolved ‘chromosomes’) were randomly selected from the forqs output and were used to reconstruct ‘sampled chromosome genotypes’ from corresponding segments of the 99 founder genotype calls. This set of sampled genotypes was used to directly calculate ‘true’ allele frequencies for the sampled pool and was also used as input for read simulations with simreads. The resulting reads were then used for HAF calculation.</p>

      <title>Generating a predictive model of effective coverage</title>

      <title>Overview of HAF calculation method</title>
      <p>Using haplotype inference for E+R experiments requires a genotyped founder set of inbred lines. Here, we begin by focusing on populations derived from a founder set of 99 sequenced <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> inbred lines (see Methods, ‘Establishment and sequencing of founder set’), and for simplicity limit our analysis to the 283,437 known segregating bi-allelic sites on chromosome 2L. In the analyses below, we estimate raw and haplotype-derived allele frequencies (referred to as raw AFs and HAFs, respectively) for real and simulated pools of ∼100 individuals sampled from populations derived from these founder haplotypes.</p>
      <p>Each sample is first subjected to pooled sequencing and all reads are mapped to the <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> reference genome. Raw AFs at each of the 283k sites are simply calculated as the fraction of mapped reads containing the alternate allele, after removing reads with neither the reference nor the alternate allele. To calculate HAFs, we performed haplotype frequency estimation with harp (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Kessner <italic>et al.</italic> 2013</xref>), a haplotype inference tool that uses sequence identity and base quality scores from each sequenced read in a bam file, as well as a table of founder genotypes, to obtain maximum likelihood estimates of haplotype frequencies in discrete chromosomal windows. We determined that missing calls in the founder genotype table can bias haplotype frequency estimation, and therefore, we first impute all missing genotypes before running harp (Supplemental Text, Figure S1). The frequency of each founder haplotype is inferred within sliding genomic windows (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, Methods) with extensive overlap to mitigate erroneous haplotype frequency assignments at the edges of inference windows. After inferring founder haplotype frequencies, we calculate HAFs at each SNP site by taking the weighted sum of local haplotype frequencies for founders containing the alternate allele (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, Methods).</p>

          <p>Overview of HAF calculation method. In an evolve-and-resequence experiment, the evolving population at any time point can be considered a mosaic of founder genomes. If founder genotypes are known, the relative frequency of each founder haplotype can be inferred within small genomic windows by leveraging pooled sequencing data and existing bioinformatic tools (<italic>i.e.</italic>, harp (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Kessner <italic>et al.</italic> 2013</xref>)). Allele frequencies can then be calculated from the weighted sum of founder haplotypes, rather than directly from mapped reads at each site.</p>

      </fig>
      <p>To determine the accuracy of HAFs and raw AFs, estimated allele frequencies were compared to ‘true’ allele frequencies derived from the known composition of founder haplotypes in the sample. Chromosome-wide accuracy of HAFs and raw AFs was quantified using a new metric, effective coverage, which represents the theoretical coverage at which the root-mean-square error (RMSE) from binomial read sampling equals the RMSE from observed allele frequency estimates (Figure S2). While expected error from extreme allele frequencies is lower than that of intermediate allele frequencies under a binomial model, by taking the ratio of the expected error and the observed error for the same set of true allele frequencies, effective coverage values do not depend on the underlying allele frequency spectrum (Methods). Note that while this metric specifically focuses on variance from the sampling of reads from pooled chromosomes, in practice, the ability of both HAFs and raw AFs to accurately reflect true population-level allele frequencies will also depend on variance from the sampling of individuals from the population. This independent source of error has however been well-treated elsewhere (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Feder <italic>et al.</italic> 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Kolaczkowski <italic>et al.</italic> 2011</xref>) and will not be impacted by haplotype inference.</p>
      <p>In the following sections, we explore how the accuracy of HAFs differs from raw AFs, and how it scales with empirical coverage, number of generations of recombination, and missing founder genotypes.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="s15">
      <title>Haplotype inference significantly increases the accuracy of allele frequency estimations</title>
      <p>We begin by analyzing the very simplest scenario, in which a sample consists of un-recombined chromosomes, one from each founder line. To examine the accuracy of HAFs and AFs in this scenario, we created two biological replicate samples of 99 <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> individuals, each from a different homozygous inbred strain (Methods) and performed high-coverage pooled sequencing of each sample. True allele frequencies for each sample were then calculated, incorporating estimates of uneven pooling during sequencing (Figure S3, Supplemental Text).</p>
      <p>The accuracy of HAFs depends on the power to estimate haplotype frequencies, which in turn is affected by the coverage of mapped reads throughout the genomic window used for haplotype inference. In order to compare the accuracy of HAFs to raw AFs and test how each scales with empirical coverage, reads from the two biological replicates originally sequenced at ∼140x were down-sampled to chromosome-wide empirical coverages of 1x to 100x, and then used to calculate the effective coverage of estimated allele frequencies for each replicate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Haplotype inference was initially performed using 100kb sliding windows, and accuracy was assessed only at the 27k sites with known genotype information for every founder. As expected, effective coverage of both HAFs and raw AFs is similar within the two biological replicates, and increases with higher chromosome-wide empirical coverage. Yet for all empirical coverages tested, HAFs have strikingly higher effective coverages than raw AFs. This substantial gain in accuracy from haplotype inference was most prominent at lower empirical coverages, with a &gt;40-fold increase in accuracy at 10x empirical coverage (from 10x to effectively &gt;400x). At higher empirical coverages, haplotype inference appears to produce diminishing returns and effective coverage begins to plateau.</p>

        <graphic xlink:href="4159f2"/>
      </fig>
      <p>We next tested the effect of using smaller (10kb) or larger (1000kb) windows for haplotype inference at empirical coverages up to 10x. We find that as expected, larger window sizes produce the most accurate HAFs, since more reads are available to infer haplotype frequencies in each window. Specifically, 1000kb HAFs derived from empirical coverages of 1x and 5x reached effective coverages of &gt;400x and &gt;900x, respectively.</p>
      <p>We also confirmed that similar results would be achieved by simulated samples with known sources of error. To do so, we simulated pooled synthetic reads with a standard Illumina sequencing error rate of 0.002 (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Schirmer <italic>et al.</italic> 2016</xref>) and corresponding base quality scores (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Kessner <italic>et al.</italic> 2013</xref>) from the same proportions of the 99 founder lines included in both biological replicates, and calculated effective coverage with the same empirical coverages and window sizes as above. Effective coverages for these simulated samples closely mirror effective coverages obtained from matched experimental samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A-B</xref>). Slight differences at higher empirical coverages and larger window sizes are most likely caused by compounded experimental error from DNA extractions, PCR reactions and sequencing, as well as ambiguity in the ‘true’ genotypes estimated for individually sequenced lines. We explore the effects of founder genotype ambiguity further below (see “HAF accuracy is impacted by missing founder genotypes”).</p>
      <p>Together, these results suggest that HAFs derived from multiple biological samples sequenced at low empirical coverages can be orders of magnitude more accurate than raw AFs, and that simulated samples capture the magnitude of this effect quite well. In the following analyses we focus on simulated data from these 99 founder lines in order to precisely and reliably test how recombination and missing founder genotypes affect HAFs in realistic E+R scenarios.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="s16">
      <title>Incorporation recombination and selection over short time scales</title>
      <p>In the first section we showed that HAFs are accurate for samples of unrecombined chromosomes with very similar allele frequencies to the founder population. However, in a realistic E+R scenario sampled chromosomes will be recombined mosaics of the founders and selection may substantially shift allele frequencies over time. Thus, in the remainder of our analyses, we incorporate selection and recombination using a forward-in-time simulator, forqs (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Kessner and Novembre 2014</xref>). We simulated recombination for 50 generations in a population of 1,000 randomly-mating individuals using a <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> recombination map (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Comeron <italic>et al.</italic> 2012</xref>), and tracked the breakpoints and haplotype of origin for all recombined segments at every generation. At specific generations, we randomly selected 200 recombined chromosomes (<italic>i.e.</italic>, 100 diploid individuals) from the simulated population and reconstructed the full sequences of these ‘sampled’ chromosomes from corresponding segments of the 99 individually sequenced founder haplotypes. Reads were simulated from the pooled set of 200 reconstructed chromosomes.</p>
      <p>We tested the accuracy of HAFs in three different selection regimes: five randomly chosen sites with selection strength s = 0.025 (<italic>i.e.</italic>, weak selection), 10 randomly chosen sites with selection strength s = 0.025, and 5 randomly chosen sites with selection strength s = 0.1 (<italic>i.e.</italic>, strong selection). In each case, the selected sites contributed additively to a single quantitative trait (Methods). We ran each simulation in three rounds, picking a different set of selected sites in each round, and simulated 5 replicate populations for each round. We calculated HAFs for each simulated sample, adjusting the window size for haplotype inference each generation based on the expected length of unrecombined haplotype blocks (Methods, Figure S4). As recombination proceeds, these windows become smaller, with fewer reads available to inform haplotype frequency estimation, and thus we expect that accuracy will decline.</p>
      <p>Our results show that while accuracy does decline over time, HAFs in general maintain &gt;100x effective coverage even after 50 generations in the presence of 5-10 selected sites per chromosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). We note that the three selection regimes tested all perform comparably well, though effective coverage is slightly higher with more selected sites (<italic>i.e.</italic>, 10 <italic>vs.</italic> 5) and larger selection coefficients (<italic>i.e.</italic>, s = 0.1 <italic>vs.</italic> s = 0.025). To assess the utility of HAFs for longer-term experiments, we also conducted three separate simulations with weak selection and 5 selected sites for 200 generations, and note that effective coverage of HAFs remains above the 100x threshold for detecting strong selection across 100-150 generations of recombination (Figure S5). Overall, we find that increasing empirical coverage has a diminishing returns effect on accuracy, while decreasing the generations of recombination has an approximately linear effect on accuracy.</p>

      <title>HAF accuracy is impacted by missing founder genotype</title>
      <p>In addition to the effects of recombination and selection on HAF accuracy, ambiguity in the genotypes of founders (either due to missing genotype information or residual heterozygosity) can also present challenges. We tested how setting founder genotypes to be ambiguous (<italic>i.e.</italic>, from a called ‘A’ allele to an uncalled ‘N’) influences the accuracy of HAFs. For each simulation, 1–10% of all genotype calls in the founder table were randomly selected to be assigned as ‘N’. Genotypes at these sites were then imputed prior to estimating haplotype frequencies (Supplemental Text). For each percentage of missing calls tested, three rounds of simulation were performed.</p>
      <p>We find that missing genotype calls can significantly reduce effective coverage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). However, the vast majority of the parameter space tested — 73.3% of all simulations — still yielded effective coverage values greater than 100x. Furthermore, 92.1% of simulations with less than 10% missing genotypes and fewer than 50 generations of recombination yielded effective coverage values greater than 100x.</p>
      <p>Importantly, these high overall chromosome-wide effective coverages extend to the selected sites themselves. Even with moderate levels of missing founder calls (up to 3% of missing sites), HAFs at selected sites still track closely with true allele frequencies; this is crucial for correctly detecting alleles under selection in E+R (Figure S6).</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="s18">
      <title>Estimating effective coverage with different founder sets and other model organisms</title>
      <p>Finally, we explored how the utility of HAFs may extend to other founder sets with known SNPs and known recombination rates. Specifically, we tested whether a simple linear model based on the simulations above could accurately predict effective coverage for other experimental designs and other model organisms. The regimes tested in the simulations above can be collapsed into two independent parameters that affect HAF accuracy: 1) the number of reads used for haplotype inference in each window and 2) the percent of founder genotypes that are missing. The first parameter is a combination of SNP density, read depth, and window size – while the window size itself is a function of the recombination rate and the number of generations of recombination since population initiation.</p>
      <p>We calculated regression coefficients of a log-linear model (Figure S7) using all simulations described in the sections above, which focused on a single founder set across many experimental regimes. To test whether this model could accurately predict HAF accuracy for other founder sets, we simulated three rounds of evolutionary trajectories (with 5 weakly selected sites in each round) for two entirely different founder sets composed of 1) a widely-used reference panel of 205 <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> lines known as the DGRP (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Huang <italic>et al.</italic> 2014</xref>), and 2) 100 genotyped <italic>C. elegans</italic> strains from a reference panel known as CeNDR (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Cook <italic>et al.</italic> 2017</xref>). For each founder set we simulated pooled samples for various generations and empirical coverages and calculated HAFs with various levels of missing founder information. We then used our model (trained only on the original simulations) to predict effective coverage for each of these new samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>).</p>

      </fig>
      <p>We find that across all samples tested, our simple two-parameter model has an R<sup>2</sup> value of 0.875. Predicted effective coverage values for simulations with the original 99-lines founder set differ from true effective coverage values by 25% on average, with the largest source of error due to random effects between simulation rounds. Overall accuracy for DGRP and CeNDR samples was slightly lower, with average deviations of 37% in both founder sets. We confirmed that the model does not systematically over- or under- predict the effective coverage of DGRP samples or CeNDR samples nor any other set of parameters included in our simulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). This suggests this model is broadly applicable for predicting HAF accuracy across many founder sets. Thus, given a set sequencing budget and a founder set with known sequencing quality, this model may be useful as a guideline for devising experimental schemes and distribution of resources that would maximize detection power. To this end, we have created a shiny app to help experimentalists predict effective coverage for their particular set of parameters (freely available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://ec-calculator.shinyapps.io/shinyapp/">https://ec-calculator.shinyapps.io/shinyapp/</ext-link>), as well as a table of requirements for HAF estimation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>).</p>

    <title>Disscussion</title>
    <p>E+R experiments have become a powerful tool to assay the underpinnings of rapid adaptation by tracking allele frequency trajectories within populations over time. Previous studies have shown that the greatest power to detect adaptive variants comes from an optimized experimental design that tracks allele frequencies in multiple replicate populations, samples each replicate population at multiple timepoints, and maximizes the coverage of each pooled sample. Incorporating all of these factors into an E+R framework, however, can present significant financial challenges. Here, we offer a way to mitigate these high sequencing costs without sacrificing statistical power.</p>
    <p>Our framework uses haplotype inference to increase the accuracy of pooled allele frequency estimates at low coverages. Since the accuracy of haplotype-derived allele frequencies relies on the total informative value of reads across a genomic window, rather than coverage at a single site, this approach allows us to sequence less but still maintain high accuracy in allele frequency estimations. In this vein, the window-based techniques used by HAFs have an advantage over raw AFs in that the accuracy of an individual SNP with low read depth will benefit from reads at surrounding sites in the window. Overall, our method is capable of achieving the same accuracy as would be expected from sequencing each sample at 100x (as recommended in order to reliably detect strong selection), while only requiring empirical coverage of 1x or less, bringing total sequencing costs from &gt;$25,000 down to less than $200.</p>
    <p>There are, however, limitations to this approach. First, as presented, this framework requires the founder population to be derived entirely from fully-inbred lines. As a result, the population dynamics of loci under selection may differ slightly from trajectories in natural populations due to the genetic diversity lost in the inbreeding process (<italic>i.e.</italic>, natural haplotypes, homozygous lethal mutations, and rare variants), as well as higher levels of linkage disequilibrium compared to non-inbred lines. Reconstituting an outbred population using inbred lines, however, can be an effective way to mitigate the effects of the inbreeding process, and has been experimentally shown to have negligible bias and effect on adaptive dynamics (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Nouhaud <italic>et al.</italic> 2016</xref>). Additionally, in reality even with many generations of inbreeding, residual heterozygosity may still exist. In our HAF calculation method, we treat heterozygous sites as missing calls, and impute the genotype as reference or alternate based on called genotypes before inferring haplotype frequencies. While we test the impact of these missing calls in our simulations by placing them randomly across the genome, in reality heterozygous sites are often non-randomly dispersed which in turn, could lead to variation in effective coverage not accounted for here. Fortunately, both of these issues may be addressed in futures studies with more sophisticated founder sequencing approaches that incorporate phasing. Newer long-read technologies may already make this an achievable reality for a number of systems.</p>
    <p>Second, this approach requires a reliable and comprehensive account of the variants present in each founder line. Since previous studies recommend upwards of 100 founders, sequencing each individual founder line to a sufficiently high depth (in our work, we have found sequencing coverages &gt;10x to be sufficient) may present a high upfront cost. However, this cost represents a one-time investment, which can be applied toward all future experiments using the same set of founders. Furthermore, a number of consortiums already maintain publicly available stocks of large numbers of <italic>Drosophila</italic> lines and other model organisms with full, high-quality genome sequences (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Lack <italic>et al.</italic> 2016</xref>; <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Huang <italic>et al.</italic> 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Cook <italic>et al.</italic> 2017</xref>). We anticipate that these resources will continue to rapidly expand, facilitating experiments with even greater haplotype diversity at minimal costs.</p>
    <p>In addition, this approach is limited to studying short-term adaptation on the scale of tens of generations. In fact, an assumption of our method is that within an inference window, recombination breakpoints minimally affect the ability to accurately call haplotype frequencies. For a given window size however, this assumption becomes less valid as recombination proceeds and haplotypes blocks decay. Conversely however, decreasing the window size reduces the information used for haplotype inference, which at the extreme renders HAFs no more accurate than raw AFs. In our pipeline, we attempt to balance these effects by scaling window sizes at any generation by the expected average unrecombined fragment length. While our results here demonstrate that even with this scaling procedure, recombination will limit the ability to detect adaptation on timescales of more than tens of generations, the short-term adaptive dynamics that best fit E+R studies fall well within this range. Furthermore, it is at these short timescales, when large numbers of replicate populations are critical to reliably detect selection, that the cost savings associated with haplotype inference methods will be most beneficial.</p>
    <p>Finally, this approach relies on tracking the trajectories of known bi-allelic polymorphisms derived from the founder population, and thus, <italic>de novo</italic> mutations will not be assayed in this framework. Nonetheless our approach should sufficiently capture the salient features of short-term adaptive dynamics, as there is a growing body of experimental evidence suggesting that selection acts primarily on standing genetic variation in sexual organisms, and that <italic>de novo</italic> beneficial mutations do not play a large role in rapid adaptation (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Burke <italic>et al.</italic> 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Teotónio <italic>et al.</italic> 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Sheng <italic>et al.</italic> 2015</xref>; <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Turchin <italic>et al.</italic> 2012</xref>). Additionally, by tracking only known well-validated polymorphisms, the approach is largely robust to error from small non-SNP chromosomal variants such as indels.</p>
    <p>Despite the above limitations, collectively our results show that integrating haplotype inference into future E+R experiments is a cost-effective way to achieve accuracy in allele frequency estimates, which will directly improve the ability to detect genome-wide signatures of adaptation. Consequently, we offer specific recommendations for future E+R experimental schemes that take advantage of this approach. First, each founder line should be initially sequenced to a sufficient depth that minimizes any missing genotypes. If missing genotype calls do exist in founder lines, imputing sites prior to haplotype inference can mitigate some of this error.</p>
    <p>Together, these guidelines and the analysis above form a framework for achieving effective coverages of close to 100x with empirical coverages as low as 1x even after 50 generations of recombination in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, reducing sequencing costs by 100-fold. Ultimately, these cost savings, which can be extended to experiments with a variety of model organisms, will facilitate E+R frameworks that can incorporate large numbers of replicate populations. These improvements may be crucial to the statistical power to distinguish between beneficial and neutral alleles (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Kessner and Novembre 2015</xref>; <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Baldwin-Brown <italic>et al.</italic> 2014</xref>) and ultimately the future of E+R as a practical and reliable experimental tool.</p>
