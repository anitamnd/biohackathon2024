    <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
    <p>Advances in clinical oncology require a deep understanding of cancer biology. Clinico-genomic data (CGD) obtained from routine clinical practice can greatly increase our comprehension of tumor biology. However, there are a number of barriers that impede capitalization of these critical real-world data (RWD). Paramount amongst these obstacles are prolonged time-to-analyses secondary to the difficulties of capturing data from heterogeneous sources, as well as the challenges of processing vast amounts of genomic information. These hurdles increase time-to-insight from RWD and threaten our ability to fully maximize on advances in molecular and information technologies.</p>
    <p>In the real-world setting, genomic information resides in a variety of formats. The most common is a report from an institutional molecular pathology department or a commercial vendor. This information is often accessed by clinicians or clinical researchers as semistructured data. Collecting CGD of a patient cohort in a structured electronic data capture (EDC) system can facilitate analysis and reduce time-to-analytics and time-to-action. CGD are often captured via classical (ie, manual) abstraction by individual research teams. Easily adoptable methods of large-scale CGD collection are limited but include direct transfer from individual vendors. These types of data transfer often require collaborative agreements between vendors and end-users (eg, investigators/institutions), which can limit their scalability.</p>
    <p>We previously published an overview of a methodology and design of a Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap)-based system to facilitate capture of RWD.<xref rid="ooab082-B1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> REDCap is a web-based EDC utilized by researchers to collect structured data.<xref rid="ooab082-B2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref> That platform incorporates a form entitled <italic toggle="yes">Genomics Instrument</italic>, which provides a structured format for the collection of CGD.<xref rid="ooab082-B3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref> This instrument is freely available and can be incorporated into any existing REDCap project.</p>
    <p>Here, we present GENETEX (pronounced “genetics”), an R package with a Shiny application front-end, which facilitates the abstraction of CGD from electronic health record (EHR) and streamlines capture of structured data into the <italic toggle="yes">Genomics Instrument</italic> in REDCap. Its functions include natural language processing of key genomic information, transformation of semistructured data into structured data, and importation into REDCap (<xref rid="ooab082-F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). GENETEX is executed in R but is deployed as a Shiny application to enhance the user interface for non-R users.</p>

      <caption>
        <p>Schema of GENETEX. The GENETEX package takes CGD, which is typically stored in semistructured data, as an input via a Shiny application user interface. Once the input data have been captured, the package executes a series of server-side functions that text mine CGD reports for relevant genomic data. These structured data are then imported directly into the REDCap electronic data capture system (EDC), placing the data in the Genomics Instrument in REDCap. CGD: clinico-genomic data; REDCap: Research Electronic Data Capture.</p>

      <title>Comparison of GENETEX to manual abstraction</title>
      <p>Sample genomic reports were either generated or obtained from commercial vendors. These data were devoid of protected health information; thus, no IRB was required for this project. Two highly trained abstractors manually abstracted the reports and recorded the time-to-capture for each report. GENETEX was used to abstract these same reports. To simulate the real-world experience, both techniques incorporated a manual visual quality-control step to verify if imported results were accurate. The time spent on this step was included in the total time-to-capture. Agreement rates were compared using R. A paired Wilcoxon test was used to compare the time of manual abstraction with the time to capture CGD with the GENETEX package.</p>
    </sec>
  </sec>

    <title>RESULTS</title>
    <sec>
      <title>Inputs/user interface</title>
      <p>CGD in the real-world setting is predominantly contained in either portable document format documents sent to providers by commercial vendors or in text files contained within EHR. Thus, to facilitate abstraction of these data we developed a browser-based user interface that incorporates text data captured on a clipboard as input in a Shiny application. Text is copied to a computer’s clipboard and pasted into the text area input in the Shiny application (<xref rid="ooab082-F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>).</p>

        <caption>
          <p>Browser-based user interface. Depicted is the user interface (UI) of the Shiny app of GENETEX. This UI is produced by running the code in the R script “GENETEX Shiny app. R,” which can be found on GITHUB (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://github.com/TheMillerLab/genetex/blob/main/GENETEX%20Shiny%20app.R" ext-link-type="uri">https://github.com/TheMillerLab/genetex/blob/main/GENETEX%20Shiny%20app.R</ext-link>).</p>

      </fig>
      <p>Users then control additional inputs including the free text of the subject’s record id (required field), REDCap instrument instance (required), lesion tag descriptor (optional field), and date the tissue was obtained (optional). Drop-down inputs are also presented to the user including the selection of the platform used to generate the genomics report (required) and the type of lesion the genomics report was generated from (eg, primary lesion vs metastases; optional). Finally, to direct the data to REDCap, users enter strings of the web address of the REDCap platform (required) as well as the REDCap API Token (required). These inputs are then called to the function genetex_to_redcap() by the action button “Run GENETEX to REDCap.”</p>
    </sec>
    <sec>
      <title>Server-side functions</title>
      <p>The server side of the Shiny application contains the executable code of GENETEX. The package contains a set of functions that then parse, text mine, and transform the input into structured data to serve as the substrate for import into REDCap (<xref rid="ooab082-F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). <xref rid="ooab082-T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> summarizes the functions and their respective function to extract key elements from the genomics report. We have methods to automatically mine HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee-approved gene names and detected amino acid and/or nucleotide alterations, tumor mutational burden (tmb), mismatch repair status (mmr), copy number variants (cnv), and mutational signatures. In addition, our implementation transforms the data and links the appropriate CGD with the variables used in the Genomics Instrument so that they can be uploaded into REDCap.</p>

        <title>Overview of data processing</title>
        <p>Following the initial step of securing CGD into the Shiny application, GENETEX converts these character strings to a data frame for text mining. At this time, CGD from the following platforms are able to be processed by GENETEX: Guardant360,<xref rid="ooab082-B14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref> FoundationOne,<xref rid="ooab082-B15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref> Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) SNaPshot,<xref rid="ooab082-B16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref> and Brigham and Women’s Hospital (BWH) Oncopanel.<xref rid="ooab082-B17" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref></p>
        <p>Due to idiosyncratic differences between these reports, we developed platform-specific functions to text mine data. For example, gene.variants.isolate.oncopanel() and gene.variants.isolate.snapshot() isolate gene variant data from BWH Oncopanel and MGH SNaPshot reports, respectively. However, in general, following securing CGD, the data are tokenized using the cSplit() function from the splitstackshape package.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>Isolating genomic data with regular expressions</title>
        <p>To perform text mining of CGD, we created a number of regular expressions (regex) to identify gene names, nucleotide and amino acid sequences, and cell-free DNA (cfDNA) data within genomic reports. For example, the function genes_boundary_regex() generates a regular expression of &gt;900 gene names surrounded by word boundaries (<xref rid="ooab082-F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). We further designed regular expressions to detect nucleotide and amino acid sequences and the magnitude of cfDNA (<xref rid="ooab082-F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). The regular expressions were effectively combined to identify only those genomic information of interest (<xref rid="ooab082-F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). Finally, we filter out unnecessary elements (eg, the strings “RESULTS”: “Single” “nucleotide” “variants”) that are not intended to be captured in the Genomics instrument (<xref rid="ooab082-F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>).</p>

            <p>(A) Regular expression of gene names. Depicted is a portion of the character vector output of the function “genes_boundary_regex().” This function produces a regular expression that is used by GENETEX to identify gene names in CGD reports. (B) Regular expression of nucleotide and amino acid sequences, and cfDNA. Shown are the 3 regular expressions used to identify nucleotide sequences (“nuc_regex”), amino acid sequences (“aa_regex”), and cfDNA (“cfdna_regex”) contained within CGD reports. (C) Tokenized genomics report. Depicted is a portion of a CGD report that has been tokenized. Here, each word of the report is partitioned into a single cell of the vector “X.” (D) Example of report filtered with genes_nuc_aa_cfdna_regex. Shown is vector “X” from (C), which has been filtered by a regular expression that selects only cells with elements relevant to gene names, nucleotide, and amino acid sequences and cfDNA. The code used for this step is demonstrated above the output. (E) Example of report grouped by gene name. Related tokens are grouped using the “stringr::str_detect()” function by incorporating the regular expression “genes_boundary_regex.” With this method, HUGO gene names serve as the “keyword” and thus the boundary for each group. As a result, the appropriate nucleotide, amino acid, and cfDNA data are linked with the corresponding gene name. (F) Mapping REDCap variables to data elements. Each tokenized data element in vector “X” must be linked with an appropriate variable name from the Genomics Instrument. In this step, the 4 relevant variable stems, “variant_gene,” “variant_nucleotide,” “variant_protein,” and “variant_gene_perc_cfdna” are matched with the relevant data in vector “X” by combining the “ifelse()” and “str_detect()” functions with the regular expressions “genes_boundary_regex,” “nuc_regex,” “aa_regex,” and “cfdna_regex.” (G) Complete mapping REDCap variables to data elements with the NSLS. Each data element in vector “X” must correspond to a unique variable name to be imported into REDCap. Therefore, in this final step, the variable stems “variant_gene,” “variant_nucleotide,” “variant_protein,” and “variant_gene_perc_cfdna” and linked to the number found in the column “group” which produces a unique variable. All of those variables with the suffix “_1” will be “linked” together using an NSLS. cfDNA: cell-free DNA; CGD: clinico-genomic data; NSLS: Numeric Suffix Linker System; REDCap: Research Electronic Data Capture.</p>

        <title>Group correlated text</title>
        <p>In order to group correlated genomic information (eg, gene name with the associated nucleotide/amino acid variant), GENETEX utilizes keyword-group pairing. A logical vector “keywords” is created using the dplyr function mutate() paired with str_detect() and the regular expression “genes_boundary_regex.” This logical vector becomes the object of the cumsum() function to create the numeric vector “group”; effectively grouping each unique gene name with its correlated data (<xref rid="ooab082-F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>).</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>Mapping REDCap variables</title>
        <p>In addition to isolating key genomic data from reports, the above regular expressions are also used to map variables used in the <italic toggle="yes">Genomics Instrument</italic>. The instrument uses the following variable prefixes “variant_gene,” “variant_nucleotide,” “variant_protein,” and “variant_gene_perc_cfdna” to enable tidy data for gene names, nucleotide variants, amino acid variants, and percent cfDNA, respectively. Using the following combination of ifelse() statements, str_detect(), and the aforementioned regular expressions, these variables can be linked to the corresponding data (<xref rid="ooab082-F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref>).</p>
        <p>As previously described,<xref rid="ooab082-B3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref> in order to produce unique variables that can be linked with other related information, the <italic toggle="yes">Genomics Instrument</italic> utilizes a numeric suffix linker system (NSLS). The NSLS links related elements of CGD with a character string in the variable name (eg, “variant”) with an underscore and a numeric (e.g “_1”). Therefore, a given gene will be grouped with its correlated nucleotide/amino acid variants and/or cfDNA information with a unique character string and numeric. For example, the variable prefixes “variant_gene,” “variant_nucleotide,” “variant_protein,” and “variant_gene_perc_cfdna” will all be linked with the same numeric suffix (eg, “_1”). Consequently, these elements can be grouped during analysis with the unique pairing of “variant” and “_1.” Therefore, a final step in creating this unique variable-linked system involves pasting the “var” vector with the “group” vector (<xref rid="ooab082-F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3G</xref>).</p>
        <p>An analogous approach is used to identify and abstract data on cnvs, tmb, mmr, and mutational signatures. Please see the description file and annotated R scripts contained within the package in GitHub for further details.</p>

      <title>Package outputs</title>
      <p>The front-end Shiny application is executed with an action button that produces 2 easy-to-view outputs. The first, which can be viewed by clicking on “Report” in the sidebar, produces a verbatimTextOutput of the genomic report to ensure that the correct report was pasted into the textAreaInput. The second one, viewed by clicking on “Data” in the sidebar, is a table of the data executed by genetex_to_redcap() (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table S1</xref>). This is intended to provide the user with an output of the data generated by the function so that a quality-control step can take place.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec>
      <title>Import to REDCap</title>
      <p>The data in Table 2 are imported to REDCap from the Shiny application by calling the function redcap_write_oneshot() from the REDCapR package. An example of a portion of that form with data imported from GENETEX is seen in <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S1</xref>.</p>

      <title>Real-world deployment</title>
      <p>In order to evaluate the performance of augmented abstraction with GENETEX in the real-world setting compared to manual capture, we selected 7 genomic reports at random (3 Guardant, 2 Foundation Medicine, 1 MGH SNaPshot, and 1 BWH Oncopanel) for abstraction. Each report was abstracted independently by 2 data abstractors via manual abstraction, as well as with GENETEX. In total, 744 data elements were captured from these 7 reports. Agreement rates between the 2 human abstractors were 99.19%. Importantly, &gt;99% agreement was reached between both human abstractors and GENETEX (99.33% between abstractor one and GENETEX and 99.19% between abstractor 2 and GENETEX). Given that the agreement between classical and augmented abstraction was high, we next evaluated if the GENETEX pipeline would improve time-to-analysis. The mean time for manual abstraction for each report was 784.5 (range: 220.5–3096.5) seconds compared with 136 (range: 75–216) seconds for augmented abstraction (Wilcoxon test <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> value = .015625). For augmented abstraction, the average time for capture and processing by GENETEX was 42 s (range: 34–54) with 94 s (range: 40–170) used for abstractor verification.</p>

      <title>Limitations and solutions</title>
      <p>GENETEX is to be used in conjunction with <italic toggle="yes">Genomics Instrument</italic> and thus, it is dependent on that form being installed into an REDCap project. However, we have made the data dictionary freely available so that others may incorporate it into their individual project. Importantly, our regular expressions system of mapping variable names to key genomic data provides a high degree of flexibility to map alternate variable names for REDCap instruments with different data dictionaries. Additional limitations include the fact that at this time, GENETEX does not support all potential platforms available for CGD. However, due to its open-source position, external developers can perform pull-requests on GitHub for incorporation of additional platforms and future refinement.</p>

    <title>CONCLUSIONS</title>
    <p>GENETEX is a browser-based application for natural language processing of CGD obtained in routine clinical practice. It facilitates extraction of data from EHR, transformation of semistructured data into a structured format, and loading into REDCap. Its Shiny extension enables non-R users to execute the package without the familiarity of R. Real-world deployment of the GENETEX demonstrated excellent agreement with classical abstraction in roughly 1/5 of the time. Thus, augmented abstraction with browser-based applications can decrease the barrier to data capture and importantly improve time-to-analysis of CGD.</p>
