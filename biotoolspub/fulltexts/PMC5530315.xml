      <title>Abstract</title>
      <sec>
        <title>Background</title>
        <p>Research projects often involve observation, registration, and data processing starting
from information obtained in field experiments. In many cases, these tasks are carried
out by several persons in different places, times, and ways, adding different levels of
complexity and error in data collecting. Furthermore, data processing can be time
consuming, and input errors may produce unwanted results. </p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>Results</title>
        <p>We have developed a novel, open source software called Phenobook, an easy, flexible,
and intuitive tool to organize, collect, and save experimental data for further
analyses. Phenobook was conceived to collect phenotypic observations in a user-friendly,
cost-effective way. It consists of a web-based software for experiment design, data
input and visualization, and exportation, combined with a mobile application for remote
data collecting. We provide in this article a detailed description of the developed
tool. </p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>Conclusion</title>
        <p>Phenobook is a software tool that can be easily implemented in collaborative research
and development projects involving data collecting and forward analyses. Adopting
Phenobook is expected to improve the involved processes by minimizing input errors,
resulting in higher quality and reliability of the research outcomes.</p>

    <title>Background</title>
    <p>Registration, systematization, storage, and access to large volumes of observational data
are currently affecting several disciplines related to biological sciences, as many
experiments base their conclusions on data obtained through observation. For example, a
plant breeding program can easily contain dozens of experiment, each having hundreds of
entries [<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. In other cases, ecologists
collectively produce large volumes of data through diverse individual projects [<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], where the variability of formats, logical
structures, and sampling methods create significant challenges for downstream analyses.
Cultural barriers and tradition further impede progress in the creation and adoption of data
standards [<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. In agronomy, phenotype information
has traditionally been captured in a free-text manner [<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], possibly causing a large variation of terms and concepts used to describe
comparable objects across datasets. It is not uncommon that different persons take part in
data collection, so the process of writing and transcribing massive amounts of data on paper
field books usually involves high costs in human resources and the risk of having poor data
integrity [<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. As explained in Jones et al. [<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], to address these issues scientists make use of
methods like entering data in an ad hoc manner in spreadsheet-based software tools. However,
these habits do not provide the tools to promote good data management practices because they
lack a proper structure to adequately describe and constrain the data. As stated in Ziemann
et al. [<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], the spreadsheet software Microsoft
Excel, when used with default settings, is known to convert gene names to dates and
floating-point numbers. These errors are widespread in the scientific literature. According
to a programmatic validation done by Ziemann et al. [<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], approximately one-fifth of papers with supplementary Excel gene lists contain
erroneous gene name conversions. A more robust way to collect data is the adoption of
desktop database management systems such as Microsoft Access. The biggest limitation of
these database management systems is that obtained datasets are relatively difficult to
share with colleagues. There are also available tools that aim to simplify the process of
data acquisition, reducing costs and enforcing data integrity, like FieldBook, developed
by Rife and Poland [<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], or FieldLab, developed by
International Rice Research Institute [<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. These
mobile applications allow users to specify the data input formats, locally save the
observations in the device, and finally export results in different formats.</p>
    <p>Other types of platforms designed for field data collecting rely on specific hardware, and
they turn out to be somehow more specific (and less flexible) and high-priced than platforms
previously described. Examples can be found in Berke and Baenziger [<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], Liebisch et al. [<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], and
Busemeyer et al. [<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], among others.</p>
    <p>In this article, we describe a web-based open source software that centralizes
observational records and a mobile application that can connect to the server and
synchronize data, so different users can work in the same project collaboratively at the
same time.</p>
  </sec>
  <sec>
    <title>Implementation</title>
    <sec>
      <title>Introducing Phenobook</title>
      <p>We present Phenobook, a novel open source web-based software that handles phenotypic
records, manages involved personnel, and synchronizes data with a centralized database in
order to maintain data integrity and simplify data control. Phenobook is a software
platform consisting of a web application that manages experiments combined with a mobile
application for creating a field record of observations. It also provides up-to-date
documentation, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://intabiotechmj.github.io/phenobook-server/">https://intabiotechmj.github.io/phenobook-server/</ext-link>.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec>
      <title>Users</title>
      <p>Phenobook users are classified into three categories: <list list-type="roman-lower" id="lst1"><list-item><p>non-administrator
users;</p></list-item><list-item><p>administrator users, who can manage other
users;</p></list-item><list-item><p>super-administrator users, who can manage other
users and create users groups.</p></list-item></list></p>
      <p>Each user belongs to a user group and can only access information created by its group.
This way it is possible to use the same instance of Phenobook in different working groups.
Variables are shared across the same group.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec>
      <title>Variables</title>
      <p>Each Phenobook is a spreadsheet-like document. Variables are created before creating a
Phenobook, so different Phenobooks can share the same variables, which makes it possible
to merge results in the same report. To create variables, select the option ‘variables’ in
the upper menu. Click the ‘add’ button, and insert the desired variable name, description,
and field type and check if the variable is informative. The field type can be text,
number, boolean, date, categorical, or photo. If a variable is selected as informative, it
means that its content is known before making the observations. This will serve as a guide
for the user when registering records (for example, in an experiment, cultivar and
repetition variables can be both informative, with field types categorical and numerical,
respectively).</p>
    </sec>
    <sec>
      <title>Phenobooks</title>
      <p>New Phenobooks are created by selecting ‘Phenobooks’ – ‘add’ in the software. Each
Phenobook has a name, the quantity of experimental units (rows), an optional description,
and a set of variables. Once created, the Phenobook will be visible to all users within
the same group of the creator. It is possible to query Phenobooks in different ways. The
first one is to inspect the results of an individual Phenobook. This option shows a table
with the data of the selected Phenobook. At the bottom, you can see a summary indicating
creation date, last update, and completeness percentage. Extra information about the
registry is provided (how the data was taken, on mobile or server, when, by whom, and a
historical record with all modifications made to the record as cells with historical
record are highlighted) by clicking on each cell. It is possible to fix a value (disable
modification on mobile device) by clicking the ‘fix this value’ button. It is also
possible to change the value to a previous one by clicking on ‘use’ this value on each
historical record, and to access a variable summary by clicking on each variable name. The
summary structure depends on the variable data type. Another way to query Phenobooks is
the ‘Comma Separated File (CSV) Export’ option. This will create a standard CSV and
download it to the user device. Finally, the ‘data report’ option makes possible to merge
different Phenobooks data. Selection of which variables you want to be shown is required,
and after that, the Phenobooks that will be queried must be selected. It is possible to
show the results or download a CSV file. In the results table, the information for each
record is available by clicking on cells, and a summary is provided when clicking on each
variable name.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec>
      <title>Data entry from browser, spreadsheet import</title>
      <p>Observations can be registered from the mobile application or from the server. The table
shown under the option ‘Phenobooks’ – ‘Load Data Manually’ allows the user to copy and
paste from/ to MS Excel, OpenOffice Calc, and similar spreadsheet software. Information is
automatically saved when changed, except when the cell has a format error (i.e.,
alphabetic characters in a numeric variable). In this case, the cells are highlighted in
red and the user is asked to correct the data.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec>
      <title>Mobile data entry, mobile application</title>
      <p>Phenobook counts with a cross-platform mobile application. Android and iOS application
links are available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/INTABiotechMJ/phenobook-mobile">https://github.com/INTABiotechMJ/phenobook-mobile</ext-link>. Moreover, advanced users
can build their own versions of the application by compiling the mobile project for any
supported platform by Apache Cordova, as explained in “Create your first Cordova app.”
[<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p>
      <p>It is possible to change the Phenobook server installation URL in the mobile
application</p>
      <p>(i.e., <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://yourserverip/phenobook/">http://yourserverip/phenobook/</ext-link>)
by accessing the ‘settings’ menu. As the server address is changeable in the mobile
application, there is no need to compile the application each time a server instance is
deployed or moved to another IP address or domain.</p>
      <p>Users can synchronize initial data by entering email and password, and pressing the
‘update’ button. Once synchronized, the user can login and see available Phenobooks.</p>
      <p>Records are saved in the device in a local database (Web SQL), photos are encoded and
saved in the database as well, and all the information is uploaded to the server as an
HTTP request. Image annotations are automatically linked to data entry, so observation of
anomalies can be retrospectively investigated as proposed in Burke et al. [<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Users can trigger synchronization when
connectivity to the server application is available (i.e., Internet, LAN, etc.). Through
this procedure, experiment information and observations from other users are updated in
the mobile device, and observations saved in local device storage are sent to the server.
It can also save device GPS location (if available) and date/time when registering a
variable.</p>
      <p>Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref> depicts the main interface of the Phenobook
mobile application. In order to save observations in this scenario, where the Phenobook is
already indicated, the user must select the variable and experimental unit and complete
the datum in the ‘Value’ field.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec>
      <title>Data privacy and security</title>
      <p>Both the web server and the mobile application are protected via user and password. The
information is only accessible to specified users who provide valid credentials. The
sessions are handled by PHP session support.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec>
      <title>Database specification</title>
      <p>In Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">1</xref>, a simplified version of the structure
of the database is shown. Each registry (observation) is associated with a Phenobook and a
variable and has an experimental unit number for unique identification.</p>

    <sec>
      <title>HTTP API</title>
      <p>It is possible to query and update the database via an HTTP Application Programming
Interface (API). In order to make a request to the API, a valid username and password is
required, as well as other parameters depending on the method. The API will only return
data associated with the current user's group. To use this interface, parameters must be
passed by GET method. Each method returns a JSON representation of the selected objects.

    </sec>
    <sec>
      <title>Deployment</title>
      <p>It is possible to install Phenobook in a custom server. It must have PHP version 5.6 or
higher, MySQL version 5.4 or higher, and Apache Server. Files in the
<italic>phenobook-server</italic> repository must be copied to the Apache
<italic>www</italic> folder. A MySQL database must be created in the server, and a
<italic>database.sql</italic> file must be imported into that database; this file
contains tables, structures, and one administrator user. Then, the file
<italic>files/php/config/config.php</italic> must be updated with database details
(name, username, and password). The web application is now accessible with the username
<italic>admin@yourdomain.com</italic> and password <italic>admin</italic> (for security
reasons, this password must be changed or this user deleted by creating another
administrator user).</p>
    </sec>
    <sec>
      <title>Conflicting records</title>
      <p>If the same datum (same Phenobook, variable, and experimental unit) is registered more
than once, the last uploaded to the server is used by default. It is possible, however, to
access all the saved data and change a value for a previous one (as explained in Phenobook
Query).</p>
    </sec>
    <sec>
      <title>Description of tools</title>
      <p>The web application was developed in PHP 5.6 and uses MySQL 5.4 as its database engine.
The mobile application was developed in Apache Cordova, allowing multi-platform
compilation. Synchronization was made via an HTTP POST request to the server, which
uploads all new records (including photos) and downloads existent ones, updating the local
Web SQL database.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec>
      <title>Comparison of Phenobook and similar tools</title>
      <p>The idea behind Phenobook differs mainly from existing phenotype capture tools like
Fieldbook [<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] and Fieldlab [<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] because information is stored in centralized storage thanks to a
simple syncing process. This can be used by trial managers since data taken by persons
involved in data capture can be easily traceable. Experiments are created only once in the
server (web page) and updated in mobile devices when required. This way, data adquisition
is easier to administrate and control. When the experiment is in progress, it can be seen
in the server tool if an observation is taken or missing, which helps in understanding the
level of completion. Furthermore, history records of each observation can be accessed,
since data is not overwritten. It is feasible to know which user took which datum, when,
and where. Exportation of data to well CSV is possible in all three tools. All are
mobile-based applications, since data is expected to be taken in the field. Phenobook is
expected to run in all major mobile phones, including other platforms besides Android (in
comparison, other tools are only available for Android). This can be accomplished by
compiling the source code and specifying the target platform (Android, Windows, iOS,
Ubuntu, and more). This process is explained in the official Apache Cordova tutorial
[<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Image capabilities are present in all
applications. Phenobook is expected to support audio recording in future releases. GPS
position is saved every time a record is taken (if available), so it is possible to know
where this event happened. The ability to send data to a centralized server was the main
goal of this development. These characteristics allow the software to be implemented in
larger work groups since it is important to have better control on users that are involved
in the project, and also provide them with an easier way to share their data. This
information is summarized in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">1</xref>.</p>

    <title>Conclusions</title>
    <p>We developed Phenobook initially to manage plant breeding programs observations, although
it is flexible enough to be used in wider types of experiments. The tool can be easily
deployed, and it is expected to improve data quality and compatibility through exportation,
simplify the processes of registering observations, and have better user control and
management. The ability to trace data modifications and count with context information is
also helpful when understanding how and when the data was taken.</p>
