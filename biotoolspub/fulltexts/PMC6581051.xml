    <abstract>
      <p>DNA and histone proteins define the structure and composition of chromatin. Histone posttranslational modifications (PTMs) are covalent chemical groups capable of modeling chromatin accessibility, mostly due to their ability in recruiting enzymes responsible for DNA readout and remodeling. Mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics is the methodology of choice for large-scale identification and quantification of protein PTMs, including histones. High sensitivity proteomics requires online MS coupling with relatively low throughput and poorly robust nano-liquid chromatography (nanoLC) and, for histone proteins, a 2-d sample preparation that includes histone purification, derivatization, and digestion. We present a new protocol that achieves quantitative data on about 200 histone PTMs from tissue or cell lines in 7 h from start to finish. This protocol includes 4 h of histone extraction, 3 h of derivatization and digestion, and only 1 min of MS analysis via direct injection (DI-MS). We demonstrate that this sample preparation can be parallelized for 384 samples by using multichannel pipettes and 96-well plates. We also engineered the sequence of a synthetic “histone-like” peptide to spike into the sample, of which derivatization and digestion benchmarks the quality of the sample preparation. We ensure that DI-MS does not introduce biases in histone peptide ionization as compared to nanoLC-MS/MS by producing and analyzing a library of synthetically modified histone peptides mixed in equal molarity. Finally, we introduce EpiProfileLite for comprehensive analysis of this new data type. Altogether, our workflow is suitable for high-throughput screening of &gt;1000 samples per day using a single mass spectrometer.</p>

  <p>Proteomics has become one of the most widely used methodologies in biology and medicine, as identification and quantification of entire cell proteomes has allowed fundamental discoveries in disease etiology and basic science (<xref rid="GR247353SIDC3" ref-type="bibr">Beck et al. 2011</xref>; <xref rid="GR247353SIDC18" ref-type="bibr">Li et al. 2013</xref>; <xref rid="GR247353SIDC1" ref-type="bibr">Aebersold and Mann 2016</xref>; <xref rid="GR247353SIDC19" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al. 2016</xref>). Nano-liquid chromatography coupled online with tandem mass spectrometry (nanoLC-MS/MS) is nowadays the most sensitive and comprehensive strategy for proteomics analyses. The confidence in identification and quantification of highly complex protein mixtures has become possible due to the high mass accuracy (&lt;5 ppm), high resolution (&gt;60,000), and high sensitivity (&lt;amol) of LC-MS. Moreover, the throughput of such analyses has achieved ranges of 1–3 h per sample (<xref rid="GR247353SIDC12" ref-type="bibr">Hebert et al. 2014</xref>), including for the analysis of protein posttranslational modifications (PTMs) like phosphorylation (<xref rid="GR247353SIDC14" ref-type="bibr">Humphrey et al. 2018</xref>).</p>
  <p>Histone proteins have been extensively studied in basic science and research associated to disease etiology, as their PTMs play a fundamental role in modeling the chromatin state (<xref rid="GR247353SIDC17" ref-type="bibr">Kouzarides 2007</xref>). Chromatin remodeling has a direct effect on gene regulation, recruiting enzymes for DNA repair and tuning the chromatin condensation during the cell cycle. Histone PTMs exercise this function both by changing the chemical properties of histone-DNA interactions, e.g., acetylated histones contribute to relax DNA compaction due to reduced positive charges on lysine residues, or by recruiting complexes of protein “readers” that include transcription factors, enzymes, and other structural proteins (<xref rid="GR247353SIDC2" ref-type="bibr">Bannister and Kouzarides 2011</xref>). Together, the catalysis of a histone modification in a chromatin domain can orchestrate a substantial engagement of cellular factors modulating DNA readout. Aberrant regulation of classes of enzymes defined as histone “writers” (for histone PTM catalysis) or “erasers” (for histone PTM removal) can have effects on the cell phenotype. For instance, mutations in enzymes that are involved in chromatin organization have been found in more than 50% of human cancers (<xref rid="GR247353SIDC16" ref-type="bibr">Jones et al. 2016</xref>). Abnormal levels of histone PTMs have also been detected in many other diseases, including diabetes (<xref rid="GR247353SIDC25" ref-type="bibr">Raciti et al. 2014</xref>), PTSD (<xref rid="GR247353SIDC9" ref-type="bibr">Dirven et al. 2017</xref>), schizophrenia (<xref rid="GR247353SIDC15" ref-type="bibr">Ibi and González-Maeso 2015</xref>), allergies (<xref rid="GR247353SIDC32" ref-type="bibr">Tost 2018</xref>), and drug or alcohol addiction (<xref rid="GR247353SIDC34" ref-type="bibr">Wimmer et al. 2017</xref>). Aging and aging-related diseases such as Alzheimer's are other examples where levels of histone PTMs were found to be different from phenotypes representing optimal fitness (<xref rid="GR247353SIDC5" ref-type="bibr">Berson et al. 2018</xref>).</p>
  <p>Accurate quantification of histone protein levels has also emerging potential for biomarker discovery. For instance, the relative abundance of the histone variant H3.3 is higher as compared to canonical histone H3 in cells that do not proliferate (<xref rid="GR247353SIDC21" ref-type="bibr">Maze et al. 2015</xref>), indicating a potential role of histone H3.3 as a cellular “clock” to discriminate highly proliferative cells like cancer. Histones with missense mutations have been discovered to be present in cancer tissues; e.g., H3K27M and H3G34V/R mutations occur in selected pediatric brain cancers, and H3K36M or H3G34W/L in pediatric bone tumors (<xref rid="GR247353SIDC20" ref-type="bibr">Lohr et al. 2012</xref>; <xref rid="GR247353SIDC4" ref-type="bibr">Behjati et al. 2013</xref>; <xref rid="GR247353SIDC6" ref-type="bibr">Bjerke et al. 2013</xref>; <xref rid="GR247353SIDC24" ref-type="bibr">Qiu et al. 2018</xref>). Altogether, the field of “oncohistones” is likely to become a new and important branch of cancer biology.</p>
  <p>The analysis of histones and histone PTMs by MS has reached high levels of robustness and reproducibility, with coefficients of variations well below 20% even for low abundance marks (<xref rid="GR247353SIDC27" ref-type="bibr">Sidoli et al. 2015b</xref>). Since histones are very basic proteins, i.e., highly enriched in lysine and arginine residues, the histone workflow normally includes derivatization of lysine residues to prevent the proteolytic digestion performed by trypsin in generating excessively short peptides (<xref rid="GR247353SIDC10" ref-type="bibr">Garcia et al. 2007</xref>). The most abundant PTMs on histones are methylations (me1/me2/me3) and acetylation (ac), which are usually analyzed without any requirement for enrichment. However, histones are modified in traces by almost any modification type discovered on any other protein to date (<xref rid="GR247353SIDC7" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al. 2007</xref>; <xref rid="GR247353SIDC22" ref-type="bibr">Peng et al. 2011</xref>; <xref rid="GR247353SIDC30" ref-type="bibr">Tan et al. 2011</xref>, <xref rid="GR247353SIDC31" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; <xref rid="GR247353SIDC38" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al. 2011</xref>; <xref rid="GR247353SIDC8" ref-type="bibr">Dai et al. 2014</xref>; <xref rid="GR247353SIDC13" ref-type="bibr">Huang et al. 2014</xref>; <xref rid="GR247353SIDC35" ref-type="bibr">Xie et al. 2016</xref>). Because of this abundance of different PTMs, it is common to observe isobaric peptides, i.e., peptides carrying the same number and type of modifications but differently localized. By MS, the quantification of such peptides is solved by performing fragment-based MS/MS analysis, mostly now using data-independent acquisition (DIA) methods (<xref rid="GR247353SIDC26" ref-type="bibr">Sidoli et al. 2015a</xref>,<xref rid="GR247353SIDC27" ref-type="bibr">b</xref>, <xref rid="GR247353SIDC29" ref-type="bibr">2016b</xref>). Our lab has extensively contributed in developing workflows for histone analysis, including derivatization of histones by propionic anhydride (<xref rid="GR247353SIDC10" ref-type="bibr">Garcia et al. 2007</xref>), MS data acquisition via DIA (<xref rid="GR247353SIDC26" ref-type="bibr">Sidoli et al. 2015a</xref>,<xref rid="GR247353SIDC27" ref-type="bibr">b</xref>, <xref rid="GR247353SIDC29" ref-type="bibr">2016b</xref>), and software that specifically deals with isobaric peptides (<xref rid="GR247353SIDC36" ref-type="bibr">Yuan et al. 2015</xref>, <xref rid="GR247353SIDC37" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). However, this and others’ workflows are still limited in throughput; even at its best pace, the full experimental procedure requires about 2 d of sample preparation and ∼1 h for each LC-MS run. To envision histone analysis via MS as a potential platform for personalized diagnostics or for studies in systems or clinical biology, a much higher throughput is required. In addition, LC separation is a source of carryover and batch effects, as all samples are separated through the same chromatographic column, and one sample contaminating the stationary phase potentially alters the results of all samples injected afterward.</p>
  <p>Here, we present a complete optimization of the histone PTM analysis workflow that can be performed in as little as ∼7 h starting from a cell pellet (either tissue or cell culture), and it can be scaled up to ∼400 samples in the same batch. The protocol includes histone extraction from cells in 96-well plates, followed by derivatization using propionic anhydride and digestion using trypsin. After desalting, the analysis of each sample is performed by direct injection using a TriVersa NanoMate (Advion) coupled online with an Orbitrap Fusion Tribrid (Thermo Fisher Scientific) in about 1 min. Raw file processing and peptide quantification are then performed by a newly developed freely available software EpiProfileLite, an adapted version of our EpiProfile software which we routinely use for LC-MS histone experiments (<xref rid="GR247353SIDC36" ref-type="bibr">Yuan et al. 2015</xref>, <xref rid="GR247353SIDC37" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). The protocol includes a spike-in of a synthetic peptide mimicking the sequence of endogenous histones, of which complete derivatization and digestion can be quantified for quality control purposes.</p>

    <title>Results</title>
    <p>In this work, we have tested the performance of a high-throughput workflow for the analysis of histone PTMs via direct injection mass spectrometry (DI-MS) as compared to nanoLC-MS/MS. To validate the method in terms of reliability, robustness, and sensitivity, we performed the following comparisons: (1) We injected by nanoLC-MS/MS and direct injection a library of 61 synthetic peptides to assess that all these peptides are detectable and that there are not any biases in ionization efficiency significantly more pronounced compared to nanoLC-MS/MS. (2) We engineered a synthetic peptide to benchmark the efficiency of our sample preparation, as its byproducts of the derivatization and digestion can still be detected and quantified. We used this peptide to test multiple sample preparation strategies to minimize steps and improve throughput of the full workflow, as with DI-MS, sample preparation becomes the bottleneck of the workflow. (3) We removed the step of peptide N-termini propionylation, as this step is only beneficial to improve peptide hydrophobicity and LC retention, which is no longer needed for DI-MS. (4) We tested multiple types of acquisition methods to verify that data robustness is independent from the acquisition method and it is translatable into mass spectrometers other than the Orbitrap Fusion used in this study. (5) Finally, we proved that our results provide highly comparable results to nanoLC-MS/MS when comparing histone PTMs from brain and liver tissue when using DI-MS.</p>
    <p>The optimization of our workflow for histone peptides refers to our state-of-the-art protocol for derivatization of histones which requires propionylation of histones (<xref rid="GR247353SIDC28" ref-type="bibr">Sidoli et al. 2016a</xref>). To ensure that our workflow is suitable for high-throughput analysis, we optimized a protocol which requires ∼4 h of histone extraction, followed by 3 h of propionylation and digestion, followed by stage tipping (where samples are eluted directly into the buffer for direct injection), followed by about 1 min direct injection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="GR247353SIDF1">Fig. 1</xref>). All of the steps, from the histone extraction to stage-tipping, can be performed with multichannel pipettes in 96-well plates. Stage-tipping was performed using a customized rotor arm holding stage-tips above a collector plate to collect the eluate (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://genome.cshlp.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1101/gr.247353.118/-/DC1">Supplemental Fig. 1A</ext-link>). This rotor arm can hold four sets of tips and plates (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://genome.cshlp.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1101/gr.247353.118/-/DC1">Supplemental Fig. 1B</ext-link>), allowing for simultaneous stage-tipping of 384 samples. To ensure that the instrument is in optimal condition to analyze samples, we inject digested bovine serum albumin (BSA) and acquire it using a data-dependent acquisition method (DDA) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://genome.cshlp.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1101/gr.247353.118/-/DC1">Supplemental Fig. 1C</ext-link>). Because the analysis does not have chromatographic separation, the instrument will select for MS/MS fragmentation all the signals identified in the full MS (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://genome.cshlp.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1101/gr.247353.118/-/DC1">Supplemental Fig. 1D</ext-link>). Subsequently, the analysis of the BSA coverage can be performed using tools like Morpheus (<xref rid="GR247353SIDC33" ref-type="bibr">Wenger and Coon 2013</xref>); we consider the coverage adequate when &gt;60% (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://genome.cshlp.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1101/gr.247353.118/-/DC1">Supplemental Fig. 1E</ext-link>). The instrument should also prove that it can perform multiple injections without issues of signal stability when we re-inject BSA or perform multiple injections of other samples, i.e., for example, quantified peptide H3K9me3 injected 104 times without assistance (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://genome.cshlp.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1101/gr.247353.118/-/DC1">Supplemental Fig. 2</ext-link>). Together, the evaluation of the system prior to the experiment is performed by evaluating the sequence coverage of a directly sprayed BSA and repeated injections of the same BSA standard to assess reproducible spray current and stability.</p>

      <title>Detection efficiency assessment by synthetic peptides</title>
      <p>First, we injected a library of 61 isotopically labeled synthetic histone peptides (which we normally use as internal standards), corresponding to all the common modified and unmodified peptides of histone H3 and H4 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://genome.cshlp.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1101/gr.247353.118/-/DC1">Supplemental Table 1</ext-link>). To assess biases in ionization efficiency, we mixed the peptides in all equal molarity (290 fmol/µL) and observed differences in intensity compared to the expected equal intensity for all peptides. The analysis was performed in parallel via nanoLC-MS/MS and via direct injection, showing poor correlation between the two techniques (correlation = 0.31) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="GR247353SIDF2">Fig. 2</xref>A). We did not expect to observe high correlation in this case because high correlation is achieved only when two method are equally capable of quantifying differences in signal intensity of analytes. Since peptides were all mixed in equal molarity, higher or lower signals are only due to biases of various type. Four peptides showed an underestimation by nanoLC-MS/MS: H3K4me2, H3K4me3, H3K79me1, and H3K79unmod (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="GR247353SIDF2">Fig. 2</xref>B); the first two are very hydrophilic, while the other two are very hydrophobic. It is reasonable to assume that hydrophilic peptides are not retained properly by nanoLC-MS/MS, and therefore their quantification is underestimated. Regarding the two hydrophobic peptides, they elute in the very last part of the chromatogram where potential interference of nonpeptide contaminants might suppress the actual signal. A side-by-side view of the quantification for three injections of the synthetic peptide TKQTAR (H3 aa 3–8) clearly shows that the very early eluting peptides are underestimated by nanoLC-MS/MS as compared to expected (purple line, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="GR247353SIDF2">Fig. 2</xref>C). The three technical replicates performed by direct injection (DI-MS) showed a coefficient of variation significantly smaller than the three technical replicates analyzed by nanoLC-MS/MS (coefficient of variation 8.9% and 23.6%, respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="GR247353SIDF2">Fig. 2</xref>D; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://genome.cshlp.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1101/gr.247353.118/-/DC1">Supplemental Fig. 3</ext-link>). This was not surprising, as nano-chromatography is an inevitable source of variability in proteomics analyses. In addition, we speculate that higher reproducibility is also a consequence of the “simper” task required to define signal abundance; when performing LC-MS, the abundance corresponds to the accurate definition of an extracted ion chromatogram, while in DI-MS it is simply the intensity of the signal within a single spectrum. Collectively, our biggest concern was introducing biases by DI-MS significantly larger than nanoLC-MS/MS; our preliminary investigation using a synthetic peptide library verified that the two techniques have at least comparable inaccuracies as compared to expected signal intensity. If anything, DI-MS showed a smaller overall deviation from expected results compared to nanoLC-MS/MS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="GR247353SIDF2">Fig. 2</xref>E,F).</p>

      <title>Quality control by an engineered synthetic ‘histone-like’ peptide sequence</title>
      <p>A common gap in histone analysis is a proper quality control (QC) of the sample preparation. To compensate for this issue, we engineered a peptide with a sequence not corresponding to any known histone sequences but with similar physical and chemical properties, i.e., rich in lysine and arginine residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="GR247353SIDF3">Fig. 3</xref>A). The sequence is not encoded in any database, but it resembles existing histone peptides once digested. This peptide sequence was planned on purpose so that incomplete digestion and/or improper propionylation (under- or overpropionylation) generates peptides that are also detectable within the <italic>m/z</italic> range of canonical histone peptides. We verified the purity of our peptide by infusing the molecule completely undigested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="GR247353SIDF3">Fig. 3</xref>B), and we verified the sequence by HCD fragmentation and high resolution MS/MS acquisition (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://genome.cshlp.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1101/gr.247353.118/-/DC1">Supplemental Fig. 4</ext-link>). We then checked the production of complete and incomplete products by testing a 5-min trypsin digestion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="GR247353SIDF3">Fig. 3</xref>C). Spectra were acquired using a targeted SIM scan which we could multiplex (MSX) in the Orbitrap Fusion acquiring all 10 signals in the same spectrum. Next, we applied the use of the QC peptide by comparing three types of sample preparation, each aiming to minimize the time required to propionylate and digest a purified histone mixture. The sample utilized was mouse embryonic stem cells differentiated for 3 d. As a control, we used the standard protocol for histone derivatization and digestion (<xref rid="GR247353SIDC28" ref-type="bibr">Sidoli et al. 2016a</xref>) with only 2 h incubation with trypsin and with no N-terminal peptide propionylation. Moreover, we compared two other sample preparations, one including just 1 µL of propionic anhydride for each round of derivatization (to avoid drying before introducing trypsin) and one with an excess of ammonium hydroxide added after propionic anhydride (to assess issues of overpropionylation when pH &gt; 10). All three methods obtained an efficiency of propionylation and digestion estimated to be around 98% when considering the peptide oxidized at the methionine residue as part of the complete products (nanoLC-MS/MS data) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="GR247353SIDF3">Fig. 3</xref>D). Methionine oxidation is considered a negligible issue because all the major peptides quantified in our routine analyses do not contain methionine residues. The comparison with the results obtained with DI-MS analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="GR247353SIDF3">Fig. 3</xref>E) had an <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> Pearson correlation &gt;0.98 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://genome.cshlp.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1101/gr.247353.118/-/DC1">Supplemental Table 2</ext-link>). The major observable difference between the two results was a more sensitive detection of the underpropionylated products; this is most likely because chromatographic retention is not a factor during direct injection, and underpropionylated peptides have more hydrophilic properties. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that a sample preparation correctly performed leads to a relative abundance of the completely derivatized and digested spike-in well above 90% (not considering oxidation). We recommend discarding and repeating runs that show poorer yields benchmarked by the “histone-like” spike-in peptide.</p>

      <title>Acquisition of endogenous histone peptides by variable-size full MS windows</title>
      <p>Once we established that the derivatization and digestion protocol were of high efficiency, we created a method to detect peptide groups in small size MS windows (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="GR247353SIDF4">Fig. 4</xref>A). Each of these windows included all the unmodified and modified states of peptides sharing the same sequence which, when detected together, can be normalized by the signal of one another to obtain the relative abundance of each modified form. To ensure accurate discrimination between acetylation (42.01 Da) and trimethylation (42.047 Da), we acquired the full MS spectrum using a resolution of 240,000 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://genome.cshlp.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1101/gr.247353.118/-/DC1">Supplemental Fig. 5A</ext-link>). This acquisition could easily detect all the canonical acetylated and methylated states of histone peptides, including low abundance species normally detected only by nanoLC-MS/MS (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://genome.cshlp.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1101/gr.247353.118/-/DC1">Supplemental Fig. 5A,B</ext-link>). Because histone peptides have numerous isobaric forms, i.e., peptides sharing the same precursor mass but with different localization of the modification (example in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://genome.cshlp.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1101/gr.247353.118/-/DC1">Supplemental Fig. 5C</ext-link>), we programmed the acquisition method to perform targeted MS/MS fragmentation of isobaric peptides which we then used to determine the relative ratio between the isobaric forms using the principle of the Fragment Ion Relative Ratio (<xref rid="GR247353SIDC23" ref-type="bibr">Pesavento et al. 2008</xref>). This canonical protocol of histone preparation for nanoLC-MS/MS (<xref rid="GR247353SIDC28" ref-type="bibr">Sidoli et al. 2016a</xref>) contains two rounds of propionylation, including both propionylation of lysine residues prior to digestion and peptide N-terminal propionylation postdigestion. This latter is recommended to increase the hydrophobicity of histone peptides. However, we verified that removing the N-terminal propionylation step improves the detection of the b-ions series of histone peptides, which aid in the discrimination of the isobaric forms at the MS/MS level (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://genome.cshlp.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1101/gr.247353.118/-/DC1">Supplemental Fig. 6A–C</ext-link>). First, we verified that we did not introduce significant biases in the estimation of PTM abundances by removing the step of N-terminal propionylation. By comparing the relative abundances estimated by DI-MS of histones extracted from HEK293T cells, we observed a good correlation (<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.71) by preparing the samples with and without the step of N-terminal derivatization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="GR247353SIDF4">Fig. 4</xref>B). Then, we looked at how many quantifiable peptides we could observe by removing the N-terminal propionylation step; results showed that DI-MS increased the number of peptides with quantification ≠ 0 by removing this step in the sample preparation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="GR247353SIDF4">Fig. 4</xref>C). Understandably, the trend was the opposite for the nanoLC-MS/MS results, as by removing the propionylation, peptides bind less efficiently the C<sub>18</sub> column. We also selected two examples of isobaric forms, of which the relative ratio needs to be estimated by using MS/MS fragment ions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="GR247353SIDF4">Fig. 4</xref>D). Data clearly showed that the presence of N-terminal propionylation provides a different ratio estimation between the isobaric forms as compared also to nanoLC-MS/MS (here used as reference).</p>

        <graphic xlink:href="978f04"/>
      </fig>
      <p>Next, we optimized the acquisition method to ensure the maximum sensitivity and accuracy of the analysis. First, we optimized the automatic gain control (AGC) in the Orbitrap to achieve the best sensitivity while maintaining low potential charge excess into the analyzer, which leads to inaccurate mass detection. We proved that 5 × 10<sup>5</sup> ions was the ideal target, as 5 × 10<sup>4</sup> ions led to insufficient sensitivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="GR247353SIDF5">Fig. 5</xref>A) and 5 × 10<sup>6</sup> ions created deviations in the mass accuracy (more than 60 ppm) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="GR247353SIDF5">Fig. 5</xref>B). This was of mandatory importance to ensure stringent peak extraction to discriminate acetylation from trimethylation. In addition, we investigated the potential issues caused by nonperfect calibration of the quadrupole for the isolation of the full MS scan. Specifically, the Orbitrap Fusion (Thermo Fisher Scientific) can perform full MS by prefiltering all the ions not desired in the full MS with the quadrupole analyzer. This improves the ion capacity of the full scan, since all the nondesired ions are not accumulated in the ion routing multipole (IRM). However, we verified that noncalibrated wide quadrupole isolation leads to loss of sensitivity at the edges of the isolation window (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="GR247353SIDF5">Fig. 5</xref>C). The figure clearly shows that ions at <italic>m/z</italic> 486.3, 514.3, and 514.8 almost completely disappeared from the spectrum when quadrupole isolation was not properly calibrated. This generates inevitable biases in estimating PTM relative abundances; by quantifying the histone H4 peptide aa 4–17, we noticed that the largest ion (unmodified, <italic>m/z</italic> 747.94) was underestimated by DI-MS when not calibrated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="GR247353SIDF5">Fig. 5</xref>D). To assess the correct reference, we ran both DI-MS using a larger acquisition window and nanoLC-MS/MS, both showing highly comparable results.</p>

        <graphic xlink:href="978f05"/>
      </fig>
      <p>Finally, we tested a fully targeted acquisition method, where each <italic>m/z</italic> value considered for peptide quantification was not acquired by a full MS scan but by a targeted SIM. This test was performed to assess whether the relative quantification of PTMs is significantly affected by acquiring each signal individually instead of within the same scan. In addition, a targeted method paves the way to the applicability of our setup also for instruments that cannot perform wide quadrupole isolation like the Orbitrap Fusion. To reduce the cycle time, the SIM scans were multiplexed 10 by 10 in MSX scans (full list of scans in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://genome.cshlp.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1101/gr.247353.118/-/DC1">Supplemental Table 3</ext-link>), reducing the cycle time further as compared to the method described so far (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="GR247353SIDF6">Fig. 6</xref>A). A cartoon representation of the main differences between the acquisition method based on full MS windows and the targeted MSX method is illustrated in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://genome.cshlp.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1101/gr.247353.118/-/DC1">Supplemental Figure 7</ext-link>. In addition, we observed a significant increase in sensitivity (calculated using peptide intensities), due to the more focused acquisition range (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="GR247353SIDF6">Fig. 6</xref>B). By using both methods, we estimated the relative abundance of 199 histone peptides extracted from mouse brain and liver, achieving excellent correlation values when comparing the two methods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="GR247353SIDF6">Fig. 6</xref>C). As well, when we compared the log<sub>2</sub> fold change of each peptide quantified in liver versus the peptide quantified in brain, we obtained very similar values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="GR247353SIDF6">Fig. 6</xref>D). This was reassuring, as performing single MS fills of ions rather than acquiring a range including all the modified peptide forms might have led to differences in quantification accuracy. However, results clearly demonstrate that the two experiments provide very high similarities. Therefore, we adopted the DI-MS method acquired using SIM scans multiplexed (MSX) to estimate which histone PTMs are significantly different in relative abundance between mouse and brain liver. Among others, we identified a higher abundance of selected acetylations, i.e., H4K16ac, H3K23ac, and H3K18ac, and the heterochromatic marker H3K9me3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="GR247353SIDF6">Fig. 6</xref>E). On the other hand, other acetylations like H4K5ac and H4K12ac were found to be more abundant in liver cells. This also proved that our method can accurately discriminate the relative abundance of isomeric PTMs, i.e., histone modifications of the same type on the same peptide but localized on different amino acid residues. As a final comparison, we injected the same sample in a nanoLC-MS/MS analysis, obtaining high correlation when comparing the relative abundances of peptides acquired with the two acquisition methods (<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> &gt; 0.92 for both tissues) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://genome.cshlp.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1101/gr.247353.118/-/DC1">Supplemental Fig. 8</ext-link>; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://genome.cshlp.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1101/gr.247353.118/-/DC1">Supplemental Table 4</ext-link>). We thus focused on the analysis of histones H3 and H4, which have the most modified peptides, obtaining a highly similar volcano plot when deconvoluting the relative abundances of the single histone marks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="GR247353SIDF6">Fig. 6</xref>E; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://genome.cshlp.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1101/gr.247353.118/-/DC1">Supplemental Table 5</ext-link>). Minor differences in significantly regulated modifications were observed for the PTMs H4K20me2 and H4K20me3; this can be easily explained by the high hydrophilicity of the peptide carrying these PTMs (aa 20–23, KVLR), which ends up being poorly retained by LC and therefore its significance could not be assessed by nanoLC-MS/MS. Altogether, we implemented a simplified workflow for histone sample preparation combined with a high-throughput DI-MS analysis of histone peptides demonstrating highly comparable results with the current state-of-the-art method but with a throughput almost 100-fold higher.</p>

    <title>Discussion</title>
    <p>In this work, we presented the first attempt to analyze hundreds of histone PTMs in a single analysis using &lt;1-min direct injection into a mass spectrometer. The method has been optimized in many aspects, including acquisition parameters and controls for benchmarking the sample preparation. In the end, we demonstrate that this workflow achieves almost identical results to nanoLC-MS/MS, which is currently performed with at least 1-h LC gradients without considering sample loading and column equilibration (<xref rid="GR247353SIDC27" ref-type="bibr">Sidoli et al. 2015b</xref>).</p>
    <p>This approach aims to put a milestone into the high-throughput analysis of cell epigenomes. Histone PTMs play fundamental roles in “flagging” chromatin domains to prevent or promote gene expression, and thus their characterization is fundamental to understand development and disease. Large efforts have been already taken to map histone PTMs in large-scale; one important example is the GCP assay promoted by the LINCS Proteomic Characterization Center for Signaling and Epigenetics. However, to reach goals comparable to the achievements of the genomics community (1000 genomes per day), we need a high throughput at the scale presented in the current work. Our method exploits the fast speed of MS acquisition, highlighting how the real bottleneck in histone analysis is currently chromatographic separation. Running the samples for 1 min allowed the instrument to acquire three cycles of the same spectra, because each cycle lasts about 20 sec (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="GR247353SIDF6">Fig. 6</xref>A). With three cycles, the software EpiProfileLite can pick the spectra that have the most complete pattern of ions, discarding, e.g., if in one scan the signal was temporarily unstable. This does not happen routinely, but it is helpful as a precaution. We have tested and do not recommend performing scan averaging, as it unnecessarily slows the duty cycle without gaining extra sensitivity. This rapid analysis allows also for simple spotting of runs that require repetition; since the run has a fixed and small number of spectra, poor quality runs (e.g., in case of signal instability) are easily depicted by the smaller size of the raw file. A low signal leads to fewer signals in the MS and MS/MS spectra, which is reflected in the file size.</p>
    <p>Our method still has margins for improvement. For instance, the direct injection of histone peptides could benefit from the addition of supercharging agents, or a wiser or more accurate choice of buffers to maximize efficiency and spray stability, which now we cannot freely test due to the limitation of what is compatible with liquid chromatography. Occasionally, spray stability via direct injection can also be an issue. Thus, investing in this optimization could enhance the robustness of the overall workflow. Nevertheless, we observed a high reproducibility during injections (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://genome.cshlp.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1101/gr.247353.118/-/DC1">Supplemental Fig. 1F</ext-link>), indicating that the spray is stable for this type of repetitive injections.</p>
    <p>We do not exclude that our work will stimulate more efforts into the analysis or peptide mixtures of reduced complexity without the assistance of chromatographic separation. This is not a novelty, as proteomics can be performed by using MALDI sources, which do not have upfront chromatographic separation. However, it is a fact that the proteomics community largely relies on nanoLC-MS/MS to identify and quantify protein mixtures. Even though there is still a significant gap in sensitivity between direct injection and nanoLC-MS/MS, we are confident that future applications without the use of chromatography will be developed. Chromatography is currently the major cause of technical batch effects, as we also showed by presenting a much lower variation in multiple injections by DI-MS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="GR247353SIDF2">Fig. 2</xref>D).</p>
    <p>In conclusion, our goal is to introduce this experimental procedure as the new gold standard in histone analysis, as it has the potential to drastically reduce requirements of instrument time and to potentially eliminate the majority of batch effects caused by chromatographic separation.</p>

      <p>The derivatization and digestion were performed as previously described (<xref rid="GR247353SIDC28" ref-type="bibr">Sidoli et al. 2016a</xref>). Briefly, histones were dissolved in 20 µL of 50 mM NH<sub>4</sub>HCO<sub>3</sub>, pH 8.0. Derivatization reagent was prepared by mixing the sample with 5 µL of acetonitrile, followed by 5 µL of propionic anhydride and 14 µL of ammonium hydroxide (to balance the pH at 8.0) for 15 min at 37°C. This reaction was performed twice. Histones were then digested with trypsin (enzyme:sample ratio 1:20, 2 h, room temperature) in 50 mM NH<sub>4</sub>HCO<sub>3</sub>. Where specified, the derivatization reaction was performed again twice to derivatize peptide N-termini. Where specified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="GR247353SIDF3">Fig. 3</xref>D), only 1 µL of propionic anhydride was used instead of 5, and consequently only 1 µL of ammonium hydroxide instead of 14 µL to adjust the pH. To test overadjustment of pH, only 1 µL of propionic anhydride was used plus 5 µL of ammonium hydroxide instead of 1. Samples were desalted prior to DI-MS or nanoLC-MS/MS analysis by using in-house packed stage-tips. Stage-tips were manufactured by sealing a disk of C<sub>18</sub> material at the bottom of a P200 tip, followed by an equivalent of about 0.5 cm of Porous Graphitic Carbon resin (PGC, Hypercarb, Thermo Fisher Scientific) dissolved into acetonitrile. Stage-tips were equilibrated with 50 µL of water + 0.1% TFA, the sample was loaded after adding 1% TFA to the solution, the tips were washed twice with 30 µL of water + 0.1 FA, and elution was performed by using 30 µL of 60% acetonitrile + 0.1% FA. The full procedure was performed by centrifugation to force the solution through the tips with a SpeedVac Plus SC210A (Savant) without using the vacuum pump.</p>

NanoLC was configured with a 75 µm ID × 17 cm Reprosil-Pur C<sub>18</sub>-AQ (3 µm; Dr. Maisch GmbH) nano-column packed in-house using an EASY-nanoLC nanoHPLC (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The HPLC gradient was as follows: 2% to 28% solvent B (A = 0.1% formic acid; B = 80% MeCN, 0.1% formic acid) over 45 min, from 28% to 80% solvent B in 5 min, 80% B for 10 min at a flow-rate of 300 nL/min. nanoLC was coupled to an Orbitrap Fusion mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Data were acquired using a data-independent acquisition method, consisting of a full scan MS spectrum (<italic>m/z</italic> 300−1100) performed in the Orbitrap at 120,000 resolution (m/Δm for the ion at 200 <italic>m/z</italic>), followed by 16 MS/MS with windows of 50 <italic>m/z</italic> using HCD fragmentation and detected in the ion trap.

      <p>For DI-MS, samples were placed in a TriVersa NanoMate (Advion) and acquired either manually or by using a sequence coordinated with MS acquisition by a contact closure. The NanoMate was set up with a spray voltage of 1.7 kV and a gas pressure of 0.5 psi. Samples were acquired in the same Orbitrap Fusion (Thermo Fisher Scientific) as for nanoLC-MS/MS. All scans were acquired in the Orbitrap, at 240,000 resolution for the full MS and at 120,000 resolution for MS/MS.

      <title>Histone peptide quantification</title>
      <p>DIA data obtained from the nanoLC-MS/MS runs were searched using EpiProfile 2.0 (<xref rid="GR247353SIDC37" ref-type="bibr">Yuan et al. 2018</xref>). The peptide relative ratio was calculated using the total area under the extracted ion chromatograms of all peptides with the same amino acid sequence (including all of its modified forms) as 100%. For isobaric peptides, the relative ratio of two isobaric forms was estimated by averaging the ratio for each fragment ion with different mass between the two species. For DI-MS data, we modified the EpiProfile software and generated a new version named EpiProfileLite (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://genome.cshlp.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1101/gr.247353.118/-/DC1">Supplemental Code 1</ext-link>). In DI-MS, histone peptides are collected in MS scans, and isobaric peptides are collected in targeted preset MS/MS scans. EpiProfileLite reads the intensities from MS scans to calculate the percentage of all peptides with the same amino acid sequence. The unique fragment ions in the MS/MS scans are extracted to discriminate isobaric peptide intensities from the MS scans. EpiProfileLite is also available on GitHub at <uri xlink:href="https://github.com/zfyuan/EpiProfileLite">https://github.com/zfyuan/EpiProfileLite</uri>, including the user guide. For the analysis of the synthetic peptide library, we used EpiProfile (<xref rid="GR247353SIDC37" ref-type="bibr">Yuan et al. 2018</xref>) for the LC-MS runs and an in-house R script for the DI-MS runs (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://genome.cshlp.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1101/gr.247353.118/-/DC1">Supplemental Code 2</ext-link>). The R script consists of two custom functions based on MSnbase (<xref rid="GR247353SIDC11" ref-type="bibr">Gatto and Lilley 2012</xref>). Initially, the <italic>ms1PeakExtractor</italic> function takes an mzML file, extracts all spectra headers, filters them by MS1, and it extracts all candidate spectra from MS1.
