        <title>Background</title>
        <p id="Par1">Co-expression correlations provide the ability to predict gene functionality within specific biological contexts, such as different tissue and disease conditions. However, current gene co-expression databases generally do not consider biological context. In addition, these tools often implement a limited range of unsophisticated analysis approaches, diminishing their utility for exploring gene functionality and gene relationships. Furthermore, they typically do not provide the summary visualizations necessary to communicate these results, posing a significant barrier to their utilization by biologists without computational skills.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>Results</title>
        <p id="Par2">We present Correlation AnalyzeR, a user-friendly web interface for exploring co-expression correlations and predicting gene functions, gene–gene relationships, and gene set topology. Correlation AnalyzeR provides flexible access to its database of tissue and disease-specific (cancer vs normal) genome-wide co-expression correlations, and it also implements a suite of sophisticated computational tools for generating functional predictions with user-friendly visualizations. In the usage example provided here, we explore the role of <italic>BRCA1-NRF2</italic> interplay in the context of bone cancer, demonstrating how Correlation AnalyzeR can be effectively implemented to generate and support novel hypotheses.</p>

    <title>Background</title>
    <p id="Par22">Almost two decades after the completion of the Human Genome Project, the functionality of many genes remains largely enigmatic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Many such “enigmatic genes” have immense biological significance, exemplified by the associations of thousands with cancer outcome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Even genes which are well-characterized often play unexpected roles in different biological contexts (e.g., <italic>EZH2</italic> is both a tumor-suppressor and an oncogene in different cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]). Gene co-expression correlations provide a robust methodology for predicting gene function, as genes which share a biological process are often co-regulated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Similar insights can be gained from using protein interaction (for example STRING [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] and InterologFinder [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]), phenome data, or even the combination of both [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Irrespective, generating expression data remains a cost-effective approach and co-expression analysis remains a prominent tool for exploratory systemic evaluation, largely because it is capable of considering gene co-expression across the genome. However, the applications which have been developed for such inference are hampered by key limitations. Tools like COXPRESdb [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] and GeneFriends [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] calculate gene set over-representation on an arbitrary number of co-expressed genes. Alternatively, GeneMANIA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] and GIANT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] construct co-expression networks and calculate gene set over-representation on an arbitrary number of nodes. Neither approach is sensitive to the genome-wide distribution of co-expression correlations or, with the exception of GIANT, differences between tissue/disease conditions. Furthermore, these functional predictions are limited in scope and do not generate relevant, user-friendly visualizations, limiting their utility for biologists without bioinformatics skills.</p>
    <p id="Par23">Recently, Lachmann et al. introduced ARCHS4, a database with thousands of standardized RNA-Seq datasets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. We re-processed these data, calculating co-expression correlations with respect to tissue and disease (cancer/normal) condition and provided the results in a publicly accessible database. We now present <italic>Correlation AnalyzeR</italic>, a user-friendly interface to this co-expression database with a suite of tools for <italic>de-novo</italic> prediction of gene function, gene–gene relationships, and biologically relevant gene subgroups to facilitate discovery of novel relationships within genes of interest.</p>

      <p id="Par24">We have provided the source code for the <italic>correlationAnalyzeR</italic> R package and the <italic>Correlation AnalyzeR</italic> web application for public use. All preprocessing scripts, custom regex dictionaries, and scripts for generating any figures not generated by Correlation AnalyzeR can be found in the <italic>misc/</italic> directory of the correlationAnalyzeR repository.

      <title>ARCHS4 data source</title>
      <p id="Par25">Re-processed RNA-Sequencing counts were generated by the authors of the ARCHS4 repository [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. This data source comprises standardized counts across 238,522 human sequencing samples (ARCHS4 v8, Feb 2020) generated from the Illumina HiSeq 2000, HiSeq 2500, or NextSeq 500 platforms. Each sample has a corresponding entry in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database, complete with a tissue description, among other metadata categories.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="Sec5">
      <title>Generation of tissue- and disease-specific correlation data from RNA-Seq counts</title>
      <p id="Par26">We downloaded read counts and metadata from ARCHS4 and pre-processed them with custom R scripts in multiple stages:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par27">Categorization</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par28">Filtering</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par29">Normalization, transformation, and correlation calculation</p></list-item></list></p>

    </sec>
    <sec id="Sec6">
      <title>Sample categorization</title>
      <p id="Par31">We categorized samples based on their tissue descriptions from GEO, using a manually curated regex dictionary in conjunction with the Cellosaurus ontology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. For example, the terms “^pfc$” and “\bstriatum\b” positively identify brain samples with high specificity. However, we also implemented a logical matching system that could rule out an incorrect mapping which arises from term ambiguity. For example, brain samples are positively identified by “cortex”. However, since this could also refer to the kidney, brain samples are also negatively matched to the “kidney” term. This means that the brain label might be applied if “cortex”, but not “kidney”, is found in that sample’s tissue description in the GEO database. Category assignments were checked for sanity via manual inspection of randomized samples and the regex dictionary was adjusted accordingly when mistakes were noted. We assigned sample disease status using a manually curated dictionary of disease-related regex terms. Cancer, but not other diseases, was readily identifiable from available sample metadata, allowing classification of samples into <italic>cancer</italic> and <italic>normal</italic> (non-cancer) groups.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="Sec7">
      <title>Dataset filtering</title>
      <p id="Par32">We filtered the read count data using a three-step procedure:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par33">Single cell RNA-Seq (scRNA-Seq) samples were identified from the GEO metadata using a custom regex dictionary and removed because of the demonstrated unsuitability of single cell data for co-expression network inference by Pearson correlation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par34">Samples with fewer than 5 million raw read counts were discarded to improve the quality of gene co-expression calculations by reducing noise from low-quality samples [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par35">Tissue-disease groups with fewer than 30 distinct samples were removed to limit the effects of bias from individual samples and improve the performance of co-expression calculations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p></list-item></list></p>
      <p id="Par36">The final set of filtered and labeled samples along with original tissue descriptions from GEO, number of reads aligned to the genome, GEO sample IDs, and GEO Series IDs is provided here (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Table S1).</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="Sec8">
      <title>Normalization, transformation, and correlation calculation</title>
      <p id="Par37">We normalized and transformed the count data in a single step using the <italic>vst</italic> function of the <italic>DESeq2</italic> R package [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. This function first calculates sample geometric means, estimates dispersions for each gene, fits a mean-dispersion trend, and then transforms the data to make it homoscedastic. Then, we calculated gene–gene Pearson correlations separately for each tissue-disease group using the <italic>cor</italic> function of the <italic>WGCNA</italic> package [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Each correlation matrix row was subsequently transformed into a string of comma-separated values, uploaded to an Azure MySQL server, and indexed for rapid query. The VST counts were also uploaded to the MySQL database.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="Sec9">
      <title>Comparison of Pearson and Spearman correlation methods</title>
      <p id="Par38">Due to the assumptions made by Pearson correlation about linear relationships between continuous features, it was important to compare it to a correlation method that can find non-linear, monotonic relationships, for which the Spearman method was a logical choice. To test these correlation methods, we obtained the “Hallmark” collection from the Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB) v7.2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], via the <italic>msigdbr</italic> R package [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. This collection was curated using a combination of unsupervised learning, manual curation, and independent validation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. The gene sets in this database are known to be both co-expressed and functionally related [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], indicating that a suitable co-expression metric for Correlation AnalyzeR should be capable of recognizing them as correlated. Then, we performed a permutation experiment with 2832 simulations in which each involved randomly selecting a “Hallmark” gene set and then randomly selecting a gene pair within that gene set. For each selected gene pair, the Pearson and Spearman correlation was calculated using the VST-transformed expression values for those genes and the <italic>cor</italic> function. The distribution of correlation values was compared using a one-tailed t-test based on the hypothesis that Pearson would prove more effective. We also used the difference between the Pearson and Spearman coefficients to identify the top Pearson-specific and Spearman-specific gene pairs. The results of this analysis are found in the <italic>Choice of Pearson correlation</italic> subsection of the <italic>Discussion</italic>.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="Sec10">
      <title>Validation of correlation values with external databases</title>
      <p id="Par39">To validate our correlation values, we compared them to ARCHS4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], COXPRESdb [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], and GeneFriends [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. For three genes (<italic>BRCA1</italic>, <italic>AURKB</italic>, and <italic>HSP90AA1</italic>), genome-wide correlations were downloaded from each service. Of note, we derived the Correlation AnalyzeR correlations from all tissues and disease conditions so that they would be comparable with these external databases. We calculated and visualized the Spearman correlation between databases using the <italic>PerformanceAnalytics</italic> R package [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. The top 500 correlations for each gene were also compared to the list of protein interactors for that gene (BioGRID) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. We calculated the overlap between correlations and protein interactors, assessing significance with the hypergeometric test from the R <italic>phyper</italic> function and visualizing the overlap using the <italic>VennDiagram</italic> R package [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. The results of this analysis are found in the <italic>Comparison with existing datasets</italic> subsection of the <italic>Discussion</italic>.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="Sec11">
      <title>Correlation AnalyzeR</title>
      <p id="Par40">The <italic>Correlation AnalyzeR</italic> application is written in the R language [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] and can be accessed conveniently through a user-friendly web interface written in <italic>R-Shiny</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] [<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://gccri.bishop-lab.uthscsa.edu/correlation-analyzer/">http://gccri.bishop-lab.uthscsa.edu/correlation-analyzer/</ext-link>] or installed locally as an R package [<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/Bishop-Laboratory/correlationAnalyzeR">https://github.com/Bishop-Laboratory/correlationAnalyzeR</ext-link>]. Correlation AnalyzeR contains methods for retrieving tissue- and disease-specific co-expression correlations and implements four main modes of analysis:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par41">Single gene</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par42">Gene versus gene</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par43">Gene versus gene list</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par44">Gene list topology</p></list-item></list></p>

    <sec id="Sec12">
      <title>Single gene</title>
      <p id="Par45"><italic>Single gene</italic> mode (called by the <italic>analyzeSingleGenes</italic> function within the R-package implementation) is the cornerstone of the Correlation AnalyzeR approach to gene function prediction. For any gene of interest in any tissue-disease group, this method rapidly retrieves genome-wide correlations and infers gene function using a custom implementation of <italic>Gene Set Enrichment Analysis</italic> (GSEA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. GSEA is classically utilized to determine the top differentially expressed pathways between two conditions. Our approach, termed <italic>corGSEA</italic>, leverages genome-wide Pearson correlations as a ranking metric for the GSEA algorithm to determine the gene sets correlated with a gene of interest. Of note, the implementation of GSEA used here is the “pre-ranked” method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. The results of corGSEA provide novel insights into the functions of a gene within various tissue and disease contexts. This approach also leverages a light-weight implementation of GSEA, <italic>fGSEA</italic>, that benefits from an approximate 10 × speed increase compared to the original algorithm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. The Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB) v7.2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], accessed via the msigdbr R package [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], provides the annotations used by corGSEA. Finally, there is a second analysis mode within <xref rid="Sec21" ref-type="sec"><italic>Single gene</italic> mode</xref>, called <italic>Group mode</italic>.

      <p id="Par46"><italic>Gene versus gene</italic> mode (called by the <italic>analyzeGenePairs</italic> function within the R-package implementation) predicts the differences between any two genes, tissue types, and cancer vs normal conditions using genome-wide Pearson correlations and corGSEA-derived gene set enrichment. For example, an analysis of two different genes with the same tissue or disease condition would proceed as follows: for each gene, genome-wide correlations are retrieved and corGSEA is calculated using the <italic>analyzeSingleGenes</italic> function. For each of the two genes queried, the variance between each of their gene correlations (Pearson’s R) is calculated (using the <italic>rowVars</italic> function from the <italic>matrixStats</italic> package [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]), thus revealing the top diverging co-expression correlations between the two genes of interest. The same approach is applied to find the top diverging corGSEA results between the two genes, using the variance of the normalized enrichment score (NES) as the metric. <italic>Group</italic> mode is also available in <italic>Gene versus gene mode,</italic> allowing users to return the gene versus gene correlations across tissue-disease groups (automatically applied when gene one is different from gene two), or cancer versus normal correlations across tissue groups (automatically applied when gene one is the same as gene two).</p>

      <title>Single gene mode</title>
      <p id="Par54">A primary area of research in the cancer field is understanding the way in which normal tissue processes are hijacked and dysregulated in a cancer context. Therefore, we began the present analysis by using the <italic>Group Mode</italic> feature of Single Gene mode to assess BRCA1 co-expression correlations across normal tissue types (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S1). Interestingly, it was found that the highest expression of <italic>BRCA1</italic> occurs in <italic>prenatal</italic> tissues (e.g., embryos, morula, fetal tissues etc.) (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S1A). This echoes previous findings which showed that <italic>BRCA1</italic> is an essential gene during many aspects of development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. Furthermore, the interactive heatmap provided by this analysis revealed the top 100 genes that are consistently co-correlated with <italic>BRCA1</italic> across tissue groups (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S1B). When analyzed with gene set over-representation analysis, the co-correlated genes were revealed to belong to processes previously connected with <italic>BRCA1</italic> biology, including several pathways related to cell cycle progression and cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>] (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S1C). Interestingly, the second most significant gene set was “Pujana Brca2 PCC Network”, a collection of genes which are co-expressed with BRCA2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. This suggested a co-expression relationship between <italic>BRCA1</italic> and <italic>BRCA2</italic> in a normal tissue context. To further elucidate this relationship, we utilized the <italic>analyzeGenePairs</italic> function of the Correlation AnalyzeR R package to compare the expression of <italic>BRCA1</italic> and <italic>BRCA2</italic> across normal samples (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S2B), finding that they are highly co-expressed. Additionally, given that <italic>BRCA1</italic> showed a consistent co-expression with genes related to cancer, it was unsurprising to find that <italic>BRCA1</italic> (and <italic>BRCA2</italic>) were both more highly correlated and more highly expressed in cancer samples when compared to normal samples (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S2A, S2C).</p>
      <p id="Par55">To gain additional insight into the functionality of <italic>BRCA1</italic> in bone cancers, we used single gene mode to analyze the co-expression correlations in this tissue context (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). The analysis results reveal the genome-wide co-expressions and their corGSEA enrichment within a user-friendly and interactive interface (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). The interface displays a histogram of genome-wide correlation values (Pearson’s R and associated p value) with a linked data table for interactive exploration (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a).

However, no studies to date have examined a similar role for <italic>FANCI</italic> in other bone cancers, indicating a promising, unexplored line of experimental inquiry. Furthermore, the top <italic>BRCA1</italic> corGSEA results (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b) predicted several well-established biological roles and relationships of <italic>BRCA1</italic>, such as its transcription by E2F transcription factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. Interestingly, this analysis also suggested functionalities for BRCA1 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b) which have only been recently uncovered, such as its role in regulating <italic>EGFR</italic> signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>], but which have not yet been elucidated in the context of bone cancers. Finally, it was confirmed that expression of <italic>BRCA1</italic> in a bone cancer context is strongly correlated with markers of Ewing sarcoma genomic instability (“Ferreira Ewing Sarcoma Unstable vs Stable Up") [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>] (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>c), as predicted by the previous evidence of Ewing sarcoma <italic>BRCA1</italic> sequestration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>].</p>

Given the recently documented interplay between BRCA1 and NRF2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>], the tissue-specific correlation between <italic>BRCA1</italic> and <italic>NQO1</italic> may indicate that this <italic>BRCA1/NRF2</italic> interplay is also tissue-specific. Furthermore, it indicates a potential consequence of <italic>BRCA1</italic>-deficiency in bone cancers in the differential regulation of the <italic>NRF2</italic> pathway, a pathway with important roles in antioxidant responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>], drug resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>] and metastasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>].</p>

However, it is not known whether this association between <italic>BRCA1</italic> overexpression in cancer vs normal would be found for other tissue types.

Considering this result and our prior observation that <italic>BRCA1</italic> has a tissue-specific co-expression correlation with <italic>NQO1</italic> (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S2B) we decided to further evaluate the <italic>BRCA1-NQO1</italic> relationship.

Because co-expression correlation aims to identify biologically relevant covariance relationships that are not due to technical factors, it is important to remove the mean–variance trend. Therefore, we transformed the matrix using the variance-stabilizing transform [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], as is recommended by the authors of the prominent gene co-expression correlation network analysis package “WGCNA” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>].</p>

      <title>Choice of Pearson correlation</title>
      <p id="Par67">Several correlation approaches were considered, including Spearman and Pearson. A large body of discussion is available regarding the strengths and weaknesses of each for various applications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>]. In general, Pearson correlation is designed to observe linear relationships, whereas Spearman correlation is designed to observe any monotonic relationships [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>]. Because of this, Pearson is a useful tool for finding genes which are covariant, providing a biologically interpretable understanding of their relationship. Relationships which are monotonic and non-linear, while potentially meaningful, are often difficult to interpret because of the wide range of patterns which can constitute monotonic correlation. Additionally, Pearson correlation is already implemented as a standard approach in gene co-expression studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>], making results widely comparable. In particular, Pearson correlation is the basis for similar tools such as COXPRESdb [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], ARCHS4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], and GeneFriends [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p>
      <p id="Par68">Using an empirical approach that incorporates prior knowledge about gene–gene relationships, we tested the performance of both Pearson and Spearman correlation methods (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S6). Because the purpose of Correlation AnalyzeR is to predict functional relationships, we tested whether Pearson or Spearman methods were better capable of predicting relationships between genes that belong to the same gene set within the MSigDB “Hallmark” collection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. We found that the correlation metrics typically agreed, but that there was a significantly greater correlation estimation by Pearson compared to Spearman (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S6), indicating the better sensitivity of Pearson correlation for these biologically meaningful relationships. Additionally, when examining the gene pairs which showed the greatest specificity for Pearson or Spearman correlation, it was found that there was a noticeable tendency for the Spearman method to under-estimate tissue-specific relationships and to over-estimate non-linear relationships which defy simple interpretation. This pattern was exemplified by the top Pearson-specific gene pair (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S7A), <italic>MYL3</italic>-<italic>TCAP</italic> (selected from the “HALLMARK_MYOGENESIS” gene set). Considering the specificity of this gene pair for muscle tissue, it was unsurprising to see that the strongest expression of both genes occurred in samples with “muscle” and “cardiac” tissue labels (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S7A). However, while the Pearson correlation for this pair was 0.776, the Spearman correlation was only 0.189, exemplifying the sensitivity of the Pearson method to tissue-specific gene relationships. Conversely, the top Spearman-specific gene pair (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S7B) was <italic>TFF2</italic>-<italic>IL12B</italic> from the “HALLMARK_KRAS_SIGNALING_DN” gene set, a set of genes which are downregulated by KRAS signaling. While the Spearman correlation was calculated to be 0.323, visual inspection of the plot indicates that there is not a discernable relationship (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S7B). The Pearson coefficient for that same gene pair was 0.085, indicating that the Pearson method was more specific in this case. Taken together, these findings indicate the suitability of Pearson correlation in this context.</p>

      <title>Comparison with existing datasets</title>
      <p id="Par69">To ensure the validity of the co-expression results generated by <italic>Correlation AnalyzeR</italic>, genome-wide correlations for several genes (<italic>BRCA1</italic>, <italic>AURKB</italic>, and <italic>HSP90AA1</italic>) were calculated across all tissue and disease types. The top 500 co-expressed genes for each were compared to a large database of protein interactors (BioGRID) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. The overlap of co-expressed genes and protein interactors was highly significant in each case (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S8A, S8C, and S8E). Furthermore, the genome-wide distribution of co-expression correlations for each gene was also compared with existing co-expression databases COXPRESdb [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], ARCHS4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], and GeneFriends [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. As expected, a high degree of similarity was observed (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S8B, S8D, and S8F). These results indicate the congruency of <italic>Correlation AnalyzeR</italic> co-expression correlations with both protein interactome data and independent co-expression databases.</p>

    <sec id="Sec30">
      <title>Limitations</title>
      <p id="Par70">While Correlation AnalyzeR provides multiple useful tools for inferring functional relationships from gene co-expression data, it is limited by several methodological and usability issues that will be addressed in future development.</p>
      <p id="Par71">One of the primary methodological limitations of this approach is the use of “flat” labels for tissue and disease types. While these labels provide a measure of convenience and allow the use of pre-calculated co-expression matrices, they cannot resolve the important biological relationships which are only revealed within subpopulations of samples. For example, “Breast Cancer” is a broad category which contains important subtypes, such as “triple-negative breast cancer”. A superior approach may be to implement a hierarchical tissue labeling scheme with automated annotation, such as MetaSRA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>]. This would allow for the characterization of co-expression relationships at multiple levels, from whole organs to specific cellular states. While challenging to implement due to the computational limitations inherent in calculating and storing co-expression matrices, it is still a promising future direction of development.</p>
      <p id="Par72">Another limitation of this approach is the use of Pearson correlation alone for exploring gene relationships. While linear correlations are beneficial from the standpoint of interpretation, there are additional valid approaches that show robust consistency and interpretability, such as biweight midcorrelation, Kendall, and Hoeffding’s D measure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>]. While difficult to implement currently, a future direction of development for Correlation AnalyzeR will be to incorporate results from these correlation methods as well.</p>
      <p id="Par73">Another limitation of note is the “mean-correlation relationship”, a phenomena described in a recent preprint by <italic>Wang </italic>et al<italic>.,</italic> which refers to the tendency of gene co-expression correlation values to grow with the mean expression of the two genes under consideration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>]. This phenomenon represents a significant challenge for all co-expression studies and could introduce a systemic bias into the corGSEA method because it is reliant on ranking genes by correlation values. Further development of Correlation AnalyzeR will focus on testing and mitigating this trend by implementing normalization approaches, such as “Spatial Quantile Normalization” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>], which are designed to remove it.</p>
      <p id="Par74">Finally, one of the primary emerging applications for co-expression correlation analysis is single-cell RNA-Sequencing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>]. Currently, Correlation AnalyzeR explicitly removes all single cell datasets from consideration due to concerns regarding the suitability of Pearson correlation in sparse data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. A primary future direction for Correlation AnalyzeR will be to incorporate methods for single-cell co-expression inference using emerging methods designed for that purpose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>].</p>

    <title>Conclusion</title>
    <p id="Par75">Few gene co-expression correlation databases exist. Those currently available utilize a limited range of computational approaches for gene function prediction and, with the exception of GIANT, do not consider the impact of tissue and disease on co-expression. Furthermore, none exist which consider the genome-wide distribution of correlation values or provide gene comparison and gene list topology analysis. By implementing these methods, <italic>Correlation AnalyzeR</italic> provides users the opportunity to perform exploratory analyses of poorly characterized genes and uncover novel gene relationships. Additionally, current methods do not typically provide user-friendly summary tables or figures, necessitating the user possess some degree of bioinformatics skill. Correlation AnalyzeR provides high quality summary figures and tables within a flexible and user-friendly interface. These features were exemplified by our analysis of <italic>BRCA1-NRF2</italic> interplay in the context of bone cancers. In summary, Correlation AnalyzeR is a user-friendly database and web application which can reveal new gene functionalities and support the generation of novel biological hypotheses.</p>
