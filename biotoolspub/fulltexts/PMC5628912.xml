      <p>Metabolic
analyses generally fall into two classes: unbiased metabolomic
analyses and analyses that are targeted toward specific metabolites.
Both techniques have been revolutionized by the advent of mass spectrometers
with detectors that afford high mass accuracy and resolution, such
as time-of-flights (TOFs) and Orbitraps. One particular area where
this technology is key is in the field of metabolic flux analysis
because the resolution of these spectrometers allows for discrimination
between <sup>13</sup>C-containing isotopologues and those containing <sup>15</sup>N or other isotopes. While XCMS-based software is freely
available for untargeted analysis of mass spectrometric data sets,
it does not always identify metabolites of interest in a targeted
assay. Furthermore, there is a paucity of vendor-independent software
that deals with targeted analyses of metabolites and of isotopologues
in particular. Here, we present AssayR, an R package that takes high
resolution wide-scan liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry
(LC-MS) data sets and tailors peak detection for each metabolite through
a simple, iterative user interface. It automatically integrates peak
areas for all isotopologues and outputs extracted ion chromatograms
(EICs), absolute and relative stacked bar charts for all isotopologues,
and a .csv data file. We demonstrate several examples where AssayR
provides more accurate and robust quantitation than XCMS, and we propose
that tailored peak detection should be the preferred approach for
targeted assays. In summary, AssayR provides easy and robust targeted
metabolite and stable isotope analyses on wide-scan data sets from
high resolution mass spectrometers.</p>

  <p id="sec1">The goal of an untargeted metabolomic
experiment is usually to identify metabolites that have changed with
the greatest significance or magnitude between two or more experimental
conditions. A typical untargeted mass spectrometric experiment usually
follows a well-defined workflow, using proprietary or open source
software (e.g., XCMS,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>−<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref></sup> mzMine<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref></sup>) to give a list of features that
can be quantified and matched to a database to yield probable or verified
metabolite identifications. This approach was recently extended to
include untargeted identification of stable isotope fluxes using the
elegant X13CMS software tool.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref></sup> In contrast,
a targeted metabolite experiment is one in which specific metabolites
must be identified with high confidence in all samples (where detectable),
and this requires prioritization of different analytical parameters.
Existing targeted workflows based upon XCMS do exist,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref></sup> but the enforcement of a single set of global peak detection
parameters is a limitation that can lead to missed peaks or inaccurate
quantitation. Some peaks are simply not found, particularly with mixed
mode hydrophilic liquid interaction (HILIC) chromatography where peaks
can be broad and of irregular shape. Furthermore, this approach suffers
serious limitation in the analysis of stable isotope tracing experiments
because isotopologues are treated as distinct features during the
peak detection stage when they should be detected in concert. This
also impacts upon data output, since isotopologues are not grouped
together and must therefore be further processed to yield the isotopic
composition of each metabolite.</p>
  <p>Targeted metabolic analysis
has traditionally required less postacquisition
analysis because the preferred instrument for such experiments has
been the triple quadrupole mass spectrometer, and the combination
of precursor and product <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> ions
specified at the point of data acquisition is tied to a specific metabolite.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref></sup> With this strategy, metabolite identification
is primarily a preacquisition issue rather than a postacquisition
one. Adding a metabolite tracer into such an analysis, however, necessitates
the addition of MRM (multiple reaction monitoring) transitions for
each expected isotopologue, and this yields a complexity of acquisition
that is not desirable, quickly limiting the number of metabolites
that can be measured. The problem of acquisition complexity is even
more pronounced if isotopic tracers are used that contain more than
one heavy isotope (e.g., <sup>13</sup>C<sub>5</sub>, <sup>15</sup>N<sub>2</sub>-glutamine). It is in this context that the new generation
of high resolution, accurate mass spectrometers excel because relatively
standard wide scan methods can be used for data acquisition, yet many
metabolites and their isotopologues can subsequently be separated
and quantified through data analysis approaches.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref></sup></p>
  <p>We set several criteria for an ideal software tool
that can take
high resolution, high mass accuracy data from any mass spectrometer
and return peak integrals for specific metabolites and their isotopologues.
These criteria are (a) robust peak detection taking into account all
isotopologues, (b) a simple, optional quality control curation step
for all peaks prior to quantitation, (c) reporting of values for separate
(including split) peaks where more than one is found that could be
attributed to a single metabolite, (d) reporting of values and bar
charts for grouped isotopologues, and (e) an interface that is easy
and intuitive to use. Here, we present AssayR, an R package<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref></sup> that fulfills the above criteria (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref></xref>). Using data obtained on a
ThermoScientific Q Exactive mass spectrometer, we demonstrate outputs
from XCMS and AssayR that reveal more accurate and robust quantitation
of analytes in AssayR.</p>

      <p>MRC5 primary human

      <title>Extracted Ion Chromatogram
Generation and Peak Detection</title>
      <p>A more detailed description
accompanies the R package code, which
is available at <uri xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://gitlab.com/jimiwills/assay.R">https://gitlab.com/jimiwills/assay.R</uri>. Briefly, a row from the configuration table (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>), representing an analyte, is read and the
configured mz ranges (combining <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic>, ppm, and isotope settings) are extracted from mzML files via the
mzR package. Interpolation is used to standardize the retention times
across these chromatograms, and the maximal chromatographic profile
is taken forward for peak detection. This means that a peak only needs
to be present in a single sample for a single isotope for that peak
to be detected and measured across the whole context. The use of combined
isotopologues (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref></xref>A) for metabolite peak identification is particularly important when
a mix of labeled and unlabeled samples are analyzed or for samples
where the labeling in a given metabolite is saturated, and therefore,
the monoisotopic <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> value would
be inappropriate for metabolite peak identification.</p>

      </fig>
      <p>The retention time minimum and maximum from the
configuration table
are used to select a region of the chromatogram on which peak detection
will be performed. A Mexican hat filter is used with the filter function
in R to translate the chromatogram and to set start and end indices
for each detected peak. The indices are used to define the range to
be summed to generate peak area measurements for each chromatogram.
Individual peaks are marked (in blue), where more than one peak is
identified within a metabolite retention time window; the peaks are
separated and shaded in different colors (e.g., green/yellow for 2
peaks; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref></xref>C),
to assist with peak curation. The interactive peak picking procedure
then allows simple alteration of detection parameters through an intuitive
query-based format. Alteration of the width of the Mexican hat (“seconds”
column in the config file) enables most peaks to be picked, even when
the chromatography is poor, such as when measuring glucose on a ZIC-pHILIC
column (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref></xref>B).
Split peaks can also be selected as a single metabolite or two peaks
by alteration of the hat width (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref></xref>C). The minimum and maximum <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> values, the hat filter width, and the peak detection threshold
are all updated during the interactive peak picking process. Once
the user is satisfied with the result, the updated parameters are
written back to the configuration file (e.g., Final config file in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>) and the peak areas
are saved for output in the data .csv file.</p>

      <title>Output</title>
      <p>The primary
output from AssayR is a .csv file
with samples separated by column and metabolites/isotopologues separated
by row. Images of the extracted ion chromatograms generated during
peak detection are exported for recording metabolite identification
and quality control: these images are generated even when the software
is run without interactive peak curation. Stacked bar charts of absolute
and relative peak intensity are produced for each metabolite, allowing
quick and easy visualization of the data. These reveal variance between
samples and allow for quick identification of possible outlier samples
(as outlined below). A representative analysis of <sup>13</sup>C<sub>6</sub>-glucose tracing in primary human fibroblasts is presented

    <title>Comparison with XCMS</title>
    <p>A popular chromatographic approach in metabolomics is the use of
ZIC-pHILIC columns at high pH<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref></sup> because
they capture a wide range of metabolites, including most of the organic
acids of central carbon metabolism. However, the chromatographic performance
of these matrices can be poor, especially in comparison to reversed-phase
chromatographic approaches. Variability in peak shape can be pronounced
as some metabolites can interact with the matrix in more than one
way, and this can lead to spread (e.g., glucose in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref></xref>B) or separated peaks. This
variability can be more pronounced if methanol is used during sample
loading due to additional surface effects of the solvent. Using the
metabolomic data set from MRC5 primary human fibroblasts pulsed with <sup>13</sup>C<sub>6</sub>-glucose, we analyzed glycolytic and related
metabolites with AssayR (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref></xref>) and XCMS. As described above, the chromatography
of glucose is poor and XCMS did not pick any of the isotopologues,
whereas AssayR showed almost full labeling in all samples (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref></xref>A). While fructose
6-phosphate was well resolved and accurately picked by both packages,
the monoisotopic glucose 6-phosphate peak had an overlapping isobaric
peak with slightly later retention time (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref></xref>B). During the peak detection stage in AssayR,
it was clear that these were mixed metabolites because some of the
extracted ion chromatograms (EICs) matched the first peak only whereas
some matched both peaks (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref></xref>B). AssayR was set up to resolve these peaks, but XCMS
picked them together.</p>
    <fig id="fig5" position="float">
      <label>Figure 5</label>
      <caption>
        <p>Comparison of AssayR with XCMS. (A) Peaks that fail the

    </fig>
    <p>The stacked bar plots in AssayR revealed that the later peak
was
unlabeled, whereas the earlier peak (glucose 6-phosphate) was predominantly
labeled. Due to the analysis of mixed metabolites, XCMS underestimated
the labeling of glucose 6-phosphate and gave a high variance (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref></xref>B). A third problem
was noticed with the quantitation of <sup>13</sup>C incorporation
into citrate/isocitrate. Comparison of the stacked bar plots revealed
that the third sample in the 60 min time point (sample 6) was different
from the other two, showing lower <sup>13</sup>C<sub>2</sub> abundance
(<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref></xref>C). Examination
of the individual EICs and RT over which they were integrated revealed
that XCMS had only picked part of the peak in sample 6 (red area of
EIC), and therefore, this isotopologue was underrepresented in the
analysis. This type of error cannot occur in AssayR because integration
occurs over a fixed RT window for all isotopologues. Thus, we present
data that strongly support the use of tailored peak detection for
the quantitation of specific metabolites in wide scan high resolution
LC-MS data sets.</p>

    <title>Conclusion</title>
    <p>AssayR is an open source
platform-agnostic R package that enables
straightforward analysis of high resolution mass spectrometric data
sets for targeted analyses, particularly those involving stable isotope
tracers. The increasing availability of high resolution mass spectrometers
renders this a timely addition to the analytical capability of investigators
studying metabolic pathways. While common preference for the reliability
and quantitative capability of triple-quadrupole mass spectrometers
will not be displaced in the immediate future by high resolution spectrometers,
the versatility of the postacquisition approach afforded by the latter
is a very good match for stable isotope labeling studies. AssayR enables
