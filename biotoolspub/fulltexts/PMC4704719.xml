      <p>The reference single nucleotide polymorphism (rs) ID in dbSNP (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/SNP/">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/SNP/</ext-link>) is a key resource identifier, which
is widely used in human genetics and genomics studies. However, its application is
often complicated by the varied IDs of different versions. Here, we developed a
user-friendly tool, SNPTracker, for comprehensively tracking and unifying the rs IDs
and genomic coordinates of massive sequence variants at a time. It worked perfectly,
and had much higher accuracy and capacity than two alternative utilities in our
proof-of-principle examples. SNPTracker will greatly facilitate genetic data exchange
and integration in the postgenome-wide association study era.</p>

<body>
  <p>The dbSNP database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/SNP/">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/SNP/</ext-link>) is a standard resource for genetic and
genomic studies in which the sequence variants, most of which are single nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs), are identified by RefSnp (rs) ID number (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Sherry <italic>et al.</italic> 1999</xref>). The rs ID system provides a very
convenient way for geneticists to exchange data and knowledge. However, the dbSNP rs IDs of
sequence variants were updated frequently by merging redundant ones and removing
falsely-discovered ones. This is particularly true when high throughput genotyping
technologies are being used widely (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Kitts <italic>et
al.</italic> 2014</xref>). So a sequence variant may have multiple different rs IDs
in different bioinformatics databases and genetics datasets. This issue is complicating
annotation, data merging and exchange of sequence variants in genetic and genomic
analyses.</p>
  <p>To our knowledge, there have been two tools for updating the rs IDs of sequence variants by
batch, LiftRsNumber (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Zhan 2011</xref>) and <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">dbSNP Batch Query (2005)</xref>. LiftRsNumber was developed
to convert dbSNP rs IDs over different versions for genetic analyses in 2011. It should be
noted that dbSNP has enlarged substantially in the past 4 years, during which many
sequence variants were merged and deleted once or multiple times. Because LiftRsNumber has
not been updated since 2011, it may not adequately consider the emerging complexity of the
rs ID system. In addition, as LiftRsNumber was originally an internal tool that used
resources only from its developers’ server, users have to modify its source codes to
adopt new resource datasets. This is inconvenient and difficult for many users. In
contrast, <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">dbSNP Batch Query (2005)</xref> is a convenient
online tool. However, it cannot process a batch with over 30,000 SNPs, making it infeasible
for a genome-wide association study (GWAS), or whole genome sequencing dataset. Besides, it
does not output data in a format recognizable by a popular genetic analysis tool
(<italic>e.g.</italic>, PLINK; <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Purcell <italic>et
al.</italic> 2007</xref>), and cannot flexibly retrieve rs IDs by genomic
coordinates. So, <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">dbSNP Batch Query (2005)</xref> is
actually far from convenient in many scenarios.</p>
  <p>In the present study, we developed an accurate and convenient standalone utility, named
SNPTracker, for efficiently tracking and unifying dbSNP rs IDs and genomic coordinates of
massive sequence variants for further genetic and genomic analyses. We also compared the
accuracy and coverage of SNPTracker with those of LiftRsNumber (Accessed in April 2015) and
<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">dbSNP Batch Query (Accessed in April 2015)</xref>.</p>
  <sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s1">
    <title>Materials and Methods</title>
    <p>SNPTracker is built upon an algorithm for comprehensively converting the previous rs IDs
into the latest ones by using three dbSNP resource datasets, RsMergeArch, SNPHistory and
SNPChrPosOnRef from dbSNP (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Sherry <italic>et
al.</italic> 1999</xref>). The RsMergeArch dataset records all SNP merging events
of rs IDs in dbSNP. It contains three types of rs IDs of a variant, the early version ID
(rsLow), the later version ID (rsHigh), and the current ID (rsCurrent). In a merging
event, dbSNP always merges the rsHigh ID to the rsLow one. The SNPHistory dataset
contains variants that have been deleted in dbSNP. The SNPChrPosOnRef dataset includes
chromosomes and genomic coordinates of all known variants in dbSNP. The process is
separated into two main parts, data preparation and ID mapping (Supporting Information,
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.g3journal.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1534/g3.115.021832/-/DC1/FigureS1.pdf">Figure S1</ext-link>).</p>
    <sec id="s2">
      <title>Tracking by rs IDs</title>
      <p>SNPTracker starts with a procedure to extract effective data for all input sequence
variants from the three aforementioned resource datasets. The merged events of all
input variants are read from the RsMergeArch dataset at first. As some variants were
merged several times in dbSNP, SNPTracker traces such variants from the first merge
event to the latest one by walking through intermediate rs IDs. For some variants,
submitters withdrew rs IDs as descripted in the dbSNP Guide document (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK3861/">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK3861/</ext-link>). Therefore, SNPTracker
next reads the SNPHistory dataset and marks the latest rs IDs, which have been
completely deleted. However, one may also resubmit his or her withdrawn variants,
probably because the deleted variants are widely used by other users. These
resubmitted variants are marked by “reactivation” in the SNPHistory
dataset. Accordingly, SNPTracker also uses these reactivated rs IDs for tracking. At
the end of the data preparation procedure, SNPTracker reads the SNPChrPosOnRef
dataset to retrieve coordinates for all input variants. Note that some variants have
problematic coordinates, such as being mapped to multiple contigs (Multi) and not
being mapped to any current chromosome (NotOn). SNPTracker marks variants with these
annotations as well. Finally, input variants not existing in the SNPChrPosOnRef
dataset but in the SNPHistory dataset are marked as being deleted. After preparing
the effective data, SNPTracker then goes through every input variant to update its rs
ID and coordinate. The extracted rs IDs and annotations are stored in a Hash Table.
For variants with valid rs IDs, SNPTracker reports the latest rs IDs and genomic
coordinates into a results file. In contrast, SNPTracker reports the rs IDs with
special codes in a separate error file. Besides, the rs IDs marked as being deleted
will be also saved into the error file.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="s3">
      <title>Tracking by genomic coordinates</title>
      <p>SNPTracker can also track the rs IDs by variants’ genomic coordinates. The
input genomic coordinates are utilized to retrieve the rs IDs from the SNPChrPosOnRef
dataset first. SNPTracker assumes the input coordinates are 1-based. Moreover, it
also automatically corrects for 0-based coordinates. Given the rs IDs, SNPTracker
will follow the above procedure of tracking by rs IDs. In dbSNP, the SNPChrPosOnRef
dataset is available only for reference genomes, hg19 and hg38. If the input
coordinates are hg17 and hg18, SNPTracker first automatically converts the
coordinates into hg19 by the UCSC LiftOver algorithm, and then retrieves the rs IDs
by the new coordinates.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="s4">
      <title>Tracking by a map/bim file</title>
      <p>To facilitate genetic analysis in PLINK (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Purcell
<italic>et al.</italic> 2007</xref>), SNPTracker also has a function for
updating rs IDs for variants in marker files in the “bim” or
“map” formats. SNPTracker reads the rs IDs (if available) or genomic
coordinates first. Given the rs IDs or genomic coordinates, the main procedures
involved are the same as aforementioned. Users can straightforwardly use the output
of SNPTracker as one of the inputs of PLINK for further analyses.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="s5">
      <title>Compiling raw resource data from dbSNP</title>
      <p>To speed-up the tracking procedure, SNPTracker uses a compiled resource dataset from
the original dbSNP resource data. In the SNPTracker resource file, all previous
versions of rs IDs in the dbSNP RsMergeArch dataset are directly mapped to the
current version of rs IDs so that SNPTracker can quickly retrieve the current version
of rs IDs for any version of rs IDs. This is done only once by an iterative algorithm
in SNPTracker when there is a new dbSNP resource dataset. The complied resource data
of the latest version of dbSNP have been provided on the website of SNPTracker, and
can be automatically downloaded by SNPTracker. Meanwhile, users are also able to use
the original resource datasets directly downloaded from dbSNP. SNPTracker will then
automatically compile the resource datasets prior to the actual tracking procedure
(see detail in the online user-manual <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://grass.cgs.hku.hk/limx/snptracker/">http://grass.cgs.hku.hk/limx/snptracker/</ext-link>).</p>

      <title>Usage of SNPTracker</title>
      <p>SNPTracker encoded by Java (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.java.com">https://www.java.com</ext-link>) has a
user-friendly command-line interface for tracking rs IDs in either small- or
large-scale datasets. Once initiated for the first time, SNPTracker automatically
downloads the resource datasets of Human Build 142 from the SNPTracker server in
parallel. The input is either rs IDs or coordinates of variants stored in a text
file. The simplest way to run SNPTracker is by its default model with the input file
path and prefix of output file name:<disp-formula id="eq"><mml:math id="me1"><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>java -jar snptracker.jar input.txt output,</mml:mtext></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula>in which the first column of the input file is the rs ID column, and
the version of output coordinate is hg19 by default. Besides, users could also
flexibly specify the input/output settings in three different ways (including the
conventional map/bim files recognizable for PLINK, see detail in the online
user-manual, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://grass.cgs.hku.hk/limx/snptracker/">http://grass.cgs.hku.hk/limx/snptracker/</ext-link>).</p>
      <p>Moreover, we also provided a web-based front end to further ease the usage of
SNPTracker for relatively small-scale datasets (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://grass.cgs.hku.hk/limx/snptracker/online/online.html">http://grass.cgs.hku.hk/limx/snptracker/online/online.html</ext-link>). On the
webpage, users can specify the settings by clicking buttons, and submit a SNP
tracking task to our web server. Once the result is available, a downloading link for
the result will be sent to users by E-mail.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="s9">
      <title>SNPTracker updated more rs IDs than LiftRsNumber</title>
      <p>We first asked whether SNPTracker updates the latest version of rs IDs better than
LiftRsNumber. This comparison was based on an old in-house GWAS dataset (genotyped by
Illumina Human610-Quad BeadChip and Illumina Human550-Quad Beadchip) that contains
4,801,761 SNPs on a workstation with 6 GB RAM and i5-3570 3.40GHz CPU. Both
SNPTracker and LiftRsNumber were used to convert the rs IDs in the dataset to dbSNP
Build 142, and map variants’ coordinates onto the hg38 human reference genome.
As LiftRsNumber was hard-coded to use the resources of the old dbSNPs, we manually
modified its source codes to allow it to read the latest dbSNP resource datasets.
SNPTracker successfully updated 25,591 more rs IDs than LiftRsNumber in total (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>). Most of these SNPs were reported to
have unknown and deleted rs IDs by LiftRsNumber. In contrast, SNPTracker successfully
traced back rs IDs at all of these SNPs except for 119 deleted and 26 invalid SNPs
(<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>). Supposedly, LiftRsNumber only
used the current rs ID in the RsMergeArch dataset to track rs IDs, which may have no
information for some SNPs. However, SNPTracker also used the previous rs IDs in the
RsMergeArch dataset to track SNP IDs (detailed in <italic>Methods</italic>). Besides,
SNPTracker produced more detailed annotation about the problematic SNPs (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>). For instance, SNPTracker reported 572
and 15 SNPs that were no longer mapped to any current chromosomes (NotOn), and
coordinates according to dbSNP Build142 in the old GWAS dataset.</p>

      <p>We also analyzed three old Affymetrix genotyping platforms (GeneChip 100K Array Set,
GeneChip Mapping 500K Array Set, and GenomeWide Array Set), and 3 other Illumina
genotyping platforms (HumanHap 300-Duo Array Set, HumanHap 550-Duo Array Set, and
HumanHap 650Y Array Set) to evaluate the performance of SNPTracker. The Affymetrix
GeneChip Mapping 500K Array Set included two subarrays, 250K Nsp Array (containing
262,264 variants), and 250K Sty Array (containing 238,304 variants). Both SNPTracker
and LiftRsNumber were used to convert the rs IDs in both datasets to dbSNP Build 142,
and mapped variants’ coordinates onto the hg19 human reference genome. For
variants with rs ID in the 250K Nsp Array, SNPTracker successfully converted the rs
ID of nine more variants that were reported to have unknown ID by LiftRsNumber, and
reported 31 variants that were no longer mapped to any current chromosomes but were
not recognized by LiftRsNumber (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.g3journal.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1534/g3.115.021832/-/DC1/TableS1.pdf">Table S1</ext-link>). Moreover, SNPTracker also successfully retrieved the rs IDs
for 4383 variants by their coordinates (hg17), which had no rs ID in the 250K Nsp
Array. In contrast, LiftRsNumber cannot trace rs IDs by coordinates, and the 4383
variants were reported as unchanged rs IDs with “—”.
Furthermore, SNPTracker gave more detailed annotation at 234 problematic SNPs and rs
IDs (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.g3journal.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1534/g3.115.021832/-/DC1/TableS1.pdf">Table S1</ext-link>). The pattern of results was quite similar for 250K Sty Array
(<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.g3journal.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1534/g3.115.021832/-/DC1/TableS2.pdf">Table S2</ext-link>). The Affymetrix GeneChip 100K Array Set, Affymetrix
GenomeWide Array Set, Illumina HumanHap 300-Duo Array Set, Illumina HumanHap 550-Duo
Array Set, and Illumina HumanHap 650Y Array Set contained 116,204, 440,794, 318,223,
561,436 and 660,876 variants, respectively. The comparison results of these five
platforms between SNPTracker and LiftRsNumber are shown in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.g3journal.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1534/g3.115.021832/-/DC1/TableS3.pdf">Table S3</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.g3journal.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1534/g3.115.021832/-/DC1/TableS4.pdf">Table S4</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.g3journal.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1534/g3.115.021832/-/DC1/TableS5.pdf">Table S5</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.g3journal.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1534/g3.115.021832/-/DC1/TableS6.pdf">Table S6</ext-link>, and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.g3journal.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1534/g3.115.021832/-/DC1/TableS7.pdf">Table S7</ext-link>. In summary, SNPTracker has three advantageous features: (i)
SNPTracker can trace variants without rs IDs through coordinates; (ii) SNPTracker can
produce more detailed annotation for problematic variants; (iii) SNPTracker can trace
more variants that were reported to have unknown IDs by LiftRsNumber;</p>

      <title>SNPTracker produced more rs IDs than dbSNP Batch</title>
      <p>We also made a comparison between SNPTracker and <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">dbSNP Batch Query (2005)</xref>. Since dbSNP Batch is limited to 30,000 rs IDs at
each query, we randomly drew 30,000 rs IDs from the above-mentioned in-house GWAS
dataset for comparison. These rs IDs were mapped onto dbSNP Build 142 with
coordinates of hg38. While both tools produced very similar number of rs IDs,
SNPTracker had 29,824 (out of 29,999) consistent results with dbSNP Batch. In
addition, SNPTracker had 175 more converted SNPs than <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">dbSNP Batch Query (2005)</xref>, 29,999 <italic>vs.</italic> 29,824
respectively. We then manually retrieved the rs IDs for the 175 variants via the
dbSNP’s individual SNP search webpage (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/SNP/">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/SNP/</ext-link>) one by one. It turned out that all
of the rs IDs of the 175 variants are consistent with those given by SNPTracker,
suggesting SNPTracker retrieved the rs IDs even more comprehensively than <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">dbSNP Batch Query (2005)</xref>. For example, dbSNP
Batch failed to return any rs ID for rs115610697. Both SNPTracker and the
dbSNP’s individual SNP search webpage reported this rs ID was merged into
rs113010839. A possible reason why the 175 rs IDs was ignored by <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">dbSNP Batch Query (2005)</xref> is that it may ignore
some of the previous rs IDs that are deleted after merging into the current rs
IDs.</p>

      <title>Conclusions</title>
      <p>In summary, SNPTracker is a user-friendly tool for comprehensively tracking and
unifying rs IDs and genomic coordinates of massive amounts of sequence variants. It
has a higher success rate in updating rs IDs than the alternative tools, and can
export the results in formats recognizable by popular genetics analysis tools.
SNPTracker will play a very useful role in facilitating genetic data exchange and
integration in GWAS.</p>
