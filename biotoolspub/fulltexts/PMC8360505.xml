      <p>High-throughput imaging techniques have become widespread in many fields of biology. These powerful platforms generate large quantities of data that can be difficult to process and visualize efficiently using existing tools. We developed easyXpress to process and review <italic toggle="yes">C</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">elegans</italic> high-throughput microscopy data in the R environment. The package provides a logical workflow for the reading, analysis, and visualization of data generated using CellProfiler’s WormToolbox. We equipped easyXpress with powerful functions to customize the filtering of noise in data, specifically by identifying and removing objects that deviate from expected animal measurements. This flexibility in data filtering allows users to optimize their analysis pipeline to match their needs. In addition, easyXpress includes tools for generating detailed visualizations, allowing the user to interactively compare summary statistics across wells and plates with ease. Researchers studying <italic toggle="yes">C</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">elegans</italic> benefit from this streamlined and extensible package as it is complementary to CellProfiler and leverages the R environment to rapidly process and analyze large high-throughput imaging datasets.</p>

    <title>Introduction</title>
    <p>Developments in high-throughput imaging techniques have led to a rapid increase in these data. Researchers are able to move away from the laborious manual collection of images that typically limits large-scale analyses [<xref rid="pone.0252000.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Furthermore, these advances have enabled scientists to collect data of intact cells, tissues, and whole-organisms with increased temporal and spatial resolution [<xref rid="pone.0252000.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. However, typical users require software methods for efficient handling, analysis, and visualization to make the most of these extensive image datasets.</p>
    <p><italic toggle="yes">C</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">elegans</italic> is a globally distributed, free-living roundworm nematode that is amenable to many types of experimental biology. The <italic toggle="yes">C</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">elegans</italic> cell lineage is completely characterized [<xref rid="pone.0252000.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], and the <italic toggle="yes">C</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">elegans</italic> connectome is completely mapped [<xref rid="pone.0252000.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], making these animals an exemplary model for developmental biology and neurobiology. The species can also be rapidly reared in large, genetically diverse populations in laboratory settings, providing unparalleled statistical power for experimental biology compared to any other metazoan [<xref rid="pone.0252000.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Furthermore, metabolic and developmental pathways in <italic toggle="yes">C</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">elegans</italic> are conserved in humans [<xref rid="pone.0252000.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. High-throughput imaging technologies can improve <italic toggle="yes">C</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">elegans</italic> studies by increasing experimental efficiency, scalability, and quality. Existing systems for automated image acquisition, such as the Molecular Devices ImageXpress platforms generate images of nematodes that can be analyzed with software like CellProfiler’s WormToolbox [<xref rid="pone.0252000.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] to extract nematode phenotype information. This software uses probabilistic nematode models trained on user selected animals to automate the segmentation of nematodes from the background of images in high-throughput. As a result, CellProfiler’s WormToolbox is able to measure hundreds of phenotypes related to animal shape, intensity, and texture. Implementing this software for large-scale imaging experiments can generate large quantities of data that requires additional analysis software for reliable and reproducible handling, processing, and visualization. CellProfiler Analyst was developed to offer tools for the analysis of image-based datasets, but this software is not integrated with modern statistical environments. We sought to design a resource that facilitates the exploration of CellProfiler data in the R environment [<xref rid="pone.0252000.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], where this limitation can be eliminated. The R language provides extensive open-source statistical and data visualization tools that are well supported by the user community. In leveraging R, we are able to create a flexible tool that can be rapidly integrated with other statistical R packages to suit project-specific analysis needs.</p>
    <p>We developed easyXpress, a software package for the R statistical programming language, to assist in the processing, analysis, and visualization of <italic toggle="yes">C</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">elegans</italic> data generated using CellProfiler. easyXpress provides tools for quality control, summarization, and visualization of image-based <italic toggle="yes">C</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">elegans</italic> phenotype data. Built to be complementary to CellProfiler, this package provides a streamlined workflow for the rapid quantitative analysis of high-throughput imaging datasets.</p>

    <title>Methods</title>
    <sec id="sec003">
      <title>Preparation of animals for imaging</title>
      <p>Bleach-synchronized animals were fed <italic toggle="yes">E</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">coli</italic> HB101 bacteria suspended and allowed to develop at 20°C with continuous shaking. Animals in 96-well microtiter plates were titered to approximately 30 animals per well. Prior to imaging, animals were treated with sodium azide (50 mM in 1X M9) for 10 minutes to paralyze and straighten their bodies.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec004">
      <title>Imaging</title>
      <p>Animals in microtiter plates were imaged at 2X magnification with an ImageXpress Nano (Molecular Devices, San Jose, CA). The ImageXpress Nano acquires brightfield images with a 4.7 megaPixel CMOS camera and are stored in 16-bit TIFF format. The images were processed using CellProfiler software (for details see <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://github.com/AndersenLab/CellProfiler" ext-link-type="uri">https://github.com/AndersenLab/CellProfiler</ext-link>).</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec005">
      <title>Paraquat dose response</title>
      <p>A 1.5 M solution of paraquat (Methyl viologen dichloride, Sigma, 856177-1G) was prepared in sterile water, aliquoted, and frozen at -20°C until used. Experimental animals were grown at 20°C and fed OP50 bacteria spotted on modified nematode growth medium, containing 1% agar and 0.7% agarose to prevent animals from burrowing. After three generations of passaging, animals were bleach-synchronized and embryos were transferred to the wells of 96-well microplates. Each well contained approximately 30 embryos in 50 μL of K medium [<xref rid="pone.0252000.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Microplates were incubated overnight at 20°C with continuous shaking. The following day, arrested L1 animals were fed HB101 bacteria suspended in K medium. At the time of feeding, the animals were also exposed to paraquat at one of six concentrations (0, 7.81, 31.25, 125, 500, 2000 μM) by serial dilution of a freshly thawed aliquot of 1.5 M paraquat solution. The final volume in each well after dosing and feeding was 75 μL. The animals were then grown for 48 hours at 20°C with continuous shaking, afterwards the microplates were imaged to assess the effects of paraquat exposure on nematode development.</p>

      <title>Naming conventions</title>
      <p>Several functions in the <italic toggle="yes">easyXpress</italic> package require specific naming conventions to work properly. For full details regarding essential file naming and directory structure see the package repository (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://github.com/AndersenLab/easyXpress" ext-link-type="uri">https://github.com/AndersenLab/easyXpress</ext-link>). Importantly, when using the Metadata module in CellProfiler to extract information describing your images, specific column names are suggested (<xref rid="pone.0252000.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).</p>

      <p>The easyXpress package is designed to be simple and accessible to users familiar with the R environment. The easyXpress package comprises nine functions for reading, processing, and visualizing large high-throughput image-based datasets acquired from microplate-based assays processed with CellProfiler (<xref rid="pone.0252000.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>). Because our software is built to handle CellProfiler data as input, we suggest users review the overview and applications of CellProfiler as a prerequisite description of data generation [<xref rid="pone.0252000.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Below, we describe the workflow for users to analyze their image data with easyXpress.</p>

      <title>Data import and model assignment</title>
      <p>To read in CellProfiler data files, we provide <italic toggle="yes">readXpress()</italic>. Measurements calculated by CellProfiler can be exported in a comma-separated value (csv) file and accessed using <italic toggle="yes">readXpress()</italic>. For large-scale, high-throughput experiments, users can employ a computing cluster for increased analysis speed (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://github.com/AndersenLab/CellProfiler" ext-link-type="uri">https://github.com/AndersenLab/CellProfiler</ext-link>). In this case, CellProfiler data stored in.RData format is accessed using <italic toggle="yes">readXpress()</italic>. Additionally, the function can optionally import a design file created by the user containing experimental treatments and conditions. This design file is joined to the CellProfiler data and output as a single dataframe.</p>
      <p>CellProfiler’s WormToolbox detects and measures the phenotypes of individual animals based on user-calibrated models of variability in body size and shape [<xref rid="pone.0252000.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. To effectively detect animals in a mixed-stage population, multiple worm models must be used. However, using multiple worm models creates a one-to-many relationship between real animals and their measured phenotype (<xref rid="pone.0252000.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig</xref>). We have included the function <italic toggle="yes">modelSelection()</italic> to annotate this information for downstream analysis. In instances where multiple worm model objects are assigned to a single primary object, <italic toggle="yes">modelSelection()</italic> will identify the best fitting model. Models are first ranked by frequency in the dataset such that the smallest model is classified as the most frequently occurring and the largest model is the least frequently occurring. In our experience, the most frequently occuring model in the dataset has the smallest size because it is often repeatedly assigned to a single primary object. Conversely, the least frequently occurring model in the dataset has the largest size as it is able to define the entire size of an animal, and is thus assigned to a primary object only once. The largest ranked model occuring within a single primary object is then selected as the best fitting model for that primary object. If necessary, <italic toggle="yes">modelSelection()</italic> will also specify whether the selected model object was repeatedly assigned to the same primary object and flag this event as a cluster. This problem occurs in instances where a model object is repeatedly assigned to a single primary object. If the largest model object is found to occur repeatedly in a single primary object, this model will be selected and a cluster flag will be added (<xref rid="pone.0252000.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1C Fig</xref>). The <italic toggle="yes">modelSelection()</italic> step is essential to resolve cases where multiple instances of a selected model object are assigned to a single primary object, thus contributing to inaccurate phenotype measurements.</p>

    <sec id="sec011">
      <title>Data pruning and summarization</title>
      <p>Once the data are read into the R statistical environment, it is crucial to optimize data quality before in-depth analysis. Uneven well illumination can hinder the performance of CellProfiler’s object identification and phenotype extraction. Despite correcting for uneven illumination within a well, discerning foreground objects from background can be especially challenging near the periphery of the well and can add noise to nematode phenotype data (<xref rid="pone.0252000.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Fig</xref>). The function <italic toggle="yes">edgeFlag()</italic> was written to identify and flag animals located near the edge of circular wells using the centroid coordinates of the selected model object. By default, the function sets the radius of even illumination from the image center to 825 pixels, but this parameter can be adjusted by the user to serve project-specific analyses.</p>
      <p>We also developed <italic toggle="yes">setFlags()</italic> in conjunction with <italic toggle="yes">edgeFlag()</italic> to further address data points that deviate from the expected animal measurements. The function <italic toggle="yes">setFlags()</italic> takes the output of <italic toggle="yes">edgeFlags()</italic> and detects outlier measurements among all measurements within a well using Tukey’s fences [<xref rid="pone.0252000.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. By default, outlier calculations are performed by excluding data identified by <italic toggle="yes">modelSelection()</italic> as part of a cluster as well as data in close proximity to the well edge. However, <italic toggle="yes">setFlags()</italic> is customizable, allowing the user to specify which filters to include. <italic toggle="yes">edgeFlag()</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">setFlags()</italic> were designed to allow for analysis-specific optimization when handling various experimental datasets. This flexibility in data filtering makes easyXpress extensible to many unique projects.</p>
      <p>Once data are adequately flagged, the function <italic toggle="yes">process()</italic> organizes the data into a list containing four elements: raw data, processed data, and summaries for both datasets. The raw data element is the CellProfiler data following <italic toggle="yes">modelSelection()</italic> and flag annotation. The processed data are generated by default after subsequent removal of all cluster, edge, and outlier flags. If a user includes data annotated as clusters or edge cases in <italic toggle="yes">setFlags()</italic>, cluster and edge cases will be retained in the processed data output. Finally, it is often useful to summarize data by well to interpret patterns specific to experimental variables. Alternatively, measurements may be summarized by other experimental factors according to the individual experimenter’s plate design. <italic toggle="yes">process()</italic> aids in the summarization of both the raw and processed data elements. This function comprehensively calculates the means, variances, quantiles, minimum, and maximum values of animal length for any experimental unit (<italic toggle="yes">e</italic>.<italic toggle="yes">g</italic>. well). We have also included the wrapper function <italic toggle="yes">Xpress()</italic> to accelerate the import and processing of CellProfiler data. <italic toggle="yes">Xpress()</italic> will perform the above functions with all default settings, but a user can alter input arguments to better suit project specific needs.</p>

      <title>Visualization</title>
      <p>The easyXpress package provides several plotting functions to allow users to explore the data through detailed and elegant visualizations. After data summarization, it is often useful to inspect the values of the summary statistics in order to recognize patterns or identify potential outlier data. We provide <italic toggle="yes">viewPlate()</italic> to assist with the visualization of mean animal length within each well across a microtiter plate (<xref rid="pone.0252000.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>). This function accepts either raw or processed data to generate an interactive plot that allows users to scan across a plate to determine the number of objects present within individual wells.</p>

      <p>To complement the top-level data visualization provided by <italic toggle="yes">viewPlate()</italic>, we have included <italic toggle="yes">viewWell()</italic> to allow users to deeply explore data within individual wells. This function generates a plot of the well image following CellProfiler analysis with all objects annotated with their assigned class (<xref rid="pone.0252000.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>). Additionally, <italic toggle="yes">viewWell()</italic> can optionally generate a boxplot of the length values for each object. This plotting function is especially useful because it enables rapid qualitative assessment of object classification performance. By overlaying the model object classifications on the well image, users can quickly determine whether CellProfiler classified objects as expected or whether errors in model selection or data flags occurred.</p>

      <p>Lastly, we have developed the function <italic toggle="yes">viewDose()</italic> to allow for the visualization of dose response data. <italic toggle="yes">C</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">elegans</italic> are often used to study conserved responses to various compounds [<xref rid="pone.0252000.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0252000.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. <italic toggle="yes">viewDose()</italic> allows a user to visually examine the effect of a compound on animal size and shape over a range of concentrations (<xref rid="pone.0252000.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4</xref>).

        <title>Multiple model objects assigned to a single primary object.</title>
        <p>When running CellProfiler’s WormToolbox with multiple worm models, multiple model objects can be assigned to a single primary object (real animal). Different colors are used to outline each worm model object. Here four unique models were used: L1, L2/L3, L4, and Adult. These worm models represent the approximate sizes of animals at each life stage. For example, some mutant or diverse wild genetic backgrounds might have differently sized adult animals as compared to the laboratory-adapted N2 strain. We have included this “soft matching” to account for small differences in the sizes of developmental stages across different genetic backgrounds, laboratories, and environmental conditions. (A) An animal detected by CellProfiler as a primary object has been assigned three unique worm models: two L1 model objects, one L2/L3 model object, and one L4 model object. <italic toggle="yes">modelSelection()</italic> classifies this animal as an L4 model object. (B) An animal detected as a primary object has been assigned four unique worm models: three L1 model objects, two L2/L3 model objects, one L4 model object, and one Adult model object. Here, <italic toggle="yes">modelSelection()</italic> identifies the Adult model as the best fitting model object. (C) An animal detected as a primary object has been assigned two unique worm models: three L1 model objects, and two L2/L3 model objects. In this case, <italic toggle="yes">modelSelection()</italic> classifies this animal as an L2/L3 model object and adds a cluster flag annotation to indicate the repeated assignment of the selected model object to the primary object.</p>

Objects near the edge of the well (y &lt; 500 and y &gt; 1500) have similar raw detected intensities (int) to more medial objects (y ~ 1000) in (A) but lower corrected intensities in (B) because of uneven background correction. Raw and background-corrected image segments are displayed in (C).

    <p>Reviewer #1: Authors has developed a package easyXpress based on R-Statistical Environment platform that can facilitate the analysis with CellProfiler. This study has potential and could be beneficiary for many scientists looking for a solution. However, I find it difficult to assess the methods that they have developed due to limitation posed with unavailability of the code as well as statistical description of functions. In addition, I have few questions to authors as follows.</p>
    <p>Q.1 : Authors mentioned that the code is available on github, however, I was unable to see the code or validate that it is working in the way it is proposed.</p>
    <p>Q.2 Many place it is written to refer the manual however manual is not accessible, and information is not provided in the manuscript. My suggestion is, since it is package -based article, authors must provide the code to validate their claim or write full description in the manuscript.</p>
    <p>Q.3 Authors mention that they have developed some functions to customize the filtering of noise in data, however no description or statistics underlying the function is explained anywhere in manuscript.</p>
    <p>Q.4 I am unable to find the explanation/statistics for summarization in methods though it is mention.</p>
    <p>Reviewer #2: This paper presents a piece of software meant to aid in the management and analysis of data first examined by CellProfiler. Beyond offering a method to visualize the outputs of CellProfiler, with the option of overlaying annotations, it provides further functionality in terms of refining annotations and removal of C. elegans deemed as outliers by custom filtering routines. Flexible control of functions and hyperparameters make this software amenable to an array of imaging situations. The contributions of this software, although limited when compared to a package such as CellProfiler itself, seem meaningful as it automates processes that are otherwise menial and time consuming. Further, inter-experimental comparisons will benefit from the consistency offered by using this software to manage how outlier removal occurs within a dataset. This paper makes meaningful contributions to the field of study however, there remains a few outstanding questions after reading the paper. Those questions can be found below.</p>
    <p>Lines 130-143 begin to describe the modelSelection function, however, some items remain unclear. Based on the description starting at line 136, it seems to be that modelSelection would select the most infrequent model as the best model fit. Given that this is the correct interpretation, it seems to run against intuition where if one were to rely on model frequency alone to clear up cases of ambiguous labeling, the most frequent model may be better suited. If the least frequent is indeed the model that is chosen in cases of ambiguity, it would be helpful to elaborate on why this is the case. If this was understood incorrectly, it would be helpful to expand upon this sentence and provide further details on how models are ranked/selected.</p>
    <p>The following sentence starting on line 139 raised another question. It seemed to be in the previous sentences that a "primary object" was referencing a C. elegans however, the statement "modelSelection() will also specify whether the selected model object was repeatedly assigned to the same primary object..." makes this conclusion seem unlikely. It is understood that a single C. elegans could be assigned multiple instances of different models however, it is unclear how a C. elegans could be assigned multiple instances of the exact same model. Due to this confusion, it would be helpful to have a statement on either i) what a primary object is in reference to, if it is not a C. elegans, or ii) in what cases one would expect a C. elegans to receive duplicates of the same model label.</p>
    <p>The authors indicate that the easyXpress will help with necessary statistical tools for quality control and provide quantitative analysis of high-throughput imaging datasets. Although Figure 4 indicates a study using paraquat on worm measurements, the authors did not provide many details neither present quantitative results from this data. It is advisable to indicate the experimental details in the method section and show a detailed statistical analysis of this data. To show the full power of this platform, the author should represent the quantitative data of the study, worm body sizes, and the necessary statistical analysis.</p>
    <p>Figure 3 identifies a few animals as L4_model while they appear to be of similar size as the adult animals as per the box plot on the right. Were these animal images confirmed with high-resolution imaging or manual inspection? If these annotations were erroneous, the authors are encouraged to discuss possible reasons for this error and whether it will affect the measurements.</p>
