      <title>Abstract</title>
      <p>Essential genes are those whose loss of function compromises organism viability or results in profound loss of fitness. Recent gene-editing technologies have provided new opportunities to characterize essential genes. Here, we present an integrated analysis that comprehensively and systematically elucidates the genetic and regulatory characteristics of human essential genes. First, we found that essential genes act as ‘hubs’ in protein–protein interaction networks, chromatin structure and epigenetic modification. Second, essential genes represent conserved biological processes across species, although gene essentiality changes differently among species. Third, essential genes are important for cell development due to their discriminate transcription activity in embryo development and oncogenesis. In addition, we developed an interactive web server, the Human Essential Genes Interactive Analysis Platform (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://sysomics.com/HEGIAP">http://sysomics.com/HEGIAP</ext-link>/), which integrates abundant analytical tools to enable global, multidimensional interpretation of gene essentiality. Our study provides new insights that improve the understanding of human essential genes.</p>

    <title>Introduction</title>
    <p>Essential genes are indispensable for organism survival and the maintenance of basic cell and tissue functions [<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1–3</xref>]. The systematic identification of essential genes in different organisms [<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] has provided critical insights into the molecular bases of many biological processes [<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Such information may be useful for applications in areas such as synthetic biology [<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] and drug target identification [<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The identification of human essential genes is a particularly attractive area of research because of the potential for medical applications [<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Utilizing gene-editing technologies based on CRISPR-Cas9 and retroviral gene-trap screens, three independent genome-wide studies [<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11–13</xref>] identified essential genes that are indispensable for human cell viability. The results agreed very well among the three studies, confirming the robustness of the evaluation approaches. All of these studies [<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11–13</xref>] showed that ∼10% of the ∼20 000 genes in human cells are essential for cell survival, highlighting the intrinsic buffering mechanisms of eukaryotic genomes against genetic and environmental insults [<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p>
    <p>In a recent review, Pavelka <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] stated that gene essentiality is not a fixed property but instead depends strongly on environmental and genetic contexts and can be altered during short- or long-term evolution. However, this paradigm leaves some questions unresolved, as we do not know how essential genes are interconnected within cells, why these genes are essential or what their underlying mechanisms may be. Furthermore, we do not know whether these genes are associated with disease (e.g. cancer) or have the potential to be exploited as targets for therapeutic strategies. With the recent and rapid development of next-generation sequencing and other experimental technologies, we now have access to myriad data on genomic sequences, epigenetic modifications, structures and disease-related information. These data will enable researchers to examine human essential genes from multiple perspectives.</p>
    <p>In light of this background, we performed a comprehensive study of human essential genes, including their genomic, epigenetic, proteomic, evolutionary and embryonic patterning characteristics. Genetic and regulatory characteristics were studied to understand what makes these genes essential for cell survival. We analyzed the evolutionary status of human essential genes and their profiles during embryonic development. Our findings suggest that human essential genes are important for lineage segregation. Essential genes have important implications for drug discovery, which may inform the next generation of cancer therapeutics (<xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). Finally, we developed a new web server, the Human Essential Genes Interactive Analysis Platform (HEGIAP), to facilitate the global research community’s comprehensive exploration of human essential genes.</p>

      <title>Multi-level essentiality of human essential genes</title>
      <p>Essential genes define the key biological functions that are required for cell growth, proliferation and survival. To characterize human essential genes, we first compared three essential gene sets generated by different experimental methods [<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11–13</xref>]; more than 60% of essential genes were cataloged in at least two data sets (Venn diagram in <xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). Here, we focused on the essential genes detected by Wang <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], who defined a CRISPR score (CS) for the assessment of gene essentiality. Briefly, low CSs indicate high degrees of essentiality and vice versa. Here, we used data from the KBM7 cell line for further analysis. We first evaluated the cell-line specificity of CSs to ensure the robustness of our analysis in terms of reflecting the general properties of gene essentiality in different cell types. First, according to Wang <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], a predominant part (98.99%) of essential genes in the KBM7 cell line were not cell-line specific; they identified only 19 such genes. Essential genes in the KBM7 cell line also represent more than two-thirds of the essential genes identified in the other two studies. Using these data, we calculated Pearson coefficients of CS correlations between cell lines for all screened genes to assess the similarity of essentiality between cell lines. The essentialities of all screened genes in multiple cell lines showed high degrees of correlation (Pearson coefficient: maximum, 0.83; minimum, 0.79). In addition, the results of our analyses using CSs for different cell lines and using multi-omics data from different cell types were robust, demonstrating the reliability of the data sets used.</p>
      <p>We divided all protein-coding genes into 10 groups (CS0–CS9) according to ascending CS values, where group CS0 was composed of essential genes. This detailed classification provided a good representation of the various features in subsequent analyses.</p>
      <sec id="sec4">
        <title>Protein essentiality: high transcription activity and stability, `hub’ of the PPI network</title>
        <p>We first analyzed the expression levels of human genes in 2916 individuals from the Genotype-Tissue Expression Program [<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Essential genes were highly expressed compared with nonessential genes (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 1 × 10<sup>−50</sup>, Welch’s <italic>t</italic>-test; Cohen’s <italic>d</italic> = 8.76), and the expression level decreased as gene essentiality decreased (the CS value increased; <italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.42, <italic>P</italic> = 0.04; <xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). Furthermore, an analysis using publicly available human protein stability data [<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] showed that proteins encoded by essential genes showed more stability than did other proteins (<italic>P</italic> = 1.10 × 10<sup>−18</sup>, Welch’s <italic>t</italic>-test; <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S1A</xref>). This observation was consistent with the findings of a recent study [<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], which showed that highly expressed proteins are stable because they are designed to tolerate translational errors that would lead to the accumulation of toxic misfolded species.</p>
        <p>In many model organisms, essential genes tend to encode abundant proteins that engage extensively in protein–protein interactions (PPIs) [<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. We constructed a PPI network for each CS group (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S1B</xref>). Essential genes showed significantly more connectivity than did other genes (<italic>P</italic> = 2.73 × 10<sup>−266</sup>, Welch’s <italic>t</italic>-test; <xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>), and the degree of connectivity was correlated negatively with the CS in the essential gene set (<italic>r</italic> = −0.29, <italic>P</italic> = 1.22 × 10<sup>−37</sup>; insets in <xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). We then calculated the distribution of genes over the range of connectivity. We found that with higher degrees of connectivity, there were fewer genes (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S2A</xref>) but greater proportions of essential genes (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S2B</xref>). As a novel study showed that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are important players in regulatory networks [<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], we investigated genes whose expression levels were altered significantly following CRISPRi knockout of lncRNAs, identified in a previous study [<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. We found significantly a greater proportion of essential genes among all differentially expressed genes (DEGs) than among genes that showed no significant alteration in expression (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S2C</xref>). This result suggests that essential genes are more likely to be regulated by lncRNAs. Finally, we performed a gene ontology (GO) analysis for each group. Essential genes were enriched in fundamental biological processes, such as rRNA processing, translational initiation, mRNA splicing and DNA replication, and nonessential genes were less significantly enriched in other processes (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S3</xref>).</p>
        <p>In summary, essential genes are highly expressed and associated with important biological processes. Proteins encoded by essential genes are stable and located at connection hubs in PPI networks. Taken together, these results show the essentiality of essential genes at the protein level.</p>

      <sec id="sec5">
        <title>Structural essentiality: high density in the genome and 3D structure lead to a `hub’ of chromatin organization</title>
        <p>In general, gene length affects the stability of the kinetics of genetic switches and thus the dynamics of gene expression [<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. We found that human essential genes were much shorter than nonessential genes (<italic>P</italic> = 1.38 × 10<sup>−53</sup>, Welch’s <italic>t</italic>-test; <xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>), consistent with the results of a previous study of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> [<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Generally, long genes were likely to contain more diverse transcripts in the human genome (<italic>r</italic> = 0.34, <italic>P</italic> = 1.0 × 10<sup>−100</sup>, Pearson correlation; <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S4A</xref>). Therefore, fewer types of transcripts were expected in essential genes, as they were short. However, a greater variety of transcripts was found in essential genes compared with nonessential genes (<italic>P</italic> = 7.02 × 10<sup>−42</sup>, Welch’s <italic>t</italic>-test; <xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>), and the number of transcript types decreased as essentiality decreased (<italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.90, <italic>P</italic> = 2.70 × 10<sup>−5</sup>, Pearson correlation; insets in <xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>), indicating that mRNAs transcribed by essential genes were highly variable. GC content is associated with DNA stability, and variations in GC content within the genome result in variations in staining intensity in chromosomes [<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. We thus examined the distribution of GC content. Our result showed that genes with moderate to high degrees of essentiality (CS0–CS4) tended to have a slightly higher GC content than did other genes (CS5–CS9) in both the promoter regions and gene bodies (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S4B</xref>). Furthermore, as Alu repetitive elements in the genome have been found to be regulators of gene expression [<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23–26</xref>] and as the Alu repetitive component may contribute to prevention of DNA damage [<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], we investigated repetitive elements within essential genes. DNA sequences for Alu elements were first identified and masked using RepeatMasker [<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. We found that Alu repetitive elements were significantly enriched in essential genes compared with those in nonessential genes (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 1 × 10<sup>−50</sup>, Welch’s <italic>t</italic>-test; <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S4C</xref>). Together, these results indicate that essential genes are formed with high GC content and colocalize with Alu repetitive elements, suggesting high DNA stability of essential genes.</p>
        <p>We next examined the genomic distribution of essential genes and found that the transcription start sites (TSSs) of these genes tended to cluster (<xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E; Supplementary Figure </xref><xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5A</xref>). We then investigated the three-dimensional (3D) structural organization of essential genes. Previous studies have shown that topologically associated domains (TADs) are highly conserved between cell types and species and that proximity to the TAD boundary likely contributes to the stabilization of gene expression [<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29–33</xref>]. We detected TADs using high-throughput/high-resolution chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C) data from Jin <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] and Rao <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. We observed a significantly greater density of essential than nonessential genes within TAD boundaries (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 1 × 10<sup>−16</sup>, Welch’s <italic>t</italic>-test; <xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F; Supplementary Figure </xref><xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5B–E</xref>). As chromatin may be associated with proteins’ affinity for each other, resulting in chromatin loops [<xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], we calculated intra-TAD local (&lt;100 kb) Hi-C contacts for each gene set and examined the distribution of gene TSSs in chromatin loop anchors. Essential genes contained more local contacts (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 1 × 10<sup>−43</sup>, Welch’s <italic>t</italic>-test; <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S6A and B</xref>), and TSS density of essential genes that located in chromatin loop anchors was greater than that of nonessential gene groups (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S6C</xref>). As the formation of architectural loops depends strongly on the protein CTCF [<xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], we examined the distribution of CTCF signals detected by ChIP-seq [<xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. As expected, CTCF was more likely to bind near essential genes (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S6D</xref>). We used the recently introduced SPRITE experimental protocol [<xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] to identify active hubs of inter-chromosomal interactions that arranged around nuclear speckles. We found that essential genes were enriched on these experimentally verified structural hubs (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S6E</xref>).</p>

        <title>Epigenetic essentiality: the enrichment of epigenetic marks leads to an epigenetic regulatory network `hub’</title>
        <p>The epigenetic modification of chromatin provides the necessary plasticity for cells to respond to environmental and positional cues and enables the maintenance of acquired information without changing the DNA sequence [<xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. To study the epigenetic information on essential genes, we took advantage of recent high-throughput genomic assays [<xref rid="ref41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>, <xref rid="ref42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. We first examined the chromatin accessibility of essential genes. Strong DNase I hypersensitivity (DHS) signals were observed in the promoters of essential genes, and this enrichment decreased as gene essentiality decreased (<xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2G</xref>). Moreover, more transcription factor binding sites were detected in the promoters of essential genes (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S7</xref>). We then examined the DNA methylation pattern of essential genes. By analyzing data obtained with two sequencing-based methods, the DNA immunoprecipitation (MeDIP-seq) and methylation-sensitive restriction enzyme (MRE-seq) methods [<xref rid="ref43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], we found that the methylation levels of gene promoters increased as gene essentiality decreased (MRE-seq: <italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.93, <italic>P</italic> = 8.6 × 10<sup>−6</sup>; MeDIP-seq: <italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.93, <italic>P</italic> = 5.8 × 10<sup>−6</sup>, Welch’s <italic>t</italic>-test; <xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2H; Supplementary Figure </xref><xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">S8A</xref>). Methylation levels were higher in the gene body regions of essential genes than in other genes (MRE-seq, <italic>P</italic> = 1.5 × 10<sup>−5</sup>; MeDIP-seq, <italic>P</italic> = 9.6 × 10<sup>−20</sup>), supporting the highly transcribed nature of essential genes [<xref rid="ref44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Next, we examined two histone modifications—trimethylation of H3 lysine 4 (H3K4me3) and trimethylation of H3 lysine 27 (H3K27me3)—associated with transcription activation and gene repression [<xref rid="ref45" ref-type="bibr">45–47</xref>], respectively. Similar to chromatin accessibility, H3K4me3 signals were strongly enriched in the promoters of essential genes, and H3K4me3 density in gene promoters increased while gene essentiality increased (<xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2I</xref>). In contrast, H3K27me3 signals were weaker in the promoters of essential genes compared with nonessential genes (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S8B</xref>). Finally, we studied the abundance of noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs), which play a key role in regulating gene expression [<xref rid="ref48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>, <xref rid="ref49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. The density of ncRNAs in gene promoters decreased as essentiality decreased (<italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.40, <italic>P</italic> = 0.049; <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S8C</xref>).</p>
        <p>These observations of both histone modification marks show that essential genes tend to be located in the most active chromatin regions. Therefore, essential genes are hubs of epigenetic modification. As these modifications have important regulatory functions, these epigenetic hubs may, in turn, contribute to gene essentiality. For instance, inactive genes with low expression levels in the essential gene group seem to be `outliers’ because most essential genes are highly expressed. We suppose that a fraction of these inactive genes are essential, not because they are highly expressed and are direct modulators of critical cellular processes, but because they are located at epigenetic hubs. CRISPR-based screening may negatively affect the integrity of these epigenetic hubs, hampering cell proliferation. Based on the hypothesis that epigenetic hub location contributes to a gene’s high degree of essentiality, we believe that some inactive genes located near epigenetic hubs, for instance in highly accessible chromatin regions, are more likely to be essential, even if they are not actively transcribed like typical essential genes; hereafter, we refer to these genes as inactive epigenetic hub genes. A high degree of essentiality of an inactive epigenetic hub gene may be due predominantly to its location near an epigenetic hub. Therefore, such genes may be more enriched in the CS0 group than among genes with lower degrees of essentiality (CS1–CS9). In the analysis (Materials and methods) performed to test this hypothesis, we found that inactive epigenetic hub genes were more likely to be in the essential gene group than in the nonessential gene groups (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S8D</xref>). Thus, disruption of these genes may hamper cell proliferation not by their seized expression, but by the disruption of epigenetic hub integrity. This result further supports the role of essential genes as epigenetic hubs.</p>
        <p>In summary, these results provide epigenetic evidence for the role of essential genes as hubs of active epigenetic modification.</p>

      <title>Evolutionary nature of human essential genes</title>
      <p>Highly and widely expressed genes have been found to have originated early and to be conserved across species [<xref rid="ref50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. We next investigated the universal distribution of evolutionary rates of essential genes. Using gene age categories defined in a study [<xref rid="ref51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>] based on inferred gene origination times, we showed that, as expected, essential genes on average were older (<xref rid="f3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>) and significantly more conserved (<italic>P</italic> = 9.40 × 10<sup>−9</sup>, Welch’s <italic>t</italic>-test; <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S9</xref>) than were nonessential genes. However, a small subset of essential genes was notably young (<xref rid="f3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>); we found that the proportion of essential genes among human-specific genes (gene age group 13) was significantly larger than that of other genes (gene age groups 1–11; <xref rid="f3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>), indicating that human-specific genes are more likely to be essential in humans. Similar results were obtained for the other three cell types (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S10</xref>). GO analysis of essential genes in the two youngest groups (human and chimpanzee) showed significant enrichment in the regulation of GTPase activity (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S11A</xref>). Enrichment of these young essential genes in immune-related functions may indicate that these young and essential genes compress a few of cell-type-specific essential genes in hematopoietic lineages and that these genes take up a considerable proportion due to their very small amount of these young and essential genes. We also found that these youngest essential genes were shorter, less conserved and not as actively expressed as other essential genes (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S11B</xref>). In addition, `old’ genes have been reported to be longer than `young’ genes [<xref rid="ref50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>, <xref rid="ref52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>, <xref rid="ref53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]; however, most essential genes in this study were `old,’ but they were shorter than other genes on average (<xref rid="f3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>).</p>

      <p>Evolutionary age is defined based on the presence of a homolog in a wide range of species from single-celled organisms to primates [<xref rid="ref54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. However, the essentiality of a gene can change during the course of evolution [<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. We investigated the essentiality of homologous genes in humans and four other species (mouse, <italic>Danio rerio</italic>, <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> and <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>). We observed 329, 66, 15 and 143 essential genes in humans that were also essential in the four other species, respectively, but only 150, 9, 2 and 2 shared genes in random controls, indicating that essential genes were significantly more conserved than were other genes (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 1 × 10<sup>−5</sup>, permutation test), consistent with previous findings [<xref rid="ref55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Interestingly, more than half of the genes found to be essential in humans were nonessential in other species and vice versa (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S12</xref>), also consistent with the findings of Hart <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref rid="ref55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Gene essentiality may change in different species because genes or functions could arise separately or be lost or replaced by others during evolution; in this way, the biological network could become more robust [<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. To test this hypothesis, we compared PPI networks among species using essential genes annotated in various species retrieved from DEG database [<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. We first constructed a PPI network with essential genes for each species using a previously described network topology method [<xref rid="ref56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>] and detected subnet modules (densely connected regions that can represent molecular complexes) using the MCODE algorithm [<xref rid="ref57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. We then performed gene set enrichment analysis [<xref rid="ref58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>] for each subnet module. Interestingly, similar biological processes were observed between human and other species, although the essential genes were quite different (<xref rid="f3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>); for instance, rRNA processing was enriched in human, mouse and <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, but less than 18% of human essential genes were essential in these species (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S12</xref>). Protein localization analysis using existing annotation data [<xref rid="ref59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>] also showed that a larger fraction of human essential genes encode proteins located in cytoplasm than those encoded by human nonessential genes, whereas percentages of proteins located in membrane and extracellular for human essential genes are lower than those for human nonessential genes (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S13</xref>). These observations showed similar protein localization propensity in human and in prokaryotes [<xref rid="ref60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>] for essential genes in comparison with nonessential genes and may also support similar functions of essential genes between species. In addition, the percentage of proteins located in nucleus is higher for human essential genes than for human nonessential genes (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S13</xref>).</p>

        <title>Dynamic expression of essential genes in early embryo development</title>
        <p>Cell fate decisions contribute fundamentally to the development and homeostasis of complex tissue structures in multicellular organisms. The key to understand the different fates of apparently identical cells lies in the emergence of transcriptional programs [<xref rid="ref61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. We next characterized essential genes in mammalian embryonic development. Due to the lack of experimental data from human embryos, we used data from mouse preimplantation embryos. To examine whether genetic and epigenetic features were consistent in human and mouse, we calculated the distributions of gene expression and epigenetic information in human and mouse embryonic development. We observed strong correlations (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S14</xref>), which supported the use of mouse data to study human essential genes. During embryo development, the expression levels of essential genes were progressively increased, and two significant increasing were observed in two-cell embryos and the inner cell mass (ICM), which corresponding to zygotic genome activation [<xref rid="ref62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>, <xref rid="ref63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>] and the 1st cell fate decision, respectively. In contrast, the expression levels of nonessential genes were significantly lower than those of essential genes during the entire preimplantation period (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 1 × 10<sup>−100</sup>, Welch’s <italic>t</italic>-test), and genes in groups CS7–CS9, which labeled as the least essentiality, were silent after the two-cell embryo stage, similar to the maternal mRNA degradation process (<xref rid="f4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). To further understand the dynamic changes in the transcription activity of essential genes during embryo development, we investigated chromatin state dynamics. Accessible chromatin and active histone modifications were highly enriched in the promoters of essential genes compared with those of nonessential genes (<xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2G and I and </xref><xref rid="f4" ref-type="fig">4B and C</xref>). In addition, chromatin was progressively accessible and the H3K4me3 density progressively increased (<xref rid="f4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B and C</xref>). However, essential genes were least methylated during embryo preimplantation (<xref rid="f4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>). These observations suggest that the expression of essential genes is required for embryo development and that both chromatin accessibility and epigenetic modifications contribute to the formation of transcriptional programs in essential genes.</p>

Interestingly, differential patterns of transcription were observed during early lineage specification (<xref rid="f4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>). Essential genes were highly expressed in the ICM, which gives rise to the entire fetus, but much less expressed in the trophectoderm (TE), the outer layer of the blastocyst-stage embryo. During the subsequent formation of the primitive endoderm (PE) and epiblast (Epi), essential genes were also more highly expressed in embryonic tissues than in extraembryonic tissues. Finally, during the formation of the three germ layers, essential genes were highly expressed in the ectoderm, which was derived from the anterior epiblast by embryonic day 6.5 (E6.5), but weakly expressed in the primitive streak (PS) and PS-derived mesoderm and endoderm [<xref rid="ref61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. Compared with essential genes, nonessential genes were weakly expressed and showed no apparent pattern during embryo development. Thus, the transcription of essential genes is required for lineage segregation, especially for the development of the fetal-origin part of the placenta.</p>

      <title>Three types of `hubs’ location of essential genes</title>
      <p>Essential genes have been identified to be important content in multiple life-science research domains including those of genetic networks [<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="ref73" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>, <xref rid="ref74" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>], developmental phenotypes [<xref rid="ref75" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>], evolution [<xref rid="ref76" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>], cancer therapy [<xref rid="ref77" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>] and drug discovery [<xref rid="ref78" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]. Our work extends previous findings by revealing three `hub’ locations of essential genes. First, essential genes are `hubs’ of PPI networks. As described in the `centrality-lethality’ rule, genes and proteins with high degrees of connectivity tend to be essential because their inactivation is more likely to disrupt overall network architecture [<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Our statistical analysis confirmed that gene essentiality is correlated significantly with the degree of connectivity and that proteins encoded by essential genes are very stable, tolerating translational errors. Second, our work revealed a structural ‘hub’ of essential genes. Not only are essential genes clustered densely in the genome; these clusters have a 3D structural organization. Third, essential genes are sensitive `hubs’ of epigenetic modification, which contributes to their high expression levels. As essential genes are centers of epigenetic modification and chromatin structure, their high transcription activity levels may further promote the expression of surrounding genes; that is, essential genes may act as the ‘seeds’ of a transcription factory, where endogenous genes are replicated, transcribed and repaired [<xref rid="ref79" ref-type="bibr">79–81</xref>]. Furthermore, this three-‘hub’ model for essential genes indicates that gene knockdown in CRISPR experiments has the following effects on the transcriptional regulatory system in a cell: the gene will be down-regulated; the expression of other genes in the same PPI network will change; and the chromatin structure and epigenetic signal surrounding the CRISPR site may also change, which may affect the regulation of many other genes.</p>

      <title>No gene is absolutely essential; only functions can be so</title>
      <p>Consistent with previous findings [<xref rid="ref50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>], we confirmed that most essential genes are old. However, we also found that an unexpectedly high proportion of the youngest, human-specific genes are essential and play a role in the regulation of GTPase activity, although we cannot rule out the possibility that this may reflect enrichment of the very few cell-type-specific essential genes in hematopoietic cells, which could easily comprise a considerable fraction of all young and essential genes. Although essential genes are highly expressed and genes with high expression levels tend to be conserved across species, we noticed great variation in essential genes among species. By further examining the PPI networks constructed by essential genes, we found that although gene essentiality changes across species, the biological processes were conserved. This observation provides new insight supporting the idea that no gene is absolutely essential; only functions can be so [<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p>

      <title>Implications for gene editing and synthetic biology</title>
      <p>Major innovations in our ability to edit genome sequences have enabled cost-effective and straightforward genome editing in yeasts, plants and animals [<xref rid="ref82" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>, <xref rid="ref83" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>]. The identification of three ‘hub’ locations of essential genes suggests that the effects of gene editing (or gene therapy) on cells should be examined with consideration not only of the target gene and its signaling pathways but also of the associated epigenetic environment and the context of chromatin structure. Furthermore, essential genes can be used as a preferred gene set or important reference for gene interactions in synthetic biology. Additionally, in cancer research, they could facilitate drug discovery, offer promise as markers and may be useful for the identification of clinical therapeutic applications.</p>
      <p>In summary, our work provides very valuable information that improves our understanding of human essential genes. Due to the limitations of experimental approaches, further work is required not only to understand the evolutionary plasticity of essential genes across various species but also to gain more evidence on the three `hub’ locations of essential genes. These studies will facilitate our understanding of the design principles of transcription regulatory networks, higher-level organization of vital processes and principles underlying drug resistance.</p>

      <title>Calculating relative abundances of inactive epigenetic hub genes</title>
      <p>The observed proportion of genes in each essentiality group with expression levels lower than a specific threshold and whose promoter regions were highly accessible (defined by a specific cutoff of DNase-seq tag density in a 2 kb region upstream of the TSS) was calculated. Then, for each group, the expected probability that a gene was an inactive epigenetic hub gene (defined as the product of the proportion of genes with low expression levels and that of genes located at highly accessible chromatin sites, using the same cutoffs) was calculated. The relative possibility that a gene was an inactive epigenetic hub gene was defined using the observed/expected ratio. To ensure that the analysis was not biased toward the selection of particular cutoff values, we applied widely ranging cutoff selection parameters [expression cutoff: minimum = 2, maximum = 10 (FPKM), step = 0.5; chromatin accessibility cutoff: minimum = top 50% of all genes, maximum = top 95% of all genes, step = 1%]. All 170 cutoff combinations yielded similar and significant results.</p>

      <p>Twelve tumor types (COAD, KICH, BLCA, KIRC, CHOL, UCEC, PRAD, KIRP, LIHC, CESC, LUAD and BRCA) from the TCGA project were used to screen pan-cancer candidate genes. DEGs were first quantified in each cancer–normal tissue pair. The 5000 top-scoring DEGs among all genes and the 1000 top-scoring DEGs among essential genes were further combined, and genes in both of these sets were used as candidate genes for each cancer type.

                <p>Our work extended knowledge on two features of essential genes. First, although previous studies indicated that `old’ genes are generally longer than `young’ genes, we found that essential genes are old but unexpectedly short. Second, although long genes are generally more likely to contain more diverse transcripts than short genes, the short essential genes contained a larger variety of transcripts. These two characters of essential genes may be important for the stability of cell functions.</p>
