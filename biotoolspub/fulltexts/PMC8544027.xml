    <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
    <p id="P4">Networks are a powerful and flexible paradigm that facilitate communication and computation about interactions of any type, whether social, economic, or biological. In recent years, the vast amount of biomedical data generated through omics approaches has contributed to a massive increase in publications featuring biological network models of cancer and other human diseases. This data is often provided as figures and tabular data files in <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">supplementary materials</xref>, thus making its access and re-use laborious and time consuming. NDEx, The Network Data Exchange (<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">Pillich, Chen, Rynkov, Welker, &amp; Pratt, 2017</xref>; <xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">Pratt et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">Pratt et al., 2015</xref>) is an online commons providing infrastructure and data resources to facilitate the use of biological networks in research. NDEx enables new modes of collaboration and publication using biological networks, and simplifies access to and re-use of network models.</p>
    <p id="P5">Scientists can use NDEx to find networks to use in analysis applications: with 5913 publicly available networks, NDEx provides easy access to a wide variety of biological network data, including but not limited to resources such as BioGRID (<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">Oughtred et al., 2021</xref>), SIGNOR (<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">Licata et al., 2020</xref>), Wikipathways (<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">Kutmon et al., 2016</xref>), DrugBank (<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">Wishart et al., 2018</xref>), and BioPLEX (<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">Huttlin et al., 2021</xref>).</p>
    <p id="P6">Individuals and organizations can store and manage networks in their NDEx accounts, and can also make their networks publicly available, providing an easy distribution channel for both small pathways and very large interaction data sets. NDEx users can request DOIs (Digital Object Identifiers) for their networks and use them to link to the data from publications. Unlike a spreadsheet of interaction data in <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">supplementary materials</xref>, readers can immediately visualize and inspect the data interactively in NDEx. Since 2017, NDEx has been an official repository for Springer Nature and the PLoS family of journals.</p>
    <p id="P7">In addition, NDEx is fully integrated with Cytoscape (<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">Shannon et al., 2003</xref>), a desktop application for network visualization and analysis, thus enabling networks to seamlessly flow from a journal article to a user’s NDEx account straight into Cytoscape for subsequent data integration and analysis. Therefore, storing and distributing networks with NDEx promotes FAIR data principles, where networks become archival resources that are Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Re-usable.</p>
    <p id="P8">Notebooks in Python and R have become a preferred software environment for bioinformaticians and experimental biologists; NDEx exposes a powerful REST API allowing Jupyter notebooks and other programs in Python to access NDEx via the ndex2 Python package, as shown in Basic Protocol 3. Client libraries are also available in R, Java, and JavaScript, positioning NDEx to serve as a framework for integration between bioinformatics applications and content resources. Examples of use of NDEx by applications include NAGA (Network Assisted Genomic Analysis) (<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">Carlin et al., 2019</xref>), a web application and supporting service that uses NDEx in multiple capacities, and CRAVAT (Cancer-Related Analysis of Variants Toolkit; <xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">Masica et al., 2017</xref>), a toolkit for the interpretation of variants in the context of known mechanisms.</p>
    <p id="P9">As scientific analysis systems increasingly shift to the cloud, NDEx and Cytoscape are moving to a primarily cloud-based network analysis ecosystem, where containerized services, applications, and data resources are easily accessible and fully interoperable.</p>

    <title>BASIC PROTOCOL 1 GETTING STARTED WITH NDEX</title>
    <p id="P10">In this first protocol, we will introduce the fundamental aspects of the NDEx web user interface (hereafter, NDEx UI) and prepare the ground for the “real world” use cases presented in Basic Protocols 2, 3, and 4. You will learn to use the NDEx UI to search for networks, become familiar with the NDEx Network Viewer (NNV), and create your own NDEx account. NDEx accounts are free to use and provide you with 10 gigabytes of cloud storage space for your networks. It is not necessary to install the Cytoscape desktop application for this protocol, but it is required in Basic Protocol 2, so we recommend that you install the software now to avoid interruptions in the workflow. Here is a breakdown of the topics covered in this protocol:</p>

    <title>BASIC PROTOCOL 2 USING NDEx AND CYTOSCAPE IN A PUBLICATION-ORIENTED WORKFLOW</title>
    <p id="P88">As seen in the previous protocol, an NDEx account unlocks several features not available to anonymous users such as the ability to save networks, manage their visibility, or open them in Cytoscape for subsequent analysis, visual styling, and layout. In this second protocol, we will describe the NDEx features that support collaboration, peer-reviewed publication, and distribution of network models. You will learn how to connect Cytoscape with NDEx and export (save) a network to your NDEx account, share it with collaborators, and finally request a DOI to make your network accessible as a stable reference resource. Basic Protocol 2 uses one of the sample networks available in Cytoscape; however, we encourage you to follow the protocol using your own research network model if possible. If you are not familiar with the Cytoscape Desktop application, please refer to the manual at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://manual.cytoscape.org/en/stable/">https://manual.cytoscape.org/en/stable/</ext-link>.

    <title>BASIC PROTOCOL 3 WORKING WITH NDEx NETWORKS IN PYTHON</title>
    <p id="P124">Programmatic access and interactive display via Python, R, and JavaScript enable a broad range of applications in network analysis and visualization. The ndex2 Python client library provides a convenient wrapper around the NDEx server API: NDEx networks are transferred using the CX (Cytoscape Exchange) format and ndex2 includes the NiceCX Python object to simplify the use of CX data. As NiceCX does not provide common network manipulation functionality, for this purpose data is cast into other data models such as NetworkX or iGraph. This protocol consists of a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates how to use the ndex2 Python client and NiceCX class to perform the following operations:</p>

</p>
            <p id="P146">In this first step, you will import a public network from NDEx into the python environment. Every network in NDEx is assigned a Universal Unique ID (UUID) that can be used to reliably reference a specific network.

This allows you to work on the style of your network in Cytoscape using the interactive style editor, then save the network to NDEx for future use as a template. The NiceCX class provides a special method for this common operation, both downloading the template and copying the style to the target network. You specify the network to use as template by defining its UUID, and the apply_template() method copies the visual style and applies it to the ‘Sonic Hedgehog’ network you imported from NDEx in the previous step (<xref rid="F14" ref-type="fig">Fig. 14</xref>).</p>

            <p id="P153">NiceCX networks have a convenient one-step upload method. Saving a network to your account requires you to provide your NDEx ‘username’ and ‘password’. You will now save the ‘Sonic Hedgehog’ network with its colorful visual style to the NDEx account you created earlier on, in Basic Protocol 1.
</p>
            <p id="P154">You use the first three blocks of code (<xref rid="F15" ref-type="fig">Fig. 15</xref>) to set the credentials required to access your NDEx account.
<disp-quote id="Q26"><p id="P155">You will need the credentials (account name and password) of the NDEx account you created during Basic Protocol 1. Please have the credentials handy before moving forward with this protocol. Also, please be beware of typos and make sure you hit the ENTER key in each field to set the input value!</p></disp-quote>
</p>
            <p id="P156">The fourth block of code assigns a new name to your network and saves it to your account using the upload_to() method. The function returns the URL of the network’s RAW JSON, which you can use to generate a clickable URL to visualize your new network.
<disp-quote id="Q27"><p id="P157">Your new network is saved to your NDEx account as a ‘private’ network, so when you click the link to visualize it, you will be asked to login unless you already have a browser window opened and you are logged in to your NDEx account.</p></disp-quote>

            <p id="P159">Apply a layout.
</p>
            <p id="P160">The ndex2 client and NiceCX class do not provide network manipulation functionalities; for such operations, the data must first be cast into a different data model, in this case a NetworkX object (<xref rid="F16" ref-type="fig">Fig. 16</xref>).
</p>
            <p id="P161">In the first block of code, you start from our NiceCX network and generate a NetworkX object using the NiceCX to_networkx() method; then, you use the NetworkX spiral_layout() method to assign positions to the nodes. The result of the layout operation is a Python dictionary of positions keyed by node IDs that you assign to the variable ‘pos’. You can display the network with the new layout using the NetworkX draw method, passing in the NetworkX object and dictionary of positions.
</p>
            <p id="P162">To apply the new layout to our NiceCX network, you need to transform the NetworkX positions into a CX cartesianLayout aspect. This is achieved in the second block of code by iterating through the dictionary of positions to create a list of Cartesian coordinates that you then apply to the NiceCX network via the set_opaque_aspect() method.
<disp-quote id="Q28"><p id="P163">The minus sign in front of the ‘y’ coordinates in line 7 (<xref rid="F16" ref-type="fig">Fig. 16</xref>) is required to ensure that the layout of your NiceCX network will be identical to what you previewed when drawing the NetworkX network in the previous block of code. The reason for this is that NetworkX uses one convention for the zero position of Cartesian coordinates (zero at bottom left) while Cytoscape/cytoscape.js/CX use another (zero at top right). So, omitting the minus sign in line 7 would result in a NiceCX network with a vertically flipped layout (<xref rid="F17" ref-type="fig">Fig. 17</xref>). You can experiment yourself by removing the minus sign and saving a new copy of the network, then compare it with the previous one.</p></disp-quote></p>

You will now update the ‘Sonic Hedgehog colorful (ndex2)’ network you saved in step 3 above with its updated version boasting the new spiral layout (<xref rid="F18" ref-type="fig">Fig. 18</xref>) and display it in the notebook.
<disp-quote id="Q29"><p id="P166">The target network to be updated is specified by its UUID, and this MUST be the first argument passed to the update_to() method.</p></disp-quote>

      <title>Background Information</title>
      <p id="P168">As seen in the three protocols described above, NDEx provides a convenient way to store network models in the cloud in a safe and easily accessible manner. Users can decide to use NDEx anonymously, as a resource where they can find and query a variety of networks; alternatively, they can create a free account, get 10 gigabytes of cloud storage space, and unlock many additional features only available to registered users. All these features aim to simplify network biology workflows by allowing seamless communication between data resources and other services/applications, by providing interactive access to data, and by promoting its immediate use and re-use in an intuitive, transparent manner. In this respect, NDEx advocates and fully supports FAIR data principles. One of the most important workflows for scientists is that related to publishing their research findings; NDEx can simplify pre-publication collaboration between researchers, provide live data access to reviewers during the peer-review process, and turn network models into permanent, archival resources by minting DOIs. Hence, the NDEx infrastructure is a useful asset not only for the individual researcher, but also for the larger or-ganization that can use it as publishing and distribution channel for its scientific data output.</p>

      <title>Critical Parameters</title>
      <p id="P169">The NDEx UI and ndex2 Python client communicate with the NDEx server via the internet; it is therefore of critical importance that you use a fast, stable broadband connection to the internet when working with networks in NDEx. The NDEx UI and Python client are capable of catching errors and ex-ceptions, and present users with clear, under-standable error messages; however, sometime networking errors happen that neither the user nor the software have control over; if you encounter any problems while executing op-erations that you have already executed suc-cessfully before, please try resetting your internet connection, or try again later. In addition, some convenience features in the NDEx UI require certain conditions to be met. For example, in order to use the “Open in Cytoscape” feature, you must have Cytoscape installed on your machine, running and accessing its default port (1234).</p>

The interface lets users add/modify metadata to annotate their networks; for example, users can control a network’s visibility or version, specify a published reference, and select a license. The NDEx score at the top of the page is a measure of the degree of annotation of the network and is used to rank the network in search results: the more the properties are annotated, the higher the score, the better the rank in search results.</p>
