        <p id="Par1">Deep learning has emerged as a versatile approach for predicting complex biological phenomena. However, its utility for biological discovery has so far been limited, given that generic deep neural networks provide little insight into the biological mechanisms that underlie a successful prediction. Here we demonstrate deep learning on biological networks, where every node has a molecular equivalent, such as a protein or gene, and every edge has a mechanistic interpretation, such as a regulatory interaction along a signaling pathway.</p>

        <title>Results</title>
        <p id="Par2">With knowledge-primed neural networks (KPNNs), we exploit the ability of deep learning algorithms to assign meaningful weights in multi-layered networks, resulting in a widely applicable approach for interpretable deep learning. We present a learning method that enhances the interpretability of trained KPNNs by stabilizing node weights in the presence of redundancy, enhancing the quantitative interpretability of node weights, and controlling for uneven connectivity in biological networks. We validate KPNNs on simulated data with known ground truth and demonstrate their practical use and utility in five biological applications with single-cell RNA-seq data for cancer and immune cells.</p>

    <title>Introduction</title>
    <p id="Par4">Deep learning using artificial neural networks (ANNs) has reached unprecedented prediction performance for complex tasks in multiple fields, including image recognition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], speech recognition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], natural language processing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], board and computer games [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], and autonomous driving [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. There is tremendous potential for deep learning in biology and medicine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], as illustrated by initial applications in medical image classification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], brain image segmentation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], epigenome prediction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], DNA/RNA binding analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], and RNA splicing inference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Recently, deep learning has also shown promising results in the analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) datasets, facilitated by large single-cell datasets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].</p>
    <p id="Par5">For certain specialized tasks with ample training data, ANNs already achieve prediction performance superior to that of human experts. However, the trained ANNs typically lack interpretability, i.e., the ability to provide human-understandable, high-level explanations of how they transform inputs (prediction attributes) into outputs (predicted class values). This lack of interpretability is a major limitation to the wider application of deep learning in biology and medicine—not only because it reduces trust and confidence in using such predictions for high-stakes applications such as clinical diagnostics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], but also because it misses important opportunities for data-driven biological discovery using deep learning.</p>
    <p id="Par6">Pioneering research aimed at making deep learning models interpretable and informative for biological applications focused primarily on ex post analysis of trained ANNs, for example by identifying inputs that result in specific predictions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] or by analyzing the compressed layers of autoencoders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. A complementary approach is the ex ante engineering of deep learning architectures for built-in biological interpretability, for example by including domain knowledge from structural biology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>], biophysical regulation of transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>], gene annotations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>], cancer growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>], genetic screens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>], or by combining knowledge from different domains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>].</p>
    <p id="Par7">Here we demonstrate the feasibility of deep learning on biological networks, including signaling pathways and gene-regulatory networks. We introduce knowledge-primed neural networks (KPNNs) as a broadly applicable framework for interpretable deep learning and biological discovery. We construct KPNNs from public annotation data for cellular signaling and transcription regulation, such that each node corresponds to a protein or a gene, and each edge corresponds to a regulatory relationship that has been documented in biological databases. We train the KPNNs based on single-cell RNA-seq data for the cell type or biological model of interest, using an optimized learning method that enhances the biological interpretability of the trained models.</p>
    <p id="Par8">Conceptually, we conceive cells as living “information processing units” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>] that perform network-based “biological calculations” to regulate cell state [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. KPNNs are designed to perform similar calculations in silico, predicting cell state from single-cell RNA-seq data in deep neural networks that are constructed based on biological knowledge. Because KPNNs capture key aspects of the cell’s regulatory machinery, we hypothesize that KPNN learning will give rise to interpretable models. To enable interpretability, we exploit three modifications to generic deep learning that enhance the interpretability of KPNNs: (i) repeated network training with random deletion of hidden nodes (a technique known as dropout [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]), which yields robust results in the presence of network redundancy; (ii) dropout on input data in order to enhance quantitative interpretability of node weights; and (iii) training on control inputs to normalize for the uneven connectivity of biological networks.</p>
    <p id="Par9">We validate KPNNs for interpretable deep learning using simulated data with known ground truth, we compare them to other machine learning algorithms including the ex post biological interpretation of feature weights, and we demonstrate the practical use of KPNNs in five biological applications with publicly available single-cell RNA-seq datasets: T cell receptor signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>], immune cells in the Human Cell Atlas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>], clinical subtypes of Langerhans cell histiocytosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>], cancer cell development in acute myeloid leukemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>], and cancer cell subtypes in glioblastoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. Overall, our results establish KPNNs as a new form of interpretable deep learning that may be broadly useful for biological discovery based on large-scale datasets.</p>

      <title>KPNNs establish deep learning on biological networks</title>
      <p id="Par10">Deep learning using artificial neural networks (ANNs) seeks to “learn” (i.e., approximate in a generalizable way) the complex relationship between a set of prediction attributes (e.g., single-cell transcriptomes) and the corresponding class values (e.g., cell states). The learning process typically starts from a generic, fully connected, feedforward ANN—which is a directed acyclic graph organized in layers such that each node receives input from all nodes in the previous layer and sends its output to all nodes in the next layer. During the learning process, edge weights are randomly initiated and then updated iteratively based on training data, seeking to improve the accuracy with which the ANN transforms the inputs into corresponding class values. With enough training data, large multi-layer ANNs can learn highly complex relationships between prediction attributes and class values, without requiring any prior domain knowledge. However, the resulting trained ANNs lack interpretability, given that their nodes, edges, and weights do not correspond to meaningful domain concepts.</p>
      <p id="Par11">To overcome the lack of interpretability of deep learning on ANNs, we sought to embed relevant biological domain knowledge directly into the neural networks that are trained by deep learning (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). To that end, we replaced the fully connected ANNs of generic deep learning with networks derived from prior knowledge of biological networks, thereby creating “knowledge-primed neural networks” (KPNNs). In KPNNs, each node corresponds to a protein or a gene, and each edge corresponds to a potential regulatory relationship that has previously been observed in any biological context and annotated in public databases. By integrating a broad range of previously documented regulatory relationships, we thus assume that most regulatory relationships relevant to the biological system of interest have already been observed in other contexts, and we use deep learning on KPNNs to contextualize this prior knowledge with single-cell RNA-seq training data for the investigated biological system.
<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Interpretable deep learning with knowledge-primed neural networks (KPNNs). Deep learning provides a powerful method for predicting cell states from gene expression profiles. However, generic artificial neural networks (ANNs, top row) are “black boxes” that provide little insight into the biology that underlies a successful prediction – for two reasons: (i) hidden nodes and edges in an ANN have no biological equivalent, which makes it difficult assign a biological interpretation to the weights of a fitted ANN model, and (ii) ANNs are inherently instable, and very different networks can achieve similar prediction performance. Knowledge-primed neural networks (KPNNs, bottom row) enable interpretable deep learning on biological networks by exploiting structural analogies between biological networks (such as the signaling pathways and gene-regulatory networks that regulate cell state) and the feed-forward neural networks used for deep learning. In KPNNs, each network node corresponds to a protein or a gene, and each edge corresponds to a potential regulatory relationship that has been observed and annotated in public databases. Weights within the KPNN are obtained by a deep learning method that has been optimized for interpretability, and the learned weights are interpreted as estimates of the regulatory importance of the corresponding signaling protein or transcription factor</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13059_2020_2100_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p>
      <p id="Par12">We constructed KPNNs to reflect the typical flow of information in cells, where signals are transduced from receptors via signaling proteins to transcription factors, which in turn induce changes in gene expression. The expression levels of the regulated genes were used as input nodes, whose values can be measured by single-cell RNA-seq. Signaling proteins and transcription factors were modeled as hidden nodes, and we infer the corresponding node weights during the learning process. Finally, receptors constitute the output nodes of the KPNN, capturing phenotypic cell states and the ability of individual cells to interact with their environment.</p>
      <p id="Par13">KPNNs can be trained in much the same way as ANNs (see the “<xref rid="Sec10" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref>” section for details), based on single-cell RNA-seq data for cells in different states (e.g., subtypes of cancer and immune cells) or under different environmental exposures (e.g., receptor-stimulated vs unstimulated cells). After successful completion of the learning process, each fitted edge weight is taken as an indicator for the relevance of the corresponding regulatory relationship in the investigated biological system. We then derive node weights from the edge weights, in order to identify signaling proteins and transcription factors that are likely relevant in this biological system. KPNNs thus exploit the ability of deep learning algorithms to assign meaningful weights across multiple hidden layers in KPNNs, thereby identifying and prioritizing relevant regulatory proteins for experimental validation and biological interpretation.</p>
      <p id="Par14">As the first biological test case for interpretable deep learning using KPNNs, we chose our recent single-cell RNA-seq dataset measuring cellular response to T cell receptor (TCR) stimulation in a standardized in vitro model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. The TCR signaling pathway, which orchestrates the transcriptional response to antigen detection in T cells, is well-suited for evaluating our method, given the pathway’s complexity and its well-characterized nature. To construct a dedicated TCR KPNN (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S1a), we connected the TCR (output node) to gene expression (input nodes) via shortest paths through a network of protein signaling and gene-regulatory interactions (hidden nodes). The resulting network was then reversed and trained to predict TCR stimulation from single-cell RNA-seq data: Gene expression (input nodes) provides the input for transcription factors (hidden nodes), whose outputs are used by signaling proteins (hidden nodes) to predict TCR stimulation (output node).</p>
      <p id="Par15">Deep learning on the TCR KPNN provided high prediction accuracy comparable to that of deep learning on ANNs (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S1b-c), despite the KPNN’s much lower number of edges (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S1d-f). Specifically, KPNNs predicted TCR stimulation with a median receiver operating characteristic (ROC) area under curve (AUC) value of 0.984 (interquartile range, 0.979 to 0.987), while ANNs with the same number of nodes (and many more edges) achieved a median ROC AUC value of 0.948 to 0.985 (interquartile range, 0.936 to 0.988 across all analyses; 0.938 to 0.989 for the best-performing number of network layers).</p>
      <p id="Par16">In summary, we have demonstrated that deep learning on KPNNs is practically feasible and that it can achieve comparable accuracies to deep learning on ANNs. These results hold the promise that deep learning on biological networks may yield trained network models that are both accurate and biologically interpretable.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="Sec4">
      <title>A biology-based network structure enables KPNN interpretability</title>
      <p id="Par17">To understand how the network structure of KPNNs may contribute to interpretable deep learning, we performed a systematic network analysis comparing the TCR KPNN with corresponding ANNs. As expected, the KPNN was much sparser than ANNs with the same number of nodes. For example, the best-performing ANN had 151-fold more edges than the KPNN (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S1d-f). However, the most striking differences between the KPNN and the corresponding ANNs referred to the structural properties of these networks.</p>
      <p id="Par18">When we compared the KPNN to fully connected ANNs with the same number of nodes (fANN) and to sparse ANNs with the same number of edges as the KPNN (sANN, see the “<xref rid="Sec10" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref>” section for details), the KPNN contained many deep connections (“shortcuts”), contrasting with the strictly layered network architecture of the ANNs (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a, Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S2a). Because each node in the fully connected ANNs is connected to all nodes of both the previous and the following layer, the distance from a given node to any node of the input layer is the same, depending only on the node’s layer. In contrast, distances in the KPNN differed widely due to the presence of shortcuts that connect certain parts of the network much more directly with the input layer.
<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Comparative structural network analysis of KPNNs and ANNs. The TCR KPNN is compared to a fully connected ANN (fANN) with the same number of nodes and the same median depth as the KPNN, and to sparse ANNs (sANNs) where edges were randomly removed to match the edge number of the KPNN while retaining an intact network (results are shown for 50 random sANNs). <bold>a</bold> Average distance to the input nodes for all hidden nodes in the fANN (top) and KPNN (bottom). <bold>b</bold> Cumulative distribution of the outdegree of hidden nodes in the KPNN, the fANN, and averaged across the sANNs. <bold>c</bold> Assessment of network sensitivity to fragmentation upon removal of important edges in the KPNN, the fANN, and the sANNs.

      <p id="Par19">The KPNN was further characterized by unique patterns of network connectedness. Most notably, the distribution of node outdegrees (the outdegree measures the number of edges that leave a node) resembled an exponential distribution for the KPNN, while all nodes in the ANNs were connected to the same (constant) number of other nodes (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b, Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S2b-c). This approximately scale-free nature of the KPNN derives in part from the presence of highly connected “hubs” in biological networks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>], which link many nodes with lower connectivity. As a result of these connectivity patterns, the KPNN showed higher modularity than the ANNs, which is evident from its higher sensitivity to fragmentation upon edge removal compared to fully connected ANNs, and even to sparse ANNs (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>c, Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S2d).</p>
      <p id="Par20">The sparseness and modularity of KPNNs restrict individual hidden nodes in their access to input data via direct or indirect network connections to the input nodes. To quantify the amount of information available to each hidden node, we calculated the network reachability as the number of input nodes that a given hidden node can access through the network. Strikingly, most hidden nodes in the KPNN were connected only to a small fraction of input nodes. Such restrictions in the access to input data were much less pronounced in edge-matched sparse ANNs and absent from fully connected ANNs (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>d, Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S2e).</p>
      <p id="Par21">In summary, the network structure of KPNNs deviates from that of generic ANNs by incorporating key properties of biological networks, such as a sparse modular architecture and hierarchy-skipping shortcuts. KPNNs have fewer free parameters that are optimized by deep learning. Moreover, every node and every edge within a KPNN has a corresponding biological interpretation. The characteristic network architecture of KPNNs is therefore expected to benefit their biological interpretability.</p>

      <title>An optimized learning method enhances KPNN interpretability</title>
      <p id="Par22">Complementing the characteristic network structure of KPNNs, we developed an optimized learning method that enhances the interpretability of trained KPNN models. The learning method for KPNNs resembles those commonly used for deep learning on ANNs. In a nutshell, edge weights are iteratively updated until they reflect the relationship of input data (i.e., single-cell RNA-seq profiles) to the network output (i.e., class values representing cell states or environmental exposures) throughout the structure of hidden nodes. Subsequently, we calculate hidden node weights from the edge weights, and we interpret these node weights as measures of importance of the corresponding signaling protein or transcription factor in the investigated biological system.</p>
      <p id="Par23">When we applied generic deep learning (as described in detail in the “<xref rid="Sec10" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref>” section) to KPNNs instead of ANNs, we obtained high prediction accuracies (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S1b-c). However, we identified three recurrent challenges to interpreting the learned models: (i) low reproducibility in the presence of network redundancy, (ii) lack of quantitative interpretability (i.e., node weights fail to quantitatively reflect the predictive power of individual nodes), and (iii) uneven connectivity inherent to biological networks, which affects node weights independent of training data. To address these issues, we conceptualized and validated several modifications of the learning method, which jointly enhance the interpretability of KPNNs.</p>
      <p id="Par24">First, biological networks are characterized by widespread redundancy, for example when one protein regulates another protein via two separate signaling pathways. Such redundancy can result in a lack of reproducibility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>], such that KPNNs with widely different edge weights may achieve similar prediction performance as the result of cost functions with multiple local minima. To illustrate this problem and to demonstrate our solution, we simulated a series of simple gene-regulatory networks with matched training data (see the “<xref rid="Sec10" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref>” section for details). We first engineered a network without any node redundancy, performed model fitting, and then calculated node weights. In this redundancy-free network, node weights accurately reflected the information flow that we embedded into the network (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a). However, when we introduced redundancy into the network and repeatedly trained the model, generic deep learning resulted in node weights that were highly variable, and node weights of redundant nodes were inversely correlated across network replicates (<italic>R</italic> = − 0.79, Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>b). Repeated KPNN training thus yielded inconsistent and uninterpretable results when using generic deep learning.

      <p id="Par25">To address this issue and to obtain robust, interpretable node weights in the presence of widespread network redundancy, we incorporated random dropout of hidden nodes into our learning method. When networks are trained with dropout, a given percentage of nodes is randomly selected and “dropped” (i.e., set to zero) for each sample and training step. Deep learning with dropout was originally proposed as a strategy to improve the generalizability of ANNs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. We found that random dropout of hidden nodes dramatically improved consistency of node weights across KPNN replicates, resulting in an almost perfect correlation of weights for redundant nodes (<italic>R</italic> = 0.99, Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>c) and an improved overall correlation of node weights between network replicates (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S3). These results demonstrate that dropout of hidden nodes forces deep learning to spread weights across the network instead of depending on individual nodes, which improves robustness.</p>
      <p id="Par26">Second, we found that node weights obtained using generic deep learning did not adequately reflect quantitative differences in the predictive power of individual nodes. We illustrate this issue with a simulated network comprising three strongly predictive hidden nodes (each of these nodes was connected to several predictive input nodes) and three weakly predictive hidden nodes (each of these nodes was connected to just one predictive input node). Using generic deep learning, this difference was not reflected in the trained node weights (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>d). We thus introduced dropout of input nodes into the learning method (in addition to dropout of hidden nodes), thereby forcing the learning to spread weights across input nodes. As a result, we indeed observed much-improved and robust quantitative interpretability, with a clear difference in node weights between nodes with different predictive power (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>e). This result was robust toward mistakes in the network structure (false positives and false negatives), which we confirmed by shuffling a subset of randomly selected edges (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S4).</p>
      <p id="Par27">Third, uneven connectivity in biological networks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>] affects node weights in trained KPNNs independently of the input data, for example resulting in structurally inflated weights for central, well-connected nodes. To illustrate this effect, we simulated a network with 12 hidden nodes organized into a top layer (nodes A and B) and a bottom layer (nodes 1 to 10). We constructed this network with uneven connectivity, such that one of the top-level nodes is connected to a higher number of nodes than the other (A, 2 nodes; B, 8 nodes). We then trained with control inputs that were equivalent across input nodes, simulated such that all input nodes predicted the output equally well. Networks trained with these control inputs were biased by the underlying network structure: The strongly connected node B received a higher node weight than the weakly connected node A, and the central nodes of the top layer (node A and B) received higher node weights than the peripheral nodes of the bottom layer (nodes 1 to 10) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>f).</p>
      <p id="Par28">To normalize for uneven connectivity in KPNNs, we compared models that were trained on the actual simulated data—resulting in node weights that reflect both the simulated biological signal and the effect of uneven connectivity (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>g), to models trained on control inputs—resulting in node weights that solely reflect network connectivity (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>f). By comparing node weights between these two models, we can quantify the degree to which a given node is more or less important than expected based on the network structure. The resulting “differential node weights” thus provide a normalized measure of node importance in the training data that is adjusted for the influence of network structure on trained node weights. Differential node weights clearly distinguished the data-driven and the network-driven weights of node A (with two out of two downstream nodes predictive) and node B (with only one out of five downstream nodes predictive) in our simulation (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>h).</p>
      <p id="Par29">In summary, we introduced three methodological advances for interpretable deep learning on KPNNs: training with hidden node dropout enhances robustness of node weights in the presence of network redundancy, input node dropout distinguishes between strongly predictive and weakly predictive nodes, and the calculation of node weights based on control inputs allows us to normalize for the effect of uneven connectivity in biological networks. Together with the sparse structure of KPNNs and the fact that every node and every edge in the KPNNs has a corresponding biological interpretation, this learning method fosters interpretable deep learning on biological networks.</p>

      <title>KPNNs infer a regulatory model of T cell receptor stimulation</title>
      <p id="Par30">When we trained the TCR KPNN with our optimized learning method, based on single-cell RNA-seq data for TCR stimulated vs unstimulated Jurkat cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>], we obtained high prediction accuracies (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>a), comparable to those obtained by generic deep learning on KPNNs and on ANNs (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S1b). Moreover, we indeed observed the anticipated boost in biological interpretability of the trained KPNN model (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>b-d).
<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><p>KPNN analysis of T cell receptor (TCR) stimulation. <bold>a</bold> Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves for the TCR KPNN, predicting TCR stimulation based on single-cell RNA-seq profiles with different levels of dropout.

      <p id="Par31">The introduction of dropout in our optimized learning method improved the reproducibility across network replicates, giving rise to highly consistent model interpretations (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S5). Moreover, we observed broader spreading of high node weights across the network, as illustrated by an animation of the learning process (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Supplementary Video <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">1</xref>). This gain in robustness was most pronounced between 0 and 10% dropout, with little impact on prediction performance up to 30% dropout (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>a, Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S6). We thus selected a conservative dropout rate of 10% for further analysis, which resulted in a median node weight correlation of 0.912 (interquartile range 0.814 to 0.961), compared to 0.737 without dropout (interquartile range 0.608 to 0.854). Prediction performance was maintained with a median ROC AUC value of 0.982 with dropout (interquartile range 0.977 to 0.987), compared to 0.984 without dropout (interquartile range 0.979 to 0.987).</p>
      <p id="Par32">Node weights were normalized for uneven connectivity in the TCR signaling network by calculating differential node weights against the TCR KPNN trained on control inputs (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>b, Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>: Table S1). The resulting differential node weights identified key regulators of TCR signaling such as the NF-κB1:RELA (p65:p50) transcription factor complex, its subunits RELA and NF-κB1, and the p38α MAP kinase MAPK14. Moreover, regulators with high differential node weights were enriched for MAP kinase pathways (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S7, Additional file <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>: Table S2), which are known to be involved in TCR signaling and immune response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>].</p>
      <p id="Par33">The regulators of TCR signaling identified by our analysis formed a subnetwork within the KPNN (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>c). This subnetwork includes many regulators linked to TCR signaling, such as the transcription factors CREBBP, CREB1, and ATF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>], as well as the kinases RPS6KA4 and RPS6KA5, which regulate transcription factors downstream of MAPK signaling. It further comprises the well-established T cell regulators STAT3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>], STAT4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>], HDAC1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>], TCF3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>], and RUNX1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>]. The KPNN-derived subnetwork also includes MYC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>] and the PRC2 subunits EZH2 and SUZ12 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>], which are general regulators of hematopoiesis and T cell development. In contrast, ZAP70 and TCR were not part of this subnetwork—given their location at the apex of the KPNN, these two nodes received the highest possible weights for both the actual data and the control inputs.</p>
      <p id="Par34">Importantly, our analysis of the TCR dataset reinforced and validated key design decisions of our modified learning method. First, dropout dramatically enhanced the consistency of the learned node weights (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>a). Our chosen dropout rate of 10% was further validated by the fact that it resulted in the strongest enrichment for genes and proteins with a known role in TCR signaling (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S7). Second, normalization for the effect of uneven network connectivity was essential to obtain meaningful node weights, given that the structure of the TCR signaling network would otherwise dominate over the relevant biological information contained in the single-cell sequencing data (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S8).</p>
      <p id="Par35">To evaluate the effect of the introduced prior knowledge on the trained models, we compared the original TCR KPNN to a series of control KPNNs with randomized connectivity but retained global network structure, which we generated by random edge shuffling. The control KPNNs generally showed reduced prediction performance compared to the TCR KPNN (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S9a). The node weights in the control networks were equally dissimilar from each other as they were from the TCR KPNN, although a weak positive correlation remained (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S9b-c), indicating that random edge shuffling alone is insufficient to purge all biological network structure from the control networks. Indeed, when we trained the control networks on the TCR dataset or on the control inputs without normalization, they showed similar enrichment for known TCR signaling regulators as the TCR KPNN (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S9d-e). However, differential node weights placed the TCR KPNN among the networks with the strongest enrichment for known TCR signaling regulators (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S9f), and those control networks with similar enrichment were notably similar to the TCR KPNN (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S9g), suggesting that they retain the enrichment because of this similarity. Overall, these results reinforce the relevance of biological network structure for interpretable deep learning using KPNNs.</p>
      <p id="Par36">Finally, we benchmarked the KPNN against other machine learning algorithms, both in terms of prediction performance and biological interpretability. When we trained elastic nets, random forests, support vector machines, and neural networks on the TCR dataset, we observed high prediction performance for all methods (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S10a). In contrast, we found little overlap between the network-based interpretations of the KPNN and the interpretations based on input features weights that were obtained from the other machine learning algorithms (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S10b-c). For example, the NF-κB and MAP kinase regulators identified by the KPNN were not detected by any of the other algorithms. This observation is expected and reassuring given that KPNN interpretability seeks to uncover signaling proteins and transcription factors with cell-state-specific biological activity at the protein level; such factors are not necessarily differentially expressed at the RNA level (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>d) and therefore not detected by conventional algorithms (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S10d).</p>
      <p id="Par37">In summary, interpretable deep learning with KPNNs uncovered a subnetwork of TCR-related regulators relevant to the specific biological system that we investigated here. We thus exploited single-cell RNA-seq data to contextualize a much broader network of potential regulators that may be linked to TCR signaling based on public databases. We also compared KPNNs with alternative machine learning methods and found that the latter could not identify signaling proteins and transcription factors that have important regulatory roles but are not differentially expressed.</p>

      <title>KPNNs are broadly useful for interpretable deep learning on single-cell RNA-seq data</title>
      <p id="Par38">Having established and validated KPNNs on simulated data and on the TCR dataset, we sought to apply our method to a wider spectrum of biological questions. To that end, we obtained recently published single-cell RNA-seq datasets of cancer and immune cells from the Human Cell Atlas and other sources, and we derived a generalized KPNN that does not require prior knowledge of the receptors and signaling pathways relevant to the biological system of interest (this is in contrast to the TCR KPNN, where T cell receptor activity was designated a priori as the output node). The resulting “GEN KPNN” integrates signaling pathways and gene-regulatory interactions from public databases into a single network that is directly useful for interpretable deep learning and compatible with a broad range of single-cell RNA-seq datasets.</p>
      <p id="Par39">We constructed the GEN KPNN (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S11, see the “<xref rid="Sec10" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref>” section for details) by connecting multiple cell surface receptors via shortest paths through a network of protein signaling and gene-regulatory interactions (hidden nodes) to the gene expression profiles that are measured by single-cell RNA-seq (input nodes). We introduced dataset-specific output nodes that represent the sample annotations of interest for the corresponding dataset (e.g., cell type or disease state), and we connected each of these output nodes to all cell surface receptors, reflecting the concept that phenotypic cell states can be captured by the ability of individual cells to interact with their cellular environment. The resulting GEN KPNN showed very similar network properties as the TCR KPNN (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S12), suggesting that it enables interpretable deep learning in the same way as described for the TCR KPNN.</p>
      <p id="Par40">First, we applied the GEN KPNN to a large reference dataset from the Human Cell Atlas (HCA) comprising 483,084 immune cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. This dataset contains T cells, B cells, and monocytes, each derived from two sample sources, bone marrow and cord blood. Given that the differences between immune cell types have already been studied extensively, we focused instead on differences between cells obtained from bone marrow vs cord blood. To that end, we trained the GEN KPNN to predict cell type from gene expression, separately for single-cell transcriptome profiles of 262,895 immune cells from bone marrow and 220,189 immune cells from cord blood. The KPNN achieved high prediction performance (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S13a), similar to other machine learning methods previously used to predict cell types from single-cell RNA-seq data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>], and it enabled us to systematically compare gene-regulatory mechanisms for bone marrow and cord blood.</p>
      <p id="Par41">Hidden nodes with higher weight for bone marrow-derived cells comprised key regulators of cell fate, including SOX2, KLF5, KLF4, MYC, KRAS, and POU5F1, and they were enriched for key aspects of development, proliferation, and pluripotency (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>a, Additional file <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref>: Table S3, Additional file <xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media">6</xref>: Table S4). In contrast, hidden nodes with higher weight for cord blood-derived cells comprised regulators associated with functions of mature immune cells, including multiple MAP kinases and protein phosphatases, and they were enriched for pathways such as T cell receptor signaling, B cell receptor signaling, B cell activation, and innate immune response. Moreover, we observed a striking difference between STAT2 (more important in bone marrow) and STAT4 (more important in cord blood). Both proteins are part of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>], and STAT2 is well-known for its role in type I interferon signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>], while STAT4 is primarily linked to IL-12 signaling and T helper cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>]. The KPNN thus indicates that STAT2 plays a more prominent role in developing cells of the bone marrow, while STAT4 is more relevant for mature cord blood-derived cells.

      <p id="Par42">We observed similar differences between RUNX3 (more important in bone marrow) and RUNX2 (more important in cord blood), consistent with reports that RUNX3 is critical for early T cell development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>], while RUNX2 has been implicated in more mature roles of T cells including thymic development and viral response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>]. Our KPNN analysis thus identified more developmentally immature B cells, T cells, and monocytes in bone marrow compared to cord blood. Importantly, these observations were not due to differences among hematopoietic stem cells, which were not included in our analysis. Rather, they capture gene-regulatory differences among the bulk of B cells, T cells, and monocytes between these two immune cell compartments.</p>
      <p id="Par43">Second, we explored the utility of the GEN KPNN for analyzing disease-associated cell states in Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH), a rare developmental disorder that combines relevant aspects of a cancer and of an autoinflammatory disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>]. Based on a recently published single-cell RNA-seq analysis of LCH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>], we trained the GEN KPNN to distinguish between progenitor-like and mature LCH cell populations described previously. We obtained separate KPNN models for (i) bone-derived LCH cells from patients with relatively benign single-system disease and (ii) skin-derived LCH cells from patients with aggressive multi-system disease. The KPNN achieved high prediction performance for this dataset (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S13b), thereby enabling a meaningful comparison of hidden node weights between the two fitted models (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>b and Additional file <xref rid="MOESM7" ref-type="media">7</xref>: Table S5). Several of the identified regulators of LCH cells in bone were related to cell growth and differentiation, including YY1, SUZ12, MYC and MYCN, and GATA1. In contrast, LCH cells in the skin were characterized by high regulatory importance assigned to signaling proteins, including almost all JAK and STAT proteins (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>b). These results identify inflammatory signaling through the JAK/STAT pathway as a potential contributor to aggressive multi-system LCH in the skin.</p>
      <p id="Par44">Third, we investigated cellular differentiation hierarchies in a single-cell RNA-seq dataset of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), a hematopoietic cancer that is characterized by extensive cellular heterogeneity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. We trained the GEN KPNN to distinguish leukemic cells from healthy controls at four stages of myeloid differentiation: Hematopoietic stem cells (CD34+EGR1+), progenitor cells (CD34+EGR1−), granulocyte-macrophage precursors (CD34−CD14−), and monocytes (CD34−CD14+). The KPNN achieved high prediction performance for distinguishing between leukemic and non-leukemic cells at all four stages (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S13c). Comparing the hidden node weights of the trained KPNNs, we identified an iterative increase in the number of differentially regulated factors for each stage of the differentiation hierarchy (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>c and Additional file <xref rid="MOESM8" ref-type="media">8</xref>: Table S6). Moreover, monocytes showed very different regulatory patterns compared to the three types of progenitor cells. For example, we found that the receptor tyrosine kinase FLT3 had a greater role in leukemic progenitors (but not in leukemic monocytes) compared to their normal counterparts, consistent with the known oncogenic role of FLT3 and its association with poor disease prognosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref>]. Similar patterns were observed for the proto-oncogenes KIT and STAT5B, which are closely linked to AML-specific signaling via FLT3 and the JAK/STAT pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">81</xref>]. In contrast, leukemic monocytes were characterized by increased importance of the transcription factors MYC, NFKB1, and NPM1, all of which have been implicated in AML biology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">82</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">84</xref>]. These results indicate striking regulatory differences between progenitor cells and differentiated cells in AML.</p>
      <p id="Par45">Fourth, we focused on glioblastoma, a brain cancer characterized by molecularly defined subtypes that tend to co-exist in the same tumors. Based on recently published single-cell RNA-seq data of glioblastoma patient samples [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>], we trained the GEN KPNN to differentiate between four cell states: astrocyte-like cells (AC), mesenchymal-like cells (MES), neural progenitor-like cells (NPC), and oligodendrocyte progenitor-like cells (OPC). We observed high prediction accuracy for all pairwise comparisons (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S13d). The trained KPNN models recapitulated characteristic molecular differences between glioblastoma cell states (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>d, Additional file <xref rid="MOESM9" ref-type="media">9</xref>: Table S7, Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S13d), including an association of HIF1A regulatory importance with MES cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">85</xref>] and of ERBB2 with NPC cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86">86</xref>]. We also uncovered novel associations such as an elevated regulatory importance of NOTCH signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87">87</xref>] in MES and NPC, and of RUNX2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">88</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90">90</xref>] in AC and OPC. Furthermore, OPC and NPC were characterized by high regulatory importance of protein degradation through CUL4A and its complexes, AC and MES showed a strong role of DLX5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">91</xref>] related signaling, and AC was characterized by pronounced regulatory importance of TP53 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92">92</xref>] and LEF1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR93">93</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR94">94</xref>]. More generally, the trained KPNNs constitute regulatory network models for all four glioblastoma cell subtypes, which confirmed and extended previous claims of greater pairwise similarity between AC and MES, and between OPC and NPC, than for the other combinations of cell states.</p>
      <p id="Par46">In summary, we created a generalized KPNN that incorporates cell surface receptors, signaling pathways, and gene-regulatory interactions into a single network that is directly applicable to a broad range of biological questions, and we demonstrated its utility on four single-cell RNA-seq datasets. We found that interpretable deep learning with KPNNs was practical even for large single-cell atlases, achieved high prediction accuracies for distinguishing between cell states, and uncovered characteristic regulatory differences for a range of applications in immunity and cancer biology. These results establish KPNNs as a widely useful method for biological discovery, as it combines the interpretability of biological networks with the power of deep learning.</p>

    <title>Discussion</title>
    <p id="Par47">Deep learning has great potential for predictive analysis of biological phenomena, but its utility for scientific discovery is reduced by the “black box” character of the learned models. Indeed, even for highly predictive deep learning models, it is often difficult to derive human-understandable descriptions of the patterns that enabled successful predictions. To address this shortcoming, interpretable deep learning has emerged as an active area of machine learning research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95">95</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96">96</xref>], which has focused primarily on the ex post interpretation and reverse-engineering of trained models. For example, it is possible to visualize what ANNs trained for image recognition “see” when they classify a picture as a cat or a house [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97">97</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99">99</xref>], or to extract DNA sequence motifs that are predictive of tissue-specific enhancer regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100">100</xref>]. In the current study, we propose, implement, and validate a very different approach. We show that deep learning can be performed on biological networks, where each node corresponds to a protein or a gene, and each edge corresponds to a regulatory interaction. Our study thus demonstrates deep learning with ex ante, built-in, molecular interpretability.</p>
    <p id="Par48">Several technologies converged to enable interpretable deep learning on biological networks with single-cell RNA-seq data as input. First, two decades of research into systems biology and regulatory networks have established large databases of signaling pathways and gene-regulatory interactions, built on high-throughput experiments and on manual curation of many individual mechanistic studies. Second, recent progress in single-cell sequencing makes it possible to obtain transcriptome profiles for many thousands of single cells, thus providing ample experimental data for “contextualizing” these biological networks—at a sufficiently large scale for deep learning to play out its strengths. Third, deep learning has emerged as a method for inferring hidden states in deep neural networks based on large training datasets, potentially allowing us to infer unobserved states in complex biological networks. By combining compendia of potential regulatory interactions from public databases with single-cell RNA-seq data for the investigated biological system, deep neural networks may indeed be able to unravel those regulatory mechanisms that are relevant to the biological question of interest.</p>
    <p id="Par49">Our proof-of-concept for interpretable deep learning on biological networks comprises two key components: the knowledge-primed neural networks (KPNNs), which enable interpretability by providing a representation of biological networks that can be fitted by deep learning; and the optimized learning method, which provides a workflow for training the KPNNs based on single-cell RNA-seq data in a way that enhances their interpretability.</p>
    <p id="Par50">We derived and validated an application-specific TCR KPNN for T cell receptor signaling and a generalized GEN KPNN for a broad range of applications. These KPNNs model the signaling pathways of a cell by connecting cell surface receptors via signaling pathways and transcription factors (hidden nodes) to their target genes (input nodes corresponding to gene expression profiles obtained by single-cell RNA-seq). We demonstrated the feasibility of deep learning on these KPNNs and found that the prediction performance was comparable to that of ANNs and other machine learning methods. A comparison of network structures showed that KPNNs are structurally distinct from ANNs (greater sparseness, higher modularity), which likely enhances their interpretability by restricting the KPNN training to biologically meaningful models. Indeed, we found that trained KPNNs showed more relevant enrichments than structurally similar networks with randomly shuffled edges.</p>
    <p id="Par51">We also optimized the learning method to address three obstacles to interpretable deep learning on biological networks: (i) <italic>Hidden node dropout</italic>: Short-term removal of random hidden nodes during training conferred robustness to the KPNN interpretations in the context of redundant signaling pathways; (ii) <italic>Input dropout:</italic> Short-term removal of random parts of the input data enhanced the quantitative interpretability of node weights; and (iii) <italic>Correction for network structure</italic>: KPNN training on simulated control inputs allowed us to adjust for uneven connectivity inherent to biological networks. These three methodological optimizations enhanced the biological interpretability of KPNNs both on simulated and on real data. We anticipate that similar optimizations will also be relevant to other studies in the growing field of interpretable deep learning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR101">101</xref>].</p>
    <p id="Par52">As a proof-of-concept for interpretable deep learning on biological networks, we applied our method to five large single-cell sequencing datasets covering a range of biological applications. First, we investigated TCR signaling in vitro, and the trained KPNNs indeed recapitulated key aspects of what is known about TCR signaling, contextualized to the concrete biological model (Jurkat cells stimulated by CD3/CD28 antibodies). Second, we demonstrated the scalability of our method on a large immune dataset from the Human Cell Atlas (483,084 single-cell transcriptomes), where we discovered unexpected regulatory differences between mature immune cells obtained from bone marrow vs cord blood. Third, we analyzed single-cell RNA-seq profiles from patients with Langerhans cell histiocytosis, and we identified JAK/STAT signaling as a potential contributor to an aggressive disease course. Fourth, we compared leukemic and normal cells at multiple stages of hematopoietic differentiation, uncovering stage-specific regulators in acute myeloid leukemia. Fifth, we inferred subtype-specific gene-regulatory networks in tumor samples from patients with glioblastoma. In all of these cases, the KPNNs discovered both known and novel regulators based on the single-cell RNA-seq data.</p>
    <p id="Par53">These applications—together with our extensive analyses of simulated data—support the validity and practical utility of interpretable deep learning using KPNNs. Nevertheless, there are potential limitations that should be considered by potential users of our method. First, KPNNs currently require directed acyclic graphs, in order to be compatible with deep learning algorithms. We have developed a procedure that derives high-confidence acyclic KPNNs from biological networks with cycles, but explicit modeling of cycles within KPNNs could be advantageous. Second, our current KPNNs are restricted to discovering and contextualizing regulatory mechanisms that have previously been annotated in public databases, while entirely novel and unexpected interactions may be missed. Third, KPNNs may suffer from false positives and false negatives in the annotation data, although we found that the results were robust toward shuffling a limited number of edges in simulated networks. Fourth, the specificity of the KPNNs (i.e., ability to confidently exclude regulatory mechanisms that are not relevant in the investigated biological system) depends on the quality of the single-cell RNA-seq training data, and noisy or biased experimental data may affect the performance of our method. Fortunately, KPNNs appear to cope well with the inherently low coverage and frequent experimental dropouts in single-cell RNA-seq data, and we obtained comparably robust results on in vitro as well as ex vivo profiles of human cells.</p>
    <p id="Par54">Beyond these practical considerations, our study raises conceptual and methodological challenges and opportunities. Most notably, it poses the question how interpretability should be defined more formally in the context of interpretable deep learning on domain knowledge networks. Here we explored the hypothesis that the structural analogy between KPNNs and biological networks, together with our optimized training method, will result in trained KPNN models that capture key aspects of the regulatory mechanisms at work in the biological system of interest. We empirically tested this hypothesis based on simulated data and in multiple biological applications of KPNNs, and our results support the practical utility of our method. The ability to infer molecular mechanisms distinguishes KPNNs from most methods for single-cell RNA-seq data analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR102">102</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR103">103</xref>]. More generally, KPNNs provide a deep learning-based framework that complements existing bioinformatic methods for identifying key transcription factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR104">104</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR106">106</xref>] and other regulatory proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR107">107</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR109">109</xref>] from single-cell gene expression data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR110">110</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR111">111</xref>]. KPNNs are also complementary to well-established paradigms for mathematical modeling and computational simulation of signaling pathways and gene regulatory networks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR112">112</xref>].</p>
    <p id="Par55">It will be interesting to explore in more detail how KPNNs compare to and potentially complement other machine learning methods. Based on our observations, KPNN interpretability—with its focus on inferring the regulatory importance of signaling proteins and transcription factors—is conceptually and empirically distinct from existing methods for ex post interpretability based on feature weights for (observed) gene expression levels. Important signaling proteins and transcription factors identified by KPNNs were rarely differentially expressed at the RNA level, and many of them are therefore undetectable by alternative methods. As illustrated on simulated data with known ground truth, the node weights in the KPNNs capture regulatory importance at the protein level, suggesting that KPNNs may help derive mechanistic hypotheses about the role of signaling proteins and transcription factors from single-cell RNA-seq datasets. In the future, it will be interesting to compare regulatory mechanisms inferred by KPNNs to those established using high-throughput experimental approaches such as CRISPR screening or phosphoproteomics and to validate the most interesting regulatory mechanisms identified by KPNNs with detailed mechanistic studies.</p>
    <p id="Par56">Finally, KPNNs are loosely related to graph neural networks (GNNs). GNNs use domain knowledge to connect input nodes in networks, and input node values are iteratively updated by sharing information between neighboring nodes prior to prediction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR113">113</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR114">114</xref>]. In genome biology, GNNs have been used to predict clinical attributes from gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR115">115</xref>]. While GNNs and KPNNs both build on networks that capture prior domain knowledge, GNNs use network knowledge to share information between input nodes (within the input layer) in order to improve prediction performance. Interpretability of GNNs is thus restricted to the updated inputs. In contrast, KPNNs use network knowledge to connect hidden nodes (between layers) in order to achieve deep, multi-layer interpretability of the trained model. Toward this end, KPNNs exploit the analogy between biological regulation (signals are transduced from receptors via signaling proteins to transcription factors, which control gene expression) and feed-forward neural networks (output nodes, hidden nodes, input nodes), thus providing a new way of performing deep learning using domain-specific graphs/networks.</p>

    <title>Conclusions</title>
    <p id="Par57">This study provides a general framework and initial proof-of-concept for interpretable deep learning on biological networks. We demonstrated the utility of knowledge-primed neural networks (KPNNs) for the molecular interpretation of single-cell RNA-seq data, which is an exciting and highly active research area. Moreover, given the broad interest in networks for describing biological mechanisms, we expect that our use of deep learning on biological networks will also be relevant in other areas of biology and medicine, for example analyzing metabolome/proteome data, biochemical reaction networks, cellular differentiation, or even brain circuits.</p>

      <title>Construction of a general regulatory network for human cells</title>
      <p id="Par58">Knowledge-primed neural networks (KPNNs) integrate multiple signaling pathways and gene-regulatory interactions into a single network that can be fitted by deep learning. As the biological basis of these KPNNs, we integrated large-scale, genome-wide datasets of transcription factor target genes and protein signaling interactions from several public databases into a broad network model of the potential regulatory space in human cells. This general regulatory network model is represented as a directed graph.</p>
      <sec id="Sec12">
        <title>Transcription factors</title>
        <p id="Par59">Genes constitute the input nodes of the KPNNs, and their expression levels are measured by single-cell RNA-seq. Transcription factors constitute part of the KPNNs’ hidden nodes, and their regulatory importance is inferred by deep learning. To connect the genes to the transcription factors that may regulate their expression, we obtained transcription factor/target gene pairs from the Harmonizome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR116">116</xref>] database (as of 3 July 2017), including the following data sources: ENCODE, CHEA, ESCAPE, MotifMap, and TRANSFAC (including both manually curated and predicted binding sites). Further transcription factor/target gene pairs were obtained from the TTRUST [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR117">117</xref>] database (as of 3 July 2017), which we mapped to gene names using an NCBI resource (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/DATA/gene_info.gz">ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/DATA/gene_info.gz</ext-link>, as of 10 October 2016). Different datasets were combined by counting the number of datasets that support a connection for each transcription factor/target gene pair. To prioritize experimental over computational evidence, weights of 1.0 and 0.3 were used for experimental and computational support, respectively. For each gene, the transcription factors with the largest weighted number of datasets supporting the connection to the gene were retained. As a result of this procedure, 745 genes were targeted by more than 25 transcription factors; these genes were removed from the analysis to avoid biasing the network by including promiscuous or false-positive regulatory interactions.</p>

      <sec id="Sec13">
        <title>Signaling pathways</title>
        <p id="Par60">Signaling proteins also constitute part of the KPNNs’ hidden nodes. To connect signaling proteins to their target proteins (transcription factors or other signaling proteins), we obtained a comprehensive dataset of protein signaling interactions, protein complexes, and protein family information from the SIGNOR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR118">118</xref>] database (as of 3 July 2017), which is a large, manually curated database of directed signaling interactions. To focus this network on signaling pathways that connect proteins, we removed interactions of transcriptional regulation, guanine nucleotide exchange factor, transcriptional activation, post-transcriptional regulation, and transcriptional repression, and we removed all nodes that were not proteins, complexes, or protein families, as well as nodes from databases other than UniProt [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR119">119</xref>] and SIGNOR. All retained interactions were aggregated into a directed graph of potential regulatory interactions. To capture interactions between complex members and annotations of protein families, we further linked family members to nodes representing protein families, and protein complex members to nodes representing complexes. This was done using edges in both directions, thus enabling protein complex members to regulate their target complexes and vice versa.</p>

      <title>Construction of application-specific KPNNs for deep learning</title>
      <p id="Par61">From the general regulatory network described in the previous section, application-specific KPNNs are derived as follows: (i) define the cell surface receptor(s) expected to be most relevant for the biological phenomenon of interest, (ii) extract a directed acyclic graph that connects the selected receptor(s) to all reachable transcription factors, and (iii) connect transcription factors to their target genes. The resulting graphs are used for interpretable deep learning by reversing the cascade: Measured gene expression values (input nodes) predict the regulatory importance of connected transcription factors (hidden nodes), which predict the regulatory importance of their connected signaling proteins (hidden nodes), which then predict the regulatory importance and activation states of surface receptors, which finally predict the output (phenotype) of the specific dataset. In this study, two KPNNs were constructed: (i) a KPNN specific to TCR signaling (TCR KPNN), which seeks to predict TCR stimulation from gene expression, and (ii) a generalized KPNN (GEN KPNN) that can be used to predict cell states from single-cell RNA-seq datasets independent of specific receptors.</p>
      <sec id="Sec15">
        <title>TCR KPNN</title>
        <p id="Par62">To construct the KPNN for TCR signaling, we selected the TCR node (SIGNOR-C153) as the output node of the network and calculated shortest paths to all reachable transcription factors in the general regulatory network using the function <italic>all_shortest_paths</italic> from the igraph package (version 1.1.2) in R (version 3.2.3). These paths were then combined, resulting in a directed acyclic graph. Finally, transcription factor/target gene pairs were used to connect each transcription factor to its target genes (input nodes).</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="Sec16">
        <title>GEN KPNN</title>
        <p id="Par63">To construct a generalized KPNN that does not require prior knowledge of the most relevant receptors and signaling pathways for a given application, we introduced output nodes that represent sample annotations of interest in a given dataset (e.g., cell type or disease state). Output nodes were adapted to the specific biological question and dataset: In the HCA dataset, three output nodes were used to represent B cells, T cells, and monocytes. In the other three systems, one output node was used for the binary classification of (i) progenitor vs mature cells in the LCH dataset, (ii) leukemic vs normal cells in the AML dataset, and (iii) disease subtype in the glioblastoma dataset, i.e., pairwise comparisons between astrocyte-like cells (AC), mesenchymal-like cells (MES), oligodendrocyte progenitor-like cells (OPC), and neural progenitor-like cells (NPC). These output nodes were connected to all cell surface receptors, based on the pathway annotations in the SIGNOR database obtained with SIGNOR’s REST API. We then calculated shortest paths from the output nodes via the cell surface receptor nodes to all reachable transcription factors in the generic regulatory network using the function <italic>all_shortest_paths</italic> from the igraph package. These paths were combined, resulting in a directed acyclic graph. Transcription factor/target gene pairs were used to connect each of the transcription factors to their target genes (input nodes). This initial graph was then extended to ensure inclusion of all relevant cell surface receptors. To that end, shortest paths from individual receptors to all transcription factors were added under the condition that they do not introduce cycles. This was ensured by the following procedure: First, shortest paths from all receptors to all transcription factors were identified in the general regulatory network and transformed to an edge list. Second, edges from this list were added to the graph if the edge’s parent depth was smaller than the child depth, or if the child was not yet included in the network. Node depth was defined as the distance of a node from the output nodes. In addition, to rule out feedback loops from transcription factors to upstream protein signaling pathways, the depth of transcription factors (and their downstream nodes) was artificially set to be greater than the depth of all non-transcription factors. Finally, the two steps were repeated iteratively until no more edges could be added. This procedure thus enabled us to extend our graph by adding relevant connections, while ensuring that no cycles were introduced into the graph.</p>

      <title>Single-cell transcriptome datasets used for KPNN training</title>
      <p id="Par64">While the KPNNs represent the wider regulatory space potentially relevant for the application of interest, it is the deep learning on KPNNs using single-cell transcriptome data that confers specificity and identifies those parts of the KPNNs that are indeed relevant and predictive for the investigated biological system.

Only unperturbed cells (i.e., those that expressed non-targeting guide RNAs) were included in the analysis. To identify the CRISPR guide RNAs in each cell, a reference genome was created by extending the human GRCh38 genome assembly with sequences of all used guide RNAs with Cell Ranger <italic>mkref</italic>. Sequencing data were aligned to this reference genome with Cell Ranger <italic>count</italic> and merged with Cell Ranger <italic>aggr</italic>. Barcodes with less than 500 unique molecular identifiers (UMIs), less than 200 identified genes, or more than 15% mitochondrial reads were considered low-quality and removed from the analysis.

Next, a positive or negative twofold change was introduced in selected genes (predictive/informative genes whose expression was linearly correlated with each cell’s class value), resulting in a second (differential) gene expression profile. Finally, single-cell RNA-seq profiles of individual cells were simulated by subsampling reads from these average profiles using <italic>rbinom</italic> in R as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR120">120</xref>].

Marker gene expression for CD79A and CD19 was used to identify B cells; CD3D, CD3G, and IL32 to identify T cells; and CD14 and CST3 to identify monocytes. Cells with log (TPM + 1) values above 4 for any of the listed marker genes were assigned to the respective cell types. Cells assigned to none of the cell types (which comprises all other cell types) or to multiple cell types (including cell duplicates) were removed from the analysis.

      <title>Generic deep learning methodology and implementation</title>
      <p id="Par71">Deep learning was performed on the application-specific KPNNs with the single-cell transcriptome profiles as training data, using a three-step workflow: (i) processing of input data, (ii) training of the KPNN or ANN as a deep neural network, and (iii) evaluation of prediction performance on unseen test data. This workflow was implemented in a custom Python (version 2.7.6) program, using the Python libraries tensorflow [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR121">121</xref>] (version 1.3.1), pandas (version 0.19.2), scipy (version 0.14.0), and numpy (1.13.2). The software implementation has also been tested successfully in a more recent version of Python (version 3.7.3). It requires three inputs: (i) a neural network graph (KPNN or ANN) in the form of an edge list, (ii) a file containing class values for each single cell, and (iii) a file containing transcriptome profiles for each single cell. The methods outlined below were applied for both KPNNs and ANNs, and they constitute the generic deep learning workflow that was used in this study.</p>

        <title>Network training</title>
        <p id="Par73">Training of the neural networks (KPNNs or ANNs) is configured by a method to initialize edge weights, an activation function for hidden and output nodes, a loss function, an algorithm to minimize the loss function, and criteria to terminate training. Network training was implemented in TensorFlow, with the following setup. Edge weights were randomly initialized using TensorFlow <italic>global_variables_initializer</italic>. A sigmoid activation function was used for all hidden and output nodes using TensorFlow <italic>nn.sigmoid</italic>. The sigmoid function was chosen because of its similarity to “on” and “off” states in biological systems. The loss function to minimize was chosen as a weighed cross-entropy with L2 regularization. To calculate the loss function, cross-entropy was first calculated using TensorFlow <italic>nn.sigmoid_cross_entropy_with_logits</italic>. Then, to improve training in the presence of class imbalance, the cross-entropy of each sample was weighted by the number of samples of each class. The weight for each class was calculated as (1/<italic>N</italic><sub>classes</sub>)/(<italic>N</italic><sub><italic>x</italic></sub>/<italic>N</italic><sub>samples</sub>), where <italic>N</italic><sub>classes</sub> is the number of classes, <italic>N</italic><sub><italic>x</italic></sub> is the number of samples of class x, and <italic>N</italic><sub>samples</sub> is the total number of samples. Finally, L2 regularization was calculated using TensorFlow <italic>nn.l2_loss</italic> and added to the weighted cross-entropy. For this loss function, the ADAM algorithm was used to minimize the regularized, weighted cross-entropy using TensorFlow <italic>train.AdamOptimizer</italic>. To track the learning progress, training and validation error were calculated by subtracting predicted class probabilities from true labels. Training was terminated with early stopping, which was triggered by a specific number (“patience”) of epochs without considerable learning processes (“failed epochs”). Epochs were considered as “failed epochs” if either (i) training loss plateaued (indicative of arrival at a minimum) or (ii) validation set error increased (indicative of overfitting). To be able to recover the most promising model, new models were saved during training (using TensorFlow <italic>train.Saver)</italic> if they achieved considerable learning progress (decreased validation set error by a given percentage) compared to the previously saved model. When a model was saved, the counter of failed epochs (“patience”) was set to zero. After learning was terminated, the most recently saved model was loaded and used to calculate test set performance.</p>

The learning rate (alpha) was selected to the highest value that ensured smoothness of learning curves.

        <p id="Par77">Dropout constitutes a modification of the learning algorithm where a given percentage of nodes is randomly set to zero in each training iteration and for each sample, temporarily removing the contribution of the affected nodes. Dropout was originally developed as a regularization technique to reduce overfitting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. Applied to KPNNs, dropout encourages the learning algorithm to spread weights across all relevant nodes, which reduces variability of node weights across network replicates (leading to improved robustness) and balances weights across input nodes (leading to node weights that more quantitatively reflect node importance). Dropout was implemented in our network training program using TensorFlow <italic>nn.dropout,</italic> which was applied separately to hidden nodes and to input nodes<italic>.</italic></p>

        <title>Normalizing for the uneven connectivity of biological networks</title>
        <p id="Par78">To normalize for the biological network structure and connectivity patterns of KPNNs, we trained the KPNNs not only on the actual single-cell transcriptome data, but also on artificial control inputs where all input nodes were set to values that are equally predictive of the class values. All input nodes carry equal importance in this scenario, hence the resulting node weights reflect only the inherent network structure of the KPNN. Control inputs thus quantify the effect of uneven connectivity on node weights and allow us to normalize for it. Control inputs were generated in the same way as the simulated single-cell transcriptome datasets used to develop our methodology (as described above), with one difference: while only a subset of inputs were selected as predictive in the simulated dataset, the control inputs were simulated such that all inputs were equally predictive. To that end, raw read counts were summed up across all cells corresponding to one class value (e.g., unstimulated cells in the TCR data) to generate an average transcriptome profile. A positive or negative (randomly selected with numpy <italic>random.choice</italic>) twofold change was added to all input genes to generate a second average transcriptome profile. Reads were then drawn from the two average transcriptome profiles using numpy <italic>random.binomial</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR120">120</xref>]<italic>.</italic> The number of reads drawn was based on the number of reads in each cell in the original data.

      <title>Calculation of node weights as a measure of node importance</title>
      <p id="Par86">Trained KPNNs models were analyzed by calculating node weights as a reflection of node importance for the KPNN-based predictions. Edge weights are readily obtainable from the network model, but they only indicate the (local) relationship of a given node to its parent node and do not capture the (global) importance of each node for the full network. To obtain informative node weights, we applied small perturbations to each hidden node separately and measured changes in network output, thus quantifying the importance of each node to the output of the network. Finally, because the sign of the resulting node weights is largely arbitrary, we take the absolute value of the node weights as a measure of the importance of each node in the trained KPNNs.</p>
      <sec id="Sec40">
        <title>Calculation of node weights using induced perturbations</title>
        <p id="Par87">To obtain informative node weights, we applied a procedure analogous to numerical gradient estimation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR122">122</xref>], which is commonly used to evaluate the effect of small numerical perturbations of edge weights on the network predictions (outputs) in order to test the calculation of backpropagation gradients. Here, instead of perturbing edge weights, we applied perturbations to nodes, thus estimating the effect that small perturbations of node outputs (activations) have on the network predictions. For each node <italic>n</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>, network predictions (class probabilities) were calculated after perturbing <italic>n</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> twice, once by adding and once by subtracting a small factor (epsilon, which was set to 0.001 for all datasets) from the output (activation) of <italic>n</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>. The mean difference of class probabilities after additive and subtractive perturbation was then further divided by 2*epsilon to derive a normalized measure of node weight. As a result, nodes with large node weights had a greater effect on network predictions than nodes with smaller node weights, thus quantifying the global importance of each hidden node to the network.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="Sec41">
        <title>Rationale for calculating absolute values of the node weights</title>
        <p id="Par88">Node outputs can impact network predictions positively or negatively, depending on the sign of their associated edge weights. In the case of input nodes, the sign of node weights can be interpreted directly with respect to network predictions (for example, “high expression of gene X predicts TCR stimulation, whereas low expression predicts no stimulation”). For hidden nodes, however, this relationship is absent because hidden nodes can assign negative or positive weights to the associated input nodes with equal outcome. For example, a negative edge weight associated with a negative node output will result in a positive number as much as a positive edge weight associated with a positive node output. The sign of node weights will thus randomly differ between replicate networks (i.e., the same network trained separately on the same input data). In contrast, the absolute magnitude of node weights reflects the importance of each node for prediction, independent of its sign. For this reason, we calculated absolute node weights, which robustly quantify the contribution of each node to the predictions.</p>

Node weights of the resulting trained KPNN models were then extracted to perform statistical comparisons between either (i) input data and simulated control inputs (TCR KPNN) or (ii) pairs of KPNNs (GEN KPNN). We performed statistical differential analysis on node weights of replicate networks in much the same way as it is commonly done for gene expression data. To this end, node weights were imported into R (version 3.2.3), where they were analyzed and plotted using the packages data.table (version 1.11.4), limma (version 3.26.9), ggplot2 (version 2.2.1), and pheatmap (version 1.0.10).

These ANNs were constructed such that they match the corresponding KPNNs in terms of the number of input nodes, hidden nodes, and output node(s). In contrast, the distribution of edges was notably different, and the number of hidden layers was handled as a free parameter ranging from 1 to the maximum depth of the corresponding KPNN, thus resulting in multiple ANNs for each KPNN.</p>
      <sec id="Sec50">
        <title>Construction of ANNs</title>
        <p id="Par97">Fully connected ANNs (fANNs) were constructed by distributing the hidden nodes equally across all layers and adding edges to fully connect adjacent layers. Moreover, all nodes of the first hidden layer were connected to all input nodes, and all nodes of the last hidden layer were connected to the output node(s). Given that these fANNs have many more edges than their corresponding KPNNs, we also generated a separate set of sparse ANNs (sANNs). These sANNs were derived from the fANNs in a way that established the same number of edges and nodes as in the corresponding KPNN. This was done in three steps that guarantee end-to-end connectivity of the resulting sANNs: First, all edges were removed from a given fANN. Second, we generated a minimal network that spans all nodes. To that end, edges were added for each pair of consecutive layers such that every node in the lower layer was connected to exactly one (randomly selected) node in the upper layer (this step also ensured that each node in the upper layer is connected to at least one node in the lower layer, since higher layers were always smaller or equal in size compared to the lower layers). Third, edges were added back randomly until the network had the same number of edges as the corresponding KPNN. The third step was carried out separately for the input layer and for the hidden layers of the network. Consequently, the resulting sANN was equivalent to the KPNN in the number of edges connecting input nodes to hidden nodes, and also in the number of edges connecting hidden nodes with each other.</p>

Distance to input nodes was measured with the igraph function <italic>distances</italic>. The resulting distance values were used to calculate reachability, counting the number of input nodes with finite distance. To compare modularity, the network was transformed into an undirected graph using the igraph function <italic>as.undirected</italic>, edges to be removed were identified using the igraph function <italic>edge.betweenness.community</italic>, and the number of clusters was determined with the igraph function <italic>clusters</italic>.</p>

      <title>Validation of the TCR KPNN against randomly shuffled control KPNNs</title>
      <p id="Par99">To assess the effect of the prior biological knowledge that is encoded in the TCR KPNN on the trained models, we generated a series of randomly shuffled control KPNNs that resemble the overall network structure of the TCR KPNN. The control KPNNs were established by iteratively swapping edges of the TCR KPNN (“network shuffling”) while maintaining the network topology including the in-degree and out-degree of each node. We then trained and interpreted the control networks in the same way as the original KPNN, and we compared the trained KPNN models to measure the effect of network shuffling on the network interpretations.</p>
      <sec id="Sec53">
        <title>Construction of control KPNNs</title>
        <p id="Par100">The TCR KPNN was randomized to generate randomly shuffled control networks using the following multi-step strategy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR124">124</xref>], which ensures that no circles are generated: First, nodes are grouped into layers by iteratively removing leaf nodes (i.e., nodes with an outdegree of zero), such that the first nodes to remove (leaf nodes of the original network) are assigned to the lowest layer. Second, a unique index is randomly assigned to each node under the constraint that nodes in lower layers have smaller indices than nodes in the higher layers. Third, pairs of edges are swapped under the following conditions: (i) parent node index is greater than child node index in both newly added edges and (ii) the newly added edges exist neither in the original network nor in the current shuffled network. Swapping is performed once for each edge.</p>

      <sec id="Sec54">
        <title>Training and interpretation of shuffled KPNNs</title>
        <p id="Par101">Control networks were trained using the same parameters and cutoffs as the original TCR KPNNs, thus ensuring comparability. Networks were trained both on real data (<italic>n</italic> = 90) and on control inputs (<italic>n</italic> = 60). For interpretation, node weights of the best performing networks were selected such that the number of trained KPNNs for each control network corresponds to the number used for the analysis of the original TCR KPNN (<italic>n</italic> = 42). Differential node weights (comparing KPNNs trained on real data and control inputs) were calculated as for the TCR KPNN: First, quantile normalization was performed using quantiles from the TCR KPNN analysis. Second, significantly different nodes were selected based on a <italic>P</italic> value cutoff that corresponds to the adjusted <italic>P</italic> value cutoff of 0.05 in the TCR KPNN analysis. Third, the enrichment of known TCR regulator proteins among differential nodes was calculated for each control network.</p>

      <title>Benchmarking of the TCR KPNN against other machine learning methods</title>
      <p id="Par102">To benchmark and compare the prediction performance and biological interpretability of KPNNs to that of established machine learning methods, we trained elastic nets, random forests, support vector machines, and neural networks to predict TCR activation on the TCR dataset. We then evaluated their prediction performance using the ROC AUC metric and extracted input feature weights as potential biological interpretations.</p>
      <sec id="Sec56">
        <title>Training and interpretation of neural networks</title>
        <p id="Par103">Neural networks were trained using the keras package (2.0.6) in Python. Data were split into 80% training set and 20% test set. Activation functions used were ReLU between layers and sigmoid for the final output. Cross-entropy loss was calculated based on the output layer and optimized using the AdaGrad algorithm. Hyperparameters were tuned on training data using fivefold cross-validation with the function <italic>GridSearchCV</italic> of the sklearn package (0.18.1), searching a grid of learning rate (values: 10<sup>−3</sup>, 10<sup>−2</sup>, 10<sup>−1</sup>, and 10<sup>0</sup>) and L2 norm (values: 0, 10<sup>−2</sup>, 10<sup>−1</sup>, to 10<sup>0</sup>). Optimal hyperparameters after 100 epochs were selected to train the final model. Training of the selected model was stopped (early stopping) once learning failed to improve the cross-entropy loss on validation data (20% of training data) by 0.01 for 10 epochs. Performance was evaluated on unseen test data. For interpretation, features in the test data were individually shuffled and changes in prediction performance were recorded to obtain estimates of feature importance.</p>

        <title>Training and interpretation of other machine learning methods</title>
        <p id="Par104">Additional algorithms were trained using the caret package (6.0.78) in R. Data were split into 80% training set and 20% test set. The following algorithms were included: logistic regression with elastic net penalty (glmnet package, version 2.0.13); SVMs with linear, polynomial, or radial basis function kernel (kernlab package, version 0.9.25); and random forest (randomForest package, version 4.6.12). Hyperparameters were tuned on training data using tenfold cross-validation using the caret function <italic>train</italic>. Feature importance of trained models was evaluated using the <italic>varImp</italic> function.</p>

        <title>Enrichment of transcription factor target genes</title>
        <p id="Par105">To assess our ability to identify TCR signaling proteins from the feature weights of these machine learning methods, we performed enrichment analysis on the 100, 200, and 500 top-ranked features of each model against the target genes of each transcription factor. This analysis was performed using the function fisher.test in R, and the <italic>P</italic> values were corrected for multiple testing using p.adjust with parameter “BH”.</p>

The video visualizes the learning process for the TCR KPNN, trained twice without dropout (generic deep learning) (top) and twice with dropout (optimized learning method) (bottom). Edge color and thickness reflect edge weights, with thick red lines indicating high weights and thin grey lines indicating low weights. Edge weights were transformed to absolute values prior to plotting. The networks shown were selected by first correlating edge weights between all pairs of networks, and then selecting the two networks that are closest to the median of all pairwise correlations (R = 0.78 without dropout and R = 0.86 with dropout).</p>
