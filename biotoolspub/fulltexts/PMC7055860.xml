    <abstract>
      <p>Skeletal muscle is comprised of a heterogeneous population of muscle fibers which can be classified by their metabolic and contractile properties (fiber “types”). Fiber type is a primary determinant of muscle function along with fiber size (cross-sectional area). The fiber type composition of a muscle responds to physiological changes like exercise and aging and is often altered in disease states. Thus, analysis of fiber size and type in histological muscle preparations is a useful method for quantifying key indicators of muscle function and for measuring responses to a variety of stimuli or stressors. These analyses are near-ubiquitous in the fields of muscle physiology and myopathy, but are most commonly performed manually, which is highly labor- and time-intensive. To offset this obstacle, we developed Myosoft, a novel method to automate morphometric and fiber type analysis in muscle sections stained with fluorescent antibodies.</p>

    <title>Background</title>
    <p>Skeletal muscle is the most massive tissue in humans and is responsible for movement and posture [<xref rid="pone.0229041.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0229041.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The human musculature comprises over 600 skeletal muscles, which generate a diverse range of contractile forces due to differences in the compositions of their constituent muscle fibers [<xref rid="pone.0229041.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0229041.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Muscle fibers are broadly classified by contractile kinetics (slow or fast twitch, referred to as type I or type II, respectively). Type II fibers may be further categorized according to metabolic activity (oxidative or glycolytic) [<xref rid="pone.0229041.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0229041.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. According to this method of classification, there are four general fiber types: type I fibers (slow twitch/oxidative metabolism), type IIa (fast twitch/oxidative metabolism), and types IIx and IIb (faster and fastest twitch/glycolytic metabolism) [<xref rid="pone.0229041.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0229041.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Each fiber type contains different myosin heavy chain (MyHC) isoforms, which differ with respect to ATPase activity and contraction speed. The contractile properties of a muscle fiber can be inferred by its size (generally reported as its cross-sectional area, CSA) and type [<xref rid="pone.0229041.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0229041.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The sizes and types of fibers in a given muscle collectively contribute to its functional output [<xref rid="pone.0229041.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0229041.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p>
    <p>The distributions of fiber size and type display plasticity in response to physiological pressures like aging and exercise and are altered in cases of neuromuscular disease [<xref rid="pone.0229041.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0229041.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Thus, analysis of fiber size and type in histological muscle preparations can be a useful method for quantifying key indicators of muscle function and for measuring responses to a variety of stimuli or stressors. However, despite the value of such analysis, it is often performed manually, which is both labor-intensive and time-consuming. To offset this obstacle, several groups have developed software that automates analysis of muscle histology [<xref rid="pone.0229041.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0229041.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. SMASH, reported in 2014 [<xref rid="pone.0229041.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], and an unnamed Image-J plug-in for muscle analysis, published in 2016 [<xref rid="pone.0229041.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0229041.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], introduced automatic analysis of muscle histology to the field using a watershed algorithm for segmentation. Both programs, however, require manual intervention to run the program effectively, which may affect reproducibility between laboratories. Additionally, these programs lack the ability to discern all fiber types and mixed-fiber type combinations. MyoVision [<xref rid="pone.0229041.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] and Muscle J [<xref rid="pone.0229041.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], published in 2018, were the first programs to offer fully automated analysis of muscle histology. Myovision deploys a k-means binarization followed by detection of incompletely and completely segmented ‘seeds’ which the program processes independently. Although the watershed applied to incompletely segmented seeds following thresholding improves fiber detection, low-quality image inputs yield an abundance of incompletely segmented seeds, which increase the risk of false object counts. Moreover, Myovision applies these algorithms to the entire image (regardless of pixel dimensions), imposing a significant strain on the computer and making analysis of high-content images challenging. MuscleJ uses basic color transformation, Gaussian noise reduction and Li threshold binarization. This thresholding method, however, minimizes image-cross entropy, which leads to more incompletely segmented fibers. While these objects are not appropriate for analysis, they are nevertheless analyzed in MuscleJ, resulting in an overall reduction in the accuracy of the reported data. Neither Myovision nor MuscleJ permit the detection of mixed fiber types. Thus, we sought to develop a program that addressed these central limitations–specifically, the detection of all fiber types and mixed fiber type combinations and high-fidelity output even with suboptimal staining quality.</p>
    <p>Traditional segmentation methods have relied on relatively simple mathematical transformations of images based on limited information concerning individual pixels, and the aforementioned muscle-specific programs are no exception. Unfortunately, these approaches are typically successful only when the images have high signal:noise ratios and image features are simple. Recently, machine learning algorithms have been proposed to handle digitally archived histopathological ‘big data’ [<xref rid="pone.0229041.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The major advantage of data mining approaches is that they rely on pattern recognition from minimally processed images in order to perform segmentation. Furthermore, machine learning makes it possible to distinguish between pixels that, despite sharing certain superficial similarities, do in fact belong to separate image features. This has proven useful in the context of computer-assisted diagnosis, where machine classifiers are used to assign pathological grades to biopsy samples [<xref rid="pone.0229041.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0229041.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. For example, a Spatially Constrained Convolutional Neural Network has been deployed for qualitative detection of nuclei in cancerous tissue [<xref rid="pone.0229041.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Historically, this work has been performed by human experts because of the complexity of the problem: so-called histological primitives (objects like nuclei) must be identified and then further analyzed for disease relevant features (e.g. position, size/shape). Within the past decade, learning-based tools have been taken a step further: versatile and reliable methods have been developed to facilitate histological image analysis, with applications for virtually any histochemically processed sample [<xref rid="pone.0229041.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0229041.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].</p>
    <p>While the promise of machine learning for image segmentation has begun to be realized, it has yet to be utilized within the context of muscle biology. The key problem is one of boundary detection: fiber boundaries must first be accurately identified in order to make additional inferences about the fibers. Diverse machine-learning approaches (e.g. deep neural networks specialized for EM images or combinations of watershed algorithms and affinity-based segmentation) have already been implemented in the context of connectomics, all of which aim specifically toward boundary detection [<xref rid="pone.0229041.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0229041.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Thus, we sought to train a machine-learning algorithm to detect muscle fiber boundaries in immunostained histological preparations. Recently, a machine learning based tool for image segmentation (Trainable Weka Segmentation, TWS) has been developed for the popular open-source image analysis software ImageJ, bringing the capabilities of machine learning to image analysis in biomedical research fields. In addition to increased usability of TWS as a Fiji plugin option, TWS has several advantages including freely available license, user-friendly graphic interface, and portability due to JAVA language implementation [<xref rid="pone.0229041.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. With respect to the problem of myofiber identification, a TWS classifier can be trained to recognize and distinguish between the muscle fiber boundary and intra-fiber space after a few simple manual annotations that instantiate these two features. Then, given an image, the classifier will predict the distribution of the muscle fiber boundary and intra-fiber space. The results of this prediction are represented as a probability rendering of the original image, where darker pixels represent higher probabilities for the boundary, and lighter pixels represent lower probabilities. Since the classifier is trained specifically to segment images of contiguous muscle fibers, it can “learn” to account for and clarify flaws in an immunostained image that would otherwise confound the analysis or necessitate additional segmentation methods.</p>
    <p>Here, we present Myosoft, a novel tool to analyze muscle histology that synergizes machine learning-based image segmentation with thresholding-based object extraction and quantification. Myosoft uses pre-trained machine learning classifiers to delineate muscle fiber boundaries and subsequently extracts the size, type, and relevant morphometric features of the fiber. Additionally, Myosoft is run in the open-access image analysis software Fiji (Fiji is Just ImageJ) which is widely used to analyze cellular histology [<xref rid="pone.0229041.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0229041.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Altogether, Myosoft is a high-throughput, quick, accurate, and convenient solution to analyzing large sections of muscle tissue, capable of circumventing the error, bias, and labor incurred by manual annotation.</p>

      <title>Mice and muscle tissue preparation</title>
      <p>All experiments involving animals were performed in accordance with approved guidelines and ethical approval from Emory University’s Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. C57BL/6J (n = 29) and Dmd&lt;<italic>mdx-4Cv&gt;</italic> (n = 3) mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratories. Adult mice between the ages of 3 to 9 months were used without consideration of sex. Mice were euthanized via inhalation overdose of isoflurane, the skin was removed from the hindlimbs, and gastrocnemius/soleus or tibialis anterior/extensor digitorum longus (TA/EDL) muscles were excised as a single unit. Gastrocnemius muscle tissues were mounted in OCT freezing medium (Triangle Biomedical Sciences), snap-frozen in liquid N<sub>2</sub>-cooled 2-methylbutane and stored at -80°C for cryo-sectioning. Tissue cross sections of 10 μm thickness were collected every 400 μm using a Leica CM1850 cryostat.</p>

      <title>Immunofluorescent staining</title>
      <p>For immunostaining specific types of myosin heavy chain and laminin, tissue sections were first treated with mouse-on-mouse reagents (M.O.M. Kit, Vector Laboratories Inc.) to block endogenous Fc receptor binding sites followed by a 1 hour incubation with 5% goat serum, 5% donkey serum, 0.5% bovine serum albumin, 0.25% Triton-X 100 in phosphate buffered saline (blocking buffer). Sections were then labeled with an undiluted 1:1:1 mixture of mouse monoclonal antibodies BA-D5 (anti-MYH7, fiber type I), SC-71 (anti-MYH2, fiber type IIa), and BF-F3 (anti-MYH4, fiber type IIb) (hybridoma supernates, Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank) supplemented with rabbit polyclonal anti-laminin antibody (2 μg/ml, Sigma) overnight at 4°C. Control sections were incubated with species-matched non-immune IgGs. Sections were then incubated with isotype-specific Alexa Fluor (AF) conjugated secondary antibodies: anti-mouse IgG2b-AF350, anti-mouse IgG1-AF555, anti-mouse IgM-AF647, and anti-rabbit IgG-AF488 (Invitrogen, Molecular Probes) to mark type I, IIa, IIb fibers and laminin, respectively. Sections were mounted using ProLong Diamond anti-fade mountant (ThermoFisher Scientific).</p>

    <sec id="sec008">
      <title>Image acquisition</title>
      <p>All images were obtained using a Nikon Eclipse Ti-E inverted epifluorescent microscope equipped with a motorized stage. Images were acquired in NIS-Elements software (Nikon) with a 10x/0.3NA PlanFluor objective. The ND acquisition menu within Elements was used to take images from adjacent fields of view and digitally stitch them (with 15% overlap) to form a single image of the entire muscle cross-section (approximately 20–30 mm<sup>2</sup>) used for analysis. For our analyses, all images were acquired as 16-bit multi-channel images, which open in Fiji as 16-bit hyperstacks. Myosoft will work with 8 or 16-bit images, but images must be formatted as hyperstacks prior to analysis. We provide an ImageJ macro for converting single channel images into a Myosoft-compatible hyperstack in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0229041.s002">S2 File</xref>.</p>

        <p>Four images containing 150–200 fibers and two larger images containing &gt;500 fibers were taken from areas of the muscle section where all fiber types were represented.

        <title>Images used to test the efficacy of Myosoft and compare it to other programs</title>
        <p>Images for comparison of analysis programs were generated by fractionating large, whole tissue section images. Small images (containing 200–1000 fibers) were chosen after dividing the original image into sixteenths while larger images (1000+ fibers), were taken from 2 different muscle sections divided into halves or fourths. Selection was accomplished with a random number generator to eliminate bias from the process. If an image was randomly selected and had significant fluorescence artifacts or tissue damage, either this area was excluded, or a new image was chosen (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0229041.s005">S2 Fig</xref>). Each of these images was then run through Myosoft and its peer programs to obtain simple fiber counts. False negatives and false positives were then manually scored for each image. All above images were then classified as either poor or good quality. Stain quality was quantified as the ratio of intensity between the intra-fiber space and fiber boundary. Ratios &gt;5 were defined as good stain quality while ratios ≤5 were defined as poor stain quality. Measurements were made at various locations to account for non-uniformity in staining within single images. The number of images that were used to generate each figure is summarized in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0229041.s006">S1 Table</xref>.</p>

Next, to facilitate computation on computers with limited CPU clock speed and RAM, the entire 10x muscle image is sliced into 4 to 25 (that is, 2<sup>2</sup> to 5<sup>2</sup>; we use 4<sup>2</sup> = 16) equally sized smaller images that are then processed independently (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0229041.g001">Fig 1</xref>. Step 3). Although not strictly necessary for the analysis presented here, this step drastically reduces the computing power required for execution of the Myosoft macro and is thus highly recommended (and a default setting in Myosoft).</p>

      </fig>
      <p>In the segmentation step, sliced images from step 3 are segmented using a pre-trained machine learning classifier (primary classifier). The primary classifier includes difference of gaussians, Sobel, and hessian filters for feature extraction and gaussian blur and maximum filters for noise reduction. A minimum of two classes is required for training the classifier, which will then segment images into these classes. In our case, the primary classifier was trained with pixels corresponding either to the fiber boundary (high intensity pixels marked with laminin antibody) or intra-fiber space (low-intensity pixels not marked with laminin antibody). Several hundred pixels of either class were defined using the line tool in ImageJ. During classification of experimental images, each image slice is converted to a probability distribution where the intensity of each pixel (0–255) reflects the confidence of the classifier in assigning it to its respective class (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0229041.g001">Fig 1</xref> Step 4). Next, images are subjected to another round of segmentation using a separate machine learning classifier (iterative classifier). The iterative classifier was trained to make the same classification as the primary classifier (i.e. boundary vs. non-boundary) but was trained with output images (grayscale probability maps) of the primary classifier. Both the primary and iterative classifiers are random forest models and the decision tree structure is determined by the input pixels. In this way, the output pixel generated by the decision tree of the primary classifier is run through the new decision tree structure of the iterative classifier to arrive at a new classification. The output of this step is an image with defined and continuous fiber boundaries and intra-fiber spaces with minimal noise (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0229041.g001">Fig 1</xref>. Step 5).</p>
      <p>In the thresholding step, Myosoft retrieves all iteratively segmented images and stitches them to re-form a unified and complete segmented image of the original muscle section (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0229041.g001">Fig 1</xref>. Step 6). Next, gaussian blur is applied to the image. This blurred image is then run through a maximum entropy thresholding algorithm [<xref rid="pone.0229041.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] for binarization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0229041.g001">Fig 1</xref> Step 7). In the binary image, pixels are either black (representing the laminin-stained cell boundary) or white (corresponding to cytoplasm of myofibers, which are unstained). A particle analyzer extracts contiguous white pixels as objects and represents them as ROIs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0229041.g001">Fig 1</xref> Step 8, red). The ROIs obtained after gating in step 8 are expanded according to an adjustable ROI expansion factor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0229041.g001">Fig 1</xref> Step 8, yellow). ROI expansion is performed to ensure that ROIs match the laminin-demarked fiber boundary as closely as possible (see laminin image inset, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0229041.g001">Fig 1</xref> Step 9). These ROIs, which represent all fibers detected by Myosoft, are overlaid on individual channel images corresponding to each fiber type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0229041.g001">Fig 1</xref> Step 9). Intensity within the ROIs is measured and used to identify Type I, Type IIa, Type IIb, and mixed-type fibers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0229041.g001">Fig 1</xref> Step 10, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0229041.g002">Fig 2</xref>). Myosoft will generate a color-coded section map where fibers are shaded according to CSA, allowing for rapid visualization of the distribution of fiber sizes within a sample (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0229041.g001">Fig 1</xref> Step 11). Myofiber CSAs, sorted by fiber type, are stored in .csv files readable with Excel. The user can easily plot type-specific size distributions from this data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0229041.g001">Fig 1</xref> Step 12). In addition to the CSA values reported in these spreadsheets, several other parameters are also reported: perimeter, circularity, minimum Feret distance, Feret angle, Feret aspect ratio, roundness, and solidity. The mean, standard deviation, minimum and maximum values for each of these measurements is also reported. Lastly, when Myosoft completes analysis, it will immediately report the fiber type proportions (for Type I, Type IIa, Type IIb, and Type IIx), total section size, and average CSA for the sample in a log window within Fiji.</p>

          <title>Method for extracting fiber type data from Myosoft measurements.</title>
          <p><bold>a</bold> Intensity measurements are made on image channels corresponding to individual fiber types. These measurements are grouped into bins to generate a histogram, where low-intensity objects (background) are clustered towards the left and high-intensity objects (fibers of a given type) are clustered towards the right. The user defines a threshold intensity value (dotted line), and objects with greater mean intensity than the threshold are counted as fibers of that type. A black and white (binary) ROI mask is made for each fiber type. <bold>b</bold> Black and white ROI masks for each fiber type are used to identify mixed-type fibers. Identification of IIa/IIb mixed fibers is shown as an example: the black and white mask of Type IIa fibers is opened by Myosoft. Next, Type IIb ROIs are recalled, and Myosoft measures intensity within all Type IIb ROIs. Since the images are binary, the measurement values are either 0 (black) or 255 (white). Thus, modal values of 0 indicate fibers that are both Type IIa and Type IIb, or Type IIa/IIb mixed fibers. <bold>c</bold> Intensity thresholding (from <bold>a</bold>) identifies the entire population (mixed and pure/unmixed) of fibers of that type. Shown is an example of the determination of pure Type IIb myofibers. These are distinguished by first merging black and white ROI masks of all Type IIb-containing mixed fiber types. All Type IIb ROIs are recalled, and Myosoft measures intensity within the ROIs. Mixed fibers are black (modal intensity = 0) and pure fibers are white (modal intensity = 255). <bold>d</bold> Type IIx fibers are identified through process of elimination. Black and white masks for Type I, Type IIa, and Type IIb fibers are merged. ROIs for all fibers are recalled, and Myosoft measures the intensity within the ROIs. Type IIx fibers are white (modal intensity = 255).</p>

        <title>i. Fiber typing pipeline—Determination of IIa, IIb, I and IIx fiber types</title>
        <p>Following identification of myofibers within the tissue section image, Myosoft performs semi-automated determination of IIa, IIb, and I fiber types. To accomplish this, single-channel images corresponding to each fiber type are retrieved and the total ROI mask is applied (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0229041.g002">Fig 2A</xref>. Total ROI Overlay step). Intensity values are extracted from each ROI and plotted as a frequency distribution (bin width automatically determined by Fiji). The distributions are typically bimodal, with peaks corresponding to myofibers that are positively stained for a given MyHC isoform (high intensity values at the right of the histogram) and those that are not (low intensity values at the left of the histogram). From the intensity histograms, the investigator is prompted to manually establish a threshold that will be used to define positive and negative fibers of each type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0229041.g002">Fig 2A</xref>. Mean Intensity Distribution step). Myosoft then chooses all ROIs above the input threshold and saves the new ROI selection for each fiber type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0229041.g002">Fig 2A</xref>. ROI selection step). Next, Myosoft recalls the ROI selection for IIa, IIb, and I fibers, recolors and fills them as black and embeds them in the image (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0229041.g002">Fig 2A</xref>. B&amp;W ROI Mask step). Finally, to determine IIx fibers, Myosoft retrieves the total ROI mask and applies it to this black and white (BW) reference image. Myosoft then extracts the modal value from each ROI. Since type IIa, IIb, and I are black, the modal value extracted for these ROIs will be 0. Conversely, since regions that are not type IIa, IIb, nor I are empty (white), ROIs from the total mask which overlay these will possess a modal value of 255. Myosoft selects for ROIs with modal values of 255 as type IIx fibers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0229041.g002">Fig 2D</xref>).</p>

    </sec>
    <sec id="sec018">
      <title>ii. Fiber typing pipeline—Delineation of mixed and pure fibers</title>
      <p>To determine mixed fiber types for all combinations (IIa/IIb, IIa/I, IIb/I, IIa/IIb/I), Myosoft retrieves each BW reference image and ROI masks from each type are successively overlaid and measured. Each time, ROIs with modal values of 0 (black)–an indication that it is a mixed fiber–are selected and saved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0229041.g002">Fig 2B</xref>).</p>
      <p>To find fibers that are solely IIa, IIb, or I, Myosoft retrieves the ROIs corresponding to all possible mixed combinations for each fiber type individually. For example, for IIa fibers, it will retrieve ROIs for IIa/IIb, IIa/I, and IIa/IIb/I. These ROIs are then converted into a BW mask as described above. Myosoft will then overlay the complete ROI set for that particular fiber type, as generated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0229041.g002">Fig 2A</xref>, and will extract modal intensity values. Myosoft will then select ROIs with a modal intensity value of 255 (white) and save this as the pure ROI set for that respective fiber type. Once the above analysis has concluded, the investigator will have the ROIs and morphometric data for all fiber types. However, note that because Myosoft detects IIx fibers via the absence of other MyHC staining, it is unable to determine IIx-containing mixed fiber types (IIa/IIx and IIb/IIx). Biologically, hybrid fibers are almost always composed of MyHC isoforms that are adjacent on the spectrum of twitch kinetics (type I/IIa fibers are exceedingly more common that I/IIb fibers) [<xref rid="pone.0229041.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0229041.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0229041.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Thus, while Myosoft will report the “presence” of type I/IIb or type I/IIa/IIb fibers, these categories are subject to errors arising from staining irregularities and the intensity thresholding method used to identify fiber types. We have chosen to maintain this aspect of the analysis pipeline because 1) these fiber types are very rarely be detected (~.5% in our test data set) and 2) counting these objects ensures that fibers are not counted more than once (Myosoft could count an erroneous “I/IIb” fiber once, or count the same fiber twice, as both a type I and a type IIb fiber). Furthermore, the legitimacy of these fiber types may be easily verified using the Myosoft-saved ROIs and single channel images for individual fiber types.</p>

      <title>Adjustable parameters</title>
      <p>In our initial tests of Myosoft, we noticed that some objects that were not myofibers were erroneously scored as myofibers. However, by visual inspection, it is clear that these objects differ in size and shape from true muscle fibers. We reasoned that exclusion criteria based on morphometric features of objects would eliminate these objects from detection. Therefore, Myosoft prompts the user to enter constraining values for several parameters that correspond to specific morphometric features. This is accomplished through the Extended Particle Analyzer plugin within the Biovoxxel Toolbox. Parameters include cross-sectional area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0229041.g003">Fig 3A</xref>, recommended range: 50–6000μm<sup>2</sup>), circularity (a measure of how well an object approximates a circle, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0229041.g003">Fig 3C</xref>, recommended range: 0.3–1.0), minimum Feret diameter (the closest possible distance between two parallel tangents of an object, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0229041.g003">Fig 3E</xref>, recommended range: 5.5–60μm), and Feret aspect ratio (the quotient of maximum and minimum Feret distances, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0229041.g003">Fig 3G</xref>, recommended range: 1–4). Adjusting these parameters can be used to exclude artifacts (e.g., interstitial spaces), objects that are not fibers (e.g. blood vessels), and improperly annotated fibers (e.g., two fibers where the boundary between them is incomplete, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0229041.g003">Fig 3B, 3D, 3F and 3H</xref>). Myosoft is pre-loaded with default (e.g. recommended) values for several morphometric parameters, which were determined experimentally through testing on a single WT control section (~6000 fibers). Parameters were adjusted one at a time and then in groups to identify conditions in which the sum of false positive and false negative measurements were minimized. It must be noted that because the recommended morphometric gates were identified on adult control tissue, it is likely that these values will need to be adjusted in certain contexts (e.g. dystrophic, regenerating, or neonatal/young muscles).</p>

      <title>Myosoft performance is comparable to manual analysis</title>
      <p>We next wanted to determine how effective Myosoft is as a tool for automated myofiber size and type analysis. Two researchers with previous experience analyzing myofibers used the polygon tool in Fiji to outline muscle fibers from six section sub images (~150–600 fibers/image, ~1700 fibers total) to obtain CSA values. We then ran the same images through the Myosoft program and obtained a distribution of CSA across the images. The CSA distributions did not differ significantly between manual and Myosoft analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0229041.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). Next, we tested the accuracy of fiber typing using Myosoft. Fiber type analysis was manually performed by 3 individuals on 6 images (2 images per person) representing ~3000 fibers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0229041.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). We then used Myosoft to obtain mean intensity data for blue, red and far red channels across these four images for fiber typing.

      <title>Myosoft is a reliable program to analyze large-scale muscle histology images</title>
      <p>Several tools exist for automation of muscle histological analysis, but Myosoft is the first we are aware of that employs machine learning. To validate this approach, we compared the performance of Myosoft and other programs that analyze muscle histology. We chose three recently published programs for initial comparison: Myovision, SMASH, and MuscleJ [<xref rid="pone.0229041.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0229041.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0229041.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. First, we compared the muscle fiber count across programs with manual count, which is considered here to be the “true” muscle fiber count. While all muscle histology programs performed well counting myofiber number from muscle sections containing less than 500 fibers, Muscle J identified fewer fibers from images containing ~750–1200 fibers, Myovision identified fewer fibers from images containing ~1200–2000 fibers, and SMASH identified more fibers from images containing ~1750–2000 fibers. Myosoft was the only program to consistently reflect manual count throughout images regardless of fiber count (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0229041.g005">Fig 5A</xref>).</p>

      <p>Since these data only compare the raw fiber count with manual analysis, they do not represent the accuracy of the program <italic>per se</italic>. For example, a program may possess a high false positive and false negative rate, such that while the count may appear artificially similar to the manual count, it does not provide an accurate measure fiber number (i.e. high precision and low accuracy). Further, accuracy may be more seriously affected if the quality of the stain is not optimal. Since consistently producing high quality (i.e. high contrast) stains may be impractical, utilizing a program that can retain good performance on lower quality stains is desirable. Thus, we sought to examine Myosoft accuracy (as indicated via false positive and false negative rates) under conditions where the stain is “poor” or “good” (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0229041.g005">Fig 5B–5E</xref>). Good quality is defined as little to no noise between the muscle fiber boundary and intra-fiber space (the ratio of intensity between the intra-fiber space and fiber boundary &gt; 5), while poor quality is defined as mid to high noise (intensity ratios ≤5) between the muscle fiber boundary and intra-fiber space (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0229041.g005">Fig 5B</xref>). False positives are defined as ROIs that do not delimit a single, whole muscle fiber (where “true” fibers are determined with manual annotation). We note three possibilities for this type of error: a single ROI outlining 2 fibers (2 as 1), 2 ROIs outlining a single fiber (1 as 2), and ROIs marking objects that are not fibers (non-fiber) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0229041.g005">Fig 5C</xref>, 1–3). The false positive rate is defined as the number of false positives divided by the total number of fibers counted via manual analysis. Conversely, the false negative rate is defined as the rate at which the program does not generate an ROI for a fiber (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0229041.g005">Fig 5C</xref>, 4). We chose to compare Myosoft only to MuscleJ since it is the most recent muscle fiber analysis program and has the largest suite of abilities presented to date. Furthermore, it is like Myosoft in that it is capable of analyzing large-scale images, is coded in IJMacro and runs in Fiji (SMASH and Myovision require a MATLAB compiler). We chose images randomly from both “poor” and “good” quality stains (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0229041.s005">S2 Fig</xref>). When instances of false positive and false negative were counted manually for both Myosoft and MuscleJ, Myosoft displayed robust low false negative and false positive rates (&lt;1.5%) regardless of staining quality (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0229041.g005">Fig 5D and 5E</xref>). Meanwhile, when the stain quality was poor, MuscleJ (green line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0229041.g005">Fig 5B</xref>) performed significantly worse than Myosoft (red line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0229041.g005">Fig 5B</xref>). With low quality images, MuscleJ’s false negative rate was ~40% and false positive rate was ~17%, which were significantly greater than those of Myosoft for both good- and poor-quality stains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0229041.g005">Fig 5D and 5E</xref>).</p>

      <title>Example data: Histological analysis of gastrocnemius muscles</title>
      <p>We tested Myosoft with sections derived from WT gastrocnemius muscles (n = 8 mice). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0229041.g006">Fig 6A</xref> shows representative fiber type (top) and laminin staining images (middle). Myosoft generates a color-coded CSA map to visualize the distribution of muscle fiber size (bottom). In addition, Myosoft provides .csv files for all fibers, pure fiber types and mixed fiber types. Proportions of individual fiber types are reported to the user when Myosoft concludes analysis in an ImageJ log window, providing immediate data from the run. Mixed fiber type proportions are not reported, but are easily calculated from data given in .csv files. Proportions of all pure and mixed fiber types are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0229041.g006">Fig 6B</xref>. Mixed fibers were identified at a rate of approximately 7 per 1000, indicating that although they were largely absent from our test images, Myosoft is capable of resolving them. Lastly, because Myosoft generates a unique .csv file for every possible pure or mixed type, it is simple to generate histograms of CSA values for individual fiber types. CSA distributions from our test dataset are provided in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0229041.g006">Fig 6C</xref>.</p>

      <title>Example: Myosoft clearly distinguishes normal and dystrophic muscle</title>
      <p>Finally, we sought to evaluate the power of Myosoft to detect differences between normal and dystrophic tissue. For this purpose, we analyzed TA/EDL sections from WT or <italic>mdx</italic> mice. The <italic>mdx</italic> mouse is one of the most common muscular dystrophy models, harboring a spontaneous mutation in the <italic>Dmd</italic> gene (encoding dystrophin) and presenting with a moderate muscle phenotype [<xref rid="pone.0229041.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. <italic>Mdx</italic> muscle showed clear variability in its fiber size distribution, with abnormally high proportions of both atrophic and hypertrophic fibers. This feature, which is a hallmark of muscular dystrophy, was evident by inspection of the color-coded section image generated by Myosoft and through comparison of CSA histograms from <italic>mdx</italic> or WT muscle fibers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0229041.g007">Fig 7A and 7C</xref>). Fiber type proportions were similar between the two groups, although <italic>mdx</italic> TAs tended to have more Type IIx fibers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0229041.g007">Fig 7B</xref>). However, because the presence of IIx fibers is inferred through the absence of staining for Type I, Type IIa, or Type IIb-specific myosin heavy chain isoforms, we cannot rule out the possibility that fibers identified as IIx in this dataset are actually regenerating fibers (expressing embryonic myosin heavy chain). This is a limitation of conventional fluorescence microscopy, which uses filter cubes to distinguish light of various wavelengths. Typically, only four channels can be well resolved using this method, making it impossible to identify fiber boundaries and Type I, Type IIa, Type IIb, Type IIx and regenerating fibers. Multispectral imaging techniques, which currently enable simultaneous imaging of up to six fluorophores, are a potential means to circumvent this issue and make it possible to identify both regenerating fibers, Type IIx fibers, and hybrid Type IIa/IIx or Type IIx/IIb fibers [<xref rid="pone.0229041.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. We expect to make future versions of Myosoft compatible with this method. Lastly, we used Myosoft to compare individual fiber-type distributions between WT and <italic>mdx</italic> sections. We found that distributions for every type were strongly right-skewed in <italic>mdx</italic> muscle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0229041.g007">Fig 7D</xref>), which is expected for dystrophic muscle. Altogether, we provide a practical demonstration that Myosoft easily detects fiber size differences between normal and dystrophic muscle.</p>

    <title>Discussion</title>
    <p>Although analyses of muscle fiber size and type are crucial in both research and clinical contexts, they are still routinely performed manually despite their laborious nature and consequently represent a substantial bottleneck for projects that require them. Recent advances in computer technology have enabled software-based automation of standard laboratory data analysis, including analysis of digital images. To date, several groups have reported tools intended for applications in histological studies of muscle, including Myovision, SMASH, and MuscleJ [<xref rid="pone.0229041.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0229041.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0229041.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. However, we found that all programs tested stumbled in analysis of large images or images with sub-optimal staining. During the development of Myosoft, additional ImageJ-based muscle analysis macros with useful features were described. First, Open-CSAM uses Huang auto-thresholding followed by particle analysis to identify fibers. As reported by the authors, although this method works well for detection of the majority of myofibers within a tissue section, it requires substantial manual supplementation (correction) to achieve high accuracy (that is, the user must individually draw ROIs for missed fibers or delete ROIs for misidentified non-fibers). Furthermore, this macro is not appropriate for fiber-type analysis [<xref rid="pone.0229041.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. The second macro, which is unnamed, is heavily dependent on achieving high signal:noise membrane counterstaining, which the authors propose to accomplish by using anti-spectrin and anti-dystrophin antibodies in tandem during their immunofluorescent processing. This is emblematic of a larger problem with automated image analysis: in general, automated analysis is successful only when staining protocols are optimized to yield higher quality (greater signal:noise) input images for subsequent analysis. If myofiber boundaries are well delineated, this macro performs well in calculating fiber CSAs, and will also segment Type I and Type II fibers. The macro also generates size-based (CSA or major/minor diameter) color-coded section maps, which, as the authors demonstrate, make it simple to visually detect differences in CSA distributions between different tissues. However, it is only built to handle two fiber types, and as such is not able to distinguish Type II subtypes from one another or identify mixed fiber types [<xref rid="pone.0229041.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. As a novel alternative, we employed a machine learning-based approach to improve the accuracy of image segmentation without altering standard protocols for tissue staining or image acquisition. By using two classifiers iteratively, Myosoft systematically improves image signal:noise without the need for manipulation of original images.</p>
    <p>We have shown that Myosoft yields essentially equivalent fiber size distributions to manually annotated data, but this capability is not unique. A more challenging problem in muscle histology analysis is the evaluation of specific fiber type proportions and size distributions. Identification of muscle fiber types is most commonly accomplished through immunofluorescent methods, but weak labelling or low expression of certain myosin heavy chain isoforms, as well as high background fluorescence of muscle sections at certain wavelengths, can make it difficult to obtain data that is both precise and accurate. Myosoft solves this problem by storing identified fiber boundaries as ROIs and overlaying these ROIs on images of individual fluorescent channels, each of which corresponds to a particular myosin isoform (and, by extension, fiber type). Thresholds for determining fiber types are set objectively according to the distribution of intensities for all fibers on a given channel. Although high signal:noise ratios make the task of setting the threshold simpler, we show that it is possible to determine a valid threshold even when differences between positive and negative fibers are hard to identify by eye. Furthermore, since several measurements are made for each ROI, it is possible to set thresholds based on parameters other than intensity. For example, the standard deviation of intensity may be an even more accurate (albeit less intuitive) metric for identifying fiber types because it is less sensitive to variation in staining intensity across the section or photobleaching that occurs during image acquisition.</p>
    <p>While we focus on the use of Myosoft for fiber type analysis, it could conceivably be applied in any instance where it is necessary or desirable to make intensity measurements within identified object boundaries. For example, Myosoft is well-suited to assess muscle fusion <italic>in vivo</italic> with Pax7<sup>cre/ERT</sup>;tdTomato reporter mice [<xref rid="pone.0229041.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. In these mice, myofibers express tdTomato fluorescent protein following fusion with tdTomato expressing satellite cells, and more brightly fluorescent myofibers are understood to have incorporated more satellite cells (i.e. greater rate of <italic>in vivo</italic> fusion). Aside from this, the utility of Myosoft is not limited to intensity-based analyses. In fact, any standard measurement that can be made for an ROI can be made for a “fiber”. This could be exploited to detect fibers with centrally located nuclei; the presence of a stained nucleus within the myofiber would result in a region of high fluorescent intensity surrounded by a region of low intensity and high overall variation in the intensity measurements taken for the fiber. Thus, analysis of standard deviations for mean intensity would report on the presence of centrally located nuclei. As proof of principle, we have generated a separate macro which exclusively detects central nuclei of, and we will upload this to the same repository as Myosoft on GitHub. Another application of Myosoft might be found in denervated muscle commonly features atrophic, angular fibers which could be detected by plotting distributions of morphometric features measured by Myosoft like circularity and solidity. Notably, the machine learning approach presented here is not restricted to analysis of skeletal muscle. The classifiers used in our macro could be extended to detect boundaries for non-muscle objects provided that there is sufficient distinction between the object and its boundary. Although we have not specifically tested additional applications, we posit that Myosoft could be easily modified to identify, for example, cardiomyocytes or adipocytes in histological sections so long as a suitable marker of the cell membrane is available.</p>
    <p>Computing technology is now firmly integrated into the biological research enterprise, but rapid advances in fields such as machine learning and artificial intelligence offer new opportunities for automation of tedious analyses. Although Myosoft is, to our knowledge, the first program to exploit machine learning for use in muscle histological analysis, it is indeed only a first step. While the program represents a substantial improvement over manual analysis, it is not as complete as MuscleJ with respect to the kinds of myological analyses it will perform, such as counting vessels around myofibers and counting satellite cell number. In the future, we hope to introduce additional functionality into Myosoft so that our machine learning method can be leveraged for most or all common types of skeletal muscle histological analysis. It should also be noted that since Myosoft provides users with raw data and reference images, it is possible to corroborate results (something that is not possible within MuscleJ). We have likewise taken care to ensure that Myosoft will be simple and convenient to use for the entire muscle community through extensive beta testing and by providing detailed instructions for use/troubleshooting. Looking forward, it will be interesting to extend this approach to other types of analyses, both in muscle and beyond. As the use of automation expands in biological sciences, previously intractable research questions will become increasingly accessible.</p>

    <title>Conclusions</title>
    <p>Myosoft synergizes the power of machine learning-based image segmentation with thresholding-based object extraction and quantification to obtain the morphometry and type of fibers in a given histological section of muscle. In doing so, it is capable of circumventing the time, effort, and error incurred by manual histology analysis and addresses the central limitations of its peers. Myosoft is freely available for use in the open access image analysis platform: Fiji (Fiji Is Just ImageJ), allowing access to the vast repertoire of functions therein which are familiar to much of the muscle community. Myosoft also applies the power and versatility of a machine learning-based approach to image analysis. We anticipate that Myosoft will be an especially useful tool for the muscle community and will serve as a scaffold for the creation of future automation programs.</p>

    <p>Reviewer #1: This paper presents a semi-automated method for the morphometric and fiber type analysis in muscle sections stained with fluorescent antibodies</p>
    <p>estimating the size and type in histological muscle preparations is useful for quantifying key indicators of muscle</p>
    <p>function and for measuring responses to a variety of stimuli or stressors.</p>
    <p>The method is interesting since it might help clinicians who presently manually perform this analysis; however, this is a</p>
    <p>laborious, time consuming task, affected by inter and intra-personal variability.</p>
    <p>Results are compared to state of the art works; however, I think that several points must be modified/extended before accepting the article.</p>
    <p>section Introduction</p>
    <p>---------------------</p>
    <p>The introduction is clear, the problem is well stated.</p>
    <p>However, I think some state of the art works are missing.</p>
    <p>More precisely, in lines 70-72, authors list some automatic segmentation techniques:</p>
    <p>"To offset this obstacle, several groups have developed software that automates analysis of muscle histology (16-19)."</p>
    <p>My advice is to shortly summarize the main steps of the cited methods (I believe they are the mostly related to this work).</p>
    <p>Moreover, in subsequent lines, authors mention that learning methods are the solution to overcome staining artifacts</p>
    <p>and they say (line 75): "Machine learning offers unprecedented potential in</p>
    <p>76 resolving these present limitations in automated image analysis (20)."</p>
    <p>I would firstly recall some works where machine learning methods are used to solve the problem of histochemical image segmentation.</p>
    <p>As an example, please have a look (and I would cite) the following works, which exploit machine learning methods for stained image analysis.</p>
    <p>[1] Madabhushi A, Lee G. (2016).</p>
    <p>Image analysis and machine learning in digital pathology: Challenges and opportunities.</p>
    <p>Medical image Analysis, 33: p. 170-175.</p>
    <p>[2] Gurcan MN, Boucheron L, Can A, Madabhushi A, Rajpoot N, Yener B. (2009).</p>
    <p>Histopathological Image Analysis: A review.</p>
    <p>IEEE Rev Biomed Eng., 2: p. 147-171.</p>
    <p>[1] Casiraghi E, Cossa M, Huber V, Tozzi M, Rivoltini L, Villa A, et al. (2017)</p>
    <p>"MIAQuant, a novel system for automatic segmentation, measurement, and localization comparison of different biomarkers from serialized histological slices",</p>
    <p>Eur J Histochem.</p>
    <p>[2] Casiraghi E, Huber V, Frasca M, Cossa M, Tozzi M, Rivoltini L, et al. (2018).</p>
    <p>A novel computational method for automatic segmentation, quantification and comparative analysis of immunohistochemically labeled tissue sections.</p>
    <p>BMC BioInformatics. 19(Suppl 10): p. 357.</p>
    <p>Next I would insert citation (20) and recall the main features of Trainable Weka Segmentation. Why authors did choose this learning</p>
    <p>strategy, instead of others?</p>
    <p>section Image acquisition</p>
    <p>--------------------------</p>
    <p>At the end of this section I would put a table, or anyway I would clarify:</p>
    <p>- how many sections where acquired,</p>
    <p>- the dimensions of the acquired sections</p>
    <p>- how many subimages where extracted from those sections</p>
    <p>- the dimension of the extracted subimages</p>
    <p>- how many subimages where used for developing (and training) the system</p>
    <p>- how many subimages where used for testing it</p>
    <p>Please put some images to show:</p>
    <p>- the whole section</p>
    <p>- some of the working subimages</p>
    <p>- some of the discarded subimages (discarded as explained in line 133-134:</p>
    <p>"If an image was randomly selected and had significant fluorescence artifacts or tissue damage,</p>
    <p>this area was either excluded, or a new image was chosen.")</p>
    <p>- some good stain quality subimages (stain ratio&gt;5)</p>
    <p>- some poor stain quality subimages (stain ratio&lt;=5).</p>
    <p>A small note on line 138: I believe poor stain are less OR EQUAL TO, isn't it?</p>
    <p>Otherwise, what about subimages with stain ratio = 5?</p>
    <p>section Four components of the Myosoft pipeline</p>
    <p>------------------------------------------------</p>
    <p>At first, I would insert Fig.1, the schematic drawing to recall the main step of the myosoft pipeline, at the beginning of the section and,</p>
    <p>obviously, I would start the section with lines 185-196.</p>
    <p>line 156: which contrast enhancement technique and which convolutional (filter) matrix are applied as preprocessing?</p>
    <p>The latest might be a gaussian/median filter to remove</p>
    <p>high band/salt-and-pepper, randomic noise... however please clarify.</p>
    <p>What is the iterative classifier mentioned in line 165? Neural network, SVM, convolutional neural network, kNN, bayesian tree,...</p>
    <p>I won't go in details with the remaining part of the algorithm described in this section, since the note is that</p>
    <p>each step must be better explained.</p>
    <p>All the image processing steps are just mentioned. Therefore, if a reader wants to reimplement it, he must understand the code,</p>
    <p>which means the paper is not clear at all.</p>
    <p>Briefly, I would suggest that authors start mentioning Fig.1 and listing the main steps of the algorithm.</p>
    <p>Next, for each step, I would insert a subsection describing in detail the processing and the algorithms used in the step.</p>
    <p>section Adjustable Parameters</p>
    <p>------------------------------</p>
    <p>Since the parameters are manually chosen by users, I would suggest that the author mention which procedure is used to choose the parameter values.</p>
    <p>section Fiber typing is determined by gating of MyHC fluorescent intensity distributions</p>
    <p>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
    <p>Are the thresholds automatically chosen by automatic methods (e.g. Otsu or Arbib), or are them manually set by users?</p>
    <p>If they are manually set, what happens if any automatic thresholding or clustering method is used?</p>
    <p>sections on Results and Discussion</p>
    <p>----------------------------------</p>
    <p>These sections are well written and well presented, in my opinion, though I can't really understand the test sample size.</p>
    <p>How many sections where used for testing?</p>
    <p>There must be at least 50 sections to consider the work as convincing.</p>
    <p>Comparison to existing software would be more convincing if the number of test images and mean performance ratios were reported (e.g. with a table).</p>
    <p>Reviewer #2: In this study, the authors developed myosoft, an improved automated tool, for the analysis of muscle myofibers size and classification of fiber type populations in histological samples stained with fluorescent antibodies. Myosoft implements a machine learning approach, which appears to overcome the limitation of existing technologies that rely on the need of having a high quality staining to achieve accurate analysis. The overall work is exciting and the tool could be of great use for the biomedical field. However, considering the authors are introducing a new tool for general research use, information describing the requirements/steps for the use of this tool is necessary, as well as a fine-tuned approach for the detection of hybrid fibers.</p>
    <p>Specific comments:</p>
    <p>Given than the authors are introducing a new method for the histological analysis of muscle sections, a lot of details regarding the image requirements as well as the detailed steps for the use of the tool from beginning to end need to be provided. For instance:</p>
    <p>1. There are very few details regarding the requirements for: a) image acquisition (i.e. exposure time), b) format of the images needed to be analyzed by the tool (TIFF, 8 bit, 16 bit, merged image, individual channels, etc), c) organization of the image-files for multiple sample analysis, d) any pre-treatment of the images (it was not clear whether the multiple supplementary txt files are run before the analysis), or e) the computer needs for running the program.</p>
    <p>2. There was no tutorial with troubleshooting instructions attached as supplementary data in this manuscript or at the github site. The file attached as S2 included only a few lines of instructions with not sufficient details for a novice user. A tutorial with clear, detailed instructions of the use of the tool (preferably with images/screen shots), that includes a descriptive list of the output files obtained with an explanation of the information contained in each of them, is necessary for the correct use of the tool and an accurate interpretation of the results. Finally, it was not clear how the multiple files provided as supplementary materials should be used for the analysis of one sample (multiple samples) or for what purposes are these used. This point needs to be expanded and clarified.</p>
    <p>3. For this tool to be pertinent to the user that requires fast information, the analysis should include an output file (or a log) that contains a summary of the following information:</p>
    <p>a) Number of cells/µm2 (or biopsy size [mm2] so this information can be calculated),</p>
    <p>b) Total number of cells</p>
    <p>c) Number of cells (and %) corresponding to each fiber type</p>
    <p>d) Average CSA of all cells (µm2)</p>
    <p>e) Average CSA of each fiber type population (µm2)</p>
    <p>4. It would also be important to define what is considered a sub-optimal quality staining and define the limits at which the tool can still provide an accurate analysis.</p>
    <p>5. The authors compared myosoft with several available tools that perform similar tasks as the developed method. However, at least 2 recent publications (2019) describing automated tools using Image/J (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://doi.org/10.1186/s13395-018-0186-6">doi.org/10.1186/s13395-018-0186-6</ext-link> and doi: 10.1186/s13395-019-0200-7) have been overlooked. To have a better perspective of myosoft capabilities as compared to more recent tools, I recommend these tools should at least be mentioned in the discussion part of the manuscript.</p>
    <p>6. One of the main issues of current tools for automated detection of fiber populations in muscle sections is the detection of hybrid fibers. Biologically fibers can adapt and switch from one fiber population to another in response to different stimuli. While I understand how you propose to quantify I/IIa fibers, I am concern about the significance of finding I/IIb or IIa/IIb or I/IIa/IIb fibers. More than a biological phenomenon, the presence of these populations together is a reflection of staining issues that needs to be addressed. More importantly is to define the criteria to select one population vs the other (i.e. in the case of I/IIb are these cells really type I (slowest) or IIb (fastest)). Finally, hybrid fibers for IIa/IIx or IIx/IIb populations cannot be accounted for with the proposed staining protocol.</p>

    </p>
    <p>We are resubmitting our revised manuscript “Myosoft: an automated muscle histology analysis tool using machine learning algorithm utilizing FIJI/ImageJ software” (PONE-D-19-24806). We thank the reviewers for their insightful comments which have substantially improved the manuscript. We have addressed their concerns with manuscript revisions and new figures. Changes in the manuscript are indicated in red font. See below for a point by point response to their various concerns.</p>
    <p>Reviewer #1 </p>
    <p>This paper presents a semi-automated method for the morphometric and fiber type analysis in muscle sections stained with fluorescent antibodies estimating the size and type in histological muscle preparations is useful for quantifying key indicators of muscle function and for measuring responses to a variety of stimuli or stressors. The method is interesting since it might help clinicians who presently manually perform this analysis; however, this is a laborious, time consuming task, affected by inter and intra-personal variability. Results are compared to state of the art works; however, I think that several points must be modified/extended before accepting the article.</p>
    <p>section Introduction</p>
    <p>---------------------</p>
    <p>The introduction is clear, the problem is well stated. However, I think some state of the art works are missing. More precisely, in lines 70-72, authors list some automatic segmentation techniques: "To offset this obstacle, several groups have developed software that automates analysis of muscle histology (16-19)." My advice is to shortly summarize the main steps of the cited methods (I believe they are the mostly related to this work). </p>
    <p>We added a summary of cited methods as recommended.</p>
    <p>Moreover, in subsequent lines, authors mention that learning methods are the solution to overcome staining artifacts and they say (line 75): "Machine learning offers unprecedented potential in 76 resolving these present limitations in automated image analysis (20)."</p>
    <p>I would firstly recall some works where machine learning methods are used to solve the problem of histochemical image segmentation.</p>
    <p>As an example, please have a look (and I would cite) the following works, which exploit machine learning methods for stained image analysis.</p>
    <p>[1] Madabhushi A, Lee G. (2016). Image analysis and machine learning in digital pathology: Challenges and opportunities. Medical image Analysis, 33: p. 170-175.</p>
    <p>[2] Gurcan MN, Boucheron L, Can A, Madabhushi A, Rajpoot N, Yener B. (2009). Histopathological Image Analysis: A review. IEEE Rev Biomed Eng., 2: p. 147-171.</p>
    <p>[1] Casiraghi E, Cossa M, Huber V, Tozzi M, Rivoltini L, Villa A, et al. (2017)</p>
    <p>"MIAQuant, a novel system for automatic segmentation, measurement, and localization comparison of different biomarkers from serialized histological slices", Eur J Histochem.</p>
    <p>[2] Casiraghi E, Huber V, Frasca M, Cossa M, Tozzi M, Rivoltini L, et al. (2018). A novel computational method for automatic segmentation, quantification and comparative analysis of immunohistochemically labeled tissue sections. BMC BioInformatics. 19(Suppl 10): p. 357.</p>
    <p>We appreciate that the reviewer provided supportive references. We added those references and mentioned in introduction section. </p>
    <p>Next I would insert citation (20) and recall the main features of Trainable Weka Segmentation. Why authors did choose this learning strategy, instead of others?</p>
    <p> Trainable Weka Segmentation (TWS) is a machine learning based tool for image segmentation, which has been developed for the popular open-source image analysis software ImageJ. In addition to increased usability of TWS by Fiji plugin option, TWS has several advantages including freely available license, user-friendly graphic interface, and portability due to JAVA language implementation (27).</p>
    <p>section Image acquisition</p>
    <p>--------------------------</p>
    <p>At the end of this section I would put a table, or anyway I would clarify:</p>
    <p>- how many sections where acquired,</p>
    <p>- the dimensions of the acquired sections</p>
    <p>- how many sub-images where extracted from those sections</p>
    <p>- the dimension of the extracted subimages</p>
    <p>- how many subimages where used for developing (and training) the system</p>
    <p>- how many subimages where used for testing it</p>
    <p>We include this information in supporting file 6.</p>
    <p>Please put some images to show:</p>
    <p>- the whole section</p>
    <p>- some of the working subimages</p>
    <p>- some of the discarded subimages (discarded as explained in line 133-134:</p>
    <p>"If an image was randomly selected and had significant fluorescence artifacts or tissue damage,</p>
    <p>this area was either excluded, or a new image was chosen.")</p>
    <p>- some good stain quality subimages (stain ratio&gt;5)</p>
    <p>- some poor stain quality subimages (stain ratio&lt;=5).</p>
    <p>We include this information in supporting file 5.</p>
    <p>A small note on line 138: I believe poor stain are less OR EQUAL TO, isn't it? Otherwise, what about subimages with stain ratio = 5?</p>
    <p>We agree and corrected as recommended.</p>
    <p>section Four components of the Myosoft pipeline</p>
    <p>------------------------------------------------</p>
    <p>At first, I would insert Fig.1, the schematic drawing to recall the main step of the myosoft pipeline, at the beginning of the section and, obviously, I would start the section with lines 185-196.</p>
    <p>We put Figure 1 at the beginning of ‘Four components of the Myosoft pipeline’.</p>
    <p>line 156: which contrast enhancement technique and which convolutional (filter) matrix are applied as preprocessing? The latest might be a gaussian/median filter to remove high band/salt-and-pepper, randomic noise... however please clarify.</p>
    <p>We show our custom 5X5 convolutional matrix formula to clarify.</p>
    <p>What is the iterative classifier mentioned in line 165? Neural network, SVM, convolutional neural network, kNN, bayesian tree,...</p>
    <p>Both the primary and iterative classifier use a multithread version of random forest. The difference is that the iterative classifier is trained using the probability distribution output of the primary classifier. Therefore, the decision-tree structure is different between the two. We provide a brief explanation of this point in the Results section (Fig. 1) where segmentation steps are described.</p>
    <p>I won't go in details with the remaining part of the algorithm described in this section, since the note is that each step must be better explained. All the image processing steps are just mentioned. Therefore, if a reader wants to reimplement it, he must understand the code, which means the paper is not clear at all.</p>
    <p>We added detailed information for each step.</p>
    <p>section Adjustable Parameters</p>
    <p>------------------------------</p>
    <p>Since the parameters are manually chosen by users, I would suggest that the author mention which procedure is used to choose the parameter values.</p>
    <p>We chose parameters that minimized the sum of the proportions of false positives and false negatives. More information about our approach has been included in the manuscript, in the Results section pertaining to Adjustable Parameters (Fig. 3).</p>
    <p>section Fiber typing is determined by gating of MyHC fluorescent intensity distributions</p>
    <p>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
    <p>Are the thresholds automatically chosen by automatic methods (e.g. Otsu or Arbib), or are them manually set by users? If they are manually set, what happens if any automatic thresholding or clustering method is used?</p>
    <p>Originally, fiber typing required manual thresholding outside of ImageJ. We sought to maintain all functionality within ImageJ. Since, to our knowledge, there is no ImageJ plugin that outputs the intensity value where an algorithm gates (e.g. outputs the intensity value at which the inter-class variance is greatest for Otsu), we opted to include automatic plotting of the intensity distribution. We then integrated convenient GUIs which guide the investigator in choosing the proper gate (Fig 2A. Mean Intensity Distribution step). Although this adds a supervised step to Myosoft, we argue that automating and housing the fiber-typing within ImageJ streamlines the process as a whole and using automated thresholding does not add significant value to the program. </p>
    <p>sections on Results and Discussion</p>
    <p>----------------------------------</p>
    <p>These sections are well written and well presented, in my opinion, though I can't really understand the test sample size. How many sections where used for testing? There must be at least 50 sections to consider the work as convincing.</p>
    <p>We used 22 whole muscle section images (64 sub images) to develop Myosoft and 14 whole muscle section images (224 sub images) to test Myosoft (Supporting File 6). </p>
    <p>Comparison to existing software would be more convincing if the number of test images and mean performance ratios were reported (e.g. with a table).</p>
    <p>We used 8 images to compare Myosoft and existing muscle analysis software. Fig 5A shows the performance of each software to compare manual analysis (each data point represents an image analyzed manually, or by Myosoft or the other automated methods mentioned). Overall performances are noted by formulas for lines of best fit and r2 values from regression analysis.</p>
    <p>Reviewer #2 </p>
    <p>In this study, the authors developed myosoft, an improved automated tool, for the analysis of muscle myofibers size and classification of fiber type populations in histological samples stained with fluorescent antibodies. Myosoft implements a machine learning approach, which appears to overcome the limitation of existing technologies that rely on the need of having a high quality staining to achieve accurate analysis. The overall work is exciting and the tool could be of great use for the biomedical field. However, considering the authors are introducing a new tool for general research use, information describing the requirements/steps for the use of this tool is necessary, as well as a fine-tuned approach for the detection of hybrid fibers.</p>
    <p>Specific comments:</p>
    <p>Given than the authors are introducing a new method for the histological analysis of muscle sections, a lot of details regarding the image requirements as well as the detailed steps for the use of the tool from beginning to end need to be provided. For instance:</p>
    <p>1. There are very few details regarding the requirements for: a) image acquisition (i.e. exposure time), b) format of the images needed to be analyzed by the tool (TIFF, 8 bit, 16 bit, merged image, individual channels, etc), c) organization of the image-files for multiple sample analysis, d) any pre-treatment of the images (it was not clear whether the multiple supplementary txt files are run before the analysis), or e) the computer needs for running the program.</p>
    <p>We added detailed information in image acquisition of Method section.</p>
    <p>2. There was no tutorial with troubleshooting instructions attached as supplementary data in this manuscript or at the github site. The file attached as S2 included only a few lines of instructions with not sufficient details for a novice user. A tutorial with clear, detailed instructions of the use of the tool (preferably with images/screen shots), that includes a descriptive list of the output files obtained with an explanation of the information contained in each of them, is necessary for the correct use of the tool and an accurate interpretation of the results. </p>
    <p>We apologize for omitting the tutorial file in the last submission. We attached a detail-oriented tutorial as Supp. File 3. We also updated our Github site with newer versions of Myosoft and tutorials. </p>
    <p>Finally, it was not clear how the multiple files provided as supplementary materials should be used for the analysis of one sample (multiple samples) or for what purposes are these used. This point needs to be expanded and clarified. </p>
    <p>We described the expected data after Myosoft analysis in ‘Example data: Histology analysis of gastrocnemius muscles’ section.</p>
    <p>3. For this tool to be pertinent to the user that requires fast information, the analysis should include an output file (or a log) that contains a summary of the following information:</p>
    <p>a) Number of cells/µm2 (or biopsy size [mm2] so this information can be calculated),</p>
    <p>b) Total number of cells</p>
    <p>c) Number of cells (and %) corresponding to each fiber type</p>
    <p>d) Average CSA of all cells (µm2)</p>
    <p>e) Average CSA of each fiber type population (µm2)</p>
    <p>A) through D) are provided in an ImageJ log window (pop-up) that is shown when analysis is completed. Summary information, including average and standard deviation of CSA for individual fiber types is provided in .csv files for each fiber type, provided by Myosoft.</p>
    <p>4. It would also be important to define what is considered a sub-optimal quality staining and define the limits at which the tool can still provide an accurate analysis.</p>
    <p>Good quality is defined as little to no noise between the muscle fiber boundary and intra-fiber space (the ratio of intensity between the intra-fiber space and fiber boundary &gt; 5), while poor quality is defined as mid to high noise (intensity ratios &lt; or = 5) between the muscle fiber boundary and intra-fiber space (Fig. 5B). We also provided example images for good and poor quality images in supporting file 5.</p>
    <p>5. The authors compared Myosoft with several available tools that perform similar tasks as the developed method. However, at least 2 recent publications (2019) describing automated tools using Image/J (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://doi.org/10.1186/s13395-018-0186-6">doi.org/10.1186/s13395-018-0186-6</ext-link> and doi: 10.1186/s13395-019-0200-7) have been overlooked. To have a better perspective of Myosoft capabilities as compared to more recent tools, I recommend these tools should at least be mentioned in the discussion part of the manuscript.</p>
    <p>We discussed recent publications in Discussion section. Briefly, Myosoft is still a superior alternative to other Image J codes due to its minimal manual input requirements and analysis of 4 kinds fiber types simultaneously.</p>
    <p>6. One of the main issues of current tools for automated detection of fiber populations in muscle sections is the detection of hybrid fibers. Biologically fibers can adapt and switch from one fiber population to another in response to different stimuli. While I understand how you propose to quantify I/IIa fibers, I am concern about the significance of finding I/IIb or IIa/IIb or I/IIa/IIb fibers. More than a biological phenomenon, the presence of these populations together is a reflection of staining issues that needs to be addressed. More importantly is to define the criteria to select one population vs the other (i.e. in the case of I/IIb are these cells really type I (slowest) or IIb (fastest)). Finally, hybrid fibers for IIa/IIx or IIx/IIb populations cannot be accounted for with the proposed staining protocol.</p>
    <p>We appreciate the reviewer’s concern for fiber type staining to determine mixed fibers. We realized original staining of type IIb included a portion of false positive due to high level of background signal in the blue (AlexFluor 350) channel. Since type IIb is a major population in gastrocnemius and tibialis anterior muscles, false positives from type IIb staining caused an unusual level of mixed fiber types. Therefore, we changed the fluorescence of the secondary antibody for type IIb to far red (AlexaFluor 647). With this fluorophore, type IIb fibers are more clearly delineated and mixed fiber types are detected less than 1% (Fig 6) of total fiber number. We agree that we cannot determine hybrid fiber for IIa/IIx and IIb/IIx using Myosoft, which is one of limitations of Myosoft (discussed in manuscript). </p>
    <p>Minor:</p>
    <p>1. It would be a good reference to include the time that the tool takes to analyze a single sample (whole section)</p>
    <p>We added time (25 minutes) to analyze whole gastrocnemius section (~8,000 fibers) in Abstract.</p>
    <p>2. Besides CSA, it is not described which information regarding fiber size (perimeter, diameters, etc) can be obtained with this program.</p>
    <p>We described in ‘Four components of Myosoft pipeline’ section in Background as follows: In addition to the CSA values reported in these spreadsheets, several other parameters are also reported: perimeter, circularity, minimum Feret distance, Feret angle, Feret aspect ratio, roundness, and solidity. The mean, standard deviation, minimum and maximum values for each of these measurements is also reported. Lastly, when Myosoft completes analysis, it will immediately report the fiber type proportions (for Type I, Type IIa, Type IIb, and Type IIx), total section size, and average CSA for the sample in a log window within Fiji. </p>
    <p>3. In the discussion part it is not clear whether Myosoft can clearly identify and quantified central nuclei or if this is a possibility that has not been properly tested. Please expand</p>
    <p>The ability to detect central nuclei is an extrapolation of the principle of gating based on intensity values. The standard deviation of the intensity of a given ROI can be used to isolate centrally nucleated muscle fibers. Although we have not implemented this method in Myosoft, we have conducted preliminary tests on images with centrally nucleated myofibers as proof of principle. We have a separate macro which exclusively detects central nuclei (mentioned briefly in discussion). We will upload this to the same repository as Myosoft on GitHub </p>
    <p>4. Line 97 - C57Bl /6 J or N?, also what is the number of mice used?</p>
    <p>We used C57BL/6J. We added this info in Methods.</p>
    <p>5. Line 274. Myovision</p>
    <p>Corrected.</p>
    <p>6. The overall quality of the images and tables in the figures, especially those in color need to be improved.</p>
    <p>The PDF version for review degraded the image quality due to file size limitations. The original figures are very high quality.</p>
