      <p>In bottom-up mass spectrometry (MS)-based
proteomics, peptide isotopic
and chromatographic traces (features) are frequently used for label-free
quantification in data-dependent acquisition MS but can also be used
for the improved identification of chimeric spectra or sample complexity
characterization. Feature detection is difficult because of the high
complexity of MS proteomics data from biological samples, which frequently
causes features to intermingle. In addition, existing feature detection
algorithms commonly suffer from compatibility issues, long computation
times, or poor performance on high-resolution data. Because of these
limitations, we developed a new tool, Dinosaur, with increased speed
and versatility. Dinosaur has the functionality to sample algorithm
computations through quality-control plots, which we call a plot trail.
From the evaluation of this plot trail, we introduce several algorithmic
improvements to further improve the robustness and performance of
Dinosaur, with the detection of features for 98% of MS/MS identifications
in a benchmark data set, and no other algorithm tested in this study
passed 96% feature detection. We finally used Dinosaur to reimplement
a published workflow for peptide identification in chimeric spectra,
increasing chimeric identification from 26% to 32% over the standard
workflow. Dinosaur is operating-system-independent and is freely available
as open source on <uri xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://github.com/fickludd/dinosaur">https://github.com/fickludd/dinosaur</uri>.</p>

    <title>Introduction</title>
    <p>Mass-spectrometry-based
proteomics, fueled by seemingly ever-increasing
instrument performance, has gained considerable traction as a high-throughput
method for biomarker discovery and systems biology applications. New
and flexible workflows have extended the range of mass spectrometry
(MS) applications in life science research from biomarker discovery
to complex interaction mapping,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref></sup> whole-proteome assay
libraries,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref></sup> mRNA and protein dynamics,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref></sup> or full structural characterization of a protein complex.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref></sup> In bottom-up MS proteomics, mass-spectrometry
analysis of peptides, derived from intact proteins using proteolytic
processing, allows the measurement of thousands of isotope envelopes
of individual peptide ions. These isotope envelopes appear as ion
intensity patterns in the retention time and <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> dimensions and are often referred to as features. Accurate
feature detection is an important step in many mass-spectrometry-based
proteomics workflows<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>−<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref></sup> to quantify identified peptides in shotgun mass spectrometry
by using the integrated or apex feature intensity. This holds in particular
for label-free<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref></sup> and SILAC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref></sup> workflows. Accurately determined features are also used
to increase the accuracy of estimated precursor masses, to determine
chromatography performance and optimize chromatographic gradients,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref></sup> and to determine the total number of detectable
peptides by analyzing feature charge states, masses, and retention
times. Features can also be used to perform untargeted analysis of
data-independent acquisition (DIA) experiments.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref></sup> Lastly, recent work has shown that feature information
can increase the identification rates of chimeric MS/MS spectra, providing
a cheap possibility to increase the number of identified spectra and
the quality of the data analysis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref></sup></p>
    <p>Feature detection in proteomics and metabolomics mass spectrometry
has historically received considerable attention. Although Listgarten
and Emili thoroughly summarize early work on the subject,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref></sup> label-free quantification of shotgun proteomics
experiments has resulted in several additional published feature-detection
tools like, for example, msInspect,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref></sup> SuperHirn,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref></sup> OpenMS,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref></sup> centWave,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref></sup> Hardklör,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref></sup> and MZmine.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref></sup> In 2008, MaxQuant introduced
a graph model to improve feature detection in dense proteomics data
derived from complex biological samples.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref></sup> Later work has been driven by changing data quality; modern Fourier
transform high-resolution instruments have reduced the need for spectral
noise reduction and are not suited for <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> range binning, which were both prominent parts of the
early algorithms.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref></sup> Kalman filters have
also been employed for feature detection.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref></sup> The large number of available feature detection algorithms calls
for strategies to evaluate the outcome of feature detection. A straightforward
method for such evaluation is to ensure that the feature list returned
by the feature detection algorithm contains the peaks that were confidently
identified by data-dependent MS/MS spectra.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref></sup></p>
    <p>A feature-detection tool should ideally have several properties.
First, the tool should detect and distinguish all features for the
detectable peptide ions in an LC–MS experiment. Second, it
should provide accurate measurements of feature retention times and
monoisotopic masses in addition to providing accurate quantitative
values. Third, it should preferably compute as fast as possible, be
robust against irregularities in input data, and be flexible in terms
of input data formats, output, and computational environment. Finally,
the tool should provide parameters for optimization and means for
the users to evaluate the effects of any modified parameter. Although
MS1 feature detection is a well-studied problem,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>−<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref></sup> we believe further progress can be made toward these
ideal properties. Problems with existing algorithms are, for example,
operating system limitations, lack of support for standard file formats,
slow algorithm execution, limited control output, and closed or outdated
source code. We also experience difficulties in understanding how
modification of algorithm parameters influences performance, which
prevents adoption of a given tool to new instruments or acquisition
conditions.</p>
    <p>In the work presented here, we describe a new MS1
feature-detection
tool called Dinosaur, based on concepts adapted from the feature detection
algorithm in the MaxQuant<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref></sup> software, which
is widely used for analysis of shotgun mass-spectrometry data. Importantly,
with Dinosaur, we introduce a new strategy of creating a set of quality-control
plots, referred to as a plot trail, to support the monitoring of computation
performance. On the basis of an extensive evaluation of the plot trail,
we introduce several modifications to the original feature-detection
algorithm to improve performance and robustness. The Dinosaur implementation
is heavily optimized and parallelized and handles data files from
modern mass spectrometers in minutes on any major operating system.</p>
    <p>We evaluated the Dinosaur performance by benchmarking against four
previously published feature-detection algorithms on a 5 orders of
magnitude dilution series of synthetic peptides in a complex biological
background.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref></sup> Dinosaur achieved an equally
high level of linearity compared to the other tools while matching
features to a larger percentage of identified peptides. We also demonstrate
the utility of Dinosaur by implementing it in a chimeric spectrum
identification workflow<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref></sup> to increase the
number of detected unique peptides by 32% at a 1% false discovery
rate (FDR).</p>

      <title>Data Acquisition</title>
      <p>The synthetic peptide
dilution series
(PXD001091) and HeLa data sets (PXD000999) were downloaded from ProteomeXchange.
The eight sample-type representative samples were prepared in-lab
using standard protocols and have been deposited to the ProteomeXchange
Consortium<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref></sup> via the PRIDE partner repository
with the data set identifier PXD003405. Acquisition was performed
on a Q Exactive Plus mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific) in top-15
mode, coupled to an EASY-nLC 1000 ultrahigh-pressure liquid chromatography
system (Thermo Scientific). Linear gradients of between 5% and 35%
acetonitrile in aqueous 0.1% formic acid were run for 30, 60, 90,
or 120 min at a flow rate of 300 nL/min. The “purified protein”
sample is a His-tagged <italic>Streptococcus pyogenes</italic> M-protein expressed in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>; “synthetic peptides” refers to 20 synthetic peptides
of 80% purity (Proteogenix); “AP-MS” is an affinity
purification experiment using His-tagged <italic>S. pyogenes</italic> M-protein as a bait in mouse plasma; “plasma” and
“depl. plasma” are nondepleted and, respectively, depleted
mouse plasma; “bacteria” refers to blood agar grown <italic>S. pyogenes</italic>; “yeast” is MS-compatible
yeast protein extract digest (Promega, V7461); and “tissue
lysate” is a complete mouse liver tissue lysate. Mouse-derived
data are from Malmström et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref></sup> All raw data files were converted to gzipped and MS-Numpressed mzML<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref></sup> using the command-line version of the Proteowizard
(3.0.5930) tool msconvert.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref></sup></p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec2.2">
      <title>MS Data Analysis</title>
      <p>When we analyzed the synthetic peptide
dilution series, MaxQuant 1.3.0.5 and msInspect (build 599) settings
were as previously published.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref></sup> MaxQuant
1.5 has become available since we setup our analysis pipeline, but
feature results from v1.3 and v1.5 are very similar, and thus, we
have kept our results from v1.3. MaxQuant 1.1.0.25 was used to represent
the original feature detection algorithm using default settings. Identification
of MS/MS spectra was performed and combined within the Proteios Software
Environment,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref></sup> using X!Tandem TORNADO 2008.12.01.1
(<uri xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="http://www.thegpm.org/tandem">www.thegpm.org/tandem</uri>) and Mascot 2.3.01 (<uri xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="http://www.matrixscience.com">www.matrixscience.com</uri>) with 7 ppm precursor tolerance and 0.5 Da fragment tolerance, using
fixed carbamidomethylation of cysteins and variable oxidation of methionines
as described previously. Features were matched to MS/MS identifications
passing a 1% peptide-spectrum-match level FDR using a 0.005 Da and
0.2 min threshold. When we mapped multiple identifications to a feature,
no control was made for identification consistency, an effect with
an estimated magnitude of &lt;0.5%. Advanced feature-identification
matching is available as a Proteios plugin, but for our purposes,
we reimplemented a simplified version of this functionality to be
able to count the mock matches. This code is available at <uri xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://github.com/fickludd/dinosaur">https://github.com/fickludd/dinosaur</uri>. Dinosaur 1.1.0 was run using default parameter settings on all
files. OpenMS (1.11.1, May 2014) settings for the DeMix workflow were
as originally described; in short, a default PeakPickerHiRes configuration
was used for centroiding, followed by a FeatureFinderCentroided configuration
that allowed precursor charges of 2–7. The used TOPPAS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">32</xref></sup> workflow is accessible along with the Dinosaur
source code. For the DeMix pipeline, searches were performed with
MS-GF+,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">33</xref></sup> with trypsin set as the enzyme,
an instrument setting of 3, an initial precursor tolerance of 10 ppm,
a minimum peptide length of 7, and fixed carbamidomethylation of cysteins
and variable oxidation of methionines as modifications, as in the
DeMix publication.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref></sup></p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec2.3">
      <title>Runtime Measurement</title>
      <p>Program run times were measured
by the reported total time for Dinosaur (enabled using the −profiling
flag) and as the total feature finder execution time for OpenMS, excluding
centroiding. For the OpenMS–Dinosaur comparison, both programs
were run with concurrency of eight on a 12 core computation server
running Ubuntu Server 14.04 LTS. MaxQuant-ref was timed by starting
the analysis and measuring the time taken until MS2-related files
were first written. For MaxQuant, the total time for running steps
1–4 is reported as “MaxQuant full”, and the time
taken by the “feature detection” subprocess until the
appearance of MS2-related files is reported as “MaxQuant part”.
Dinosaur–MaxQuant comparisons were performed with concurrency
of one on a SSD-equipped desktop computer running Windows 7. All time
measurements refer to wall time.</p>

    <sec id="sec2.4">
      <title>Software Implementation</title>
      <p>Dinosaur is implemented in
Scala 2.10.0 and compiled for Java Virtual Machine (JVM) using reactive
programing techniques and Akka actors to enable parallelization. Scala
is a high-level language that gracefully blends object-oriented programming
with functional programming, and actors are a program construct that
send immutable messages to one another asynchronously and receives
and processes each message atomically. These choices of language and
parallelization library do not affect the appearance of the final
program, which appears as a regular Java program. Dependencies are
managed using Maven, and in-house libraries (<uri xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://github.com/fickludd/proteomicore">https://github.com/fickludd/proteomicore</uri>) were used for mzML parsing, supporting all mzML versions including
zlib, gzip and MS-Numpress<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34">34</xref></sup> compression,
centroid or profile, indexed or not. All Dinosaur source code and
a self-contained standalone executable can be downloaded or compiled
from <uri xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://github.com/fickludd/dinosaur">https://github.com/fickludd/dinosaur</uri> along with modified
scripts for running DeMix with Dinosaur under the Apache2 open-source
license. The label-free shotgun quantification workflow using Dinosaur

      <title>Implementation of Dinosaur and Algorithm
Improvements</title>
      <p>The implemented Dinosaur feature detection algorithm
consists schematically
of four computational steps, as shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref></xref>. In the first step, profile spectra are
centroided (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref></xref>a). Because the most common MS methods perform repeated MS measurements
during the elution of an analyte, the second step assembles centroid
peaks with similar <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> in consecutive
spectra into hills, meaning that one hill represents the full chromatographic
trace of one analyte ion isotope (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref></xref>b). In the third step, the hills are clustered
according to plausible <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> differences
based on carbon and sulfur natural isotopes and considered charge
states (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref></xref>c).
Because these clusters are not consistent in charge state or expected
isotopic prevalence, the fourth and last step is hill cluster isotopic
deconvolution into individual features with consistent charge (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref></xref>d).</p>

      <p>To improve the understanding and transparency of
the algorithm
and its parameters, Dinosaur randomly selects and visualizes parts
of the data at each computation step. We call this a plot trail (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref></xref>e–h). The
plot trail facilitates intelligent optimization of the 50 Dinosaur
parameters and supports the users to minimize the risk of major computational
mistakes or acquisition errors. The Dinosaur plot trail consists of
four types of plots; a line graph of a centroided peak (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref></xref>e), a heatmap and histogram
of a constructed hill (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref></xref>f), a line graph of a feature isotopic profile (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref></xref>g), and a heatmap of a whole
section of data with annotated features (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref></xref>h). Plot trail samples are selected uniformly
over the considered dimensions. The centroid peak plots consist of
the least, most, and median intense centroided peak from one spectrum.
The hill plots consist of the shortest, longest, and median length
hills with their apex at the same spectrum. Isotopic profile plots
are of one feature each, sampled uniformly from all features. Heatmaps
are 15 <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> times 150 spectra by
default. All sampling in the <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> and spectrum (rt) dimensions is done uniformly. Additionally, Dinosaur
supports a targeted plot trail, where a list of <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> and retention time coordinates creates corresponding
annotated heatmaps. The targeted plot trail is practical to evaluate
the algorithm performance for features of particular interest.</p>
      <p>The implementation of the plot trail supports the detailed analysis
of individual features in conjunction with MS/MS identifications.
Dinosaur was initially a reimplementation of the MaxQuant feature-finding
algorithm, as described in the original manuscript<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref></sup> (hereafter called MaxQuant-ref to distinguish it from later
MaxQuant versions with unpublished algorithms). However, using the
plot trail during implementation motivated several algorithm modifications
to improve performance and robustness. These improvements are documented
below and made the final algorithm to distinctly deviate from its
ancestor. The complete algorithm and implementation is described within
the source code.</p>
      <p>First, several changes were introduced in the
hill-building step
to reduce the occasional intermingling of traces from separate features,
which happens as multiple analytes frequently share almost identical
retention time and <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic>. The centWave<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref></sup> algorithm, used for hill construction in MaxQuant-ref,
relies on a simple maximal offset in ppm between centroid peaks. We
reduce the feature intermingling by instead comparing new centroid
peaks to the sliding average of the last three peaks in a hill to
reduce the effect of single-spectrum <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> fluctuations. Further, this matching is performed in a greedy fashion
in centWave, meaning that the first found match is selected, but this
also leads to intermingling in crowded or noisy parts of the data
because of the relatively large 7 ppm maximal offset. In contrast,
Dinosaur temporarily stores all matching hills and centroid peaks
in a list until the next pair is outside the maximal offset. At this
point, the hills and centroid peaks are matched from the list in the
order of the minimal <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> difference
until no more matches are within the maximal offset. Finally, hill-profile
smoothing in Dinosaur uses only three-point sliding windows versus
a five-point window in MaxQuant-ref. After the removal of the artifacts
introduced by intermingling, the improvements of the hill construction
are expected to reduce the misassignment of features in the later
steps and, therefore, increase the algorithm’s sensitivity.</p>
      <p>A second improvement relates to the hill cluster deconvolution
of large clusters. This phenomenon is more frequent in highly complex
samples and at the end of a chromatographic run, when remnants on
the column are washed off by a sudden increase in organic solvent.
During deconvolution, all of the hills in a cluster are compared against
each other, giving a computation of at least quadratic complexity,
which becomes prohibitively slow for clusters with thousands of hills.
This was solved in MaxQuant-ref by arbitrarily splitting clusters
above 100 hills into two halves and recursively running the deconvolution
on each half instead. This solution may split the hills of a feature
into separate subclusters, resulting in failure to detect such a feature.
Dinosaur instead sorts the hills by summed intensity and only seeds
isotope patterns from the 100 most intense hills, after which the
longest pattern is selected and the process repeated on the remaining
hills until no further patterns are found. This heuristic limits computation
complexity while avoiding arbitrary splitting of clusters and thus
potentially increases algorithm sensitivity.</p>
      <p>Third, the trimming
of isotope patterns is not well-documented
in the original MaxQuant-ref algorithm. From the original source code,
it can be seen that the algorithm relies on a few heuristic rules
based on the seed mass. Instead, Dinosaur compares the suggested isotope
pattern intensity profile to the shifted versions of an averagine
peptide<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref35">35</xref></sup> of the same mass. The shifted
averagine pattern is scored by the cosine correlation to the feature
isotope profile, multiplied by the explanation percentage of the matched
averagine peaks. The highest-scoring shift is selected to determine the monoisotopic
mass of the isotope pattern and to discard features that are not similar
enough (by default, cosine corr of ≥0.6) to the averagine isotopic
pattern. This change is expected to increase the correct assignment
of the feature monoisotopic mass, which is crucial for matching features
to MS/MS identifications and for label-free alignment in any high-resolution
MS workflow.</p>
      <p>Apart from direct algorithm improvements, Dinosaur
aims to be a
flexible tool. It runs on all major operating systems and accepts
all configurations of the MS data standard format mzML,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref></sup> including gzipped and MS-Numpressed files.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34">34</xref></sup> Parameters are controlled directly via the command
line or through a configuration file. Dinosaur is parallelized with
a configurable degree of concurrency. In addition, Dinosaur is provided
in a self-contained executable jar file without any other requirement
than the Java Runtime Environment 1.6 or higher. The complete Scala
source code for compiling Dinosaur is freely available from <uri xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="http://github.com/fickludd/dinosaur">http://github.com/fickludd/dinosaur</uri>. These properties are summarized for Dinosaur and other common feature
detection tools in <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="other">Table <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="other">1</xref></xref>. Finally, the plot trail allows users to correctly configure
Dinosaur and transparently evaluate its performance on their samples

      <title>Dinosaur Comparative Performance and Usability</title>
      <p>Dinosaur
was evaluated on three data sets to test different aspects of the
tool. First, we compare the raw algorithm performance to four other
feature-detection tools on a dilution series of synthetic peptides.
Second, we investigate the computation speed and usability of feature
data on eight samples that were representative of different mass-spectrometry-based
experiments. Third, we demonstrate an application of Dinosaur in a
workflow using three HeLa cell lysate injections in a chimeric spectrum
identification workflow.</p>
      <p>We evaluated the performance of Dinosaur
by comparing Dinosaur results to those obtained with msInspect,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref></sup> MaxQuant 1.1 (representing MaxQuant-ref), MaxQuant
1.3, and the OpenMS FeatureFinderCentroided<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref></sup> using a dilution series of synthetic peptides in a bacterial background.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref></sup> The dilution series consisted of 273 crude synthetic
peptides, log–linearly cross-diluted at 12 dilution levels
ranging from 20 pmol/μL to 200 amol/μL. Each dilution
point was analyzed in four or seven replicates for a total of 57 separate
injections. Data was collected using a standard data-dependent acquisition
method on an Orbitrap XL mass spectrometer.</p>
      <p>In our hands, Dinosaur
compares favorably to the other tested algorithms
(<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>). We used
the same set of 350 551 synthetic and bacterial peptide spectrum
matches at 1% FDR to evaluate the performance of the different feature
detection tools. The percentage of feature-matched MS/MS identifications
was higher for Dinosaur (97.8 ± 0.5%) than MaxQuant (94.5 ±
0.9%), Open MS (95.7% ± 0.7%), MaxQuant-ref (89.0% ± 1.4%),
and msInspect (81.3 ± 0.9%) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>a). These numbers of matched MS/MS identifications
were compensated for spurious pairings by control-matching with shuffled
MS2 events (see the <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.jproteome.6b00016/suppl_file/pr6b00016_si_001.pdf">Supplementary Material</ext-link> section) and therefore represents a quality measure of the detected
features because identified peptides were filtered at 1% FDR and should
in almost all cases have corresponding MS1 features. The tests with
matching of shuffled MS2 events also indicated that the high number
of MS/MS matches seen for Dinosaur was not an effect of matches due
to high numbers of randomly detected features, as the algorithms matched
2–7% of mock MS/MS events (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.jproteome.6b00016/suppl_file/pr6b00016_si_001.pdf">Figure S-2</ext-link>).</p>

      </fig>
      <p>In terms of quantitative linearity versus theoretical concentrations
of the synthetic peptides, results seem limited by instrumentation
rather than algorithm, as all tested algorithms have similar median
coefficients of correlation (<italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup>) around
0.95 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>b). In
total, all algorithms detected features for a median 17% of the synthetic
peptides across all of the analyzed LC–MS injections. The low
coverage is expected because of the sensitivity limitations of shotgun
MS/MS identifications and the very diluted synthetic peptides in the
sample and because no identity propagation between samples was performed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref></sup> We conclude that Dinosaur achieves higher sensitivity
of matched MS/MS identifications without sacrificing quantitative
accuracy compared to the other algorithms.</p>
      <p>To deeper characterize
the observed increased coverage of MS/MS
identifications, we normalized the reported features from all tools
by the median intensity of each tool on identifications that were
matched by all, and we compared feature intensity distributions (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref></xref>). In absolute numbers,
the feature-intensity distributions of the five tools are highly similar,
presumably reflecting the overall composition of detectable peptide
ions in the sample (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref></xref>a). If we, however, account for this by analyzing the relative
number of features in each intensity bin, differences in the tools
become apparent (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref></xref>b). The MaxQuant tools have a relatively strong performance on the
lower end of feature intensities, and the OpenMS feature detector
performs very well in the high-intensity end. Dinosaur, however, achieves
top numbers of matched features across the normalized intensity scale,
explaining the observed high degree of matched MS/MS identifications.
We thus conclude that Dinosaur is capable of full-dynamic-range feature
detection and appears to match the differential strength of two previous
top-performing tools.</p>

      </fig>
      <p>Apart from hard performance metrics, a mature software tool
should
be applicable in a variety of contexts and be reasonably fast. We
challenged Dinosaur by analyzing MS data from eight different samples
ranging from a purified protein to full tissue lysates of thousands
of proteins. The eight different samples represent typical samples
analyzed in proteomics studies with a representative range of complexities
(<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref></xref>a–d).
In total, Dinosaur detected 412 331 features of charge 2 or higher
in the eight files. These features were used to plot the empirical
distributions of feature intensities and retention times and to characterize
each sample’s complexity and chromatographic performance. The
number of features and their intensity was clearly dependent on the
expected sample complexity (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref></xref>a), with the highest number of features being detected
in a murine liver tissue lysate and the least in the injection of
a purified protein. When we analyzed feature retention times, the
different gradient length became evident. The highest rate of detected
features per minute was found in a 60 min gradient of a yeast sample
(<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref></xref>b), where
Dinosaur detected roughly 1000 features per min. These results are
in accordance with a previously reported rate of 1500 features per
min.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref36">36</xref></sup> Finally, we profiled the speed of
Dinosaur by measuring the computation time of feature detection in
the eight representative files. Dinosaur’s speed was compared
to MaxQuant-, MaxQuant-ref-, and the OpenMS-based feature-finding
workflow. In our results, no tool displayed a strong correlation between
computation time and sample complexity, but Dinosaur often achieved
the shortest runtime, reducing runtimes by 5–50% over the MaxQuant
versions and by 70% over OpenMS (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref></xref>c,d). In summary, the analysis of the eight
representative samples show the robustness, speed, and usability of
Dinosaur and how descriptive information regarding sample complexity
and chromatography can be obtained from Dinosaur-derived features.</p>

      </fig>
      <p>An important parameter for a feature-detection tool is the
applicability
of the tool to different workflows. To illustrate the ability to integrate
Dinosaur in downstream workflows, we first incorporated it into the
label-free quantification workflow<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref100">100</xref></sup> in
the Proteios software environment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref></sup> as
one of the selectable feature detectors. We further used Dinosaur
to implement the recently presented DeMix workflow for searching chimeric
spectra.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref></sup> We exchanged the original feature
finder to Dinosaur with some minor modifications in the original workflow
script. For an unbiased comparison with the original workflow, we
used the three HeLa lysate injections from the DeMix publication.
The DeMix workflow with Dinosaur increased the number of unique identified
peptides (1% peptide-spectrum match FDR) by 32%, compared to a standard
search on the total 151 260 MS/MS spectra in the three replicate
injections, and the OpenMS feature finder of the original publication
produced a 26% increase on the same files (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref></xref>e). The increase in DeMix effectiveness should
be directly related to the increased MS/MS matching of Dinosaur over
Open MS, as seen in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>a, and is likely a general property that is transferrable
to other samples. With the successful incorporation into a label-free
quantification workflow and a chimeric spectrum workflow, we conclude
that Dinosaur is well-adapted for general-purpose usage.</p>

    <title>Discussion</title>
    <p>In this work, we have devised an improved MS1 feature detection
tool called Dinosaur. This tool includes a plot trail, a new strategy
for performance monitoring, which was used to improve the algorithm
in most major computational steps. From these improvements, we demonstrate
an increased percentage of feature-matched 1% FDR MS/MS identifications
and equal levels of quantitative accuracy compared to other feature-detection
tools. We further demonstrate runtime decreases of 5–70% over
alternative tools and the applicability of Dinosaur, both by itself
on eight representative sample injections and as a part of a label-free
quantification workflow and a chimeric-spectrum-identification workflow.
Collectively, the results imply that Dinosaur is robust and mature.</p>
    <p>Given the high data-generation rate in MS-based proteomics, a natural
focus is the post-acquisition data analysis. The past years have resulted
in numerous developed and published feature detection algorithms in
which some are heavily used and others are not. Although most algorithms
are useful for specific purposes, underdeveloped and under-tested
software, possibly related to difficulties in publishing refined software,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref37">37</xref></sup> tends to limit common usage. It cannot be ruled
out that many of the best available algorithms remain unused due to
implementation problems like noncompatible input or output formats,
no support for the used operating system, or simply undocumented and
unexplainable crashes on apparently valid input. In this paper, we
have attempted to address the need for an accurate and powerful MS1
feature detection program by consolidating and further developing
a successful existing algorithm.</p>
    <p>Although the ideal feature
detection tool might not be achievable,
we believe Dinosaur closes the gap a little, given the observed increase
in computation speed and percentage of feature-matched MS/MS identifications.
It should be noted that acquiring 100% MS/MS identification coverage
is a game of diminishing returns, as small improvements in absolute
numbers result in increasingly complex algorithms with associated
increasing computation time. For the achievement of high coverage
in complex proteomes, a DIA-based workflow is possibly a better alternative<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref38">38</xref>−<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref40">40</xref></sup> because these workflows avoid the stochastic sampling of shotgun
MS and rely on quantification at the MS/MS level.</p>
    <p>The algorithm
improvements that differentiate Dinosaur from MaxQuant-ref
increased the percentage of feature-matched MS/MS identifications
in the synthetic peptide dilution data set from 89% to 98%, due to
decreased feature intermingling, avoided feature-splitting during
cluster deconvolution, and improved averagine matching and monoisotopic
assignment. We used the Dinosaur targeted plot trail to manually assess
158 coordinates mapping to the ∼2% of nonmatched identifications
in a representative file. For most nonmatched identifications, the
corresponding features are manually detectable in the MS data. Missed
features are often caused by mistakes in cluster deconvolution, but
often, features are entangled with other features in such a way that
it would not be possible to separate them without considering combinations
of isotope patterns, which is not readily possible in the current
algorithm. This could potentially be solved by using the Harklör<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref></sup> decharging algorithm or a two-dimensional template-based
feature detector,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>−<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref></sup> although using such a technique on high-resolution
data might be computationally prohibitive and would warrant further
investigation. We were also unable to devise a way to correctly evaluate
the precision of the reported features as the absence of an associated
identification does not necessarily indicate that the feature is incorrect
because of the limited sequencing speed of the instrument. After the
completion of the Dinosaur project, we have become aware of a small
manually annotated feature data set that could be used for this purpose
in future studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref></sup></p>
    <p>Apart from the
missing 2% of the identifications, it should be
noted that Dinosaur has been developed and optimized for Orbitrap
data. An initial test of application on high-resolution Q-TOF data
was, for example, not satisfactory according to the plot trail, and
no data from other mass analyzers such as low-resolution ion traps
has been analyzed. Here is a clear avenue for further study and algorithm
tuning. Finally, one might consider reproducing the final parts of
the MaxQuant algorithm for SILAC data analysis to enable operating-system-neutral
and open-source analysis of SILAC data using Dinosaur.</p>
    <p>Dinosaur
exposes more than 50 different configuration parameters
(<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.jproteome.6b00016/suppl_file/pr6b00016_si_001.pdf">Table S-1</ext-link>), which are configurable directly
on the command line or in a parameter file. To guide the user in tuning
and evaluating these parameters, we have implemented a plot trail
to stochastically sample the results of the major computation steps
and to create plots describing computation effect on real data. The
plot trail was used in this paper to improve the Dinosaur algorithm,
but the main purposes are computational quality control and tuning
Dinosaur parameters for application on data from other MS instruments.
Plot trail plots are stored in a quality control folder or zip folder
and can quickly be opened to check analysis performance and evaluate
the effects of particular parameter settings (see the <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.jproteome.6b00016/suppl_file/pr6b00016_si_001.pdf">Supplemental Discussion</ext-link> section). The plot trail
is distinctly different from the visualizations offered by programs
like TOPPView (OpenMS), MaxQuant, and Skyline. In these programs,
plots need to be manually generated by loading the corresponding MS
data and result files and the plot space manually selected, leaving
room for human bias. Also, all metadata present in the Dinosaur plot
trail plots is not available in the final feature results. In summary,
we believe the plot trail is a novel concept that is useful for explaining
the software function to users and to enable the earlier detection
of errors in data or feature-detection computation with minimal user
effort.</p>
    <p>Multiple groups have recently reported alternative techniques
for
identifying<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref41">41</xref></sup> and analyzing chimeric MS/MS
spectra using either MS1 features,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref42">42</xref></sup> MS/MS-based
precursor mass guessing,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref43">43</xref></sup> or iterative
searching with fragment attenuation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref44">44</xref></sup> These
recent studies consistently report up to 30% gains in the number of
unique peptides identified and examples of coisolation of four or
more peptides. In this way, peptide information in the available measured
data that was previously ignored becomes accessible. Our results using
Dinosaur concur with previous reports, contributing to a growing body
of evidence that suggests that chimeric spectral searching should
be a part of standard workflows.</p>
    <p>The intention of Dinosaur is
to provide a flexible, fast, and robust
feature finding algorithm. Even though the devised improvements give
some small increase in feature sensitivity, we emphasize that the
main benefit of Dinosaur lies in its usability and fast incorporation
in various workflows (for example, as demonstrated in the implemented
label-free quantification and chimeric-spectral-search workflows).</p>
