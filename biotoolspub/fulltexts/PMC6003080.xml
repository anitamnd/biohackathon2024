        <title>Background</title>
        <p id="Par1">What is a healthy microbiome? The pursuit of this and many related questions, especially in light of the recently recognized microbial component in a wide range of diseases has sparked a surge in metagenomic studies. They are often not simply attributable to a single pathogen but rather are the result of complex ecological processes. Relatedly, the increasing DNA sequencing depth and number of samples in metagenomic case-control studies enabled the applicability of powerful statistical methods, e.g. Machine Learning approaches. For the latter, the feature space is typically shaped by the relative abundances of operational taxonomic units, as determined by cost-effective phylogenetic marker gene profiles. While a substantial body of microbiome/microbiota research involves unsupervised and supervised Machine Learning, very little attention has been put on feature selection and engineering.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>Results</title>
        <p id="Par2">We here propose the first algorithm to exploit phylogenetic hierarchy (i.e. an all-encompassing taxonomy) in feature engineering for microbiota classification. The rationale is to exploit the often mono- or oligophyletic distribution of relevant (but hidden) traits by virtue of taxonomic abstraction. The algorithm is embedded in a comprehensive microbiota classification pipeline, which we applied to a diverse range of datasets, distinguishing healthy from diseased microbiota samples.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>Conclusion</title>
        <p id="Par3">We demonstrate substantial improvements over the state-of-the-art microbiota classification tools in terms of classification accuracy, regardless of the actual Machine Learning technique while using drastically reduced feature spaces. Moreover, generalized features bear great explanatory value: they provide a concise description of conditions and thus help to provide pathophysiological insights. Indeed, the automatically and reproducibly derived features are consistent with previously published domain expert analyses.</p>

  <sec id="Sec1">
    <title>Background</title>
    <p id="Par4">Traditional microbiology, strongly influenced by Robert Koch’s postulates, focuses on studies of bacteria (often pathogens) in isolation, an endeavor successful only for less than 1% of bacterial strains. While isolates and whole genome sequenc- ing projects continue to be valuable, metagenomic culture-independent approaches have provided a complementary view and have led to a more differentiated perception of bacteria as being unexpectedly diverse and predominantly commensal and beneficial. They allow comprehensive views of community composition and dynamics. Consequently, we can attempt to identify a healthy equilibrium of the micro- biota and how diversions from that equilibrium can be characterized. E.g., which combination and which abundance patterns of microorganisms ensure the correct functioning of digestion, are resilient to pathogens, train our immune system etc.? Likewise, environmental health is to a large extend attributable to the associated microbiota. They keep ecosystems intact by performing chemical processes such as material transformation. Also, the role microbiota play in biogeochemical cycles of life sustaining chemical elements such as carbon, oxygen, nitrogen can not be understated. Last not least, microbial community function are of commercial interest. when optimizing agricultural productivity and bioreactor stability in bioenergy applications and biochemical engineering. In all these scenarios it is desirable to understand the taxonomic composition and function of those microbiota and the dynamics that influence their function. Recent advances in Next Generation DNA Sequencing have turned microbiome research into a very data-intensive field [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] thanks to steeply dropping costs of DNA sequencing and advances in multiplexing of many samples in metagenomic marker gene sequencing. In particular, compositional exploration is commonly carried out through tag sequencing, e.g. using hypervariable regions of the 16S rRNA gene.</p>
    <p id="Par5">It is remarkable that microbiota of the lower gut have been shown to be indicative for colorectal cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The abundance patterns of microbes as measured by tag-sequencing of taxonomic marker genes (16S rRNA profiles) facilitate the categorization of microbiota with respect to their function. Sophisticated classifiers are not required for those cases easily distinguishable through high prevalence of a pathogen (e.g. Clostridium difficile) or dysbiosis (drastic loss of alpha-diversity). Those cases can be addressed using simple statistical measures or unsupervised learning, for example. However, a large range of medical conditions that stretch far beyond infectious diseases are related to subtle compositional changes in microbial communities. A current ongoing debate is to what extend it is possible to robustly cluster microbiota into community types or enterotypes (with respect to the human gut [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]). The hope tied to the identification of those community−/enterotypes is that crisp, distinct clusters can be associated with a special functionality and thus lead to a better understanding of a microbiome related condition and in turn, more targeted therapeutics. Large scale studies like the Human Microbiome Project have shown that human microbiota cluster well by body site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. A similar observation was reported based on a meta-analysis for environmental microbiota clustering according to their ecosystem [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Those clusters are observable through dimensionality reduction methods (e.g. ordination methods such as Principal Coordinate Analysis) and unsupervised learning (e.g. hierarchical clustering).</p>
    <p id="Par6">However, microbiota associated to medical conditions like Colorectal Cancer (CRC), Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD), Crohn’s disease and (pre-)diabetes are not simply falling into clusters and classification of healthy and diseased microbiota samples is beyond unsupervised learning. On the other hand, Supervised learning, in particular Random Forests, Support Vector Machines and Boosting, have been applied successfully to a large set of microbiota classification problems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], but little attention has been devoted to feature selection and feature engineering. The common approach to design the feature space for Supervised Learning is the grouping of 16S rRNA sequence reads by Operational Taxonomic Unit (OTU) in order to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset from millions of sequences to thousands of OTUs. The relative OTU abundances then form the feature vectors representing the microbiota. Gut microbiota as well as other microbial communities in soil, marine environments etc. are rather complex in terms of alpha-diversity as we frequently observe thousands of OTUs in a single sample. This generally poses a very feature rich learning task. Further microbiota feature reduction could simply be achieved by lowering OTU resolution below the common 97% sequence identity (yielding fewer but more diverse taxonomic bins) or low abundance filtering by disregarding OTUs which are either appearing only in few samples or which are on average below a certain threshold. However, these crude measures are likely to cause loss of important information and are henceforth not considered viable for microbiota representations.</p>
    <p id="Par7">Despite the above mentioned increase of samples for a particular classification task, the high ratio of feature space dimensionality over dataset size still incurs the curse of dimensionality and with it the risk of overfitting. Classification with fewer but better features is therefore desirable, a concept commonly referred to as Feature Space Compression. Owing to the nature of NP-completeness, feature subset selection requires heuristic solutions for large feature spaces. Feature selection can be done by filter methods, wrapper methods or embedded methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Recent work on microbiota/metagenome classification, such as Fizzy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] and MetAML [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], utilize standard feature selection algorithms, not capitalizing on the evolutionary relationship and thus the hierarchical structure of features. Fizzy implements a number of standard Information-theoretic subset selection methods (e.g. JMI, MIM and mRMR from FEAST C library), NPFS and Lasso. MetAML performs microbiota or full metagenomic classification, which incorporates embedded feature selection methods, including Lasso and ENet, with Random Forests (RF) and Support Vector Machines (SVM) classifiers.</p>
    <p id="Par8">In this study, we aim to distill informative features from datasets independently of the Machine Learning approach. In contrast to filter methods for feature selection, wrapper and embedded methods are often computationally expensive due to the reiteration of the training process. The state-of-the-art feature selection methods, in many cases, cannot handle the potential search space for the best subset of features in microbiota datasets. For example, the Correlation-based Feature Selection (CFS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], central part of the popular WEKA toolkit, does not scale well to the feature space dimension typically found in microbiota classification tasks with several thousand OTUs.</p>
    <p id="Par9">Kostic et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] have described their findings with regard to microbiota in colorectal cancer in terms of genera and phyla, which showed that not only are bacterial taxa powerful predictors for important conditions, but they also lend themselves naturally to generalization due to their taxonomy. Remarkably, those high-level features pose a compact and human understandable biomarker formulation of a condition. Like in these examples, experts often discriminate between microbiata classes in terms of few taxa of various phylogenetic ranks based on manual inspection of few samples. However, it is often unclear whether the chosen terms are of the right level of generality, i.e. of the most suitable rank.</p>
    <p id="Par10">The goal of this work is to formalize this process by systematically creating and reproducibly searching a suitable hypothesis space. In this context it is important to note that features in microbiota classification and in Machine Learning tasks in general are often not independent. To exploit this, we can borrow from advances in the Knowledge Management community, where general-to-specific ordered concept taxonomies are used to describe nouns, common features of text documents. Ristoski and Paulheim have recently presented an algorithm that performs feature selection given an underlying hierarchy for the features. The authors have shown that their algorithm outperforms other hierarchy based and non-hierarchy based feature selection methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p>
    <p id="Par11">However, the existing hierarchical feature selection algorithms, as in by Ristoski et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], only deal with binary features (i.e. presence-absence representations), which fail to adequately represent biological data in high resolution and cause a high loss of information compared to relative abundances. Moreover, partial 16S rRNA sequences are often assigned taxonomic ranks to genus or family level with sufficient certainty, which makes their hierarchical information often incomplete. In this paper, we introduce a hierarchical feature engineering (HFE) method, which goes beyond mere feature selection. HFE exploits the underlying hierarchical structure of the feature space in order to create an extended version of the feature space to start with, which will go through a number of processing steps resulting in a much smaller space of informative features for supervised machine learning.</p>
    <p id="Par12">In summary, while hierarchical feature engineering seems a promising approach to Feature Space Compression, adjustments for the type of data in microbiota classification tasks are required.</p>

    <p id="Par13">The introduced pipeline for Microbiota classification is composed of three main phases, including 1) Structural Feature Extraction, 2) Hierarchical Feature Engineering, and 3) Supervised Machine Learning, as illustrated in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Proposed pipeline for metagenome classification</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12859_2018_2205_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p>

      <title>Structural feature extraction</title>
      <p id="Par14">The structural features, which represent the bacterial composition of a microbial community, comprise the main feature space for microbiota samples. Those features are derived from the 16S rRNA sequences via closed-reference Operational Taxonomic Unit (OTU) picking procedure provided by QIIME [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], an open-source tool for microbiome analysis. In closed-reference OTU picking, only sequences with hits in the reference sequence database of GreenGenes are used to construct the OTU table, which consists of a list of OTUs and their abundances per sample. We chose closed-reference OTU picking because it allows to combine datasets with different variable regions. The taxonomy of the identified microbiome is automatically constructed from the predefined taxonomy of the OTU representatives in the reference sequence database. A taxonomy lineage of an OTU is composed of 7 taxonomic ranks: Kingdom, Phylum, Class, Order, Family, Genus and Species, respectively from the highest to the lowest level. We add an eighth level to the bottom of the hierarchy to represent the OTU level.</p>

      <title>Hierarchical feature engineering</title>
      <p id="Par15">The basic architecture of the HFE method is inspired by Ristoski et al.'s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] work on feature selection in hierarchical feature space. The input to HFE is composed of three items: 1) The -transposed- OTU table <italic>o</italic>, where rows represent the <italic>n</italic> samples from the training dataset allocated for building a ML model (i.e. the samples available within 9 partitions out of 10 in 10-fold cross validation, while the 10<sup>th</sup> partition is put aside for testing that ML model. The process is repeated 10 times, so that each partition is to serve as a testing dataset one time), and columns represent the <italic>m</italic> features, (i.e. the OTUs from the OTU table); 2) the associated <italic>n</italic>-dimensional label vector indicating the predefined class of each sample from the training dataset, e.g. cancer or normal; and 3) the taxonomy <italic>T</italic>. Our HFE method consists of four phases, as shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, including:<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>The HFE algorithm. Note that OTUs are possibly associated to higher taxonomic ranks (e.g. OTU 2) due to incomplete taxonomic <underline>c</underline>lassification. We refer to them as leaves in incomplete paths. The feature space first grows from R<sup><italic>m</italic></sup> to R<sup><italic>m</italic></sup><sup> + </sup><sup><italic>m'</italic></sup>, where <italic>m'</italic> is the number of internal nodes in <italic>T</italic> (phase 1). Subsequently the feature space is reduced by the number of sufficiently correlated child nodes (<italic>s</italic><sub>1</sub>, phase 2) and <underline>r</underline>elatively uninformative features (<italic>s</italic><sub>2</sub> and <italic>s</italic><sub>3</sub>, phase 3 and 4, resp.), yielding the final feature space R<sup><italic>m</italic></sup><sup> + </sup><sup><italic>m − s</italic></sup><sup>1</sup> <sup><italic>− s</italic></sup><sup>2</sup> <sup><italic>− s</italic></sup><sup>3</sup>.

It is worth mentioning that we aim to remove child nodes that are redundant to their parents, for which Pearson correlation serves as a proxy. Friedman et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] states that the compositional effect for detecting spurious correlations is less for complex communities (with thousands of OTUs), which is what our method is directed at. Moreover, we use correlation simply as a heuristic to select features, as opposed to microbial network reconstruction.</p>

As the <italic>IG</italic> measure is originally designed to handle discrete (categorical) features and ours are continuous features, a step of discretization is applied via WEKA on the features prior to <italic>IG</italic> computing. Note that WEKA’s information gain calculation for continuous features is based on supervised multi-interval discretization, as described in Fayyad et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. This way, our classification algorithm can handle not only continuous features, but also multiple classes.</p>

There is no constraint on the percentage of discarded features in this phase. Many tax- onomically underspecified OTUs would be retained without this additional filter, as they do not correlate with remote ancestors and often have higher information gain then the average of the few high level taxa in their lineage. The empirical results show that adding the features selected by the fourth phase to the output of the third phase has improved the overall performance of the produced classification model when used for CRC detection.</p>

    <p id="Par26">In this section, we evaluate the performance of the proposed methodology when applied on real biological datasets from different studies. Moreover, we conduct a comparison between our HFE method and other tools incorporating feature selection methods on biological datasets.</p>

      <title>Experimental settings</title>
      <p id="Par27">For each dataset, the initial feature set is the OTU table generated via the Structural Feature Extraction Phase of the introduced pipeline. It is noteworthy that we use the same version of GreenGenes with all datasets, i.e. May 2013 GreenGenes (GG version 13.5). The performance of the classification model trained on the initial feature set of a dataset is considered the baseline for comparison.</p>
      <p id="Par28">For each initial feature set, conventional unsupervised learning, represented here by Principle Coordinate Analysis (PCoA) technique, is utilized to cluster similar samples together in order to distinguish between the different groups of samples. Studies, where the unsupervised learning is sufficient for clear group separation, are exploited for validation. Otherwise,the studies are used to demonstrate and evaluate the capabilities of the introduced pipeline with more complicated classification tasks. The PCoA calculations and plots are produced by QIIME (version 1.8.0). Three different values, i.e. 0.6, 0.7 and 0.8, that constitute for a strong correlation have been examined as correlation threshold <italic>θ</italic>, a free parameter in HFE, when applied on initial datasets in order to generate reduced sets of informative features. The classification results show no significant difference in performance among the three values when utilized by the Correlation-based Filtering Phase in HFE. Therefore, the default value for <italic>θ</italic> is set to 0.7. The classification models are generated under WEKA environment, where the default settings of the selected ML algorithms are used, via 10-fold cross validation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] in order to avoid overfitting. The results are presented in terms of the area under the Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, i.e. AUC, precision (P), Recall (R) and F-measure (F). The significance of the differences in performance between the proposed method (HFE) and other strategies is illustrated through the p-value calculated via conducting a statistical t-test, in which a p-value less than 0.05 constitutes a significant improvement in the performance.</p>

        <title>Colorectal Cancer detection</title>
        <p id="Par33">Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common type of cancer around the world, and it is responsible for losing over half a million people every year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Developing effective screening methods can be crucial for early detection and increasing the survival rate. Nowadays, fecal occult blood test (FOBT) is commonly used as the screening technique for CRC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], but due to its limited accuracy, there is still a need for a more reliable noninvasive screening method.

Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S1 illustrates the pipeline’s cross validation results when applied to the two datasets in terms of AUC. DT, RF and NB are utilized as the selected ML algorithms in the supervised ML component. HFE compares well to the baseline but, importantly, uses substantially less features.</p>
      <p id="Par41">In the case of CRC detection, unsupervised learning cannot clearly distinguish between samples of different groups, as illustrated in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S3. Tables <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>, <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref> and <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref> show the pipeline’s classification results when applied on the CRC datasets (CRC1, CRC2, CRC1+2, respectively), in terms of AUC, precision, recall and f-measure, compared to the baseline results when no feature selection was used. The variability among the different folds of cross validation is captured via the standard deviation of AUC, precision, recall, f-measure and the size of the engineered feature sets, which shows standard deviation scores that range from 0.074 to 0.217 for the evaluation scores, and a range from 6.633 to 12.328 when it comes to the size of the feature subsets across folds in the CRC studies. In the largest CRC dataset, i.e. CRC1+2, in particular, the mean and standard deviation of the feature subset size across folds are 96 and 6.633 (variance <italic>≈</italic> 44), respectively, while the size of the feature subset intersection obtained across folds is 31 features. Comparing variability results among the CRC datasets shows that the larger the feature space the smaller the variance of the feature subset size and the larger the feature subset intersection obtained across folds. For building the classification models for both baseline and HFE feature sets, we consider DT, RF and NB algorithms for their ability to computationally handle a varied range of feature space under WEKA framework. The results in Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref> through Table <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref> show that using HFE improves the performance in general across the CRC datasets when compared to the baseline performance, especially using Random Forest as the ML algorithm. It is worth mentioning that we have conducted a comparison between the performance of the proposed method with and without the 4<sup>th</sup> phase, i.e. responsible for handling features with incomplete hierarchical information, in order to examine whether it adds value to the pipeline, and the results showed that the features selected by the 4<sup>th</sup> phase improves the quality of the performance in terms of AUC, by 3.7%, 12% and 6.7% when applied to CRC1, CRC2 and CRC1+2, respectively, using RF as the ML algorithm. Moreover, we conduct a comparison among Fizzy, MetAML and HFE, in terms of AUC and number of selected features, of which DT, NB and RF are used for building the classification models. Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> and Table <xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table">5</xref> illustrate the comparison between Fizzy and HFE when applied to the CRC datasets using several ML algorithms, which shows significant improvements in the performance using HFE over Fizzy’s feature selection algorithms (JMI, MIM, mRMR and NPFS-MIM), with p-value of 0.0007, 0.0035 and 0.0358 for Fizzy-(JMI/MIM/mRMR) vs. HFE when applied on CRC1, CRC2 and CRC1+2, respectively, and an overall p-value of 0.0494 for NPFS-MIM vs. HFE when applied to the CRC datasets. It should be noted that Fizzy requires the number of features to be predefined ahead to the actual feature selection process, except for NPFS. Therefore we assign sizes that are similar to the ones produced by HFE, i.e. 97, 28 and 92 for CRC1, CRC2 and CRC1+2, respectively, and then ones that are slightly above those of HFE, i.e. 110, 50 and 100, respectively as well, to allow for comparison. The number of features selected by NPFS-MIM for each CRC dataset is 654, 167 and 513, respectively. Moreover, Table <xref rid="Tab6" ref-type="table">6</xref> compares the performance of MetAML vs. HFE when applied to the CRC and IBD datasets provided by Pasolli et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], which are taxonomic profiles at species-level generated from shotgun sequencing data. The results show that HFE outperforms the best results achieved by MetAML in terms of AUC, with a p-value of 0.0492, when RF is used with/without embedded feature selection methods, i.e enet and lasso, while using far less features. Note that HFE also overcomes MetAML’s limitation to deal with complete taxonomic information. We thus expect the performance margin to increase further, when including OTUs with incomplete taxonomic lineages to the dataset. Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref> Figure S4 through Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S7 illustrate comparisons between the confusion matrices of the CRC datasets’ baseline models and HFE-based models with

For CRC1, both our and Zeller et al.'s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] results with regard to informative features include OTUs asso- ciated with <italic>Fusobacteriaceae</italic>, <italic>Peptostreptococcus</italic>, <italic>Clostridium</italic>, <italic>Bacteroides</italic>, <italic>Lactobacillus</italic>, <italic>Eubacterium</italic>, <italic>Bifidobacterium</italic>, <italic>Dorea</italic>, <italic>Lachnospiraceae</italic>, <italic>Ruminococcus</italic> and <italic>Streptococcus</italic>. For CRC2, both our and Zackular et al.'s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] results with regard to informative features include OTUs associated with <italic>Fusobacterium</italic>, <italic>Bacteroidales</italic>, <italic>Lachnospiraceae</italic>, <italic>Gammaproteobacteria</italic>, <italic>Bacteroides</italic>, and <italic>Clostridiales</italic>. It is worth noting that the informative feature set of the combined CRC dataset encloses a number of OTUs, which have not been reported specifically by Zeller et al. and Zackular et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], including <italic>Fusobacteriales</italic>, <italic>Oscillospira</italic> and some OTUs associated with <italic>Porphyromonas</italic>, <italic>Rikenellaceae</italic>, <italic>Prevotella</italic>, <italic>Akkermansia muciniphila</italic>, <italic>Lawsonia</italic>, and <italic>S24-7</italic> of Bacteroidales, which are highly presented in Cancer samples, and <italic>Yaniellaceae</italic>, Cellulomonadaceae, <italic>Coprococcus</italic>, <italic>Bifidobacteriaceae</italic>, <italic>Bifidobacterium breve</italic>, <italic>Bacilli</italic>, <italic>Lactobacillus ruminis</italic>, <italic>Lactobacillus delbrueckii</italic>, <italic>Rhizobiales</italic>, and some OTUs associated with <italic>Blautia</italic> and <italic>Blautia producta</italic>, which are highly presented in Normal samples. The observation of OTUs assigned to <italic>Akkermansia muciniphila</italic> to be overrepresented in Cancer samples is particularly intruiging as <italic>Akkermansia muciniphila</italic> has been associated with healthy metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><p>The taxonomic tree of the top 20 informative features extracted by the HFE method, in terms of IG, for Cancer vs. Normal classification for CRC1</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12859_2018_2205_Fig4_HTML" id="MO4"/></fig><fig id="Fig5"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption><p>The taxonomic tree of the top 20 informative features extracted by the HFE method, in terms of IG, for Cancer vs. Normal classification for CRC2</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12859_2018_2205_Fig5_HTML" id="MO5"/></fig><fig id="Fig6"><label>Fig. 6</label><caption><p>The taxonomic tree of the top 20 informative features extracted by the HFE method, in terms of IG, for Cancer vs. Normal classification for CRC1 + 2</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12859_2018_2205_Fig6_HTML" id="MO6"/></fig></p>

    <title>Discussion</title>
    <p id="Par43">It seems plausible that taxa on all ranks potentially make for good features in microbiota classification: each rank subsumes different spectra of organisms that share traits that are encoded by predominantly vertically inherited genes from a shared ancestor. The proposed Hierarchical Feature Engineering (HFE) method exploits the intrinsic hierarchical nature of a set of different microbial communities to determine which members of the bacterial taxonomy are informative so to distinguish between the samples representing different conditions. HFE tackles a number of challenges that accompany the use of microbial compositions as the feature space in classification tasks, including the type of features, which is continuous (relative abundance), the size of the feature space, which is usually thousands of features (OTUs), and the number of categories/classes in the classification task, which can be more than two. If taxonomy depth (seven ranks) is considered a constant, HFE has a time complexity of <italic>O</italic>(<italic>n</italic>(<italic>m</italic> + <italic>m'</italic>)) (see Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>), which makes it suitable for large feature spaces unlike other feature selection methods, such as CFS and wrapper methods, which are computationally expensive and therefore do not scale well. Even in methods based on all-against-all correlation analysis alone the complexity is <italic>O</italic>(<italic>nm</italic><sup>2</sup>) and thus increasingly infeasible with thousands of features and samples. As illustrated in the Results section, the microbial biomarkers identified by HFE for CRC detection are supported by the evidence previously presented in Zeller et al. and Zackular et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Moreover, our results of applying HFE on the CRC dataset provided by Kostic et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] are consistent with their findings of 16S rRNA sequencing analysis, especially with regard to <italic>Fusobacterium</italic> and its associated taxonomic units being enriched in CRC samples compared to normal ones. Our results, as highlighted in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S8, show that high abundance of <italic>Fusobacteriia</italic>, which is at class level, is a potential indicator of CRC. It is worth noting that in Zeller et al. and Zackular et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] the authors report biomarkers at specific taxonomic levels without considering alternatives. In contrast, our findings, as shown in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S8 through Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S11, include biomarkers at different taxonomic levels, ranging from phylum to species level in addition to OTUs.</p>
    <p id="Par44">A noteworthy caveat is that the outcome of HFE does not reflect the direction of causality in the respective tasks, but rather sheds light on a number of potential biomarkers that help to distinguish between two or more community types. Similar to mono- vs. polygenic traits in an organism, the identified biomarkers indicate that conditions, such as CRC, adenoma and normal, are often of polymicrobial nature rather than caused by a single microbe and it can vary from a population to another. Classification error rates rise substantially, when a third category—adenoma samples—is included. The confusion, adenoma samples introduce (as shown by the confusion matrices in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figures S7), indicates that adenoma are associated with a microbiota succession that makes it harder to discern the three categories. Note though that HFE again outperforms the baseline.</p>
    <p id="Par45">HFE is generally applicable to Machine Learning tasks with hierarchically structured feature spaces. Moreover, integrating additional metadata as features in our HFE algorithm is straightforward: after HFE terminates, the feature space can be normally extended with further unstructured features. For Microbiome classification, it seems promising to include functional features with hierarchical nature, e.g. metabolic pathways and enzymes. As for other domains of application, we intend to apply HFE to classification of gene expression datasets using suitable hierarchies of genes, such as Gene Ontology (GO), EC or CAZyme.</p>

    <title>Conclusions</title>
    <p id="Par46">In this study, we tackle the problem of microbiota classification by introducing a hierarchy-based feature engineering method that can handle feature spaces with high dimensionality as in microbiome datasets and exploits the underlying hierarchical structure to construct a much smaller set of informative features for supervised machine learning. The existing hierarchical feature selection algorithms only deal with binary features, which fail to adequately represent biological data and cause a high loss of information compared to relative abundances. Moreover, partial 16S rRNA sequences are often assigned taxonomic ranks to genus or family level with sufficient certainty, which makes their hierarchical information often incomplete. Our Hierarchical Feature Engineering (HFE) method goes beyond mere feature selection into feature engineering as it creates initially an extended version of the feature space, which will be processed through filtering steps to produce a much smaller set of informative features. HFE method can handle continuous features and incomplete hierarchical information. We demonstrate substantial improvements over the baselines (without applying feature selection) and the state-of-the-art microbiota classification tools in terms of classification accuracy, regardless of the actual Machine Learning technique while using drastically reduced feature spaces for Colorectal Cancer Detection. Furthermore, by looking at the variability results among the CRC datasets, we notice that the larger the feature space the smaller the variance of the feature subset size and the larger the feature subset intersection obtained across the different folds in cross validation. This indicates that with large enough training data the HFE’s choices have the potential to be generalized for that classification task. The findings show that HFE makes similar feature choices when applied to different CRC datasets, separately, supporting the attempt to constitute a generalized feature set for CRC detection. Moreover, generalized features bear great explanatory value: they provide a concise description of conditions and thus help to provide pathophysiological insights. Indeed, the automatically and reproducibly derived features are consistent with previously published domain expert analyses.</p>
