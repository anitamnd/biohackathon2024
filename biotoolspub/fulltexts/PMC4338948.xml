    <abstract>
      <p>Mobile elements constitute greater than 45% of the human genome as a result of repeated insertion
events during human genome evolution. Although most of mobile elements are fixed within the human
population, some elements (including ALU, long interspersed elements (LINE) 1 (L1), and SVA) are
still actively duplicating and may result in life-threatening human diseases such as cancer,
motivating the need for accurate mobile-element insertion (MEI) detection tools. We developed a
software package, TANGRAM, for MEI detection in next-generation sequencing data, currently serving
as the primary MEI detection tool in the 1000 Genomes Project. TANGRAM takes advantage of valuable
mapping information provided by our own MOSAIK mapper, and until recently required MOSAIK mappings
as its input. In this study, we report a new feature that enables TANGRAM to be used on alignments
generated by any mainstream short-read mapper, making it accessible for many genomic users. To
demonstrate its utility for cancer genome analysis, we have applied TANGRAM to the TCGA (The Cancer
Genome Atlas) mutation calling benchmark 4 dataset. TANGRAM is fast, accurate, easy to use, and open

    <title>Introduction</title>
    <p>Mobile elements, or transposable elements, can be categorized as either class I
(retrotransposons, RNA-mediated “copy and paste” mechanisms) or class II
(transposons, DNA-mediated “cut and paste” mechanisms), and they proliferate in the
human genome by integrating new copies through RNA intermediates in human evolutionary history.<xref rid="b1-cin-suppl.1-2015-037" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="b2-cin-suppl.1-2015-037" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> As a result, nearly half of the human genome is derived from
mobile elements.<xref rid="b3-cin-suppl.1-2015-037" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="b4-cin-suppl.1-2015-037" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Although most of mobile elements are inactive and fixed
within the human population, some younger elements (including ALU, long interspersed elements (LINE)
1 (L1), and SVA) are still actively duplicating and may result in human life-threatening diseases
eg, cancer.<xref rid="b5-cin-suppl.1-2015-037" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>–<xref rid="b8-cin-suppl.1-2015-037" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Characterizing mobile-element insertions
(MEIs) is therefore an important task when tracking down the causes of such diseases.</p>
    <p>In the past, detecting MEIs was labor-intensive and time consuming, and it was impossible to
detect MEI on a genome scale. Next-generation sequencing technologies have revolutionized variant
detection, including new approaches to MEI discovery, making it possible to cost effectively
sequence individuals or larger cohorts, and comprehensively detect MEIs in the resulting data.
Previously, we developed an early MEI detector program, SPANNER, and deployed it on the 1000 Genomes
Project<xref rid="b9-cin-suppl.1-2015-037" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="b10-cin-suppl.1-2015-037" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Pilot dataset compiling the most comprehensive catalog of
MEI events in the human genome to date.<xref rid="b11-cin-suppl.1-2015-037" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Although effective, SPANNER was computationally expensive and not easily portable,
precluding its use by scientists wishing to study MEIs in larger datasets.</p>
    <p>Recently, we developed the TANGRAM software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/jiantao/Tangram">https://github.com/jiantao/Tangram</ext-link>) to overcome some of these limitations. TANGRAM is
fast, accurate, and easy to use, and it is currently employed in the 1000 Genomes Project Phase-III
dataset, which consists of a collection of whole-genome sequencing data from over 2500 samples
across 26 populations. PCR validation experiments by the 1000 Genomes Project Structural Variation
Group (data not shown) indicates an FDR of 5.96%, a rate far better than which is much better than
was achieved with RetroSeq<xref rid="b12-cin-suppl.1-2015-037" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> (17.61%)
and VariationHunter,<xref rid="b13-cin-suppl.1-2015-037" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> (26.86%).
However, a major limitation of TANGRAM is that is was originally designed to work only with the
short-read mapper MOSAIK.<xref rid="b14-cin-suppl.1-2015-037" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Here, we
enabled TANGRAM to work with other popular short-read mappers. As somatic MEIs may play a role in
cancer genome evolutions, we demonstrate the utility of the TANGRAM program for cancer genomes,
using the TCGA<xref rid="b15-cin-suppl.1-2015-037" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Mutation Calling
Benchmark 4 dataset.</p>
  </sec>
  <sec sec-type="methods">
    <title>Method</title>
    <p>For the theoretical completeness, we review the main methodology of TANGRAM in the first
subsection. Then, we introduce a new feature and the filtering strategy in the second and third
subsections. The proposed feature enables TANGRAM to handle alignments mapped by other short-read
mappers rather than MOSAIK.</p>
    <sec>
      <title>TANGRAM algorithm overview</title>
      <p>TANGRAM detects MEIs on paired-end sequencing reads that consist of two mates from both ends of
DNA segments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-cin-suppl.1-2015-037">Fig. 1A</xref>). The distance,
insert length, between two mates of a read is determined. According to alignments of two mates of
reads, we categorize reads into three groups if they are sequenced from MEI regions. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-cin-suppl.1-2015-037">Figure 1B–D</xref> shows the characters of
these three groups. Notice that reads are sequenced from a given sample and mapped against the
reference genome.</p>
      <p>The first group is the collection of alignments of mates showing short insert length. As shown in
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-cin-suppl.1-2015-037">Figure 1B</xref>, an MEI is inserted between two
mates of a read, and because the MEI is not present in the reference genome, the distance between
the two mates is shorter when mapping the mates to the reference genome. Therefore, calculating the
distribution of distances between two mates helps the tool to roughly locate MEI regions. The second
group is that one mate is uniquely mapped to the reference genome while the other mate is mapped to
a mobile-element sequence obtained from RepBase<xref rid="b16-cin-suppl.1-2015-037" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> (the sequences are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-cin-suppl.1-2015-037">Table
1</xref>), as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-cin-suppl.1-2015-037">Figure 1C</xref>. This
information is provided by MOSAIK. MOSAIK checks each mate against the mobile-element sequences when
mapping it, and once the similarity is found between a mate and any mobile-element sequences, MOSAIK
marks this mate with additional tags in outputted files. TANGRAM then is able to acquire this
information by parsing MOSAIK output files. The length of mobile-element sequences (about 100,000
basepairs) is far shorter than the human reference genome, and thus the cost of checking
similarities between mates and mobile-element sequences is tiny. The third group is mates crossing
breakpoints of MEIs. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-cin-suppl.1-2015-037">Figure 1D</xref>, the
blue-colored mate crosses an MEI breakpoint and thus alignment of it can be divided into two parts.
The first partial alignment is still in the reference genome and the second partial alignment is in
the mobile-element sequence, which is split-read (SR) alignment. By adopting the SR approach,
TANGRAM achieves single-nucleotide breakpoint resolution, which means that the exact breakpoints of
MEIs are able to be detected. Combining signals provided by those groups of alignments, TANGRAM
gains high sensitivity and lowers FDR.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec>
      <title>TANGRAM applicability to other mappers</title>
      <p>TANGRAM relies on MOSAIK to check mates mapped to mobile-element sequences. Although high-quality
result of TANGRAM is consequently acquired, it precludes studies on other short-read
mappers’ alignments. Moreover, re-alignment may be expensive. We are thus motivated to
eliminate this barrier to make TANGRAM more general.</p>
      <p>This new function of TANGRAM seeks problematic reads that are one mate is aligned well while the
other one may be unmapped, mapped to other chromosomes, mapped with low-quality value, or most of
bases clipped. These poorly mapped mates are picked and aligned against the mobile-element sequences
(<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-cin-suppl.1-2015-037">Table 1</xref>). The re-alignment is performed
by utilizing an SIMD (single instruction multiple data) Smith–Waterman (SW) algorithm,<xref rid="b17-cin-suppl.1-2015-037" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> which produces the optimal pairwise
alignment between two sequences and is about several tens fold faster compared with conventional SW
implements. Like MOSAIK’s behavior, if the similarity is found between mates and any
mobile-element sequences, then alignments of mates are marked by additional tags in outputted files.
This function simulates MOSAIK and provides the information of the second group of alignments, which
is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-cin-suppl.1-2015-037">Figure 1C</xref>. Consequently,
TANGRAM is able to handle alignments generated by other short-read mappers. The complete pipeline is
shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-cin-suppl.1-2015-037">Figure 2</xref>. It can be seen that if
a MOSAIK BAM file is given, the pipeline processes this BAM file by TANGRAM_scan directly. However,
if the given BAM file is generated by other short-read mappers, TANGRAM_bam needs to patch the
information and then generates a BAM file that will be processed by TANGRAM_scan.</p>
      <p>We describe more details of TANGRAM_bam, which is the new feature that we propose for BAMs
generated by other aligners. TANGRAM_bam can be used for the whole-genome or each chromosome
analysis. For whole-genome analysis, TANGRAM_bam processes every alignment in BAM files and each
poorly alignment will be applied SIMD SW against the mobile-element sequences. Once the similarity
is found between an alignment and the mobile-element sequences, a flag of the alignment will be
marked. Then, we search the memory pool for looking for the other mate of the alignment. Note that
there are two alignments of two mates of a paired-end read. If the memory pool searching succeeds,
TANGRAM_bam removes the finding from the memory pool and reports both alignments of a paired-end
read in outputted BAM file. The flags indicating the similarities between the mobile-element
sequences are also reported in BAM file. If the memory pool searching fails, which means that
TANGRAM_bam has not processed its mate, the current alignment will be kept in the memory pool.</p>
      <p>For the analysis of a chromosome, TANGRAM_bam processes alignments that themselves are in the
specified chromosome and their mates are not (a paired-end read consists of two mates). These
alignments not in the specified chromosome are applied SIMD SW against the mobile-element sequences
to check the similarity between the mobile-element sequences and kept in the memory pool. Then,
TANGRAM_bam processes each alignment in the specified chromosome and searches its mate in the memory
pool. If two mates of a paired-end read are both in the specified chromosome, then TANGRAM_bam
treats them as the whole-genome analysis. It can be seen that handling chromosome separately is more
memory efficient. This is the function how TANGRAM patches information provided by MOSAIK if
alignments are not done by MOSAIK.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec>
      <title>Filtering strategy</title>
      <p>TANGRAM_detect reports any possible MEIs based on the evidence provided by alignments. However,
some MEIs may be false positive caused by artificial alignments. It is more often to see them in
deeper coverage datasets. Therefore, the number of detected MEIs may be affected by the coverage of
alignments because deeper coverage often provides more evidential alignments. Of course, they may be
noise leading to false-positive MEIs. To avoid reporting false-positive MEIs, we design a filter to
remove low-quality calls. All reported MEIs should have SR evidential alignments from either side of
insertions. As SR alignments are sensitive to insertions, MEIs having SR alignments from both sides
should be high-quality calls. The exact inserted bases are thus able to be obtained by using this
filter.</p>
    </sec>
  </sec>
  <sec sec-type="results">
    <title>Results</title>
    <p>The pipeline is performed on TCGA mutation calling benchmark 4 dataset (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://cghub.ucsc.edu/datasets/benchmark_download.html">https://cghub.ucsc.edu/datasets/benchmark_download.html</ext-link>). The purpose of the benchmark
exercise is comparative evaluation of somatic mutation calls on single-nucleotide variants (SNVs)
and structural variants (SVs) under a variety of conditions designed to simulate the effects of
tumor purity and subclonal expansions. We utilize the benchmark to evaluate MEI detection of
TANGRAM. TANGRAM is applied on the released alignments directly, which are mapped by BWA.<xref rid="b18-cin-suppl.1-2015-037" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Although three types of MEIs are reported
by TAMGRAM, ALUs, L1s, and SVAs, we discuss results on ALUs only in the following sections, because
we have the most confidence in ALU detection. Next-generation sequencing data are capable to
accurately detect ALU insertions because the length of ALUs is up to 300 bp. In this length
spectrum, while one mate of a paired-end read is in an ALU insertion, the other mate is still
located in the reference genome that is a confident anchor to locate the ALU insertion region in the
reference genome. Moreover, the distribution of distances between two alignments of a paired-end
read (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-cin-suppl.1-2015-037">Fig. 1B</xref>) provides better sensitivity
of ALU detection if the current technology uses several hundred basepairs between two mates.</p>
    <sec>
      <title>High coverage normal vs. tumor cell lines</title>
      <p>The first exercise consists of two comparisons. Each of them consists of normal samples derived
from blood (HCC1143_BL and HCC1954_BL) and tumor samples derived from grade 3 breast ductal
carcinomas (HCC1143_T and HCC1954_T). The coverage of HCC1143_BL, HCC1954_BL, HCC1143_T, and
HCC1954_T are 60×, 71×, 50×, and 58×, respectively. We detect ALUs
on each individually and then check the intersection on each comparison, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-cin-suppl.1-2015-037">Figure 3</xref>.</p>
      <p>Both normal samples (HCC1143_BL and HCC1954_BL) have more ALU insertions, and it could be caused
by the coverage of normal samples higher than tumor samples. In normal samples, we call 153 and 256
ALU insertions on HCC1143_BL and HCC1954_BL, and 44.45 and 33.98% share with the tumor samples
(HCC1143_T and HCC1954_T), which means that the same ALUs are also found in the tumor samples in 50
basepairs. In all, 52 and 71 ALU insertions are detected uniquely in the tumor samples.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec>
      <title>Tumor/normal mixtures vs. normal and tumor cell lines</title>
      <p>To evaluate the effect of sample contamination, the benchmark simulates varying levels of normal
contamination in tumor samples. Seven simulations are derived from normal and tumor samples for
HCC1143 and HCC1954 separately, as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4-cin-suppl.1-2015-037">Figure 4A</xref>. The 100% normal is a subset of reads in normal cell line (HCC1143_BL or
HCC1954_BL) with the coverage 30×. The original coverages of HCC1143_BL or HCC1954_BL are
60× and 71×. Then, tumor/normal mixtures consist of different combinations of reads
from normal 30× and tumor cell line (HCC1143_T or HCC1954_T) to simulate different levels of
normal contamination in tumor samples. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4-cin-suppl.1-2015-037">Figure
4A</xref>, blue and orange represent the contribution of reads derived from normal 30× and
tumor cell line, respectively. We then call ALUs on those seven mixtures to understand the effect of
the tool on different levels of contamination.</p>
      <p>The results are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4-cin-suppl.1-2015-037">Figure 4B and
C</xref>. Each ALU callset detected on a tumor/normal mixture is compared with the one on HCC1143_BL
(normal) or HCC1954_BL (normal). As normal 30× is the subset of HCC1143_BL or HCC1954_BL,
ideally there should be no unique ALU in the callset on normal 30×. However, we detect one
unique ALU on normal 30× of HCC1954, which is actually found on HCC1954_BL as well but it is
filtered out because of its low quality. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4-cin-suppl.1-2015-037">Figure 4B and C</xref>, from the left-hand to the right-hand sides, as the percentages of normal
reads decrease, replaced by tumor reads, the intersections between mixtures and HCC1143_BL or
HCC1954_BL decrease because reads in mixtures for those intersection ALUs are substituted by tumor
reads. Moreover, the unique ALUs of HCC1143_BL or HCC1954_BL therefore increase. It is notable that
the falling rate of ALUs in the intersections is milder than the falling rate of normal reads, which
means that TANGRAM is indeed affected by the contamination but not severely.</p>
      <p>We also compare the detected ALUs on mixtures to the ones on HCC1143_T (tumor) or HCC1954_T
(tumor). We expect to see the larger intersections of ALUs between mixtures and HCC1143_T or
HCC1954_T as more tumor reads are added in mixtures (from the left-hand to the right-hand sides in
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5-cin-suppl.1-2015-037">Fig. 5B and C</xref>); meanwhile, the number of
unique ALUs on HCC1143_T or HCC1954_T decreases when more tumor reads are added in mixtures.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec>
      <title>Tumor/normal/subclone mixtures vs. normal and tumor cell lines</title>
      <p>The third dataset provided in the benchmark is tumor/normal/subclone mixture. In the dataset,
∼500 novel SNVs and ∼200 novel SVs are spiked into each subclone using a simulator,
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/adamewing/bamsurgeon">https://github.com/adamewing/bamsurgeon</ext-link>. Subclonal mutations are added as heterozygous
in the subclone, combining with normal and tumor reads to create a subclone spike-in mixture. The
percentages of reads from normal, tumor, and subclonal mutations are given in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6-cin-suppl.1-2015-037">Figure 6A</xref>.</p>
      <p>The manuscript of the benchmark does not specify types of subclonal mutations. However, in the
result, we infer that ALUs are not included in subclonal mutations because we do not see more ALUs
as more subclonal mutations spiked in. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6-cin-suppl.1-2015-037">Figure
6B and C</xref>, from the left-hand to the right-hand sides, the numbers of unique ALUs on mixtures
are not likely to change. Therefore, we do not think that ALUs are included in subclonal mutations.
The consistency of intersection ALUs and unique ALUs on HCC1143_BL and HCC1954_BL is because the
percentage of normal reads in mixtures is not changed. The comparison between mixtures and tumors
(HCC1143_T and HCC1954_T) is given in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7-cin-suppl.1-2015-037">Figure
7</xref>. As tumor reads are replaced by subclone reads in mixtures, the unique ALUs of tumor
samples increase slightly.</p>

    <title>Discussion</title>
    <p>There are two more cases that we have not considered in TANGRAM. With continuing advances in
sequencing technologies, the average read length of sequenced reads continues to increase. We
therefore believe that these two cases will become common and useful signals in MEI detection on
next-generation sequencing data.</p>
    <p>The first one is that one mate crosses an MEI breakpoint while the other mate is mapped into an
ME sequence. For example in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-cin-suppl.1-2015-037">Figure 1C</xref>, the
orange-colored mate crosses the breakpoint and the blue-colored mate is entirely in the ME. To take
those alignments into account, we need to recognize mates crossing breakpoints as anchors to locate
MEIs. To achieve this goal, we check alignments having lots of clipped bases and those clipped bases
are exactly in the ME sequences. We did not take those alignments as anchors because the quality of
them is not good when reads are short. However, we do see them in 250 bp alignments. The second one
is that a mate may cover entire MEIs and three partial alignments should be obtained, alignment to
the reference genome followed by alignment to ME sequences followed by alignment to the reference
genome again. We are working on providing those features in the near future.</p>

    <title>Conclusion</title>
    <p>Mobile elements are abundant in the human genome and some MEI events are associated with cancer.
To fully understand MEIs in the genome of an individual, we implemented TANGRAM and applied it to
cancer genomes, TCGA mutation calling benchmark 4 dataset. The purpose of the benchmark exercise is
comparative evaluation of MEI calls under a variety of conditions designed to simulate the effects
of tumor purity and subclonal expansions. The results show that TANGRAM is indeed affected by the
contamination but not severely. As we do not think MEIs included as subclonal mutations, we cannot
conclude from the experiments of subclonal expansions. Currently, TANGRAM serves to alignments
mapped by any short-read mapper and is available on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/jiantao/Tangram">https://github.com/jiantao/Tangram</ext-link>.</p>

      <p>The example of paired-end reads and their alignments in MEI regions. (<bold>A</bold>) A
paired-end read consists of two mates from both ends of a DNA segment. The distance between two
mates is determined. (<bold>B</bold>) An MEI is inserted between two mates, and because the MEI is
not present in the reference genome, the distance between the two mates is shorter when mapping the
mates to the reference genome. (<bold>C</bold>) The orange-colored mate is well mapped to the
reference genome while the other mate is highly similar to a mobile-element sequence.
(<bold>D</bold>) The blue-colored mate crosses an MEI breakpoint and thus alignment of it can be
divided into two parts. The first partial alignment is still in the reference genome and the second
partial alignment is in the mobile-element sequence.</p>

71×, 50×, and 58×, respectively. Note that the number of detected ALU
insertions may be affected by the coverage. In normal samples, we call 153 and 256 ALU insertions in
HCC1143_BL and HCC1954_BL, and 44.45 and 33.98% share with the tumor samples. In all, 52 and 71 ALU

rate of ALUs in the intersections is milder than the falling rate of normal reads in mixtures, which
