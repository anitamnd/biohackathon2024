    <abstract>
      <p>Minor histocompatibility antigens (MiHA) are critical elements for the immune response after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. They may cause both beneficial and detrimental effects in forms of graft-versus-tumor and graft-versus-host accordingly. MiHAs originate from donor-recipient discrepancies in single nucleotide polymorphisms, insertions, and deletions. To determine the genetic mismatches between a donor and a recipient, we have implemented a real-time PCR method in conjunction with allele-specific primers (AS-qPCR). The new approach allows for multiplexing up to 480 reactions per 96 well plate and differs from common qPCR based genotyping methods. Earlier, we have confirmed and published the AS-qPCR method, but standard software for qPCR analysis does not suit AS-qPCR data. Here we fill this gap and describe AScall – the interactive web application for the proposed genotyping method. With a convenient interface mimicking a regular qPCR machine interface, our tool allows batch qPCR data import via universal RDML format, amplification curves preprocessing, quality control, sample genotype calling, detailed results visualization, and report generation. We show the use of AScall for SNP and indel genotyping for the MiHA study, but anyone can use the application for an accordingly designed AS-qPCR experiment of their own. Genotyping was done manually and with AScall for 96 genomic DNA samples. AScall processed 4,800 qPCRs in 1.5 min, with only two genotype mismatches compared to manual analysis. It took 3 h for an experienced researcher for manual analysis.

    <title>Introduction</title>
    <p>Modern hematology heavily uses molecular methods for diagnosis and treatment selection. In this paper, we focus on genotyping for minor histocompatibility antigens (MiHA) (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Griffioen et al., 2016</xref>). MiHAs are polymorphic peptides, after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) they can induce an immune response if the donor and the recipient mismatched for MiHA coding polymorphisms (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">de Bueger et al., 1992</xref>). In particular condition, these peptides could render recipient cells foreign for donor immune cells and cause detrimental consequences – systemic immune reaction toward the patient cells (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Shlomchik, 2007</xref>). If a MiHA expression restricted to hematopoietic tissue, the MiHA still renders host hematopoietic cells foreign for the graft, but this would lead to the elimination of residual pathogenic cell clone, as it is also of hematopoietic origin (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Falkenburg and Warren, 2011</xref>). Also, the tissue-specific MiHA can be a target for cell therapy (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Bleakley and Riddell, 2011</xref>). The majority of MiHAs originate from non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (nsSNP), which change the amino acid sequence of proteins. Genotyping MiHAs allows us to predict HSCT consequences and study plausible targets for cell therapy.</p>
    <p>Most MiHAs are encoded by nsSNP and could be genotyped by a vast arsenal of SNP-genotyping methods such as allele-specific PCR (AS-PCR), analysis of restriction fragments length polymorphism (RFLP), high resolution melting PCR (HRM-PCR), qPCR with fluorescent beacons or fluorescent hydrolysis probes, single nucleotide extension, DNA sequencing, and microarrays.</p>
    <p>AS-PCR is a PCR with one universal primer and a pair of allele-specific primers (ASP), which 3′ end is complementary to each SNP allele (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Ugozzoli and Wallace, 1991</xref>). To determine an SNP genotype, two independent PCR reactions needed: one per SNP allele (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Spierings et al., 2006</xref>). RFLP analysis based on the digestion of the PCR product containing SNP of interest by type II restriction endonuclease that recognizes only one of the SNP variants (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Pierce et al., 2001</xref>). Both methods require agarose gel electrophoresis to detect the PCR product or the restriction fragments and make the allele call. These two methods could be multiplexed because of product length difference, although it complicates the interpretation of the results. Contrary, real-time PCR methods, like HRM-PCR, qPCR with an allele-specific beacon, or a hydrolysis probe, could be performed in one step with little hands-on time. The second set of techniques uses fluorescent dyes to visualize product accumulation. The lack of a PCR post-processing step is a significant advantage as it reduces both contamination risk and hands-on time. HRM-PCR is based on a precise measuring of fluorescence drop while melting short amplicons after PCR with an intercalating dye. States of the SNP will slightly differ in melting temperature and melting speed. The limitations of the method are that it requires proprietary software, it is hard to multiplex, it needs control reactions each time, its sensitivity depends on the SNP type, and it is prone to inaccuracies (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Słomka et al., 2017</xref>). qPCR with beacon or hydrolysis probes uses oligonucleotides conjugated with fluorescent dyes and quenchers, these beacons or probes are complementary to the SNP site. For one SNP genotyping separate probes with different dyes are needed for each allele – the typing performed in one tube. Probes and beacons with different fluorophores allow to multiplex reactions, but most commercially available qPCR-based SNP genotyping kits designed to genotype one SNP per test, so each SNP requires a separate test. This method is the most common and qPCR detection systems software able to perform allele call for the method. Amongst chemistry needed for a qPCR fluorescent probes are the most expensive, and there are two of them in each genotyping reaction. Also, probes binding depends on the SNP allele and DNA context.</p>
    <p>Sanger sequencing is the most accurate method, but it lacks a multiplexing possibility and performed in several steps, which can take up to 1 day. SNP genotyping could be scaled up by a single nucleotide extension reaction or even next-generation sequencing (NGS). Both latter methods take much time to perform, up to several days, but allow to genotype dozens to thousands of SNPs simultaneously. Although it is excessive for genotyping of a small set of known MiHAs, it could be used for the discovery of new MiHAs (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Kawase et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Bergen et al., 2010</xref>). SNP genotyping techniques were reviewed in <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Kim and Misra (2007)</xref>. MiHAs genotyping was reviewed in <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Spierings and Goulmy (2007)</xref>.</p>
    <p>As number of clinically relevant MiHAs is currently below a hundred, but more than a dozen, it is impractical to use either one SNP per test methods or NGS and microarrays. Besides, because MiHAs presentation restricted by an HLA allele, it makes sense to develop genotyping panels grouped by HLA restriction. Some MiHAs appear due to indels, so the method of choice should also be capable of genotyping indels.</p>
    <p>We picked AS-PCR variation conducted with hydrolysis probes in real-time (designated from here on as AS-qPCR) (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Stadhouders et al., 2010</xref>). Our goal was to make a robust, multiplex, and cheap method, so we stick to AS-qPCR as a method of choice. Although we have to use two tubes for an SNP to separate two allele-specific reactions, we can set as many parallel reactions in a well as a qPCR machine optical system allows: each target is “color-coded” using a <italic>gene-specific</italic> hydrolysis probe with a fluorescent dye. The probe is universal for both tubes. The positive outcome of AS-qPCR for the allele is judged by the simple fact of successful qPCR – an increase in the fluorescence signal.</p>
    <p>In the earlier study, we developed our AS-qPCR for by far the largest HLA-A<sup>∗</sup>02:01 restricted group of 20 known MiHA (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Romaniuk et al., 2019</xref>). The proposed approach reveals full power, performed in a multiplex – four SNPs can be genotyped using two wells. Moreover, the example genotyping set has control gene reaction incorporated into each well. It shows any pipetting inaccuracy and allows DNA load normalization and well comparison without technical repeats. One test is for gene deletion, and in this case, both tubes have the same gene-specific reaction for the indel. Although our proposed MiHA genotyping method is easy to analyze by the “visual approach,” almost five hundred events possible per plate render analysis time-consuming and error-prone. So, to accompany the genotyping, in this article, we report AScall – the program to foster batch data analysis for the AS-qPCR method. In the example, we used all five detection channels of the CFX96 Touch real-time PCR detection system (Bio-Rad, United States): four channels for target polymorphisms and one channel for a control gene. In the example, AS-qPCR kit for 20 HLA-A<sup>∗</sup>02 restricted MiHAs, four hundred reactions run in parallel in a 96 well plate for eight DNA samples: for one control gene, 19 SNPs, and one gene deletion. The performance of our program was shown using 96 genomic DNA samples genotyped with the AS-qPCR method for this set of MiHAs and was compared to manual genotyping. AScall software allowed to reduce analysis time and showed comparable with manual genotyping results.</p>
    <p>Detection systems for qPCR could be found in many scientific and diagnostic molecular biology labs, as qPCR is a fast and handy method for various applications. So, as an obvious consequence, there are many software tools for qPCR analysis, particularly for SNP genotyping. To our knowledge, all SNP calling tools for qPCR analyze data obtained by “one-tube” approach, an SNP is genotyped in one tube using two <italic>allele-specific</italic> hydrolysis probes with different fluorescent dyes, one SNP per well. Such an approach implemented in the CFX Manager software by the Allelic Discrimination plot. Also, these programs do not allow more sophisticated analysis with quality control for the experiment. The R language is widely used for processing qPCR data (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Rödiger et al., 2015a</xref>; <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Burdukiewicz et al., 2018</xref>). However, ready-made solutions, such as Chainy (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Mallona et al., 2017</xref>), do not correspond to our specific task. AScall program is not limited to the example genotyping panel but is readily applicable to accordingly designed primer sets and any number of reactions per well.</p>

      <title>Overall Experiment Quality Control and Individual Curve Control (QC)</title>
      <p>These steps are conducted to check for possible experiment problems. The QC checkpoints are minimal fluorescence signal and Cq thresholds, the signal from NTC samples, a control gene signal, a Cq delta for paired wells. The QC results are provided in the table in the details tab (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>). The QC codes can be found in <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. AScall software adjusts the Cq delta slightly for target markers using corresponding Cq difference for the control gene for the pair of wells. If one or both AS-qPCR reactions for a marker are inside the Cq range, but the end-point fluorescence level is below the RFU threshold, then the call for the pair of wells would be “Uncertain.” The same call would be in the opposite case: Cq is out of the range, but the curve is above the RFU threshold.</p>

      <title>Performance Assessment</title>
      <p>The genotyping was done as described earlier (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Romaniuk et al., 2019</xref>). Briefly, primers and probes for genotyping of 20 polymorphisms split into five kits. Each kit consists of two mixes of primers either for reference or alternative alleles of the SNPs or indel as marked by Human genome assembly GRCh38<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="footnote1">1</xref></sup>. Each mix also has the control gene primers. Primer mixes and 5× qPCR-HS ready qPCR mix (EvroGen, Russia) were used to prepare stock genotyping solutions. Stocks were validated using control plasmid mixes. Peripheral blood samples for genotyping obtained from volunteers. DNA extracted using the Wizard Genomic DNA Purification Kit (Promega, United States). Altogether, 96 genomic DNA samples, separated into twelve plates, were genotyped. Samples with low DNA concentration were intentionally left to check AScall performance. qPCRs performed using the CFX96 Touch system (Bio-Rad, United States). The proprietary CFX Manager 3.1 software used for manual analysis and data export in the RDML data format version 1.1, one file per plate. For manual analysis, the baseline interval was 5–15 cycles, cycle thresholds set automatically. Heterozygous call for a gene was made if both tubes were positive for the control gene and the allele-specific reactions. The homozygous call was made, if only one allele-specific reaction were positive, while controls are still positive for both tubes. Automated analysis using AScall was performed for twelve rdml files simultaneously, with the Cq delta set to 3.5, Cq range set to 15–25 cycles, and RFU threshold of 200. Hands-on time measured for manual and automated data processing performed by an experienced user, for one or 12 data files (plates), respectively. Manual genotyping was done blindly and independently. The generated report was used to compare manual and automated analysis.</p>

      <title>The AScall Software</title>
      <p>AScall is a user-friendly, open-source tool for the allele-specific qPCR analysis written with the R language and R Shiny library. It can accept data from a wide range of qPCR machines, either raw or preprocessed. File formats supported by the AScall include, but not limited to, rdml, lc96p, xlsx. A batch analysis is also supported. AScall is a cross-platform web-based tool. It can be used online at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://shtest.evrogen.net/AScall/or">http://shtest.evrogen.net/AScall/or</ext-link> implemented locally. The source code of AScall is written according to the Model-View-Controller programming pattern so that it can use a separate server for faster data computation. AScall has a convenient graphical user interface and straightforward operational pattern. We tried to make AScall resemble a qPCR detection system’s software so that any user can implement the same analysis logic as usual. AScall is not bound to the specific kit and can be used with similar homemade kits and with any number of color channels (primer sets), and samples.</p>
      <p>The AScall user interface separated into three visual blocks: data import and processing, visualization of the results, and filters to select desired markers, kits, or samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). The AScall software can import several files for batch analysis and allows setting desired data processing parameters to finetune genotype call. It also allows recalculating Cq using eight curve-fitting models, seven Cq computation methods, and a readjusted background range.</p>
      <p>For convenience, processed result visualization separated into two tabs: summary (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>) and details (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). The first one shows overall statistics as a genotype barplot and genotype table for all processed files. The details tab is for by-well details, fluorescent curves, genotypes, and possible quality control errors. Plate overview provides all necessary actions for curve selection and highlighting as a standard qPCR software do. The individual curves view is convenient for a quick check for problems that may appear during qPCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). The filters used together with file and well selectors at the details tab can help to narrow study results. Also, there is a separate tab with the user manual for convenience. Another option to view results is report generation. It becomes available after computation and generates Microsoft Excel-compatible file with genotyping results, genotype count plot, QC control table, and a table with settings used. For batch import, a joint summary and a joint report will be provided. An overview of the AScall software workflow is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>.</p>

      <title>AS-qPCR Data Analysis With AScall</title>
      <p>For AScall software to work as designed, one should consider a strict naming convention. The target name must have two parts: an SNP or indel name, and the allele name or plus sign for the indel, separated by the underscore symbol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). Sample replicates, positive and none template controls are optional but must follow naming conventions. The easiest way to use the AScall tool is by exporting AS-qPCR data files from a qPCR detection system software as RDML v1.1 files and importing them into the AScall tool. Overall experiment quality control and individual curve control (QC) conducted to check for possible experiment problems. The QC checkpoints are minimal fluorescence signal and Cq thresholds, the signal from NTC samples, the control gene signal, and Cq delta. The QC results provided in the table of the details tab (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>). Genotype calling can be done only for samples passed QC. For an SNP, the genotype is determined by the rule of thumb: if only one allele-specific reaction is positive – the sample is homozygous for this marker; positive results for both allele-specific reactions – the sample is heterozygous. For an indel, both wells should be positive or negative. The MiHA genotyping obtained using AScall was implemented to select donors for <italic>in vitro</italic> T cell studies.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="S3.SS3">
      <title>AScall Comparison With Manual Genotyping</title>
      <p>Side by side comparison of manual and automated genotyping was made for 96 DNA samples tested for 20 markers. AS-qPCRs were set without DNA concentration adjustment. Altogether, 4,800 qPCRs have been processed both manually and with AScall, with the total possible number of genotype calls of 1,920 for target genes. Manual genotyping was done blindly and independently and took approximately 15 min per plate, 3 h altogether, while automated analysis with ready rdml files took only one and a half minutes, with most of the time spent for file upload. During manual analysis, two samples (40 genotypes) and 15 scattered genotypes were excluded due to low control gene signal or low target gene signal, 1,865 genotypes left in total. AScall software excluded 88 reactions as not available and 73 as “Uncertain” due to more stringent QC. First of all, each pair of wells is checked for control gene reactions: both should be positive and end-point fluorescence should be above the set threshold, Cq difference for control reactions between respective wells should be less than the preset value, and the Cq should be inside the Cq range. Also, the control gene end-point signal shows plausible evaporation – well-outlier is excluded altogether with the paired well. Some of these reactions can still be assessed manually with caution. Also, to exclude false positives, the same check algorithm was applied to target genes. AScall made 1,759 genotype calls. There were two mismatches with manual typing. One automated genotype call made for the weak signal well pair, the genotype for these wells was not determined during manual assessment. The other genotype mismatch was also due to low signal, and we cannot say it was wrong, as a low signal can also lead to a wrong reaction interpretation by a researcher. During extensive testing with different settings, only some wells with a weak signal generated false results, so for fine-tuned AS-qPCR testing, AScall software can be a robust and reliable tool, and default setting will be sufficient.</p>

  <sec id="S4">
    <title>Discussion (Including Scalability and Limitations)</title>
    <p>As far as we know, there are no other software tools for automated analysis of multiplexed allele-specific qPCR wherein alleles separated into different wells and color channels and with introduced control for DNA presence in a well. Software supplied with qPCR detection systems offers only simple genotyping with two detection channels used per well, gene expression analysis, or standard calculation of a threshold cycle. Thus, a user of the AS-qPCR method may get threshold cycles from the proprietary software but must make labor and error-prone genotyping manually. AScall software overcome this issue, as it specifically designed for the AS-qPCR method. AScall has a smooth, user-friendly interface, anyone, who knows how to work with a qPCR software can handle AScall.</p>
    <p>DNA samples of mediocre quality were the main reason for the target genotype to be marked as “Uncertain” by the software. The manual genotyping could overcome this issue only to a certain extent, as human interpretation can lead to erroneous results.</p>
    <p>The tool is written in language R with Shiny for a web interface so it can be easily changed for user-specific needs. It can run at a server or a local computer. Although we tried to predict as many qPCR errors as possible, the tool may still be prone to genotyping errors caused by weak fluorescent signals or wrong Cq interpretation by proprietary software. This type of mistake can be easily excluded by eye analysis. Also, AScall can recalculate Cq with many different methods if needed. Maybe the implementation of neuronal networks can be beneficial for AScall software.</p>
    <p>Overall, AScall is documented, freely available, and open source. Thus, our software can be part of an analysis pipeline corresponding to the Minimum Information for Publication of Quantitative Real-Time PCR Experiments (MIQE) guidelines (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Bustin et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
