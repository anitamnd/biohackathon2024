      <p>DNA is a structurally plastic molecule, and its biological function is enabled by adaptation to its binding partners. To identify the DNA structural polymorphisms that are possible in such adaptations, the dinucleotide structures of 60 000 DNA steps from sequentially nonredundant crystal structures were classified and an automated protocol assigning 44 distinct structural (conformational) classes called NtC (for Nucleotide Conformers) was developed. To further facilitate understanding of the DNA structure, the NtC were assembled into the DNA structural alphabet CANA (Conformational Alphabet of Nucleic Acids) and the projection of CANA onto the graphical representation of the molecular structure was proposed. The NtC classification was used to define a validation score called confal, which quantifies the conformity between an analyzed structure and the geometries of NtC. NtC and CANA assignment were applied to analyze the structural properties of typical DNA structures such as Dickerson–Drew dodecamers, guanine quadruplexes and structural models based on fibre diffraction. NtC, CANA and confal assignment, which is accessible at the website <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://dnatco.org">https://dnatco.org</ext-link>, allows the quantitative assessment and validation of DNA structures and their subsequent analysis by means of pseudo-sequence alignment.

    <title>Introduction   </title>
    <p>The prevailing DNA architecture, a right-handed double helix composed of sequentially complementary antiparallel strands, is structurally very plastic. Local deformations of DNA induced by interactions with binding partners, proteins and small-molecule drugs are necessary to convey its biological function, conservation and transfer of genetic information. The DNA strand has the ability to accommodate large conformational changes by forming kinks or bends or to undergo radical rearrangements into loops or folded forms such as quadruplexes. These conformational changes cannot be understood without going beyond the ‘A–B–Z’ classification traditionally used to describe DNA structural diversity. The necessity of understanding the DNA conformational space in its full complexity increases with the increasing number of biologically important DNA structures other than the double helix: tetraplexes with complicated and variable topologies, single-stranded hairpins and cruciforms, and DNA junctions involved in recombinant processes such as Holliday junctions.</p>
    <p>A detailed analytical view of the backbone conformational behaviour is not easy to obtain. The analysis is complicated by two factors: the plasticity of the DNA molecule, which leads to a host of DNA conformers, and the many torsional degrees of freedom of the DNA backbone. The flat hypersurface of potential energy and its multidimensionality make mathematically rigorous analysis of the DNA conformational space hard to accomplish, and a brute-force computational classification of DNA conformers has proven to be futile. The existence of several thousand experimental DNA structures solved by crystallographers and NMR spectroscopists has made such a comprehensive knowledge-based analysis of DNA conformational space possible.</p>
    <p>Here, we present a substantial revision of our previously published classification protocol of dinucleotide conformers (Svozil <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb75"> ▸</xref>), leading to the discovery of new conformers occurring in several nonduplex structures such as tetraplexes, four-way junctions and various single-stranded topologies. Analysis of the currently available crystal structures resulted in the establishment of an ensemble of 44 dinucleotide conformers NtC (<bold>N</bold>ucleo<bold>t</bold>ide <bold>C</bold>onformers). The NtC classes were further used to formulate the DNA structural alphabet CANA (<bold>C</bold>onformational <bold>A</bold>lphabet of <bold>N</bold>ucleic <bold>A</bold>cids), a concept that is well known in protein structural analysis (Unger <italic>et al.</italic>, 1989<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb84"> ▸</xref>; Levitt, 1992<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb53"> ▸</xref>), but, to the best of our knowledge, is the first formally defined DNA structural alphabet. Its usefulness has already been demonstrated by analyzing the structural features of DNA complexed with transcription factors and histone proteins (Schneider <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb70"> ▸</xref>). We briefly characterize the NtC conformers and show their typical occurrence in DNA structures, and use the NtC classification to calculate a validation score called confal, which allows quantification of the agreement between the known conformers and an analyzed dinucleotide. We then demonstrate the usefulness of the NtC and CANA classification scheme by annotating a few prototypical DNA structures.</p>

      <title>Retrieval of sequentially nonredundant structures   </title>
      <p>We retrieved two sets of crystal structures: 2405 protein–DNA complexes and 879 structures of ‘naked’ DNA. To capture as wide a spectrum of DNA structures as possible, we selected structures with a crystallographic resolution equal to or better than 3.0 Å by a search in the Protein Data Bank (PDB; Berman, Battistuz <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb9"> ▸</xref>) and the Nucleic Acid Database (Berman, Westbrook <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb10"> ▸</xref>) (release of 9 April 2014). We rejected structures containing RNA or DNA/RNA hybrids. Further, we excluded structures that did not contain DNA longer than five nucleotides or peptides longer than 20 amino acids. This criterion led to the exclusion of 173 protein–DNA complexes and 149 structures of naked DNA. To avoid the analysis of sequentially redundant structural data, we excluded structures with similar protein and at the same time similar DNA sequences, keeping just one structure with the highest crystallographic resolution in the case where it was better by 0.2 Å or more or otherwise that with the best <italic>MolProbity</italic> score (Chen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb25"> ▸</xref>). The treatment of sequence redundancies is described in more detail in the Supporting Information. The final data sets contained 58 069 steps of natural dinucleotides obtained from 1389 protein–DNA complexes and 413 structures of naked DNA.</p>

      <title>The conformational assignment of steps   </title>
      <p>We analyzed structures of a DNA fragment between C5′ of one nucleotide and O3′ of the following nucleotide containing two deoxyriboses, two bases and the linking phosphate group. This is depicted in Fig. 1<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"> ▸</xref> and is referred to as a step. The step conformations were analyzed in nine-dimensional torsion space defined by seven backbone torsions labelled δ, ∊, ζ, α<sub>1</sub>, β<sub>1</sub>, γ<sub>1</sub> and δ<sub>1</sub>, and two torsions around the glycosidic bond, χ and χ<sub>1</sub>. The stable conformations referred to as NtC (Nucleotide Conformers) were similarly to those in our previous study (Čech <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb12"> ▸</xref>) assigned by the method of weighted <italic>k</italic> nearest neighbours (<italic>k</italic>-NN). This approach requires the availability of a training data set during the prediction phase. As the training set, we initially used step data consisting of manually checked assignments into the 18 NtC used in the original <italic>k</italic>-NN protocol.</p>

      <title>Enhancement of the original <italic>k</italic>-NN protocol and the discovery of new NtC classes   </title>
      <p>The application of the original <italic>k</italic>-NN protocol (Čech <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb12"> ▸</xref>) to the current data led to the assignment of 50 136 steps; 7903 remained unassigned. These were further analyzed by complete linkage hierarchical clustering with a circular Euclidean distance implemented in the <italic>R</italic> statistical software. This analysis reassigned several thousand steps of the original 18 NtC and discovered 26 new NtC classes. In total, there were 8472 reassigned and newly assigned steps. The identification of new NtC led to a new training set, referred to in the following as the golden set. The resulting golden set contains a manually curated self-consistent ensemble of 4431 steps that define the 44 currently specified NtC classes (Table 1<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1"> ▸</xref>; the full list is given in Supplementary Table S1). The majority of the steps in the golden set originated from structures with resolution better than 2.0 Å, but some conformers needed to be defined, at least in part, by structures with worse resolutions (Supplementary Fig. S2).</p>
      <p>There have been a few changes in the details of the description of the conformational classes since the web server <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://dnatco.org">https://dnatco.org</ext-link> was set up (Černý <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb13"> ▸</xref>): the conformational classes NtC were originally called ntC and their number diminished from 57 to 44 after merging formally distinguishable but nevertheless structurally close clusters. The website <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://dnatco.org">https://dnatco.org</ext-link> contains both the original and the current version of the assignment.</p>

      <title>NtC classes as a tool to validate DNA structures: confal score   </title>
      <p>To quantify the closeness of fit between a candidate step and the assigned NtC class, we introduced a conformational validation score: confal. It is defined as the Gaussian-weighted distance between the torsion values of the candidate and the average for the NtC,<disp-formula id="fd1"><graphic xlink:href="d-74-00052-efd1.jpg" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif" position="float" orientation="portrait"/></disp-formula> where <italic>t</italic>
<sub><italic>i</italic></sub> are the torsion values of the candidate and 〈<italic>t</italic>
<sub><italic>i</italic></sub>〉 are the corresponding averages of the assigned NtC; the summation runs over the nine step torsion angles. The coefficient <italic>c</italic>
<sup>2</sup> is calculated for each NtC class in such a way that confal equals 100 for a perfectly matching candidate and 1 at the limiting values of ±28° or ±5 estimated standard deviations from the NtC torsion averages, whichever value is smaller; confal is set to 0 for unassigned candidates. The above formula calculates confal values for steps; the value for the whole structure is the arithmetic average of the confal values of all steps. Fig. 2<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"> ▸</xref> shows the confal distributions for all ∼60 000 steps and in 1802 analyzed structures. Based on the data in Fig. 2<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"> ▸</xref>, a percentile rank is reported for any structure analyzed using the web server at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://dnatco.org">https://dnatco.org</ext-link>.</p>

      <title>Overview   </title>
      <p>We first characterize the structural properties of 44 distinct step-conformer classes called NtC (Nucleotide Conformers; the full list is given in Supplementary Table S1) and introduce a coarser yet comprehensive classification of DNA conformations: a structural alphabet called CANA (Conformational Alphabet of Nucleic Acids; Table 1<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1"> ▸</xref>, Fig. 3<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"> ▸</xref>). In the last section, we discuss the occurrence of NtC and CANA in a few archetypal DNA structures (Fig. 6) and show a potential use of these conformational classifications for the straightforward and objective annotation of DNA structures. An automated assignment of NtC, CANA and confal for any PDB-formatted DNA structure can be carried out at the website <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://dnatco.org">https://dnatco.org</ext-link> (Černý <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb13"> ▸</xref>).</p>

      <title>Dinucleotide conformers NtC and the DNA structural alphabet CANA   </title>
      <p>Our analysis of DNA step structures separated them into 44 distinct conformer classes called NtC that are described in detail in the Supporting Information and Supplementary Table S1. The NtC assignment was implemented in the automated procedure available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://dnatco.org">https://dnatco.org</ext-link> (Černý <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb13"> ▸</xref>). A fine-grained clustering into 44 classes is convenient for further computational use, but it is perhaps too detailed for straightforward human interpretation.

A newly identified conformer, AB02, is unique owing to its extremely low value of the torsion ∊ of near 60°.

To test the stability of AB02, we performed quantum-mechanical calculations, which are summarized in Fig. 4<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"> ▸</xref> and described in the Supporting Information and Supplementary Table S2. The calculations showed that a dinucleotide with value of the torsion ∊ of near 60° is at its local minimum, making the conformer an unlikely artifact of intermolecular interactions. The ∊ value at the energy minimum coincides with the ∊ values observed in the crystal and that calculated for the AB02 class average (Supplementary Table S2).</p>

        <p>B-to-A conformers represent a structural complement of the previous CANA letter, A-B, but they are represented by a much more diverse and numerous group of conformers than A-B. All B-to-A conformers occur in duplexes, but they can also occur in quadruplexes (BA13 in PDB entry <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://scripts.iucr.org/cgi-bin/cr.cgi?rm=pdb&amp;pdbId=3sc8">3sc8</ext-link>; Collie <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb21"> ▸</xref>) or joints of Holliday junctions (BA05 in PDB entry <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://scripts.iucr.org/cgi-bin/cr.cgi?rm=pdb&amp;pdbId=1p4e">1p4e</ext-link>; Chen &amp; Rice, 2003<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb16"> ▸</xref>).

The two traditionally recognized B forms, BI and BII, also do not suffice to describe the conformational diversity of the B-like backbone. In the structural alphabet CANA, we describe the B-form by three letters for BI conformers (BBB, 2B1 and 3B1), one letter for BII conformers (BB2) and one letter for transitional BI-to-BII conformers (B12). In addition, we grouped numerically minor but structurally diverse conformers that still bear some features of the B-form under the letter miB (for mixed B-DNA).</p>

Dinucleotides whose conformations belong to the letters BBB, 2B1 and 3B1 form the core of Watson–Crick-paired double helices, but they can occur in almost any structural context, including quadruplexes or joints of Holliday junctions.

The most frequent conformer epitomizing the BII form is BB07. CANA letter B12 represents conformers with torsion-angle values between those typical of the BI and BII forms.

        <title>miB: various B-like conformers   </title>
        <p>The high plasticity of B-DNA is demonstrated by the existence of several distinct conformers that, despite their variability, share the typical features of the B-form: both sugars in the C2′-<italic>endo</italic> pucker and both glycosidic torsions χ above 200°. The structural features of these conformers can be quite exotic, but they have often been modelled with base stacking in double helices. If modelled correctly, they are likely to be energetically un­favourable but perhaps possible if stabilized by other strong interactions. The most important member of the miB letter is the NtC class BB16. It is important owing to its ability to accommodate a large local deformation of the strand. The particular combination of torsions attributable to this conformer can lead to unstacking of the bases to incorporate an intercalated drug (PSB entry <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://scripts.iucr.org/cgi-bin/cr.cgi?rm=pdb&amp;pdbId=1p20">1p20</ext-link>; Howerton <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb43"> ▸</xref>); BB16 is also often found at or adjacent to the strand crossing in Holliday junctions (PDB entry <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://scripts.iucr.org/cgi-bin/cr.cgi?rm=pdb&amp;pdbId=1l4j">1l4j</ext-link>; Thorpe <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb81"> ▸</xref>).

        <title>NAN: non-assigned conformers   </title>
        <p>About 21% of the analyzed steps end up as unassigned to any NtC with defined torsion values and are labelled NAN. Although we aimed at the highest possible percentage of assigned steps, we considered a fraction of 21% of unclassified steps to be a realistic compromise between the accuracy of assignment and the conformational properties of the analyzed steps. Therefore, we decided not to loosen up the parameters of the assignment process to classify more steps.</p>
        <p>We find two reasons why steps remain structurally uncharacterized: (i) a missing template in the golden set and (ii) incorrect model building during the refinement process. While the latter reason can be remedied by the use of improved force fields for model building and by more robust validation protocols, the former is caused by as yet incomplete sampling of the nine-dimensional conformational space of the DNA backbone. To estimate the contributions of the two reasons is not easy, but some facts point to a large proportion of incorrectly refined structures. A significant majority of unassigned steps (over 90%) were found in right-handed double-helical structures with Watson–Crick paired bases, where we do not see any reason for the massive occurrence of so far unknown conformers. We assume that most of these steps are likely to be a consequence of insufficiently refined duplexes, as can, for example, be seen in the dodecamers of PDB entries <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://scripts.iucr.org/cgi-bin/cr.cgi?rm=pdb&amp;pdbId=1vte">1vte</ext-link> (Aymami <italic>et al.</italic>, 1990<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb5"> ▸</xref>) and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://scripts.iucr.org/cgi-bin/cr.cgi?rm=pdb&amp;pdbId=1dne">1dne</ext-link> (Ala-Kokko <italic>et al.</italic>, 1989<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb3"> ▸</xref>), which have no or very few of their steps structurally assigned (Supplementary Table S3). Furthermore, comparison of the conformers reported in this and our previous analyses (Svozil <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb75"> ▸</xref>; Čech <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb12"> ▸</xref>) suggests that the majority have already been characterized, and that newly discovered conformer classes will be numerically small, accounting for a small fraction of the currently unassigned steps.</p>
        <p>The issue of incorrectly refined structures has been approached by Sunami <italic>et al.</italic> (2017<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb74"> ▸</xref>), who found that about a quarter of phosphate groups in higher resolution structures are actually disordered and may be positioned better in the electron density. The authors of the <italic>PDB_REDO</italic> web service (Joosten <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb46"> ▸</xref>) offer an automated procedure to optimize crystallographic structure models deposited in the PDB. To see how <italic>PDB_REDO</italic> changes the distributions of the assigned NtC classes, we compared the NtC distributions in DNA structures as they had been deposited in the PDB and after they had been treated by <italic>PDB_REDO</italic>. As a test case, we selected 34 structures of dodecamers related to the Dickerson–Drew dodecamer. On average, the confal score improved by 7 after application of the <italic>PDB_REDO</italic> protocol, but the fraction of reassigned NtC classes varied widely between 0 and 77% in individual structures. The confal values showed significant improvement, for example, in the structure with PDB entry <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://scripts.iucr.org/cgi-bin/cr.cgi?rm=pdb&amp;pdbId=1d29">1d29</ext-link> (Larsen <italic>et al.</italic>, 1991<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb52"> ▸</xref>), while no changes were observed in PDB entry <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://scripts.iucr.org/cgi-bin/cr.cgi?rm=pdb&amp;pdbId=4i9v">4i9v</ext-link> (Szulik <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb78"> ▸</xref>) and a mixture of increased and lowered confal values were found in PDB entry <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://scripts.iucr.org/cgi-bin/cr.cgi?rm=pdb&amp;pdbId=5bna">5bna</ext-link> (Wing <italic>et al.</italic>, 1984<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb86"> ▸</xref>) (Supplementary Table S3).

        <title>How well is the sugar pucker described by the backbone torsion δ?   </title>
        <p>The sugar pucker is correctly described by two parameters, the pseudorotation phase angle <italic>P</italic> and its magnitude τ (Altona &amp; Sundaralingam, 1972<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb4"> ▸</xref>), but we simplify its description and use just one parameter: the torsion angle δ. A potential problem of this simplification is represented by the ambiguous relationship between <italic>P</italic> and δ, where one value of δ may correspond to two <italic>P</italic> values describing two different sugar puckers. As Fig. 5<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"> ▸</xref> demonstrates, situations in which δ indicates the C2′-<italic>endo</italic> or C3′-<italic>endo</italic> pucker but <italic>P</italic> proves otherwise are rare even for unassigned steps. Most importantly, the scattergrams in Fig. 5<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"> ▸</xref> show that the δ torsion represents the sugar pucker correctly in the golden set: the region around the C3′-<italic>endo</italic> pucker with <italic>P</italic> values of 0–60° is indeed associated with δ ≃ 80° and the region around the C2′-<italic>endo</italic> pucker with <italic>P</italic> = 150–180° is associated with δ ≃ 130°. The condition that <italic>P</italic> of a classified step must fall within ±72° of the golden-set <italic>P</italic> average (see §<xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec2"/>2) led to the exclusion of ∼0.8% (484) of the analyzed steps in the whole set. Of interest might be the golden-set averages near <italic>P</italic> = 60° corresponding to the O4′-<italic>endo</italic> sugar pucker. As expected, the magnitude τ varies in a narrow range and does not discriminate between different sugar puckers.</p>

      <title>NtC classes as a tool to validate DNA conformations: confal score   </title>
      <p>The confal score of a step measures how closely its structure matches the structure of the NtC class to which it was assigned. The confal distribution for the analyzed steps (upper histogram in Fig. 2<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"> ▸</xref>) shows two features: (i) a smooth distribution for the assigned steps with a mode value of about 80 and few steps with confal values below 30, and (ii) a tall peak for ∼12 000 unassigned steps with confal 0. In contrast, the confal distribution of individual structures is shifted to lower values. While most structures have confal values of between 60 and 80, and a structure with a confal value of about 65 is in the 50th percentile (median), the distribution has a long tail that extends to values below 10. This indicates a very poor match between the geometries of the NtC classes and steps in some of the analyzed structures. Because confal quantifies the conformity between the geometries of analyzed steps and of the defined NtC classes, a particular value of confal and the corresponding percentile do not necessarily mean high or low structure quality; it just shows the similarity to the known conformers. For instance, the Dickerson–Drew dodecamer of PDB entry <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://scripts.iucr.org/cgi-bin/cr.cgi?rm=pdb&amp;pdbId=1bna">1bna</ext-link> (Drew <italic>et al.</italic>, 1981<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb27"> ▸</xref>) has confal 77 and belongs to the 84th percentile among the classified structures, indicating that the steps of this structure can be well characterized by the known conformers.</p>

        <title>The Dickerson–Drew dodecamer   </title>
        <p>The DNA do­decamer with the palindromic sequence d(CGCGAATTCGCG), often called the Dickerson–Drew dodecamer (D-Dd), was the first solved crystal structure of a right-handed DNA duplex (Drew <italic>et al.</italic>, 1981<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb27"> ▸</xref>) and has often been assumed to represent a prototypical B-DNA duplex. The importance of D-Dd is documented by the fact that a host of related structures were subsequently solved with gradually increasing resolution, it has been co-crystallized with various drugs, its components have been chemically modified and the structures of many oligonucleotides possess sequences related to D-Dd. D-Dd has also served as a test bed for <italic>in silico</italic> modelling since the first force-field simulations (Kollman <italic>et al.</italic>, 1982<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb49"> ▸</xref>). We therefore believe that a conformational analysis of D-Dd-related structures may be of general interest.</p>
        <p>We assigned NtC to structures sequentially related to D-Dd solved by both crystallography and NMR; the results are listed in Supplementary Table S3(<italic>b</italic>). A notable aspect of the assignment to the crystal structures is that actually only about half of the steps adopt BI conformations; a full 20% correspond to the CANA letter B-A, 15% are BII or mixed BI/BII (BB2 and B12, respectively) and finally 10% are A and A-B forms. The original D-Dd structure (PDB entry <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://scripts.iucr.org/cgi-bin/cr.cgi?rm=pdb&amp;pdbId=1bna">1bna</ext-link>; Drew <italic>et al.</italic>, 1981<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb27"> ▸</xref>) has nine steps in BI, three in BII, eight in B-to-A and two in A-to-B conformations. An in-depth analysis of sequence-related structural features would require further experimental data on related sequences besides the closely related D-Dd sequences or systematic crystal data on CC<italic>XXX</italic>­NNNGG decamer sequences (Hays <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb42"> ▸</xref>). Just a quick comparison of the central AATT tetranucleotide from the D-Dd structures showed an encouraging convergence of the assigned NtC classes. The AA and TT steps converge to BB01 and the central AT step to the BA05 NtC class in structures with increasing crystallo­graphic resolution.</p>
        <p>Complexation of D-Dd-related oligonucleotides with minor groove-binding drugs does not induce significant conformational changes; these structures show similar statistics just with fewer B-A and A-B letters and more non-assigned conformers. The statistics listed in this paragraph do not include a few structures whose steps were impossible to classify because of severe backbone deformation that was likely to have resulted from incomplete refinement.</p>
        <p>A different distribution of NtC classes can be seen for D-Dd structures determined in solution by NMR techniques. These structures report many more BI conformers than the crystal structures, but surprisingly no structures described by the A-B, BB2 and B12 letters. The question remains whether these statistics reflect the actual conformational preferences of the D-Dd sequence in solution or are a consequence of the force fields used in NMR refinement.</p>
        <p>To quantify the distribution of the backbone conformers in computer simulations of D-Dd, we analyzed the trajectories of several MD simulations (Supplementary Table S3) based on three force fields. Despite detailed discussion of this topic being outside the scope of this study, we conclude that the force fields optimized for long MD simulations of DNA do reproduce the main D-Dd structural features quite realistically. The closest match between the distribution of NtC in crystal structures and MD simulations is observed in short 100 ns simulations (Černý <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb14"> ▸</xref>) and long 1 ms simulations (Galindo-Murillo <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb31"> ▸</xref>) with the bsc0 force field (Pérez <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb65"> ▸</xref>); the bsc1 force field (Ivani <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb44"> ▸</xref>) and OL15 (Zgarbová <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb88"> ▸</xref>) force field underestimate the frequency of B/A forms (AB01, BA06) and overemphasize that of BII (BB07).</p>

        <p>Guanine tetraplexes have emerged as important noncanonical DNA structures in genomes. G-tetraplex structures are present inside cells (Han &amp; Hurley, 2000<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb40"> ▸</xref>), and bioinformatic evidence has provided insight into the sequence diversity in intronic regions of the human genome (Todd &amp; Neidle, 2011<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb83"> ▸</xref>). The basic building block of G-quadruplexes is a guanine tetrad, in which four guanine bases form a square-planar structure stabilized by the presence of potassium or sodium cations. G-quadruplexes exhibit various topologies characterized as intramolecular, bimolecular and tetramolecular, and are typified by the presence of a large number of various conformers. The proportion of the canonical BI conformation can be as high as 50%, as in the structure of the tetramolecular quadruplex with PDB entry <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://scripts.iucr.org/cgi-bin/cr.cgi?rm=pdb&amp;pdbId=1o0k">1o0k</ext-link> (Clark <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb20"> ▸</xref>), where BI steps are interspersed by a few B-A conformers. Steps with guanines in the <italic>syn</italic> orientation acquire NtC such as BBS1, BB1S and BB2S. Dinucleotides within the loops in bimolecular (PDB entry <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://scripts.iucr.org/cgi-bin/cr.cgi?rm=pdb&amp;pdbId=1jpq">1jpq</ext-link>; Haider <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb38"> ▸</xref>) and intramolecular (PDB entry <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://scripts.iucr.org/cgi-bin/cr.cgi?rm=pdb&amp;pdbId=1kf1">1kf1</ext-link>; Parkinson <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb62"> ▸</xref>) quadruplexes are structurally more flexible and commonly unstacked, and only some of them can currently be classified.</p>

        <title>I-motifs   </title>
        <p>I-motifs are DNA quadruplexes formed in cytosine-rich sequences (Gehring <italic>et al.</italic>, 1993<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb34"> ▸</xref>) that are comprised of two parallel-stranded duplexes held together in an antiparallel orientation by intercalated hemiprotonated cytosine–cytosine base pairs. In terms of backbone conformations, i-motifs are a rich source of steps in unusual conformations. In cases when their strands consist only of cytosine (PDB entry <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://scripts.iucr.org/cgi-bin/cr.cgi?rm=pdb&amp;pdbId=190d">190d</ext-link>; Chen <italic>et al.</italic>, 1994<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb15"> ▸</xref>), less than half of the steps adopt AA02, an A-like conformer with BI-like χ/χ<sub>1</sub>, but the rest cannot be assigned to any existing conformational class. They will possibly be classified when more i-motif structures have been solved.</p>

        <title>Holliday junctions   </title>
        <p>A Holliday junction is a DNA intermediate in homologous recombination (Liu &amp; West, 2004<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb54"> ▸</xref>). It contains four double-stranded DNA arms joined together by short links. The stems of the junctions are usually B-DNA duplexes with very few, if any, B-A and A-B conformers (PDB entry <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://scripts.iucr.org/cgi-bin/cr.cgi?rm=pdb&amp;pdbId=1dcw">1dcw</ext-link>; Eichman <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb28"> ▸</xref>). The NtC class that can be associated with the junction proper is the recurrently occurring NS04, but they may be formed by steps in BII BB07, atypical B-like BB16 or unclassified conformations.</p>

      <title>DNA models derived from fibre diffraction   </title>
      <p>DNA models based on the fibre diffraction of DNA are often used as starting structures in computer modelling and other studies. We therefore decided to analyze the backbone conformations of the fibre models available in the 3<italic>DNA</italic> software package (Lu &amp; Olson, 2008<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb55"> ▸</xref>) and in <italic>Nucleic Acid Builder</italic>, which is part of the <italic>AmberTools</italic>14 software package (Salomon-Ferrer <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb66"> ▸</xref>). The assignments of the ‘Arnott’ model from <italic>AmberTools</italic> and of models ‘51’ and ‘4’ from 3<italic>DNA</italic> are shown in Fig. 7<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7"> ▸</xref>; Supplementary Fig. S4 shows more examples, and the assignment is summarized in Supplementary Table S5. Model 4, which is treated in 3<italic>DNA</italic> as the default B-DNA duplex, is the medium-populated BB04 class with mixed BI–BII features. Of the three models built by <italic>AmberTools</italic>14, the models labelled as ‘Langridge’ and ‘Arnott’ fit the canonical BI BB00 class, but the dihedral angle values of ‘Langridge’ in particular are mostly found in the tail regions of the torsional distributions as defined in the golden set for BB00. The third model, ‘the average’, differs significantly from any major B-DNA conformer and is only weakly related to the rather exotic BB15, with a high α<sub>1</sub> value and γ<sub>1</sub> near 0°.</p>
      <p>The labelling of several fibre models by codes suggesting the existence of distinct DNA conformations as C, D or B′ is not supported at the level of their backbone conformations because they have backbone structures classified by the same NtC classes. On the other hand, some other fibre models are labelled by the same code but are described by different NtC. For instance, ‘C-DNA’ models were found to have their backbones described by the canonical BB00 or by BII BB07; one duplex labelled as B′-DNA has one backbone described by BB07 and the other described by AA00.</p>

      <title>Models based on the superposition of structures of NtC classes used as building blocks   </title>
      <p>We superimposed Watson–Crick paired steps in the conformations of NtC AA00, BB00 and BB07 to test whether these building blocks can potentially put together a duplex DNA. The models built from AA00 and BB00 display the main characteristics expected for A-DNA and B-DNA duplexes despite the fact that the models were built by simple superposition of the backbone atoms without any geometry or energy optimization (Fig. 8<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8"> ▸</xref>). This leads us to the conviction that the NtC classes can be used to build realistic models of DNA duplexes. In contrast, a hypothetical duplex composed solely of the BII NtC class BB07 cannot exist as its minor groove is too narrow and the phosphate groups on the opposing strands clash. Indeed, our data set of nearly 60 000 steps shows only 31 cases when two BB07 steps overlap in sequence, and in only three cases three BB07 steps overlap forming a tetranucleotide stretch in the BII-DNA form; no longer stretches exist.</p>

    <title>Conclusions   </title>
    <p>Our analysis of DNA structures led to the identification of 44 DNA step conformer classes called NtC (Supplementary Table S1). Structurally similar NtC classes were grouped into 11 letters of the DNA structural alphabet CANA (Table 1<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1"> ▸</xref>, Fig. 3<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"> ▸</xref>), which makes the analysis of DNA structure more comprehensible yet does not compromise the impartiality of the structural description and provides a tool to characterize the DNA structure beyond a rough classification into BI-, BII-, A- and Z-DNA types. Annotation of the conformational properties of a few archetypal types of DNA structures revealed some unexpected features. The Dickerson–Drew dodecamer, which is often considered to be a typical B-DNA duplex, is conformationally rich, with a high proportion of features mixing B and A forms. Our analysis of duplex models based on the fibre-diffraction data discloses the need for their critical evaluation before they are used for computer modelling (Fig. 7<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7"> ▸</xref>, Supplementary Fig. S4). Conformational analysis of guanine quadruplexes demonstrates the universality of the most frequent B conformer, BB00, which builds the tetrad cores of these folded DNA in combination with more exotic conformers such as BBS1 or BB1S.</p>
    <p>The ∼21% of steps that are left unassigned in our procedure represent a compromise between the accuracy of the assignment and the complex nature of the DNA conformational space: a relaxed accuracy of the assignment criteria can lead to an arbitrarily higher percentage of assigned conformers, but the broad overlapping torsion distributions would lead to increasing uncertainty of the assignment. A small percentage of the currently unassigned steps may subsequently be classified as new NtC classes. These classes may be quite important for understanding the detailed architecture of folded DNA, such as turns in hairpin structures or quadruplexes and still uncharacterized conformer(s) describing the i-motif fold, but they will most likely be numerically small. Undoubtedly, a fair number of the unassigned steps originate from refinement errors, but even error-free structures will have a significant number of uncharacterized conformers because of the high deformability of DNA molecules.</p>
    <p>Both NtC classes and CANA letters are assigned automatically to any PDB-formatted DNA structure at the website <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://dnatco.org">https://dnatco.org</ext-link> (Černý <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb13"> ▸</xref>). A representation of the CANA letters embodied into the molecular graphics of DNA structures allows straightforward visual inspection of the main structural features of the DNA (Fig. 6<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6"> ▸</xref>). The definition of the NtC classes allowed us to define a validation score, confal, that quantifies the agreement between the conformation of an analyzed structure and the known NtC classes.</p>
    <p>We believe that the NtC and CANA assignment protocol will contribute to understanding DNA structures by their impartial characterization, help to refine and validate DNA crystal and NMR structures, interpret DNA molecular modelling, and facilitate challenging analyses of sequence-dependent features of DNA structures and their interactions with proteins.</p>
