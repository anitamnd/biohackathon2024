<body>
  <p>In a recent work, Turner (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>) compared the performances of two bioinformatics programs, cutadapt (Marcel, <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>) and AlienTrimmer (Criscuolo and Brisse, <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>), to trim off exogenous oligonucleotides from short-insert paired-end reads. Turner (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>) suggested that AlienTrimmer performed with very low sensitivity. Here we show that this reported lack of performance was due to inappropriate use of AlienTrimmer. Indeed, when all relevant oligonucleotide sequences to be trimmed off are specified, AlienTrimmer performs faster than cutadapt and with equally satisfactory sensitivity.</p>
  <p>The bioinformatics protocol by Turner (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>) allows short-insert paired-end reads as well as library preparation oligonucleotides occurring within such reads to be identified. These exogenous oligonucleotide sequences need to be removed from such reads as their presence may affect negatively downstream analyses such as <italic>de novo</italic> assembly or variant detection by mapping approaches (e.g., Criscuolo and Brisse, <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Bolger et al., <xref rid="B1a" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). To illustrate this protocol, Turner (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>) generated paired-end reads of length 250 base pairs (bps) from <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> with 96 separate libraries prepared using the standard dual index Nextera® XT transposon protocol. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref> shows an example of typical paired reads with short insert size from these data. As underlined by Turner (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>), when the insert size is very short (i.e., less than the length of a single read), each paired read is a composite sequence starting with genomic insert sequence in 5′, whereas the downstream sequences contain oligonucleotides used for library preparation (i.e., reverse complement of concatenated primer + index + transposase sequences), followed by a short stretch of As, and next by apparently random sequence with low Phred (Ewing and Green, <xref rid="B3a" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>) quality scores <italic>Q</italic> (see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). In order to trim off these exogenous oligonucleotide sequences, Turner (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>) compared the respective accuracy of cutadapt and AlienTrimmer. Yet, the two programs were run using as input to be trimmed off, only the transposase sequence, but not the other alien oligonucleotide sequences (see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). With this incomplete setting, each trimming program performed quite differently. As cutadapt was set to perform 3′ trimming only, it detected the transposase sequence as well as downstream sequences. In order to provide more flexible functionality and simpler usage, AlienTrimmer's strategy is to detect the specified alien oligonucleotides within reads and perform trimming when the matched region is close enough to a read end. Therefore, when the adapter oligonucleotide (or transposase) sequence is far from the 3′ end because it is followed by unspecified index, primer or artefactual nucleotides, it is detected by AlienTrimmer but not trimmed off (see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). As a consequence, AlienTrimmer did not yield accurate read trimming in the way Turner (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>) used it (i.e., without specifying index, primer and artefactual sequences, although they were identified).</p>

  <p>Here, we compared cutadapt (version 1.3) and AlienTrimmer (version 0.3.2) on the original read data (Turner, <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>) by providing all oligonucleotide sequences to be trimmed off. Following Turner (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>) analyses, all paired reads with predicted insert size &lt;250 bps were gathered, and every read pair of combined length &lt;250 bps after quality trimming (cut-off <italic>Q</italic> = 20) was discarded, therefore leading to a subset of ~80,000 read pairs. The program cutadapt was launched with the two reverse complemented transposase sequences to perform 3′ end trimming, as it would run slower when specifying more oligonucleotide sequences, which is unnecessary (see above). As AlienTrimmer running times are not affected by the number of specified alien oligonucleotides to trim off, it was launched with all combination of exogenous bps (i.e., reverse complement of concatenated primer + index + transposase sequences for each of the 16 used indexes + poly-A). Quality-trimming option (cut-off <italic>Q</italic> = 20) was also set for both programs in order to trim off low quality random bps in 3′, sometimes occurring when the insert size is very small (see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). Following Turner (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>) criteria, true positive and false negative results were defined as trimmed reads leaving less and more than five bps to be trimmed, respectively. Denoting <italic>TP</italic> and <italic>FN</italic> as the number of true positive and false negative results, respectively, the sensitivity <italic>TP</italic> / (<italic>TP</italic> + <italic>FN</italic>) was estimated for each number of bps to be trimmed (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>).</p>
  <p>All read pairs with insert size &lt;250 bps were processed by cutadapt and AlienTrimmer in ~17 and ~8 s, respectively, confirming that AlienTrimmer runs fast with multiple input alien oligonucleotides. Note that we ran the program AlienTrimmer compiled with gcj to native machine code to observe such fast running times: different Java virtual machines were tested to execute AlienTrimmer, each running from ~2 (Oracle JRE 7) to ~6 (gij version 4.8) times slower than the gcj-compiled version on these read data. Clearly, AlienTrimmer had high sensitivity. As expected, AlienTrimmer had moderate sensitivity only when the number of bps to be trimmed was small (i.e., less than the specified <italic>k</italic>-mer value within a single read, see Criscuolo and Brisse, <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Indeed, as AlienTrimmer was launched with default <italic>k</italic>-mer value (i.e., <italic>k</italic> = 10), moderate sensitivity was observed when the number of bps to be trimmed was less than 20. However, higher sensitivity values were observed by setting lower <italic>k</italic>-mer values (not shown). Of note, cutadapt plot in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref> shows a decreasing trend that differs from the increasing one in Turner (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). This could be explained by the fact that all paired reads with insert size &lt;250 bps were analyzed here, whereas Turner (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>) considered selected subsets from each library.</p>
  <p>In conclusion, AlienTrimmer has high sensitivity and speed in removing alien oligonuceotide sequences from short-insert paired-end reads. This work underlines that it is critical to specify all possible alien oligonucleotide sequences as input for AlienTrimmer (as allowed by the protocol presented by Turner, <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>) and to perform quality trimming upstream of alien sequence removal. As the speed of AlienTrimmer is not affected by the number of input oligonucleotide sequences, this feature is a strong advantage for the process of raw data from read archives, for which the oligonucleotide sequences used for library preparation may be undocumented.</p>
