    <abstract>
      <p>With the increasing number of molecular biology techniques, large numbers of
oligonucleotides are frequently involved in individual research projects. Thus,
a dedicated electronic oligonucleotide management system is expected to provide
several benefits such as increased oligonucleotide traceability, facilitated
sharing of oligonucleotides between laboratories, and simplified (bulk) ordering
of oligonucleotides. Herein, we describe OligoPrime, an information system for
oligonucleotide management, which presents a computational support for all steps
in an oligonucleotide lifecycle, namely, from its ordering and storage to its
application, and disposal. OligoPrime is easy to use since it is accessible
<italic toggle="yes">via</italic> a web browser and does not require any installation
from the end user’s perspective. It allows filtering and search of
oligonucleotides by various parameters, which include the exact location of an
oligonucleotide, its sequence, and availability. The oligonucleotide database
behind the system is shared among the researchers working in the same laboratory
or research group. Users might have different roles which define the access
permissions and range from students to researchers and primary investigators.
Furthermore, OligoPrime is easy to manage and install and is based on
open-source software solutions. Its code is freely available at <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://github.com/OligoPrime" ext-link-type="uri">https://github.com/OligoPrime</ext-link>. Moreover, an implementation of
OligoPrime, which can be used for testing is available at <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="http://oligoprime.xyz/" ext-link-type="uri">http://oligoprime.xyz/</ext-link>. To our knowledge, OligoPrime is the only
software solution dedicated specifically to oligonucleotide management. We
strongly believe that it has a large potential to enhance the transparency of
use and to simplify the management of oligonucleotides in academic laboratories
and research groups.</p>

    <title>Introduction</title>
    <p>One of the most common and essential techniques in biology and medicine is the
polymerase chain reaction (PCR). It is routinely used in various approaches, from
classical PCR to more sophisticated quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR) all the way
to the preparation of next-generation sequencing (NGS) libraries. Since the cost of
PCR is affordable to all kinds of laboratory settings, the amount and diversity of
reagents needed for PCR, especially oligonucleotides, has been rapidly increasing,
and therefore the tracking of the stock in notebooks or spreadsheets and search
through frost-encrusted freezer boxes<sup><xref rid="bibr1-11795972211041983" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> must be replaced by a far more elegant solution based on computer
application.</p>
    <p>Oligonucleotides are short, chemically synthesized sequences composed of nucleotide
residues, which pair to the complementary nucleic acid section representing its target.<sup><xref rid="bibr2-11795972211041983" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> As sequencing becomes more affordable, oligonucleotides are turning into an
irreplaceable reagent in a molecular biology laboratory. Oligonucleotides are used
for amplifying DNA in different PCR approaches but are also fundamental in many
other widespread laboratory techniques, such as molecular cloning, site-specific
mutagenesis, and as molecular probes (eg, used as detection probes in fluorescence
in situ hybridization, FISH, which enables visualization of the localized gene
expression).</p>
    <p>Oligonucleotide sequences can be made available from databases such as PrimerBank,<sup><xref rid="bibr3-11795972211041983" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> but can also be custom synthesized for specific purposes using designated
tools, such as Primer-BLAST, an NCBI Primer designing tool.<sup><xref rid="bibr4-11795972211041983" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="bibr5-11795972211041983" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> Properties of oligonucleotides
include length, GC content, melting temperature (Tm) range, molecular weight,
extinction coefficient, and tendency to form secondary structures that are important
for optimizing efficiency, ensuring the proper experimental design and reliable
results. Oligonucleotide specificity depends on its length and the sequence of the
DNA used in the experiment.<sup><xref rid="bibr2-11795972211041983" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> Proper storing and tracking of stored oligonucleotides are important for
their stability. For example, unmodified DNA oligonucleotides are stable for 2 years
at −20°C, whereas refrigerated at +4°C, they are stable for about a year
(&gt;60 weeks) . For cost-effectiveness, oligonucleotides are often shared between
laboratory members and, if possible, used for different projects within a larger
research group. Therefore, it is important to have a centralized system for
oligonucleotide management and tracking.</p>
    <p>Nowadays, there are various laboratory reagent management software solutions
available, such as LabCollector,<sup><xref rid="bibr6-11795972211041983" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> AiO,<sup><xref rid="bibr7-11795972211041983" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> OpenFreezer,<sup><xref rid="bibr8-11795972211041983" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> MyLabStocks,<sup><xref rid="bibr9-11795972211041983" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> LabStoRe,<sup><xref rid="bibr10-11795972211041983" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> and LINA.<sup><xref rid="bibr11-11795972211041983" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> Even though these solutions are useful for general laboratory use (eg,
keeping track of reagents information and stocks management, exporting data), they
are not specific for oligonucleotide tracking, ordering, and managing. There are
currently no open and/or freely accessible solutions on the market that would
comprehensively provide a record of oligonucleotide libraries and fully cover the
needs of research and medical laboratories. However, whereas the use of licensed
products is necessary and affordable in the industry, it can present a barrier and
further financial burden in academic settings.</p>
    <p>Here, we present OligoPrime, an open-source and freely accessible web-based software
solution, which is devoted to the management of oligonucleotides in small to
medium-sized academic laboratories. To ensure security, the software can be hosted
on an internal in-house server which can only be accessed from within the internal
laboratory network by the laboratory members. Moreover, different access policies
and permissions can be defined, which restrict the users of the software to specific
roles, such as Student, Researcher, or Administrator. We believe that with this
software we can reorganize and simplify working with oligonucleotides in the
laboratory and therefore make it faster and more effective, leaving the staff to
focus on the content of their work instead of organizational aspects.</p>

    <title>Results</title>
    <p>OligoPrime presents software designed to simplify the storage and ordering procedures
of oligonucleotides in a laboratory. It is easy to use and has a clear layout and
multiple functionalities, which we tried to adapt to several possible laboratory
scenarios, such as ordering multiple oligonucleotides from the same supplier in a
batch, preventing mixing-up of nucleotides by having an overview over the exact
location of storage and their belonging projects and listing the users that recently
used a specific oligonucleotide within a project.</p>
    <p>The layout of the software is intuitive and simple to use. Moreover, there is a
variety of options that allow the user to add and edit oligonucleotide data as well
as personalize the user experience. These options are easily accessed to save time
on every step of working with oligonucleotides. The software offers different levels
of user access; the user can customize the data while all their actions are being
recorded in the history section. This functionality also has a protective function
of keeping user data safe by following the regulative standard operating procedures
(SOPs).</p>
    <sec id="section3-11795972211041983">
      <title>Functionalities</title>
      <p>OligoPrime functionalities are divided into specific parts, which are described
in the following section. The full documentation of the software is available at

        <p>From the main page, the user can change the theme and access the
documentation of the software for further information. The documentation can
also be exported and printed in a portable document format (PDF).</p>
        <p>The “Overview” page shows general analysis data, including the occupancy of
refrigerators and the total number of oligonucleotides. Oligonucleotides are
presented in an organized list and are automatically sorted by their
generated names in descending order. This order can be modified based on any
trait (eg, “Sequence,” “Freezer,” “User.”)</p>
        <p>The software allows linking and unlinking of oligonucleotides (eg, forward,
reverse, and probe) and their data. The user can add their most frequently
used oligonucleotides to a “Favorites” list, which allows faster access to a
selection of oligonucleotides. These oligonucleotides appear on the
“Favorites” page.</p>
        <p>Details of each oligonucleotide can be accessed by clicking on the bar with
the oligonucleotide. Oligonucleotides can be modified or deleted by the
users with the right level of access. This is described in detail in the
“Editing Primer Data” section.</p>

      <sec id="section6-11795972211041983">
        <title>Searching and filtering oligonucleotide data</title>
        <p>OligoPrime software allows the user to search the database using fast or
advanced search options. When using a normal (fast) search, the user can
search the database based on all selected attributes simultaneously,
depending on the amount selected with the “View columns” option. Advanced
search options can be accessed by clicking on the “Filter Table” button and
selecting the desired criteria. Filtering can also be combined with
searching, which allows us to perform advanced queries in selected
subsets.</p>
        <p>Filtering is possible using various traits, to mention a few:</p>
        <list list-type="bullet" id="list1-11795972211041983">

          </list-item>
        </list>
        <p>The system also allows the user to search for duplicate oligonucleotides by
simply entering the selected sequence into the search field. The system will
search for all oligonucleotides with the same sequence, thus list all
duplicates. Moreover, the user can also search for oligonucleotides with
similar sequences. We can do that by entering a part of a sequence in the
search field, from which the system then finds all oligonucleotides that
contain this part of the sequence.</p>

      <sec id="section7-11795972211041983">
        <title>Sorting oligonucleotide data</title>
        <p>Oligonucleotides can be sorted based on certain traits with the “View
columns” option and check off the boxes with desired traits, then sorting
them in an ascending or descending order. When checking off the boxes, the
user can also use the “Select all” option to see all data at the same
time.</p>

        <title>Exporting and printing data</title>
        <p>All oligonucleotide data from the database can be exported with the
“Download” option. The data is exported in a comma-separated values (CSV)
format. The program also allows you to print all data at once.</p>

        <title>Adding new oligonucleotides</title>
        <p>New oligonucleotides can be added in 2 ways. The fast and simplified way
includes adding oligonucleotides or probes with no obligatory information to
fill in (“Add one general”) and the normal way includes all adding options
with some obligatory fields (“Add primer”).</p>
        <p>The “Add primer” option offers you to add one general oligonucleotide
(described in the previous section) or, 1 or 2 (forward and reverse)
oligonucleotides at the same time. The software allows you to put in old,
already existent oligonucleotide data from the database. There is an option
of uploading a file or importing data to the database by selecting the “CSV”
option and choosing which document to upload. The software also provides an
example of how the data for importing should be structured.</p>
        <p>When adding a new oligonucleotide in this way, the user must put in the
obligatory data (tagged with an asterisk symbol) before the system allows
the user to access the next page. <xref rid="table1-11795972211041983" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> represents a summary of

required, namely, assay ID, size, probe sequence (optional), quencher, and
dye. A document, such as the information sheet provided by the manufacturer,
can be added as an attachment to the oligonucleotide data.</p>

details, data such as the amount available, results of an analysis, and
comments can be edited. The user with the assigned role can also edit all
other information by clicking on the edit icon and by accessing the “Edit
primer” page.</p>
        <p>This page allows users to edit the oligonucleotide data or correct any
possible mistakes that have been made during the process of adding new
oligonucleotides to the repository. This includes basic oligonucleotide
properties, oligonucleotide order form, its location in the laboratory,
project information, etc.</p>
        <p>The “Analysis” field allows the user to link crucial information (eg, graphs
or videos) as a part of the analysis to the oligonucleotide data.</p>

        <p>As with the procedure of adding a new oligonucleotide, the required fields
should be filled in. When ordering 2 oligonucleotides simultaneously, common
features are required first and specific features second for each
oligonucleotide. The software allows the user to reorder an oligonucleotide
by moving it directly from the library on the “Overview” page to the
“Ordered” section of the “Orders” page. This can be done by selecting an
oligonucleotide on the “Overview” page and then selecting the “Move to
wanted” option. It is advised that if less than 10 µL of an oligonucleotide
is available, a new order should be placed immediately. If a mistake has
been made while putting in the data, the system sends a warning message.</p>
        <p>After completing an order, the date of the order appears in the
oligonucleotide details to notify other users searching for that
oligonucleotide. Existing orders can be viewed in the “Orders” page,
accessible by clicking on the shopping cart icon on the top left part of the
page. The “Orders” section also includes the “Wanted” section, where the
user can view the oligonucleotides pending to be ordered. This page should
be checked so the orders do not overlap. If the oligonucleotide has already
been ordered, this is also shown under the “Order status” in oligonucleotide
details.</p>
        <p>If your order can be ordered in a batch with other oligonucleotides, it can
be added as a pending order under the “Wanted” section. This allows other
users to add their wishes and when enough material from the same supplier is
under “Wanted,” everything can be ordered in a single batch. When an order
has been placed, the oligonucleotides from the “Wanted” section are moved to
the “Ordered” section.</p>
        <p>When an order has arrived, the oligonucleotide can be moved directly to the
oligonucleotide repository, but “Project” and “Location of storage”
information need to be filled in beforehand. Orders or wanted
oligonucleotides can be edited in the same way as the primer data in the
library, by clicking on the row with the oligonucleotide and clicking on the
“Edit” icon.</p>

      <p>Firstly, the user needs to log in using a valid username and password. In our
case, we will use the username “admin” and password “admin.” We are presented
with the “Overview” page with statistical data on top and a list of
oligonucleotides on the bottom. We could do a simple add by clicking on the “Add
one general” icon on the left, but instead, we will add the data using the “Add
primer” option on the top right, which will not allow us to proceed without
adding the obligatory data. The screenshot of both options is represented in

      <p>A new window opens, asking if we want to add 1 or 2 new oligonucleotides or if we
want to just add an old one (see <xref rid="fig4-11795972211041983" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>). We choose “two new.”</p>

      <p>In the next window, we insert the common features in the top section. In our case
it includes “Gene,” “NCBI gene ID,” “Human genome build,” “Length of amplicon,”
“Probe sequence,” “Size, 3’ Quencher,” “5’ Dye,” “Formulation,” “Storing
Temperature,” “Purification method,” “Pack type,” “Amount available,”
“Concentration,” “Project,” “Application,” “Designer name and surname,”
“Supplier,” and “Manufacturer.” The contents of these fields can be viewed at
the beginning of this section. In the lower part of the page, we will put in
data specific for each individual oligonucleotide. In our case, this includes
“Name of primer,” “Sequence,” “Tm,” “GC %,” “Optimal T of annealing” and the
location of each oligonucleotide. When we submit the data, the oligonucleotide
appears on the “Overview” page. The oligonucleotides are now linked because
their data was put in simultaneously. We can add a newly added oligonucleotide
from the “Overview” page to “Favorites” by selecting the primer and clicking the
“Favorites” icon on the right (<xref rid="fig5-11795972211041983" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>).</p>

    <title>Methods</title>
    <p>OligoPrime implementation is based on three-tier client-server architecture. With
this approach, we have achieved many benefits both in development and production
environments by modularizing the user interface, business logic, and data storage
layers. Thus, simultaneous developments of separate segments were possible, but the
main benefit is that each tier can be deployed on different heterogeneous and
distributed platforms, which is essential for load balancing, reliability, and
availability.</p>
    <sec id="section16-11795972211041983">
      <title>Software tools and packages</title>
      <p>As mentioned above, we divided the application into 3 layers (presentation tier,
application tier, and data tier). On each layer we used technologies and
frameworks suitable for them. Because OligoPrime is a web application, we were
choosing between JavaScript libraries for the presentation layer and decided to
go with React.js<sup><xref rid="bibr13-11795972211041983" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> which is an open-source JavaScript library for building user interfaces
(UI). On the application layer we decided to use Java, which is a robust
programming language, alongside with Java framework Dropwizard,<sup><xref rid="bibr14-11795972211041983" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> used for developing a backend for web applications. For data storage we
used a popular and arguably most advanced open-source relational database PostgreSQL.<sup><xref rid="bibr15-11795972211041983" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup></p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="section17-11795972211041983">
      <title>Back end implementation</title>
      <p>Core architectural style used in our backend application is representational
state transfer (REST), which is providing resources addressable through uniform
resource locator (URL) addresses, using HTTP (Hyper Text Transfer Protocol) to
transfer files. We developed a REST application programming interface (REST
API), a web service to which the frontend of the application is connected to
retrieve and store data from/into the database. For implementation of the API we
used Dropwizard. Dropwizard pulls together necessary, stable and reliable
libraries from the Java ecosystem that allows faster and more robust
development. Dropwizard also includes a jDBI (Java Database Interface) module
for convenient and idiomatic interaction with relational databases
<italic toggle="yes">via</italic> SQL (Structured Query Language). We applied jDBI to
connect our backend application to the database.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="section18-11795972211041983">
      <title>Front end implementation</title>
      <p>The key framework used in our frontend application is React.js, JavaScript
library for building user interfaces. Because we wanted the web application to
feel like a native application, we created a single-page application (SPA) using
the React Router<sup><xref rid="bibr16-11795972211041983" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> library, which is already integrated into React.js and is ready to use
straight out of the box. The biggest benefit, in contrast to traditional
websites, is Client-side rendering, which handles the routing dynamically
without refreshing the page every time a user requests a different route.
Meaning that navigating an SPA does not involve going to an entirely new page,
but instead the whole application lives inside the browser and interfaces with
our backend application <italic toggle="yes">via</italic> RESTful API to retrieve or send
data. While building user interfaces, it is essential to also consider user
experience (UX). For our web application, we used React.js library Material Design<sup><xref rid="bibr17-11795972211041983" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> for fast development and uniform design. Material Design consists of
components which are user friendly and intuitive, and we integrated them into
our application.</p>

      <p>As previously mentioned, we used the three-tier architecture with each layer
having its own application. For each application (backend and frontend), we

    <title>Discussion and Conclusions</title>
    <p>Previously, laboratory reagents could be successfully managed using laboratory
records on paper or using one of the general-purpose spreadsheet tools. However,
with the growing number of techniques and necessary reagents, this is no longer the
case. It is now clear that implementing automated systems of electronic records will
simplify experimental work and will ensure the successful running of research
laboratories. An example of such a tool is OligoPrime, a software dedicated for
specific use: management and tracking of oligonucleotides. OligoPrime is free,
straightforward, and easy-to-use, and is intended for use in small to medium-sized
laboratories. It supports a transparent view of the stored oligonucleotides, their
quantities, date of order/purchase, and history of their use. Furthermore, the
software can be helpful when using both PCR and non-PCR techniques, such as
site-specific mutagenesis or in situ hybridization, since the oligonucleotide data
include information specific for most wide-spread techniques used in a laboratory
setting. What distinguishes OligoPrime from the other 2 freely available solutions
LabStoRe and OpenFreezer, is that while they are broadly oriented to laboratory
reagents, in general, OligoPrime is dedicated to oligonucleotide management only.
Moreover, even though the proposed software can be used directly out-of-the-box, its
code is freely available, which means that its potential users can adapt its
functionality according to their own needs.</p>
    <p>Presently, OligoPrime has already been successfully applied in the laboratories of
the Medical Centre for Molecular Biology, Institute of Biochemistry and Molecular
Genetics at the Faculty of Medicine, University of Ljubljana. However, due to its
simplicity of use and affordability, we believe that OligoPrime will be of interest
to researchers of different fields of biological and biomedical research. The
OligoPrime software will provide a foundation for automatization of oligonucleotide
management and tracking with minimal human input.</p>
