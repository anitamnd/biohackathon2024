      <p id="Par1">Data independent acquisition (DIA) mass spectrometry is a powerful technique that is improving the reproducibility and throughput of proteomics studies. Here, we introduce an experimental workflow that uses this technique to construct chromatogram libraries that capture fragment ion chromatographic peak shape and retention time for every detectable peptide in a proteomics experiment. These coordinates calibrate protein databases or spectrum libraries to a specific mass spectrometer and chromatography setup, facilitating DIA-only pipelines and the reuse of global resource libraries. We also present EncyclopeDIA, a software tool for generating and searching chromatogram libraries, and demonstrate the performance of our workflow by quantifying proteins in human and yeast cells. We find that by exploiting calibrated retention time and fragmentation specificity in chromatogram libraries, EncyclopeDIA can detect 20–25% more peptides from DIA experiments than with data dependent acquisition-based spectrum libraries alone.</p>

    <title>Introduction</title>
    <p id="Par3">Over the past two decades the continued refinement of proteomics methods using liquid chromatography (LC) coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) has enabled a deeper understanding of human biology and disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Recently data independent acquisition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup> (DIA), in which the mass spectrometer systematically acquires MS/MS spectra irrespective of whether or not a precursor signal is detected, has emerged as a powerful alternative approach to data dependent acquisition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup> (DDA) for proteomics experiments. In current DIA workflows, instrument cycle is structured such that the same MS/MS spectrum window is collected every 1–5 s, enabling quantitative measurements using fragment ions instead of precursor ions. This approach produces data analogous to targeted parallel reaction monitoring (PRM), except instead of targeting specific peptides, quantitative data is acquired across a predefined mass to charge (<italic>m/z</italic>) range. One trade-off is that to cover the <italic>m/z</italic> space where the majority of peptides exist, the mass spectrometer must be tuned to produce MS/MS spectra with wide precursor isolation windows that often contain multiple peptides at the same time. These additional peptides produce interfering fragment ions, and database search engines for DDA that rely on a precursor isolation window of at most a few daltons can struggle to detect the signal for a particular peptide from that background interference. The PAcIFIC approach<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup> attempts to overcome this difficulty by using multiple gas-phase fractionated injections of the same sample to increase precursor isolation at the cost of both sample and instrument time.</p>
    <p id="Par4">Spectrum-centric tools<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup> attempt to deconvolve peptide signals from DIA data by time aligning elution peaks for both fragment and precursor ions. In contrast, peptide-centric tools analyze DIA measurements to look for individual peptides across all spectra in a precursor isolation window. Spectrum library search tools for DIA data<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup> use fragmentation patterns and relative retention times from previously collected DDA data. Other tools such as PECAN<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup> query DIA data using just peptide sequences and their predicted fragmentation pattern without requiring a spectrum library. While library searching can achieve better sensitivity than PECAN, the approach is limited to detecting only analytes represented in the library. In addition, the quality of library-based detections is only as strong as the quality of the library itself. Because mapping fragmentation patterns and retention times across instruments and platforms is difficult, many researchers prefer to simultaneously acquire both DDA and DIA data from their samples<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. While this implicitly increases the acquisition time and sample consumption, it becomes possible to detect peptides using the DDA data while making peptide quantitation measurements using the DIA data. However, detection sensitivity is inherently limited to that of the DDA data.</p>
    <p id="Par5">Typically tens to hundreds of biological samples are processed and analyzed using LC-MS/MS in quantitative proteomics experiments. The regularity of DIA allows researchers to make peptide detections in one sample and transfer those detections to other samples<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Here, we extrapolate this concept by collecting certain runs where data acquisition is tuned to improve peptide detection rates, while collecting other runs with a focus on quantification accuracy and throughput. These runs can be searched using either a typical DDA spectrum library-based workflow or a pure DIA workflow using PECAN, or spectrum-centric search methods based on DIA-Umpire<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup> or Spectronaut Pulsar. Results from runs dedicated to peptide detection are formed into a DIA-based chromatogram library. In a chromatogram library, we catalog retention time, precursor mass, peptide fragmentation patterns, and known interferences that identify each peptide on our instrumentation within a specific sample matrix. Furthermore, we report the development EncyclopeDIA, a library search engine that takes advantage of chromatogram libraries, and we demonstrate a substantial gain in sensitivity over typical DIA and DDA workflows. This tool is instrument vendor neutral and available as an open source project with both a GUI and command line interface.</p>

      <title>The EncyclopeDIA workflow</title>
      <p id="Par6">EncyclopeDIA is comprised of several algorithms for DIA data analysis (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>) that can search for peptides using either DDA-based spectrum libraries or DIA-based chromatogram libraries. In addition, the EncyclopeDIA executable contains the Walnut search engine, which is a performance optimized re-implementation of the PECAN algorithm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup> to search protein sequence FASTA databases (see Supplementary Note <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref> for further details). The algorithms in the EncyclopeDIA workflow are described in full detail in the Methods section. Briefly, the EncyclopeDIA workflow starts with reading raw MS/MS data in mzML files into an SQLite database designed for querying fragment spectra across precursor isolation windows. If fragment spectra are collected using overlapping windows, they are deconvoluted on the fly during file reading. Libraries are read as DLIB (DDA-based spectrum libraries) or ELIB (DIA-based chromatogram libraries). EncyclopeDIA determines the highest scoring retention time point corresponding to each library spectrum (as well as a paired reverse sequence decoy) using a scoring system modeled after the X!Tandem HyperScore<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Fifteen auxiliary match features (not based on retention time) are calculated at this time point. These features are aggregated and submitted to Percolator 3.1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>, a semi-supervised SVM algorithm for interpreting target/decoy peptide detections, for a first pass validation. EncyclopeDIA generates a retention time model from peptides detected at 1% FDR using a non-parametric kernel density estimation algorithm that follows the density mode across time. Any target or decoy peptide in the feature set that does not match the retention time model is reconsidered up to five times until we find a highest scoring retention time point that matches the model. The retention time-curated feature sets are submitted to Percolator for final pass validation at 1% peptide FDR.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>An approach for quantifying peptides with chromatogram libraries. <bold>a</bold> The chromatogram library generation workflow. Briefly, in addition to collecting wide-window DIA experiments on each quantitative replicate, a pool containing peptides from every condition is measured using several staggered narrow-window DIA experiments. After deconvolution, these narrow-window experiments have 2 m/z precursor isolation, which is analogous to targeted parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) experiments, except effectively targeting every peptide between 400 and 1000 m/z. We detect peptide anchors from these experiments using either EncyclopeDIA (searching a DDA spectrum library) or PECAN/Walnut (using a protein database) and chromatographic data about each peptide is stored in a chromatogram library with retention times, peak shape, fragment ion intensities, and known interferences tuned specifically for the LC/MS/MS setup. EncyclopeDIA then uses these precise coordinates for m/z, time, and intensity to detect peptides in the quantitative samples. <bold>b</bold> The EncyclopeDIA algorithmic workflow for searching spectrum and chromatogram libraries. After reading and deconvoluting DIA raw files, EncyclopeDIA calculates several retention time independent feature scores for each peptide that are amalgamated and FDR corrected with Percolator. Using high confidence peptide detections, EncyclopeDIA retention time aligns detections to the library, determines the retention time accuracy, and reconsiders outliers. After a second FDR correction with Percolator, EncyclopeDIA autonomously picks fragment ion transitions that fit each non-parametrically calculated peak shape and quantifies peptides using these ions</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="41467_2018_7454_Fig1_HTML" id="d29e375"/></fig></p>

      <title>Chromatogram library generation</title>
      <p id="Par7">Gas-phase fractionated DIA uses multiple injections with data acquisition methods that are tiled to span different precursor isolation windows<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. With modern instrumentation it is possible to collect near proteome-wide DIA measurements with equivalently narrow precursor isolation to DDA using as few as six gas-phase fractionated injections. Previously we have shown that this type of DIA experiment can produce substantially richer peptide detection lists than similarly acquired DDA experiments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. In addition, it is much easier to detect low abundance peptides from gas-phase fractionated DIA using library search engines or database search engines than when searching wide-window DIA runs, which attempt to collect near proteome-wide measurements with a single injection. However, this strategy is impractical in both total instrumentation time and sample requirements to be performed for large quantitative experiments. We propose an approach to collecting DIA data using chromatogram libraries that leverages the deep sampling of gas-phase fractionated DIA while still maintaining high throughput (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>).</p>
      <p id="Par8">In addition to collecting wide-window DIA experiments of each biological sample, we also collect narrow-window gas-phase fractionated DIA runs of pooled subaliquots of those samples. We detect peptides from the resulting narrow precursor isolation windows using library search engines (such as EncyclopeDIA) or DIA-specific database search engines (such as Walnut). To generate a chromatogram library, we catalog the retention time, peak shape, fragmentation patterns, and known interferences of detected peptides filtered to a 1% global peptide FDR. With DIA experiments we expect interference, so rather than removing impure library spectra and spectra that contain multiple peptides<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>, we simply only retain +1H and +2H fragment ions for expected B-type and Y-type ions. Due to gas-phase fractionated tiling, each peptide is only represented in the narrow-window data once, which eliminates the need for spectrum averaging<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup> or best spectrum selection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup> typically used by DDA-based library curation tools. In the chromatogram library for each peptide we retain only the highest scoring charge state (as determined by Percolator) to limit the search space.</p>
      <p id="Par9">Chromatogram libraries implicitly contain a subset of the peptides found in DDA-based spectrum libraries, but the peptides they do contain have chromatographic and fragmentation data calibrated specifically to DIA experiments on that instrumentation platform. One limitation is that peptides that cannot be detected in narrow-window DIA runs of the pooled sample will not be searched for in subsequent runs. We feel that very few quantitatively reliable peptides will be detectable in the wide-window data that are not also detectable in the narrow data and that the smaller search space represented by chromatogram libraries can increase the significance of peptide detections<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. In cases where rare variants are important to a study or if samples are likely to represent very disparate proteomes, it may also be possible generate chromatogram libraries from multiple batches of narrow-window acquisitions from different sample pools.</p>
      <p id="Par10">In this study we generated a chromatogram library using peptides derived from HeLa S3 cell lysates. First we used Skyline to assemble a HeLa-specific DDA-based spectrum library containing 166.4k unique peptides (representing 9947 protein groups) from 39 raw files acquired for other experiments. These files were collected from SCX and high-pH reverse phase fractions acquired with a Thermo Q Exactive tandem mass spectrometer using multiple HPLC gradients to vary the local peptide matrix. Using this library as a starting point, we constructed a chromatogram library from six gas-phase fractionated DIA runs with 52 overlapping 4 m/z-wide windows. We collected these runs with a Thermo Q-Exactive HF tandem mass spectrometer using a 90 min linear gradient. After overlap deconvolution, these experiments produced 300 2 m/z-wide windows, which is analogous to if we had conducted targeted PRM acquisition except that we are targeting all precursors between 400.43 and 1000.70 m/z. Following the scheme in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>, we searched the narrow-window data against a HeLa-specific DDA spectrum library (166k unique peptides), producing a chromatogram library containing 99.6k unique peptides, and an analogous search against the Pan-Human spectrum library<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup> (159k unique peptides) producing a chromatogram library containing 91.1k unique peptides. We also produced a third library containing 53.2k unique peptides using Walnut to detect peptides directly from the narrow-window DIA data using a Uniprot Human FASTA database. The difference in chromatogram library size by searching DDA-based spectrum libraries with EncyclopeDIA or a FASTA database (1143k unique +2H/+3H tryptic peptides) with Walnut is in part because the spectrum library represents a more targeted search space, while additionally including expected post-translationally modified (oxidized and acetylated) peptides, as well as peptides with multiple missed cleavages and expected +4H/+5H/+6H peptides.</p>

      <title>Comparison of spectrum and chromatogram library searches</title>
      <p id="Par11">We evaluated the chromatogram library strategy using peptides derived from a HeLa S3 cell lysate as a representative high-complexity proteome. In addition to generating the library, we also collected triplicate wide-window DIA runs with 52 overlapping 24 m/z-wide windows from the same sample using the same 90 min linear gradient. We found an average of 72.3k peptides when searching against the chromatogram library constructed using a HeLa-specific DDA-based spectrum library. Corroborating experiments from other groups<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>, with DIA we can detect up to 2x more peptides than our benchmark top-20 DDA experiments (Supplementary Figure <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). While Bruderer et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup> found a significant performance drop when comparing results from previously acquired global libraries (such as the Pan-Human library<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>) to experiment-specific DDA spectrum libraries, we did not find a similar drop when searching chromatogram libraries generated from the Pan-Human library. This result indicates that our approach enables the reuse of previously acquired global libraries intended as community standards without requiring generating experiment-specific DDA libraries. In a sense, chromatogram libraries provide a calibration step that substitutes the data in DDA spectrum libraries or fragmentation models in database search engines for DIA-specific fragmentation and HPLC/column-specific retention times. Despite this increased detection rate, we still find that DIA produces more consistent results compared to DDA, as indicated by the overlap in peptide detections between triplicate injections (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b, c</xref>). This agrees with previous reports that DIA quantification is both more uniform<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup> and more accurate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. While other library search tools such as Skyline<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup> cannot make use of all chromatogram library features, we find that Skyline still produces higher detection rates when searching chromatogram libraries as compared to both the HeLa-specific and Pan-Human DDA-based spectrum libraries (Supplementary Figure <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Untargeted peptide detections using DDA and DIA.

      <p id="Par12">We also evaluated the creation of chromatogram libraries using a DIA-only workflow. Using this approach, we were able to detect an average of 20.6k peptides from the Uniprot Human FASTA database using Walnut, or approximately 0.6× of the detections found by top-20 DDA. In contrast, we found an average of 47.8k peptides (2.3× increase) when we searched the Walnut-based chromatogram library with EncyclopeDIA (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>), or approximately 1.4× more than DDA. These results agree with previous work<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup> showing that Pecan does not perform as well as DDA when searching wide-window runs, but typically outperforms DDA when searching gas-phase fractionated runs. Interestingly, the DIA-only workflow found nearly an equal number of peptides compared to searching the 39 injection HeLa-specific DDA-based spectrum library, while requiring only an additional six library-building injections. Confirming these results, we performed the same analysis using a yeast cell lysate and found similar improvement rates when comparing Walnut versus EncyclopeDIA using a Walnut-based chromatogram library (2.2× increase, Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref>), or 1.2× more than top-20 DDA. Here we observe more modest gains over DDA experiments, which likely reflects the lowered proteomic complexity of yeast versus human cells and is echoed in the tight overlap (86%) between triplicate DIA injections versus DDA (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2e, f</xref>). As is possible with any computational strategy that incorporates machine learning, we were concerned with the potential for overfitting that might manifest in over exaggerated peptide detection rates. To answer this question we searched the HeLa wide-window DIA data using the yeast chromatogram library (and vice versa) to verify that we see a negative result when searching the wrong library. As expected this result (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a, d</xref>) produced zero peptide detections that passed a 1% peptide FDR threshold.</p>
      <p id="Par13">We also find that DIA analysis with chromatogram libraries is more sensitive at detecting low abundance proteins at a 1% protein FDR.

In this study we replicated strain and growing conditions as closely as possible to use their measurements as an independent benchmark. While both DDA and DIA confidently detect the majority of proteins at levels above 10<sup>4</sup> copies per cell, DIA outperforms DDA by 49% with proteins estimated to have between 10<sup>3</sup> and 10<sup>4</sup> copies per cell and by 2× with proteins estimated between 10<sup>2</sup> and 10<sup>3</sup> copies per cell (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>).<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>Protein detection rates scale with abundance.

      <title>Retention time and fragmentation pattern calibration</title>
      <p id="Par14">One of the primary reasons on-column chromatogram libraries improve performance is that they exploit within batch retention time reproducibility. Accurate retention time filtering is an important consideration when analyzing high-complexity proteomes with DIA, and virtually all DIA library search engines make use of this data. Retention times in aggregate spectrum libraries are typically derived by linearly interpolating multiple DDA data sets to a known calibration space (such as that defined by the iRT standard<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>), which enables retention times to be comparable from run to run, or even across platforms. However, these measurements usually contain some wobble due to errors introduced by assuming a linear fit. Bruderer et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup> improve upon this strategy with high-precision iRT fitting using a non-parametric curve fitting approach for hundreds or thousands of peptides, and EncyclopeDIA uses an analogous kernel density estimation approach to fit retention times between wide-window DIA results and retention times in libraries. Figure <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref> shows a typical spread of retention times in EncyclopeDIA detected peptides using a DDA spectrum library, which is 95% accurate within a spread of 5.1 min (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c</xref>). In comparison, Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref> shows the typical spread of retention times in the chromatogram library, which is 95% accurate within 21 s (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4d</xref>). This tightening of retention time accuracy is due to the fact that chromatogram libraries are collected on the same column as the wide-window acquisitions. Even if efforts are made to keep packing material, length, and gradient consistent, the dramatic gains in retention time accuracy with chromatogram libraries reflect variations that are difficult to control for, including packing speeds, pressures, and pulled tip orifice shapes. In addition, we find that DDA fragmentation patterns (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4e</xref>) are often somewhat different than those collected in DIA experiments (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4f</xref>). While DDA instrument methods usually tune MS/MS collision energies to the precursor charge and mass, some of this variation is likely due to fixed assumptions in charge states and precursor masses required by DIA methods when multiple precursors must be fragmented at the same time. These two factors appear to have relatively equal and orthogonal improvements over searching DDA spectrum libraries (Supplementary Figure <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>).<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><p>Retention time and fragmentation accuracy of spectrum and chromatogram libraries.

      <p id="Par15">A subtle issue with DIA library searching when using generalized spectrum libraries is that many peptides generate the same fragment ions, either because of sequence variation, paralogs, or modified forms. While EncyclopeDIA attempts to control for this using background ion distributions to predict interference likelihoods, sequence variation due to homology or single nucleotide polymorphisms can be unintentionally detected as the wrong peptide sequence in certain circumstances. For example, a sequence variation of a valine to an isoleucine is relatively common, and the mass shift of a methyl group (+14/Z) will often place both peptides inside the same precursor isolation window when Z is 2 or greater. Using chromatogram libraries can provide some protection against these issues because the initial searches to generate the libraries are performed using narrow (2 m/z) precursor mass windows, and subsequent wide-window searches benefit from precise retention time filtering. Additionally, EncyclopeDIA requires at least 25% of the primary score to come from ions that indicate the modified form to detect modified peptides when modified/unmodified peptide pairs fall in the same precursor isolation window (e.g., methionine oxidation).</p>

      <title>Peptide and protein quantitation</title>
      <p id="Par16">Automated interference removal is an important aspect to analyzing wide-window DIA data. SWATHProphet<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup> attempts to solve this by comparing relative fragment intensities in spectrum libraries to those found in the DIA data, while mapDIA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup> computes the correlation between every pair of fragment ions to identify outliers. We present an algorithm for automated transition refinement to remove fragment ion interference and alleviate the need for manual curation (see Methods section for further details). In short, after unit area normalizing all transitions assigned to a single peptide (Supplementary Figure <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4a</xref>), we determine the shape of the peak as the median normalized intensity at each retention time point (Supplementary Figure <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4b</xref>). Transitions that match this peak shape with Pearson’s correlation scores &gt; 0.9 are considered quantitative (Supplementary Figure <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4c</xref>). We find that over 81% of peptides can be quantified with at least three transitions (Supplementary Figure <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5a</xref>) and that the transitions picked by our approach produce reproducible quantitative measurements between technical replicates in HeLa experiments (Supplementary Figure <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5b</xref> and c).</p>
      <p id="Par17">Combining peptide detections across multiple samples often increases false discoveries because false detections are usually found only in individual runs. To combat this, we recalculate global peptide FDR across all experiments in a study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup> with Percolator and generate parsimonious protein detection lists that are also filtered to a 1% global protein FDR. We use cross-sample retention time alignment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup> to help quantify peptides that are missing in specific samples. After filtering peptides based on coefficient of variance and measurement consistency, we estimate protein quantities by summing fragment ion intensities across only sequence-unique peptides assigned to those proteins. Using a similar strategy to LFQbench<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>, we validated the quantitative accuracy of protein-level measurements with triplicate experiments of five different mixtures of yeast and HeLa proteomes at expected concentrations (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). In these mixtures we detected 2563 yeast proteins that passed a 1% global protein FDR threshold. Of these, we found that 2018 yeast proteins produced at least three quantitative transition ions without interference, had &lt;20% study-wide CVs, and were measured in every replicate in pure yeast experiments. While at first these detection and quantification criteria may seem stringent compared to typical proteomics experiments, narrowing our focus to confident measurements produced quantitative ratios that closely adhered to the expected mixture ratios, especially with regards to small fold changes. We employed these methods and filtering criteria to study the effect of serum starvation in human cells.<fig id="Fig5"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption><p>Quantitative accuracy in mixed proteomes. <bold>a</bold> Quantitative ratios of 2018 yeast proteins spiked into a HeLa background at five different concentrations and measured in triplicate.

      <title>Global proteomic changes from serum starvation</title>
      <p id="Par18">Serum starvation is a common step in signal transduction studies as serum contains several cytokines and growth factors that can confound signaling levels. It is commonly thought that serum starvation suppresses basal activity by reducing signaling activity that effectively resets cells to G0/G1 resting phase<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>, although more recent experiments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup> suggest otherwise. Serum starvation protocols vary widely from 2 to 24 h, and this time frame is long enough to produce changes in protein levels resulting from transcriptional regulation. These changes are a source of variation that can have serious consequences when comparing between studies.</p>
      <p id="Par19">We designed a DIA quantitative experiment to map how the proteome of HeLa cells changes in response to serum starvation over time. We selected six starvation times to match commonly used protocols and generated six biological replicates per condition. We collected all the DIA runs with the same mass spectrometer and chromatographic conditions. Of the 99.6k unique peptides in our chromatogram library, we recapitulated 93.5k unique peptides from 6,802 protein groups at a 1% global protein FDR threshold. As above, 48.6k peptides (from 5,781 protein groups) produced at least three quantitative transition ions without interference, had &lt;20% study-wide CVs, and were measured in every replicate of at least one time point.</p>
      <p id="Par20">Using EDGE<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup> we found 1097 protein groups in the HeLa proteome that changed significantly over time at a <italic>q</italic>-value &lt; 0.01 (Supplementary Data <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">1</xref>). The temporal starvation profiles of these proteins fell into five groups (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>) where the majority changing proteins increased in abundance. Several of these proteins are involved in expected pathways such as cell cycle regulation (GO enrichment FDR = 0.011), metabolism (GO enrichment FDR = 0.011), and ubiquitination regulation (GO enrichment FDR = 0.018). One advantage of our method is that quantitation is performed by summing peaks from several low interference fragment ions, which allows us to accurately quantify small changes. For example, we found that all eight of the observed components of the nuclear proteasome increased significantly by ~25% (Supplementary Figure <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6</xref>), which indicates nuclear maintenance consistent with G0/G1 resting phase.<fig id="Fig6"><label>Fig. 6</label><caption><p>Protein quantification changes following serum starvation. <bold>a</bold> Heatmap of 1097 proteins found to be quantitatively changing at a <italic>q</italic>-value &lt; 0.01 in HeLa.

      <p id="Par21">We also observed significant regulation of the abundance of 39 kinases and 7 phosphatases (Supplementary Figure <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">7</xref>). In particular, we found that EGFR levels increased by 30% over a 24 h serum starvation time course (Supplementary Figure <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">8</xref>), effectively sensitizing HeLa to the growth factor EGF. To confirm these experiments, we monitored relative changes in the phosphoproteome of four HeLa biological replicates after EGF stimulation at two common serum starvation times: 4 and 16 h. We found that while phosphopeptide measurements at both time points directionally agreed, some phosphopeptide responses to EGF were stronger when cells were starved for 16 h compared to when starving for only 4 h (Supplementary Figure <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">9</xref>). This increase corroborated our observation that EGFR protein levels increased from 4 to 16 h of starvation. These protein and phosphopeptide-level changes underline a potentially significant source of variation when comparing phosphorylation signaling studies.</p>

    <title>Discussion</title>
    <p id="Par22">We have demonstrated an experimental strategy that enables comprehensive detection of peptides and proteins using chromatogram libraries. These libraries can be seeded either with a DDA spectrum library or generated in a DIA-only mode using Walnut for initial peptide searches. Finally, we showed that at the cost of only six additional narrow-window DIA runs, both of these strategies are more sensitive and reproducible relative to comparable DDA experiments. While this approach may be unrealistic for one-off experiments, we feel that in most quantitative proteomics studies the addition of these runs are a minor cost in exchange for a significant increase in sensitivity.</p>
    <p id="Par23">One important limitation of our method is that each chromatogram library is tuned for a specific mass spectrometer and chromatographic set up. In particular, we have observed that with the hand-pulled and packed columns used here, there is significant retention time variation between replicates run on different columns, even if effort is made to ensure column consistency. We hypothesize that minor variations in packing speeds, packing pressures, tip shapes, and column lengths can affect elution times and even peptide retention time ordering. This issue may be mitigated by acquiring a new library after a column change and retention time aligning the libraries to ensure consistency. Future work remains to model these minor retention time shifts.</p>
    <p id="Par24">Another important consideration is library quality. All library searching strategies assume that entries in the library are correctly identified and consequently false positives in the library can be propagated as true positives by target/decoy analysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. This concern is potentially compounded in our approach, which can include up to two levels of library creation. Further work is necessary to improve FDR estimates for library searching in DIA experiments. In the meantime, we feel orthogonal filtering strategies are necessary to maintain conservative peptide detection lists. In addition to retention time fitting and 1% protein-level FDR filtering, in this work we require a minimum of three interference-free transitions and impose stringent measurement reproducibility requirements for peptides to be considered quantitative.</p>
    <p id="Par25">We have observed a complementarity of DDA and DIA through the use of building spectrum libraries to seed chromatogram libraries. Here the stochasticity of DDA sampling when coupled with offline peptide separation methods such as SCX fractionation can be exploited as a benefit in that only one observation of a peptide is necessary for inclusion in the library. With human samples, libraries constructed using previously recorded retention times and fragmentation patterns contained nearly twice the peptides as those constructed without prior knowledge. However, PECAN/Walnut can build on that knowledge by detecting peptide sequence variants illuminated by whole exome sequencing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>, and we are exploring ways of generating chromatogram libraries that incorporate both pieces of data.</p>

Six cell culture replicates were grown to approximately a 50% density in 6-well plates prior to FBS starvation staggered for 24, 16, 8, 4, 2, and 0 h (one time point in each well, one plate per replicate). At the 0 h time point cells were quickly washed three times with refrigerated phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and immediately flash frozen with liquid nitrogen. Frozen cells were lysed in a buffer of 9 M urea, 50 mM Tris (pH 8), 75 mM NaCl, and a cocktail of protease inhibitors (Roche Complete-mini EDTA-free). After scraping, cells were subjected to 2 × 30 s of probe sonication, 20 min of incubation on ice, followed by 10 min of centrifugation at 21,000 × <italic>g</italic> and 4 °C. The protein content of the supernatant was estimated using BCA. The proteins were reduced with 5 mM dithiothreitol for 30 min at 55 °C, alkylated with 10 mM iodoacetamide in the dark for 30 min at room temperature, and quenched with an additional 5 mM dithiothreitol for 15 min at room temperature. The proteins were diluted to 1.8 M urea and then digested with sequencing grade trypsin (Pierce) at a 1:50 enzyme to substrate ratio for 12 h at 37 °C. The digestion was quenched by adding 10% trifluoroacetic acid to achieve approximately pH 2. Resulting peptides were desalted with 100 mg tC18 SepPak cartridges (Waters) using vendor-provided protocols and dried with vacuum centrifugation. Peptides were brought to 1 μg/3 μl in 0.1% formic acid (buffer A) prior to mass spectrometry acquisition. For the reproducibility experiments and to build a chromatogram library we pooled aliquots from all six time points for three of the replicates to ensure that the pool contained virtually every peptide present in the individual time points.</p>
      <p id="Par27">With the phosphoproteomics experiment, four replicates were performed for each of the four conditions: 20 min EGF (100 ng/ml) or PBS stimulation following 4 h starvation, and 20 min EGF/PBS stimulation following 16 h starvation. Sample generation and processing was performed in the same fashion with the following exceptions: (1) in addition to protease inhibitors, a cocktail of phosphatase inhibitors (50 mM NaF, 50 mM β-glycerophosphate, 10 mM pyrophosphate, and 1 mM orthovanadate) was also added to the lysis buffer, (2) proteins were digested for 14 h, and 3) phosphopeptides were enriched using immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) using Fe-NTA magnetic agarose beads (Cube Biotech). Enrichment was performed with a KingFisher Flex robot (Thermo Scientific), which incubated peptides with 150 μl 5% bead slurry in 80% acetonitrile, 0.1% TFA for 30 min, washed them three times with the same solution, and eluted them with 60 μl 50% acetonitrile:1% NH<sub>4</sub>OH. Phosphopeptides were then acidified with 10% formic acid and dried. Phosphopeptides were brought to 1 μg/3 μl in 0.1% formic acid assuming a 1:100 reduction in peptide abundance from the IMAC enrichment.

      <p id="Par35">Further validation of the HeLa replicate dataset was performed using Skyline-daily version 4.1.1.18151. Precursors were filtered between the isolated m/z range of 388.4 to 1000.7 with a minimum of 6 measurable fragment y-ion and b-ion (charge 1 or 2) between 300 and 2000 m/z, not including y1, y2, b1, or b2. The fragment ions with the six most intense peaks from the libraries within these limits were chosen along with the first three precursor isotopes to be extracted from MS1, both set to extract within 10 ppm mass error from the centroided (and demultiplexed for MS/MS) spectra. Two iRT libraries were built (for the HeLa-specific DDA library and the HeLa-specific chromatogram library, respectively) using 73 reliably detected peptides were chosen as iRT library anchors across the retention time range. Chromatogram extraction was set to apply to all spectra within 10 min of predicted retention times using these iRT libraries. A mProphet<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup> model was trained using the target/decoy strategy (with the “Retention time difference squared” excluded) and applied without any run-to-run alignment.

      <title>Overlapping DIA deconvolution</title>
      <p id="Par36">When using the overlapping DIA scheme, every spectrum in the entire raw file must be deconvoluted. In an effort to maintain consistency between analysis techniques, we used MSConvert to deconvolute RAW files in this study. However, we have also implemented a simple deconvolution algorithm in EncyclopeDIA that can be performed on-the-fly while reading spectra in a narrow I/O buffer. In a DIA data set, at each cycle (<italic>T</italic>) every MS/MS spectrum (<italic>S</italic><sub><italic>Ti</italic></sub>) comprises fragments from precursors within the precursor isolation window (<italic>i</italic>). Spectra in consecutive half cycles are overlapped by 50%, such that precursors from the lower 50% of the window in MS/MS spectrum <italic>S</italic><sub><italic>Ti</italic></sub> should also be present in the previous/next half cycles lower offset spectra (<italic>S</italic><sub><italic>(T-1)(i-1)</italic></sub> and <italic>S</italic><sub><italic>(T+1)(i-1)</italic></sub>) while precursors from the upper 50% of the window should also be present in the corresponding upper offset spectra (<italic>S</italic><sub><italic>(T-1)(i+1)</italic></sub> and <italic>S</italic><sub><italic>(T+1)(i+1)</italic></sub>). We divide these windows into two bins and attempt to determine which fragments were derived from precursors in the upper half or the lower half using previous and next half cycles. Fragment ions that are found exclusively on the lower previous/next spectra (<italic>S</italic><sub><italic>(T-1)(i-1)</italic></sub> and <italic>S</italic><sub><italic>(T+1)(i-1)</italic></sub>) are assigned to the lower bin, while those found exclusively in the upper previous/next spectra (<italic>S</italic><sub><italic>(T-1)(i+1)</italic></sub> and <italic>S</italic><sub><italic>(T+1)(i+1)</italic></sub>) are assigned to the upper bin. Ions that are found in both sets of spectra are assigned proportionally to each bin where the proportion is set to the summed peak intensity for both spectra, e.g.: (<italic>S</italic><sub><italic>(T-1)(i-1)</italic></sub> <italic>+</italic> <italic>S</italic><sub><italic>(T+1)(i-1)</italic></sub>) / (<italic>S</italic><sub><italic>(T-1)(i-1)</italic></sub> <italic>+</italic> <italic>S</italic><sub><italic>(T+1)(i-1)</italic></sub> + <italic>S</italic><sub><italic>(T-1)(i+1)</italic></sub> <italic>+</italic> <italic>S</italic><sub><italic>(T+1)(i+1)</italic></sub>) for the lower bin. Peaks that are found in none of the previous and next overlapping spectra are assumed to be noise. New spectra are built from the deconvoluted peaks in both the lower and upper bins. Since this algorithm only needs to consider three half cycles at a time, deconvolution can happen quickly and in memory, with minimal impact on file reading speeds.</p>

      <title>Decoy library entries</title>
      <p id="Par37">A decoy library entry is created for every target library entry. To generate a decoy, first the target peptide sequence (except for digestion enzyme-specific termini) is reversed, ensuring that the decoy maintains its appearance as a tryptic peptide. Then fragment ions corresponding to amino acids (B/Y for CID, C/Z/Z + 1 for ETD) or their expected neutral losses due to modifications (e.g. phosphorylation) are calculated for both target and decoy entries. If the precursor charge state is greater than +2, then +2 fragment ions are also considered. Uncommon neutral loss ions such as A-type ions or loss of water or ammonia are not considered to limit the likelihood of false detections. Fragment ions that correspond to target sequence m/zs are transferred to new decoy m/zs such that their ion type and index are kept consistent. Delta mass errors in each fragment ion are also maintained to preserve consistency, and all peaks corresponding to the fragment delta mass window are transferred if the library is collected in profile mode. Ions that cannot be assigned to amino acids (such as those corresponding to precursor ions, background noise or interference) are not used by EncyclopeDIA.</p>

      <title>Ion weighting estimation</title>
      <p id="Par38">While searching, a unique background is calculated for each precursor isolation window using the prevalence of each fragment ion in the library spectra considered for that window (Supplementary Figure <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">12</xref>). This background helps estimate the interference frequency for any given ion and is used to weight some scores. This distribution is calculated as the frequency that any nominal m/z fragment ion (rounded by truncation) appears in entries from the library within the specified precursor window filter. <italic>m/z</italic> frequencies are calculated out to 4000 and a pseudocount is applied to every <italic>m/z</italic> bin to avoid divide by zero frequency errors.</p>

Unlike scoring functions like XCorr in Sequest, the HyperScore does not attempt to account or penalize for ions that do not match the peptide in question, making it ideal for DIA analysis where coeluting peptides are common. The score function is the weighted dot product of the intensities in the acquired spectrum (<italic>I</italic>) and the library spectrum (<italic>P</italic>), weighted by a correlation score vector (<italic>C</italic>), which is discussed in detail in the Chromatogram Library ELIB Generation section. Again, any ions in the library spectrum that do not correspond to the amino acid sequence are not considered in this score.

      <p id="Par40">Sometimes modified peptides (for example, oxidized peptides) are present in the same precursor isolation window as their unmodified forms. Since often these peptides share several fragment ions in common, we require that at least 25% of the score contribution for modified peptides come from ions that exclusively indicate that modification in cases where any of up to four isotopic peaks from the modified/unmodified peptide pairs fall in the same window.</p>

This distribution is stamped at every X/Y coordinate on a 1000 by 1000 grid mapping from the lowest and highest retention times in both the X and Y dimensions. Once the KDE is calculated, the optimal fit is traced using a ridge walking algorithm that traces the mode of the KDE across retention time (Supplementary Figure <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">13</xref>). In this algorithm the highest point in the KDE is identified and the line is fit in increasing retention time by moving to the highest local grid point to the north (increased sample retention time), east (increased library retention time), or northeast. If north and east are both the highest local point, then the line moves to the northeast. This is performed iteratively until the line is fit across the increasing retention time. Then the same ridge walk is performed in decreasing retention time by moving south, west, or southwest. This approach forces a monotonic line (it can never find a negative retention time change) that follows where the most number of X/Y coordinates lie.</p>

      <p id="Par46">Fragment ion interference is common when analyzing wide-window data. While fragment ions that show interference may still be useful for detecting peptides, those ions must be screened prior to quantitation to ensure an accurate measurement. We designed a non-parametric approach to selecting the best ions for quantitation. We first Savizky-Golay smooth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup> the fragment ion chromatograms and then normalize them to have unit integrated intensity. To simplify the smoothing mathematics, we make the assumption that cycle times are consistent within the time frame of a single peak, thus removing the need for interpolation over retention time. After normalization the chromatograms of quantitatively useful ions line up while those of interfered ions will have either higher or lower unit-normalized intensities at different retention times. We calculate the median normalized intensity at each retention time point as an approximation for the peptide peak shape. We then determine peak boundaries by tracing descent of the median peak shape from the maximum normalized intensity on either side of the peak. The boundaries are set to the minimum point at which the median peak trace starts increasing for &gt;2 consecutive spectra or any point where the trace drops to less than 1% of the maximum. At that point we calculate a Pearson’s correlation coefficient for the similarity between each fragment ion chromatogram with that of the median peak shape between those boundaries. Peaks that match with a correlation coefficient of at least 0.9 are considered quantitative, while those that match with coefficients of at least 0.75 are considered useful for detection purposes.</p>
