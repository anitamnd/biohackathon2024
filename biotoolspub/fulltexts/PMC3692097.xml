      <p>The immense increase in availability of genomic scale datasets, such as those provided by the ENCODE and Roadmap Epigenomics projects, presents unprecedented opportunities for individual researchers to pose novel falsifiable biological questions. With this opportunity, however, researchers are faced with the challenge of how to best analyze and interpret their genome-scale datasets. A powerful way of representing genome-scale data is as feature-specific coordinates relative to reference genome assemblies, i.e. as genomic tracks. The Genomic HyperBrowser (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hyperbrowser.uio.no">http://hyperbrowser.uio.no</ext-link>) is an open-ended web server for the analysis of genomic track data. Through the provision of several highly customizable components for processing and statistical analysis of genomic tracks, the HyperBrowser opens for a range of genomic investigations, related to, e.g., gene regulation, disease association or epigenetic modifications of the genome.</p>

    <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
    <p>The immense increase in the production of genomic scale datasets, e.g., through the ENCODE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt342-B1">1</xref>) and Roadmap Epigenomics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt342-B2">2</xref>) projects, poses an unmet challenge in terms of available methodology and tools for analytic investigations. These datasets provide unprecedented opportunities for individual researchers to elucidate particular biological mechanisms. However, analysis of these datasets and their relations to each other typically require development of a range of <italic>ad hoc</italic> scripts for generating, manipulating and analyzing genomic data.</p>
    <p>For a range of organisms, well-established and internationally accepted reference genome assemblies now exist. Using coordinates on such assemblies, data related to particular locations on the genome can be represented in a precise and unambiguous manner. This avoids many previous difficulties in the field, such as confusion due to incompatible gene terminology. A genome-wide collection of coordinates for a particular genomic feature is often referred to as a genome annotation track, or just genomic track. Such genomic tracks can, e.g., refer to the location of genes, binding of transcription factors, methylation of DNA or modification of histones. Genomic tracks not only allow unified visualization and browsing, such as through the UCSC Genome Browser (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt342-B3">3</xref>), but also provide a powerful and unified basis for statistical analysis. The base pair positions of reference genomes serve as coordinates on a line, allowing entities such as genes or epigenetic modifications to be viewed as elements positioned on such a line. A statistical question, posed on the relation between two genome-scale datasets, may then be formulated as a simple question relating such elements. An example is to ask whether points on a reference line as defined by one dataset falls unexpectedly often within segments on the same line as defined by another dataset.</p>
    <p>The Genomic HyperBrowser web server provides a broad suite of functionality for rigorous statistical analysis of genomic data. At the core of the system is a set of statistical analyses, available through a single tool: ‘Analyze genomic tracks’. Descriptive statistics, test statistics and null models are described in terms of well-defined elements along a linear representation of the genome, in the form of genomic tracks. This tool and its underlying methodology has been described in a previous publication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt342-B4">4</xref>), and has since been expanded with tens of new descriptive analyses and hypothesis tests. The statistical analysis is augmented by a collection of data preparation tools that support the processing of genomic data into forms that subsequently allow sophisticated questions to be posed in a simple and intuitive manner. All 42 tools at the server are based on the generic treatment of genomic data as elements along a linear representation of the genome, allowing questions related to different biological application domains to be treated in the same manner. The tools share an underlying analysis code base, which is open-source and tightly integrated with the Galaxy framework (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt342-B5">5</xref>) for handling of web access, users and data. Through the integration with Galaxy, the standard Galaxy tools are also available and can be used together with the HyperBrowser-specific functionality. The HyperBrowser website is free and open to all, and there is no login requirement.</p>
    <p>The Genomic HyperBrowser is designed to be as open-ended as possible: instead of being developed around a few canonical usage scenarios, it provides a core set of abstractions and components that can be used and combined in a myriad of ways to answer precisely formulated biological questions. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkt342-F1">Figure 1</xref> gives a schematic overview of how various tools at the HyperBrowser server can be used as part of a full analysis scenario.
<fig id="gkt342-F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Schematic overview of tool categories available at the Genomic HyperBrowser server. The figure indicates at which points of a typical analysis scenario the various tools may be of use, from the initial collection and preparation of data, through customization of data to match the analysis, to the statistical evaluation of a biological hypothesis. For boxes representing several tools, the precise list of tools can be found under the corresponding header in the table that is referred to (for instance, the two tools represented by the ‘Format and convert’ box can be found under the heading ‘Format and convert tracks’ of <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkt342-T3">Table 3</xref>).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gkt342f1p"/></fig></p>

    <title>ANALYSIS OF GENOMIC TRACKS</title>
    <p>A large collection of analytical functionality is available through the tool ‘Analyze genomic tracks’ under the ‘HyperBrowser analysis’ menu. This opens for a range of genomic investigations that query characteristics of individual tracks or relations between pairs of tracks along the genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt342-B4">4</xref>). After selecting one or a pair of tracks, the analysis of interest can be selected among a set of analyses deemed meaningful based on the type of track(s) selected. For instance, selecting two tracks of segments (intervals) along the genome (e.g. two tracks of ChIP-seq peak regions, without any values associated with the peaks) will allow questions related to co-localization (overlap). On the other hand, selecting two tracks of values per base pair along the genome (e.g. two tracks of bp-level ChIP-seq signal values for every position of the genome) will allow questions related to correlation of values. The HyperBrowser system distinguishes between 15 types of tracks at the generic level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt342-B6">6</xref>), where the most widespread types are tracks of points and segments.</p>
    <p>Analyses are divided into descriptive statistics (such as counts, base pair coverage and averages) and hypothesis tests (such as whether two tracks are overlapping more than expected by chance). A total of 56 descriptive statistics and 20 hypothesis tests are available, depending on the type of tracks (listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkt342-T1">Table 1</xref>). Each hypothesis test may be seen as a generic genomic question that can be parameterized in several ways. The statistical testing procedure used to resolve the question not only varies between questions, but also between parameterizations. One parameterization is the selection of an appropriate null model. Statistical hypothesis testing requires a notion of randomness for the null hypothesis, and careful attention has been given to making such randomness assumptions transparent to the user. For most tests, the randomness assumptions can also be selected from a list of possibly meaningful alternatives (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkt342-F2">Figure 2</xref>A). For instance, one can for hypothesis tests involving a gene track choose a simple null model where genes are randomized independently and uniformly along the genome. Alternatively, one can select a null model where the empirically observed clustering tendency of genes (distribution of inter-gene distances) is preserved. A further alternative is to sample gene positions according to a separately specified intensity track, which can for instance be used to control for influence by external confounders. Depending on the assumptions deemed appropriate by the user for the hypothesis test (through, e.g., the selection of a null model), the system will determine whether to use either an asymptotic computation or a Monte Carlo (MC) based evaluation of <italic>P</italic>-values. This is handled by the system, but at the same time transparent to the user. For MC-based evaluation of <italic>P</italic>-values, a sequential sampling scheme, MCFDR, is used to automatically determine the appropriate number of samples for statistical testing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt342-B9">9</xref>).

    <title>PROCESSING DATA INTO FORMS SUITABLE FOR ANALYSIS</title>
    <p>In many situations, a complex formulation of a biological question may be simplified if the original data are first transformed into a form that more directly reflects the question of interest. An example of this is a question of how often DNA binding locations of a given TF (as a first genomic track) fall inside or in the close vicinity of genes (as a second track). Although clearly manageable, the concept of proximity in this setting requires some thought and further specification. If one transforms the gene track by expanding the gene intervals to include, say, one kbp flanks, one can afterwards ask the more simple question of how often the TF binding locations fall inside these expanded gene intervals. This latter version is easy to envision and does not involve any ambiguity. This example shows the redefinition of a problem originally formulated to involve vicinity to fit with an analysis based on the simpler concept of containment. Thus, by combining a set of basic, generic analyses with a collection of track transformation functionality, a core set of well-understood analyses can be applied to a much broader range of biologically motivated questions. Several tools for customizing data into forms that may simplify subsequent analyses are available under the menu ‘Customize tracks’, and are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkt342-T3">Table 3</xref>.

The tool also allows converting data to and from the recent GTrack format, which is a recent, unified format that is capable of representing data of any track type, and thus data stemming from any of the other file formats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt342-B6">6</xref>).</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Convert a GTrack file to the BED format in order to use BED-specific Galaxy tools.</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">    Create GTrack file from unstructured tabular data</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">The tool allows structuring unformatted tabular data into a GTrack file by specifying the necessary meta-data through simple selection boxes, inferring further properties of the data where possible.</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Import virus integration sites of the Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) from an Excel spreadsheet into a GTrack file for further analysis by the ‘Analyze genomic tracks’ tool.</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn id="gkt342-TF3"><p>Further descriptions are given at the web pages of the tools themselves, along with demo buttons and links to reproducible examples of how each tool can be used.

    <p>In some analysis scenarios, a feature of interest is not explicitly available in the form of a genomic track, but can be derived from properties of other genomic tracks. The HyperBrowser menu ‘Generate tracks’ includes several tools for generation of datasets in such situations. Tracks can be generated based on DNA sequence properties along the genome, or based on density of, or distance to, certain genomic features along the genome. An overview of these tools is given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkt342-T3">Table 3</xref>.</p>
    <p>In other analysis scenarios, genomic coordinates are available for the data of interest, but not in a format that can be readily used in the tool of interest. Genomic datasets come in a variety of forms, including raw lists of coordinates not adhering to any specified format. The data are usually in tabular format, typically as raw text files or as spreadsheet documents. The HyperBrowser recognizes most commonly used tabular formats, in addition to a recent unified format, GTrack, supporting all 15 basic types of tracks handled by the system. A format conversion tool is available under the menu ‘Format and convert tracks’, alongside a tool for structuring raw tabular data into a GTrack file (<xref ref-type="table" rid="gkt342-T3">Table 3</xref>). A set of tools for validating and editing GTrack files are also available, as introduced in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt342-B6">6</xref>).</p>

    <title>SUPPLEMENTING GUI SELECTION WITH COMMAND-BASED BATCH EXECUTION</title>
    <p>A web interface based primarily on point-and-click selection has several advantages compared to a command-line-based approach to data analysis. A main advantage is that it does not require the recollection of suitable commands and parameters to achieve a given analysis objective. A typical disadvantage is that it may be cumbersome to perform a multitude of similar analyses. This is in contrast to the command-based approach, where slight modifications to an analysis can often be done very quickly, and where looping may allow multiple analyses to be performed without a huge manual effort. We believe this is rapidly becoming an important issue for genome analysis, as e.g. the ENCODE and Roadmap Epigenomics projects generate chromatin and transcription factor binding tracks for hundreds of different cell types.</p>
    <p>To meet this challenge, we have combined advantages of both worlds, the point-and-click based and the command based, through what we refer to as ‘batch execution functionality’. For the initial specification of an analysis, we mainly rely on a GUI-based approach, using selection boxes as described in the section ‘Analysis of genomic tracks’. After an analysis has been specified through the GUI, one can click on ‘Inspect parameters of the analysis’ to obtain a ‘corresponding batch command line’. This purely textual representation of the analysis can now be modified and/or duplicated according to customized needs, and executed in the ‘Execute batch commands’ tool under the menu ‘Text-based analysis interface’. Two options that increase the flexibility is the possibility to use a slash (/) to denote that an analysis is to be performed with multiple alternative tracks or parameter values, and the use of a star character (*) to denote that a given analysis is to be performed on all sub-tracks at a given level of the HyperBrowser track collection hierarchy. These extensions of the format greatly simplify the process of running a given analysis on a set of related tracks, e.g., for different chromatin marks or cell lines.</p>

    <title>FULL ANALYSIS SCENARIO</title>
    <p>The full reach of the Genomic HyperBrowser system becomes apparent when considering the combination of various tools for processing and analyzing data. By employing an appropriate combination of data preparation and analysis functionality, a range of sophisticated and precisely specified hypotheses can be investigated.</p>
    <p>An example of such an analysis is the investigation of whether regions associated with a given disease overlap preferentially with marks of active chromatin in a certain cell type compared to another reference cell type. A sequence of steps for analyzing multiple sclerosis (MS) associated regions in B-cells versus hepatocytes is given in a Galaxy Page at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://bit.ly/hb_example">http://bit.ly/hb_example</ext-link>. This page shows the sequence of tools that has been used, along with the exact input parameters and resulting outputs for each of the tools. Any step can be easily reproduced exactly or with modifications to the input parameters. The analysis starts with a set of SNP coordinates in a form reflecting a typical starting point with data in a raw text or a spreadsheet document. The SNP data are uploaded and formatted, and two genomic tracks of active chromatin state regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt342-B12">12</xref>) in B-cells and hepatocytes are extracted from the HyperBrowser track repository. In their original track representations, the question of interest would be whether the track of active regions in B-cells shows a stronger presence in the vicinity of SNP positions than the hepatocyte track, after appropriate normalization based on overall differences between the tracks of active regions. Both the concept of vicinity and the need for normalization complicates the precise formulation of an appropriate question. By expanding the SNPs to include flanks, and by combining the two tracks of active regions into a single case–control track, the final question becomes whether the MS SNP proximity regions overlap preferentially with segments of the combined active chromatin state track marked as case versus control. As can be seen from the result output of the final step of the analysis, this is indeed the case (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt342-B13">13</xref>).</p>
    <p>The Genomic HyperBrowser is complementarily integrated with other systems for working with genomic track data, both conceptually and implementation-wise. A powerful way to work with genomic data may be to, e.g., first get some general impressions and ideas about the data through direct visualization and browsing in the UCSC genome browser (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt342-B3">3</xref>), followed by genome-scale exploration using EpiExplorer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt342-B14">14</xref>). Relevant hypotheses may then be evaluated by robust statistical analysis within the Genomic HyperBrowser. Throughout such an analysis scenario, one may also use a variety of Galaxy tools that work well together with all the mentioned systems.</p>

  <sec sec-type="conclusions">
    <title>CONCLUSIONS</title>
    <p>The Genomic HyperBrowser is a comprehensive system for statistical analysis of genomic tracks. A range of genomic investigations can be addressed through a combination of data processing and analysis tools. Novel features and analyses are continually added to the system. Furthermore, if a user faces a track analysis challenge that cannot be resolved through the present version of the system, we take it upon us to react promptly to expand the system.</p>
