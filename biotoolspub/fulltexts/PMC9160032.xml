    <abstract id="Abs1">
      <p id="Par2">Since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, many research organizations have studied the genome of the SARS-CoV-2 virus; a body of public resources have been published for monitoring its evolution. While we experience an unprecedented richness of information in this domain, we also ascertained the presence of several information quality issues. We hereby propose CoV2K, an abstract model for explaining SARS-CoV-2-related concepts and interactions, focusing on viral mutations, their co-occurrence within variants, and their effects. CoV2K provides a clear and concise route map for understanding different connected types of information related to the virus; it thus drives a process of data and knowledge integration that aggregates information from several current resources, harmonizing their content and overcoming incompleteness and inconsistency issues. CoV2K is available for exploration as a graph that can be queried through a RESTful API addressing single entities or paths through their relationships. Practical use cases demonstrate its application to current knowledge inquiries.</p>

      <title>Background</title>
      <p id="Par3">Thanks to the continuous and massive process of deposition of SARS-CoV-2 sequences to public databases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>, viral evolution is constantly monitored by international organizations. A huge body of research studies links the spreading of mutational processes to the virus ability to organize within more transmissible variants or to escape vaccines or treatments, thus affecting the evolution of COVID-19 disease. The process is of enormous importance for understanding the course of the pandemic; however, it is hampered by a lack of (1) coordination of terms and concepts being used, (2) methods to handle their heterogeneity and evolution in time, (3) an instrument that allows to connect concepts.</p>

      <title>Information quality issues</title>
      <p id="Par4">Nowadays several organizations in the domain provide different descriptions of the same concepts. Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> captures a snapshot of the information collected on June 18th, 2021 from such sources. This example is illustrative of both heterogeneity among descriptions and inconsistencies, all highlighted in yellow:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par5"><italic>Terminology issues</italic>. Names are assigned by WHO<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup> (using Greek letters), but they are also provided by Pangolin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup> as <italic>lineages</italic>, GISAID<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup> and Nextstrain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup> as <italic>clades</italic>, or by Public Health England (PHE<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>) based on the variant importance for genomic surveillance. Nextstrain names are in turn reported by portals of both WHO and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>), with different notations for many lineages/variants (e.g., Alpha is mapped to 20I(V1) and to 20I/501Y.V1); GISAID also provides heterogeneous names (e.g., Alpha is currently assigned to GRY; formerly it was assigned to GR/501Y.V1). Mismatches may depend on updates misalignment or to partial wordings. At that time, WHO was reporting the most updated Nextstrain names<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup> whereas the CDC names were outdated.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par6"><italic>Variant identity issues</italic>. Some sources group together multiple lineages (e.g., B.1.427/B.1.429 in WHO), while others differentiate them in terms of context and effects (e.g., in CDC), or even ignore them (e.g., in PHE).</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par7"><italic>Classification issues</italic>. Variants are classified differently by their reporting sources, e.g., the Zeta (P.2) variant was reported as ‘Variant of Interest’ (changed to ‘Alert for Further Monitoring’ two weeks later) by WHO and CDC, as ‘Variant under Investigation’ by PHE, and as ‘Variant Under Monitoring’ by the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>) at the time the observed snapshot.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par8"><italic>Characterization issues</italic>. Variants’ characterizations (in terms of mutations that determine their assignment to a variant) are reported along different schemes and guidelines by both authoritative sources such as WHO<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>, CDC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>, ECDC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>, PHE<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>, and by academic/community-driven services such as CoVariants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>, outbreak.info<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>, and Cov-Lineages.org<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. For the Alpha (B.1.1.7) variant, we find different contexts from different authoritative sources. ECDC and CDC only describe notable Spike changes; ECDC reports only three changes, CDC reports 13 changes (however, three of them are “detected in some sequences but not all”). CoVariants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup> (employing the Nextstrain system) reports both amino acid changes and synonymous (nucleotide) mutations. Reported amino acid changes use different notations; for example: i) the Cov-Lineages.org Lineage Report uses ORF1ab, CoVariants mentions ORF1a and ORF1b, whereas GISAID directly uses non structural proteins NSP1–NSP16; ii) Cov-Lineages.org expresses deletions as consecutive missing nucleotides, whereas CoVariants names missing amino acids one by one. Similar differences occur in all the rows.</p></list-item></list><fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Different <italic>Namings</italic>, classes, and <italic>Contexts</italic> (i.e., characterizing mutations) given to the most known WHO-named variants available on June 18th, 2021.

      <p id="Par9">Note that all the four described aspects has been addressed by clustering information about variants by means of unique identifiers (e.g., the Pango lineage) and then applying entity reconciliation, building one integrated information structure that organizes different SARS-CoV-2 data silos.</p>

      <title>Objective</title>
      <p id="Par10">The goal of this article is to provide CoV2K, a unifying, abstract model of the information about SARS-CoV-2 in terms of entities and relationships; the model links these concepts both to knowledge sources and to massive datasets of sequence data. In addition to the illustration of the model, we also explain how the model is instantiated from some of the relevant information sources and can be explored by means of a simple API, exemplified with several prepared use cases.</p>

      <title>Abstract model</title>
      <p id="Par11">The CoV2K abstract model, shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, describes various biological aspects of viral sequences. Areas – indicated with CAPITAL letters – correspond to different facets of the abstract model. Each area contains a number of entities (rectangles, in <italic>italics</italic> in the text) with different attributes (not shown in the figure, typed in the text). We assume all entity names to be different and each entity to carry an identifier, with a uniquely assigned name (〈entity_name〉_id). Indirect edges denote many-to-many cardinality, binary direct edges denote one-to-many cardinality (the edge points to the entity that is functionally determined), bidirectional edges indicate one-to-one cardinality, direct edges linking one father entity to many child entities denote a generalization hierarchy. Dashed lines represent the connections between the left and right parts of the model, where the left part describes knowledge about SARS-CoV-2 and the right part describes extensive data (millions of sequences and thousands of epitopes) collected in public databases. All relationships are named except the generalization hierarchy describing effects. Next, we dedicate one section to each area, in which we provide a brief introduction of its purpose, a bulleted list – where each element corresponds to one entity of CoV2K along with its attributes – information on its connections with entities of other areas, and mention to suitable information sources for its instances. The list of all entities and attributes of the abstract model is provided in the project’s GitHub repository.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>CoV2K abstract model. The areas on the left of the dashed vertical line represent knowledge about SARS-CoV-2, whereas the right areas contain its data. Within each area, entities are represented by white rectangles. Within and across areas, entities are connected by relationships, of five kinds: i) directed edges between two entities represent functional relationships, e.g., each <italic>Context</italic> may refer to only one <italic>Variant</italic>; ii) a direct edge with the marked cardinality “2” denotes a double functional relationship (one <italic>AA residue change</italic> involves two <italic>AA residue</italic>s); iii) direct edges connecting one (father) entity to many (child) entities represent a generalization hierarchy, e.g., <italic>Effects</italic> are either <italic>Variant effects</italic> or <italic>Change effects</italic> or <italic>Group effects</italic>; iv) indirect edges represent many-to-many relationships, e.g., each <italic>Variant</italic> may refer to many <italic>Variant effects</italic> and each <italic>Variant effect</italic> may refer to many <italic>Variants</italic>; v) dashed lines represent knowledge-data connections. The names of relationships are read along the direction of the arrow for functional relationships, else the direction is clear from the context.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="41597_2022_1348_Fig2_HTML" id="d32e448"/></fig></p>

        <title>STRUCTURE area</title>
        <p id="Par12">SARS-CoV-2 is a single-stranded RNA virus; the two most used reference sequences, i.e., NC_045512<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup> for GenBank and hCoV-19/Wuhan/WIV04/2019<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup> for GISAID<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup> respectively present 29,903 and 29,891 bases, where each base corresponds to one of the 4 nucleotides A, C, G, or T. As in this work we chose the NCBI standard, each position in a sequence is characterized by a unique number within the 1–29,903 range. The STRUCTURE area aims to capture the information related to specific portions of the sequence.<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par13"><italic>Nuc. annotation</italic> entity. The structure of SARS-CoV-2 sequences is modeled by defining a rich set of annotations, e.g., regions identified with a name with start_on_ref and stop_on_ref positions on the reference sequence.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par14"><italic>Protein</italic> entity. Aa_sequences, i.e., sequences of amino acids, form proteins; each protein maps to a specific nucleotide annotation based on its starting and ending position. Several schemes are used to denote SARS-CoV-2 protein regions; here, we adopt the scheme employed by NCBI GenBank<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>, using both polyproteins ORF1ab and ORF1a and their nonstructural proteins NSP1–NSP16 as instances of the <italic>Protein</italic> entity, and then mapping ORF1ab and ORF1a to NSP1–NSP16 for denoting mutations (GISAID convention). Each protein sequence has a given aa_length measured by the number of its amino acids; therefore, proteins’ positions are associated with a unique number ranging from 1 to the protein’s length.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par15"><italic>Protein regions</italic> entity. Proteins include regions with special properties having a start_on_protein and a stop_on_protein position linked to a given protein_id, as well as a describing name, a general category, and a type.</p></list-item></list></p>
        <p id="Par16">Nucleotide annotations and proteins give the positional context to nucleotide mutations and amino acid changes described next. Among possible knowledge sources, we selected NCBI Virus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup> for proteins and nucleotide annotations and UniProtKB<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup> for extracting protein regions; we browse all SARS-CoV-2 protein-dedicated pages and include information regarding the topology and modification sites; we import all domains, repeats, regions, coiled coils, and motifs.</p>

        <title>POSITIONS OF INTEREST area</title>
        <p id="Par17">Specific one base (or one residue) positions are of particular interest because they harbor mutations that can modify the behavior of the virus.<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par18"><italic>Nuc. positional mutation</italic> entity. Mutations occur at specific positions of the SARS-CoV-2 nucleotide sequence, causing deletions, insertions or – most frequently – substitutions (difference encoded by the type attribute). They have a position, where the reference nucleotide is changed into an alternative, affecting a certain length of the sequence. For instance, A23403G indicates that – in the 23403rd nucleotide of the sequence – a single base of Adenine has been changed into a Guanine.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par19"><italic>AA positional change</italic> entity. Non-synonymous nucleotide mutations cause amino acid changes within specific proteins, occurring in a position where a reference residue has been changed into an alternative residue linked to a specific protein_id for a given length); these have a major influence on the protein functionalities. When type is a deletion, the alternative residue is encoded with a dash “-”. Insertions only have a position and an alternative string of arbitrary length. Amino acid changes are denoted by strings, e.g., S:D614G denotes the substitution, at the 614 position of the Spike protein, of the amino acid Aspartic Acid (D) with the amino acid Glycine (G).</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par20"><italic>AA change groups</italic> entity. As several changes may jointly produce stronger effects, it is also important to group change.</p></list-item></list></p>
        <p id="Par21">Note that this is the core area of the model, linking to all other areas: positions of interest fall within given structures of the virus; they have characteristics that depend on the single residues that are changed; positions, when mutated, lead to effects on the phenotype of the virus and, when exhibited together on same viruses, form variants. In principle, all positions are susceptible to variation; any nucleotide base or amino acid residue can be changed to any of the other three or deleted, and insertions may occur at any point of the sequence and be of arbitrary lengths. However, there is only a limited number of mutations that happen in practice. Thus, the content of this area is computed based on the presence of mutations i) in variants characterizations by authoritative sources (<italic>Context</italic> entity), ii) with documented effects (<italic>Effect</italic> entity), iii) in the data entity <italic>AA change</italic>. Protein names and nucleotide/amino acid changes notations need normalization to enable comparisons between sources. Regular expressions and string manipulation are used for converting them into the GISAID nomenclature (for mutations) and the UniProtKB nomenclature (for protein names).</p>

        <title>VARIANTS area</title>
        <p id="Par22">Using phylogenetics, viral evolution is described by trees. Each sequence is mapped to a node and is placed in the tree based on its distance to other existing nodes. The distance between any two nodes takes into account the specific nucleotide and/or amino acid changes carried by both of them. This mapping allows the partitioning of sequences into clusters, captured at different levels of the phylogenetic tree by different organizations (e.g., lineages, clades).<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par23"><italic>Variant</italic> entity. The term variant is commonly used for the clusters that become predominant (highly prevalent) in given locations at given times. Note that, when variants convey modifications in the phenotype of the virus (largely verified by the scientific community), they become new strains<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par24"><italic>Naming</italic> entity. Each variant carries several names (naming_id) and classes (v_class, e.g., VoI for Variant of Interest or VuM for Variant under Monitoring) assigned by different organizations (org).</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par25"><italic>Context</italic> entity. The variant is associated to several nucleotide mutations and amino acid changes by different organizations or computational rules over data (we refer to this as the owner), clarified by a rule_description. As an example, variants on the ECDC source are only characterized by three to five mutations on the Spike protein.</p></list-item></list></p>
        <p id="Par26">CoVariants provides very complete characterizations of both amino acid changes and nucleotide mutations; moreover, we may have a characterization that comprises all and only those mutations that appear in at least 75% sequences that are assigned to a particular lineage (i.e., to the related variant). Such lists of mutations are part of the <italic>Nuc. positional mutation</italic> and <italic>AA positional change</italic> entities from the POSITIONS OF INTEREST area. Variants are also linked to their <italic>Variant effects</italic> in the EFFECTS area. In CoV2K, we consider the variants as reported in CoVariants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup> and in PHE<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Based on a comprehensive search on systems currently available, these two resources proved to be the most comprehensive (for characterizations) and promptly updated (on other organization namings). Our methods extract information from the repositories connected to these websites and, for each variant, they report names from many different organizations. Such information is encoded in the specific naming schemes employed by the organization (e.g., names such as ‘S.501Y.V2’ are typical of Nextstrain, while ‘VUI-21JUN-01’ are typical of PHE).</p>

The presence of the change may yield an increase or decrease of the impact (encoded in the lv attribute); the effect is usually reported as a result of a scientific study that used a given method (epidemiological, experimental, computational or inferred).

      <p id="Par44">The CoV2K abstract model has allowed to provide practical guidance for the design of an integration pipeline that gathers different data sources and their data types within a single infrastructure. The details of such framework are given in the “Methods” section, which describes the extraction, transformation, loading, and harmonization of CoV2K data. The harmonization step includes several operations to achieve homogeneous and interoperable content of the resulting knowledge base, including 1) reconciliation of the different representations of variants; 2) removal of duplicate mutations; 3) cleaning of duplicate evidence papers; and 4) translation of mutation coordinates into a single system of reference.

For each endpoint, there are four possible uses:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par46">Without parameters (e.g., /evidences), returning all the instances of the entity.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par47">With a path parameter specifying the entity identifier (e.g., /evidences/XYZ), returning only the instance with the given identifier.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par48">With a query parameter specifying an attribute-value pair for that entity (e.g., /evidences?type = preprint), returning the set of evidences with the given type.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par49">With a query parameter linking that entity to another entity through a relationship (e.g., /evidences?effect_id = XYZ), returning the set of instances of the first entity that are linked to the instances of the second entity with the specified identifier.</p></list-item></list></p>
      <p id="Par50">Note that, given two entities X and Y connected by a relationship, it is possible to extract the instances of one of them connected to a given instance of the other one. Recall that entity names are unique and that entity identifiers are constructed from entity names (i.e., 〈entity_name〉_id). Users can control the production of results of queries by means of pagination parameters limit and page; the former sets the number of instances to be produced within a page of results (e.g., 100), the latter indicates the specific page to be displayed. Pagination is mandatory for the queries over data entities (e.g., <italic>Sequence</italic>, <italic>AA change</italic>…) as they may return very large results.</p>
      <p id="Par51">Note that the endpoint/effects accepts as path parameters identifiers of variants, of groups of amino acid changes, or of single amino acid changes. Moreover, given that each residue change is connected to exactly two residues, the endpoint/aa_residues invoked on a given aa_residue_change_id returns two instances corresponding to the reference and alternative residues, whereas two specific endpoints/aa_residues_ref (resp./aa_residues_alt) can be used to return only information regarding the reference (resp. alternative) residue.</p>
      <p id="Par52">The relationships of the abstract model can be combined (chained) one after the other through the /combine endpoint, e.g., /combine/evidences/effects?aa_positional_change_id=S:L452R extracts the evidences reporting effects on the Spike mutation L452R. Pagination applies to the combination result and is mandatory if the combination result refers to a data entity. A basic error handling mechanism prohibits users to build combinations with cycles (i.e., strings with repeated entities are illegal). Using path parameters that are not part of the last specified entity is also not allowed (e.g., /epitopes/variant_id = XYZ is illegal). Finally, as intermediate results of combinations may be quite large, we set a maximum threshold on their size (say 10,000 instances); when the threshold is overcome, the query fails and the user can then use shorter combinations or more restrictive query conditions.</p>

    <p id="Par57">CoV2K is an abstract model consisting of entities and relationships; the model is sub-structured within well-identified interconnected areas, representing the facets of the information about SARS-CoV-2 virus; areas in the left represent knowledge, areas in the right represent data. CoV2K provides a query system for supporting queries that arbitrarily interconnect data and knowledge.</p>
    <p id="Par58">For what concerns knowledge, we have chosen the information sources so that they are the most updated in the landscape of SARS-CoV-2-related knowledge and they provide a tight update schedule. Moreover, our ETL and harmonization pipelines for feeding CoV2K have been designed to allow easy extension of its content by future addition of data sources when these become available and are deemed trustworthy.</p>
    <p id="Par59">For what concerns data, CoV2K includes two large databases. We previously developed the ViruSurf database<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://gmql.eu/virusurf/">http://gmql.eu/virusurf/</ext-link>), which at the beginning of 2022 includes around 4 million sequences from GenBank and COG-UK with both nucleotide mutations and amino acid changes. Our pipelines reload and curate data regularly. We also include in CoV2K the Immune Epitope Database (IEDB, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.iedb.org/">https://www.iedb.org/</ext-link>) containing about 6.5 K epitopes defined for SARS-CoV-2.</p>

    <p id="Par64">In all these experiences, mastering the interplay between data and knowledge in SARS-CoV-2 has proven to be extremely useful. Our current version of CoV2K system is undergoing continuous updating of information. We are designing semi-supervised methods for extracting content from the CORD-19 literature corpus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup> to continuously collect instances of knowledge-related entities.</p>
    <p id="Par65">Many efforts aim at systematizing knowledge areas related to COVID-19.

We instead propose an abstract model focused on SARS-CoV-2 sequences and their mutations/variants. CoV2K offers a tangible route map for understanding the connections between concepts and data related to SARS-CoV-2. In building the CoV2K content, we have employed a classical data integration process driven by an abstract model, with pipelines for the integration and harmonization of different data silos, and display of results by means of a flexible application programming interface. The linking of CoV2K concepts to our web resources is a step forward in promoting FAIR principles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>, as it facilitates – at the conceptual level – the interoperability between public data sources and open knowledge and – at the practical level – the creation of several future systems that will exploit the new possibilities allowed by interlinking data and knowledge.</p>

        <title>Variants entity reconciliation</title>
        <p id="Par82">Variant names are reported in multiple sources in different ways; each source possibly provides also the characterization in terms of amino acid changes and nucleotide mutations. We here discuss how same real-world entities (variants) are recognized and represented in our MongoDB instance. This step is performed directly on the database collection of variants (after having loaded the data in MongoDB); it is thus independent from the imported sources and can be repeated as many times as needed. We call <italic>clusters</italic> the ensemble of information (related to variants’ <italic>Naming</italic>, <italic>Context</italic> and <italic>Variant Effects</italic>) that collectively characterizes a variant. Final variants’ clusters are produced starting from initial clusters through a sequence of operations on our MongoDB instance:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par83">label each input variant cluster with a unique cluster-id;</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par84">split each cluster into items 〈<italic>original variant name</italic>, <italic>variant organization</italic>, <italic>cluster-id</italic>〉, where the organization is retrieved using regular expression that identify the specific known organizations naming schemes.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par85">isolate items without a corresponding Pango lineage (which will represent singleton independent clusters);</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par86">group the remaining items by Pango lineage, which becomes the identifier of the final cluster, paired with a list of cluster-ids referencing the original clusters;</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par87">in each final cluster, add the union of the properties (namings, amino acid changes, nucleotide mutations, and effects) of the referenced original clusters;</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par88">remove duplicates from variants’ namings;</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par89">add to the set of final clusters the original clusters without any Pango lineage.</p></list-item></list></p>
        <p id="Par90">Figure <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref> shows an excerpt of the initial clusters in our database and how they are processed by the entity record reconciliation algorithm to produce final clusters. The first two clusters are recognized as referring to the same B.1.1.7 Pango lineage (used as identifier). Differently, the cluster B.1.427/B.1.429 put together two different variants that are then separated. Lastly, initial clusters that do not have a corresponding Pango lineage are kept unchanged.<fig id="Fig5"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption><p>Examples of record resolution regarding the Alpha variant, the Epsilon variant, and a specific lineage spread in the United States during Summer 2020 (called Pelican in CoVariants.org).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="41597_2022_1348_Fig5_HTML" id="d32e1458"/></fig></p>

        <title>Mutations duplicate removal</title>
        <p id="Par91">Amino acid changes and nucleotide mutations are inserted in the MongoDB instance without any check on duplicate entities. It does often happen that amino acid changes and nucleotide mutations – characterizing a variant, producing an effect, or appearing in the data entity <italic>AA change</italic> – are loaded multiple times. A MongoDB aggregation pipeline groups the documents of the aa_positional_changes (resp. nuc_positional_mutations) collection based on the aa_positional_changes_id (resp. nuc_positional_mutations_id) and automatically eliminates the replicates, guaranteeing that also other collections pointing to mutations reference the unique identifier.</p>

      <sec id="Sec34">
        <title>Evidence collection cleaning</title>
        <p id="Par92">The ETL pipeline for COG-UK Mutation Explorer can generate many duplicate evidence entries, each of which is linked to a different effect. At the time of loading, we do not check if the effect evidence sources are already present in the DB. In MongoDB, we group these <italic>Evidence</italic> records (with uri, citation, publisher, and type) into a single document and reference multiple effects by their identifier.</p>

        <title>Coordinate systems translation</title>
        <p id="Par93">All information in CoV2K related to positions on proteins of SARS-CoV-2 must be aligned to a same coordinate system. As discussed in the STRUCTURE area description, we employ the coordinates defined by NCBI reference sequence NC_045512<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup> and then use the GISAID/UniProtKB naming convention, with the following consequences: i) ORF1ab coordinates are translated into the corresponding coordinates of its subproteins NSP1, …, NSP16. ii) ORF6 protein becomes NS6 (non-structural protein 6, see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P0DTC6">https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P0DTC6</ext-link>). Such translations are applied to the entities <italic>AA positional change</italic>, <italic>Protein</italic>, <italic>Protein region</italic>, and <italic>AA change</italic>.</p>
