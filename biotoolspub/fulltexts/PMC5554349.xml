      <title>Abstract</title>
      <p>Visualizations of biomolecular networks assist in systems-level data exploration in many cellular processes. Data generated from high-throughput experiments increasingly inform these networks, yet current tools do not adequately scale with concomitant increase in their size and complexity. We present an open source software platform, interactome-CAVE (iCAVE), for visualizing large and complex biomolecular interaction networks in 3D. Users can explore networks (i) in 3D using a desktop, (ii) in stereoscopic 3D using 3D-vision glasses and a desktop, or (iii) in immersive 3D within a CAVE environment. iCAVE introduces 3D extensions of known 2D network layout, clustering, and edge-bundling algorithms, as well as new 3D network layout algorithms. Furthermore, users can simultaneously query several built-in databases within iCAVE for network generation or visualize their own networks (e.g., disease, drug, protein, metabolite). iCAVE has modular structure that allows rapid development by addition of algorithms, datasets, or features without affecting other parts of the code. Overall, iCAVE is the first freely available open source tool that enables 3D (optionally stereoscopic or immersive) visualizations of complex, dense, or multi-layered biomolecular networks. While primarily designed for researchers utilizing biomolecular networks, iCAVE can assist researchers in any field.</p>

    <title>Introduction</title>
    <p>Interaction networks are one of the primary visual metaphors for communicating and understanding -omics data at a systems level. From cellular organisms to human society, networks provide critical clues on systems-level behavior [<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>–<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. In biomedicine, they are essential for understanding normal [<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] and disease states [<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>–<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], and they are instrumental for drug discovery [<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>–<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] and biomarker identification [<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>–<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Changes in networks have helped in prognosis for breast cancer patients [<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], analyzing systematic inflammation in humans [<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] or studying emerging tumor markers [<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Network visualizations are thus important in basic and translational biomedical research, with an abundance of tools for their exploration [<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Many tools are also coupled with public databases, enabling visualizations in the context of previous knowledge [<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In fact, currently more than 500 resources are listed at Pathguide, [<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] with thousands of networks and millions of biomolecular interactions [<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p>
    <p>Among currently available tools, Cytoscape [<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] and Gephi [<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] are quite popular. There are also a number of JavaScript network visualization libraries (e.g., sigma.js [<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]), and software packages (e.g., iGraph [<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]) on the web. However, the layout algorithms in these libraries and employed in Cytoscape [<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], in addition to other tools like Ingenuity [<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], Osprey [<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], VisANT [<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], and BINA [<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], to name a few, are limited by the number of molecules and interactions that can be displayed on a 2D screen, and the associated layout and representation challenges. Furthermore, recent technological developments have increased the size and complexity of -omics experimental data, with simultaneous recordings from multiple cellular events leading to unprecedented growth in interaction data [<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. New approaches are necessary to address the visualization design challenges that the concomitant large, complex, and multi-dimensional (multi-layered) networks present to explore these systems.</p>
    <p>Currently networks with 3D localizations (e.g., brain connectivity networks or molecular complexes) are best explored in 3D. For representing abstract data, taking advantage of the third dimension can also allow for greater freedom; however, the available 3D visualization options and tools are still somewhat nascent in this domain. Stereoscopy, the projection of separate images to each eye, which creates the illusion that virtual objects have volumes in 3D space, has been shown to be particularly beneficial for exploring large, complex networks, either alone or combined with rotation or user motion cues [<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>–<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Immersive visualization environments, where users are virtually immersed inside the image, have also led to better performance than 2D in user studies for relatively difficult tasks and large networks [<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. For example, a CAVE environment, which includes projectors directed to several walls of a room-sized cube to create the sense of presence inside a virtual world, has been shown to help identify a new network property that a 2D display failed [<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. The technology features that were particularly helpful were stereoscopy, magnification, and wide field of view (the extent of the visualized image observed by the user) [<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. However, a CAVE facility is a substantial investment to build and maintain that only a limited number of institutions have. Network visualizations in stereoscopic and immersive 3D environments are still new, and we currently do not have community tools to help us understand how best to use them by conducting user studies on different technology platforms and testing alternative layout algorithms or to explore phenomena that involve large, complex networks.</p>
    <p>Here, we introduce interactome-CAVE (iCAVE), an open source tool for 3D, stereoscopic 3D, and immersive 3D visualizations of complex, large, and/or multi-layered networks. iCAVE development is made possible by the continuous evolution of data analysis tools in VR, stereoscopic visualization, and emerging 3D technologies. Use of VR technology in life sciences research is still nascent [<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>–<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], and so far does not include free open source tools for biomolecular network visualizations, mainly due to the limited portability of the technology to personal computers until recently. iCAVE is completely portable, taking advantage of recent advances in computer graphics hardware, software, and content creation that are leading to a proliferation of stereoscopic visualization capabilities in personal computing. Computers can now be upgraded to display high-quality stereoscopic 3D visuals with low-cost stereoscopic 3D glasses and software [<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], which are much cheaper than recent head-mounted displays (HMDs). As most scientific computers are becoming stereo enabled and 3D glasses are going mainstream, iCAVE is on the leading edge of this larger trend in the evolution of visual computing technology. If a computer is equipped with stereo capabilities, users can explore stereoscopic 3D visualizations. With large screens or curved walls, users can additionally take advantage of magnification and wide field of view. Users can also use iCAVE in immersive CAVE environments. Without a CAVE or a stereo-equipped computer (or if users choose to turn off stereo), iCAVE provides interactive 3D visualizations that still offer most of its features.</p>
    <p>Note that while few network visualization tools incorporate 3D layouts [<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>–<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], they are not immersive 3D, i.e., they do not have interoperation capability with virtual reality (VR) technologies, and have 2D displays. For example, Arena 3D [<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] mixes 3D and 2D properties by arranging data in multilayered graphs in 2D, with each layer representing a different data type. While the tool includes several layout and clustering algorithms for each layer and has zoom and rotation features, it does not offer global layout and clustering algorithms to make full use of the third dimension, and each layer is in 2D [<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. 3DScapeCS [<xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] is a Cytoscape PlugIn written in Java, with built-in extensions of the classic 2D force-directed layouts. Users cannot add new layouts or functionalities, and it does not utilize 3D effects to improve comprehension (e.g., transparency or advanced shadow effects). BioLayoutExpress (now Miru) [<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] is a standalone 3D application specifically designed for gene expression networks that offers three network layouts, a clustering method, no edge bundling, and limited network topology statistics. Importantly, it is not freely available. In summary, 3D biomolecular network visualization is a nascent field. We need free open source tools for biologists to visualize their networks and for algorithm developers to add and test new methods that take advantage of the third dimension. Such a tool will also enable visualization designers to perform user studies to better understand the relative advantages of various 3D features. This is necessary as how best to utilize features specific to 3D or to take advantage of new 3D technologies is currently an open research question.</p>
    <p>To the best of our knowledge, iCAVE is the first 3D, stereoscopic 3D, and immersive 3D biomolecular network visualization tool that is open source, freely available, and utilizable with commercial hardware/software. iCAVE introduces new built-in 3D algorithms for laying out nodes and their connections in 3D space and has built-in topology-based graph clustering algorithms. For example, it enables visual integration of multiple clusters or data types within the same graph as a multi-layered network (e.g., metabolomic, proteomic, genomic, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) disease, protein-drug interactions). Users can also add their own layout or clustering algorithms. While not extensive, it includes a few built-in databases to assist in preliminary mapping of high-throughput (HT) experimental data in the early discovery phase of network building. Customizable color, texture, size, and layout options assist in displaying maximum information in a graph in an optimized manner. Users can easily select edge colors, weights, and directions or bundle edges for simplified views. Data are input in a tab-delimited text file while visual outputs can be saved in 2D snapshots or movies configured with user-defined rotation, zoom, and speeds. Additional reports on network statistics are provided in 2D. Overall, iCAVE enables network explorations in hypothesis-driven contexts that are flexible, collaborative, and user friendly.</p>
    <p>In the following section, we first discuss our main contributions and findings on visualizing networks that are large, with or without known 3D physical coordinates, and with multiple data types using iCAVE. We then introduce the algorithms we implemented in iCAVE for network layout and clustering and discuss input and output formats, as well as performance and scalability aspects. Then, we summarize the features of iCAVE in the Discussion section. Finally, in the Methods section, we provide details on software libraries, user interface, network topology statistics, and layout algorithms.</p>

      <title>Optional stereoscopy</title>
      <p>iCAVE users can turn 3D stereoscopy on or off during exploration. For example, consider rendering the 2D biomolecular network in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">1</xref>A that represents a pathway affected by genomic alterations in glioblastoma [<xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Instead of the static 2D network in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">1</xref>A, users can experience full 3D depth perception at the comfort of their own stereo-equipped computer (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">1</xref>B), or inside a CAVE (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">1</xref>D) using a simple 3D extension of a classical force-directed layout algorithm (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">1</xref>) [<xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Even users without a stereo-equipped computer can interact with the 3D network: they can use their mouse (in lieu of hand-held controls) to zoom in/out or rotate the network to a view without occlusions. Rotation and zoom enables viewing the network from different view angles, such as the screenshot in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">1</xref>C. User studies have shown that even simple 3D features like rotation help better identification of properties unique to complex networks [<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Visualizations using stereoscopic 3D or immersive environments that enable inspection of a system from multiple perspectives have also been shown to make different properties of a system clearer [<xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Our case study supports this as we observed a network feature that was not intuitive from the original 2D layout in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">1</xref>A: nodes CBL and SPRY2 (with <bold>*</bold>) are “connectors” between 2 dense network regions (modules) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">1</xref>A–C). A targeted attack to these genes can splits the network into two. We could not identify this in 2D. Such discoveries of network topological features, among others, give a richer, more intuitive, and ultimately more insightful understanding of networks.</p>

      <title>Addressing large networks</title>
      <p>Important characteristics may be missed if users cannot interact with the complete network. In the simplest case, the nodes may form (i) dense sub-networks that are interconnected by a small number of “connector” nodes that render them critical or (ii) multiple networks (often 1 giant and few smaller networks) where the smaller sub-networks may represent functional groups of importance, such as a critical enzyme complexes. Hence, visualizing the complete network can be advantageous even if it is very large to identify local patterns [<xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. However, while the human brain has a remarkable capacity to visually identify patterns, enabling interpretation of data, visualizations of large networks may exhibit problems with display clutter, molecular positioning, or perceptual tension, leading the user to misinterpret closely positioned molecules as related [<xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Such misinterpretations are inherent in the limitations of human visual perception and have been well-studied in (Gestalt) psychology: people tend to organize visual elements into groups [<xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>].</p>
      <p>Three-dimensional elements that appear to form a pattern because of their visual positioning in one viewpoint can be interpreted correctly by rotating the image to a different viewpoint (e.g., Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">1</xref>). Furthermore, in networks that are denser or larger than that of Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">1</xref>, the potential 2D “hairball” effect can obscure important interactions. iCAVE users can simply navigate to a view without occlusions by moving their head, rotating the image, and zooming in or out, eliminating “edge-crossings.” To further address cluttering, iCAVE provides an “edge-bundled display” [<xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>] option for visually bundling adjacent edges together, analogous to bundling electrical wires or cables. Bundling is extremely useful in identifying global patterns in very large networks and can suggest vulnerabilities as targets. Several layout algorithms built-in within iCAVE address the molecular positioning problem; depending on the topology of a network, one may work better than another. We suggest testing each to see which works best. We provide examples of how these features can help with exploring a network in the following sections.</p>

      <title>New biological insights from networks with known 3D physical coordinates</title>
      <p>Users can visualize physically constrained networks at multiple scales, from proteins (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>A) to the whole brain (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>B). Coupled with edge bundling, these can provide insights in hypothesis generation. For example, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>A represents a snapshot of bacterial leucine transporter (LeuT) residue correlation network, where nodes represent 3D coordinates of alpha-carbon of a residue and edges represent top 3,000 (Pearson) correlations between residue pairs from a Molecular Dynamics simulation (Michael LeVine, personal communication). Remarkably, bundling the edges of this network enables the representation of highest-density “correlation highways” that travel through the substrate permeation core in the protein center, connecting extracellular and intracellular domains. These highways enable users to identify specific residues that have dense correlations with the permeation core even if they are away from it, which is unexpected. These residues may have previously unidentified importance in protein structure and function and are therefore potential candidates for follow-up studies.</p>

Nodes represent 3D coordinates of alpha-carbon of a residue; edges represent top 3,000 (Pearson) correlations between residue pairs, where the input is 3D coordinates and correlation scores. Surprisingly, 3D visualization with edge bundling enables representation of highest-density correlations (“correlation highways”) that travel through the substrate permeation pore in the protein center, connecting extracellular and intracellular domains. Correlation highways at the pore are visually fascinating and biophysically intuitive; some residues outside the pore reveal unexpected structural importance (data courtesy of Michael LeVine and Harel Weinstein).

      <title>Utilizing the third dimension for automated 3D layout positioning in abstract networks</title>
      <p>Biomolecular networks tend to follow basic and reproducible organizing principles, and navigating the entire network provides a good initial understanding. The layout algorithm must address the complex problem of arranging the nodes to clearly disseminate the network topology, and at the same time be visually pleasant and user friendly. iCAVE offers several network layout options to achieve these aims:</p>
      <p>Due to user familiarity, we extended variations of the force-directed layout to 3D: (i) the classical “force-directed algorithm” [<xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] treats the network as a physical system with edges analogous to “springs” and nodes to “electrically charged particles” that repel each other, where the final layout is established when the repulsive and attractive forces balance each other [<xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]; (ii) “hybrid force-directed layout” [<xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>] partitions the graph into smaller units prior to applying the force-directed algorithm; (iii) “lin-log layout” [<xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>] is better suited for larger networks as it keeps highly connected nodes in close proximity with minimal number of edge crossings. Alternatively, for larger networks, (iv) “coarsened force-directed layout” combines a force-directed algorithm with an efficient, high-quality force-directed graph drawing graph coarsening technique [<xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]; and (v) “simulated annealing force-directed layout” uses simulated annealing to rapidly scale to very large networks (see the Methods section) [<xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>].</p>
      <p>We further implemented 2 novel layout algorithms to take full advantage of immersive 3D features:</p>
      <p>The “semantic levels layout algorithm” segregates the network into separate layers (default 7) in the third dimension. The layout of each layer is calculated with a 3D extension of the force-directed approach. Semantic layers layout can be especially useful for user-defined networks where the number of layers and node assignments to layers can correspond to different data types (e.g., a 2D projection in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref> and 3D video in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup7">Supplementary Video 3</xref>, with layer1: genes; layer2: diseases; layer3: drugs).</p>
      <p>“Hemispherical layout” is a novel layout algorithm we have developed that positions the network on the surface of a 3D hemisphere. The most connected node is positioned at the top center of the hemisphere. Then, the whole hemisphere surface is populated based on a decreasing rank order of connectivity. The node positions are fixed, and the edges are drawn on the hemisphere surface (e.g., see a 2D projection in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>C and 3D video in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup7">Supplementary Video 4</xref>).</p>
      <p>Each layout algorithm has unique strengths, and we recommend that the user test different options. Semantic layout is often ideal for hierarchical networks. Force-directed layout often captures the essence of large networks. Hemispherical layout leads to clean images with optional edge bundling (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>C; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup7">Supplementary Video 4</xref>).</p>

        <p>Visualizing the complete global network, even if it is very large, can enable visual identification of a pattern. For example, consider a large probabilistic causal network constructed from human omental adipose tissue in a morbidly obese patient cohort in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>A. The network consists of 7,601 nodes, 13,979 edges [<xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Nodes are the genes expressed in tissue; edges are derived from a Bayesian network reconstruction algorithm that leverages DNA variation for causality. Here, we highlight nodes that represent a signature of genes causally associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) single nucleotide polymorphisms or disease pathways. Notice that within this global view of the massive network, there is a pattern of the IBD genes clustering together, which visually supports the hypothesis of functional relatedness.</p>

        <title>Example 2</title>
        <p>While force-directed layout algorithms can help identify global patterns, if the interaction network has a hierarchy, semantic layers layout can help visualize the hierarchical nature of the interactions easily. For example, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>B displays the global view of a network generated from The Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) [<xref rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>] study data. The ENCODE Consortium is generating a comprehensive parts list of the human genome functional elements, including those that control active genes, such as transcription factors (TFs). Utilizing these unprecedented volumes of data, Gerstein and co-workers have generated the massive network in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>B that includes 119 TFs that target 9,057 genes (nodes) via 26 037 interactions (edges) [<xref rid="bib58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. Using force-directed layouts, users can capture the general network structure and differentiate a TF from its neighbors by zooming in/out, adding labels to that specific TF, etc., and users obtain statistics on network centrality and other global topological properties as they pertain to the network. However, the semantic layers layout is useful in visualizing the hierarchical nature of this network, integrating TF, non-coding RNA (ncRNA), miRNA, and protein–protein interaction data (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>D; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup7">Supplementary Video 2</xref>). Here, network connectivity and hierarchy reflect genomic properties: top-level TF binding correlates with target expression, and mid-level contains “information flow bottlenecks” and connections with miRNA and distal regions, revealing ideal drug targets. Such multi-layered heterogeneous information integration assists in differentiating intra-level interconnections as well as inter-level edge types and node labels. Note that nodes in each layer are also arranged in 3D using 3D force-directed layout.</p>

        <p>Visualizing the global network of interactions while scaling or coloring a subset of the nodes based on their specific properties can enable hypothesis support. In this example, the visualization helps support the principle that functionally significant and highly conserved genes tend to be more central in physical protein–protein and regulatory networks [<xref rid="bib59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. Based on this hypothesis, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>C visualizes a network of tolerance to loss-of-function (LoF) mutations and evolutionary conservation, with nodes for (LoF) tolerant (blue) and essential genes (red) easily distinguishable [<xref rid="bib59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. Node size is based on degree of centrality of a gene. While essential genes tend to be bigger and central, LoF-tolerant genes are smaller and located in the periphery. Both the 2D snapshot (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>C) and 3D <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup7">Supplementary Video 1</xref> provide clear visualizations of this complex data that lead to easy interpretation.

Visualizing such data with semantic layout can assist in exploration in higher-level organization, all in 1 graph. The user can pick a gene (e.g., the Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor (AHR) gene, dark blue) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>A), query the COMBO database for diseases associated with its variants (purple), and identify drugs that target it (green) and drug candidates that may target it (light blue) due to guilt by association for having common targets with AHR-targeting drugs. These can serve as initial candidates for subsequent binding site characterization. Querying the COMBO database further generates a hierarchical network of proteins that interact with AHR (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>B, middle layer), diseases associated with gene variants of AHR-interacting proteins (purple), and AHR-targeting drugs (green).</p>

      <title>Graph clustering algorithms to identify network motifs</title>
      <p>Clustering is critical in network exploration as biomolecules that cluster together tend be functionally related. iCAVE offers the following graph clustering algorithms:</p>
      <p>“Edge-betweenness clustering” (EBC) is the number of shortest paths going through a particular edge. An edge with a high EB value connects multiple communities. At each step, the EBC algorithm removes the edge with the highest EB value until it has optimized a modularity metric on how unlikely the in-cluster degree of a node is in comparison to a random edge. EBC [<xref rid="bib70" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>] is an attractive algorithm since it does not require an estimate of the number of clusters <italic>a priori</italic>, unlike a majority of existing graph clustering algorithms.</p>
      <p>“Markov clustering” (MCL) [<xref rid="bib71" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>] is a scalable and unsupervised algorithm that assumes that the number of intra-cluster connections is large and inter-cluster connections is small. It is based on a bootstrapping procedure that simulates random walks (flow) through the network, which expands or contracts in parallel with regional connectivity.</p>
      <p>“Modularity clustering” (MC) uses the first eigenvector of the modularity matrix to assign nodes to clusters [<xref rid="bib72" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. While ideal for weighted networks, MC delivers intuitive layouts for networks that do not have weights as well.</p>
      <sec id="sec2-7-1">
        <title>Cluster visualization layout algorithms</title>
        <p>iCAVE can easily visualize clusters generated by iCAVE or another tool. By default, each cluster is positioned in space with “force-directed layout” [<xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], analogous to node positioning. Every cluster is embedded inside a transparent bubble, with members and their connections organized using the hemispherical layout. This arrangement provides a visual aesthetic, and (optional) edge bundling further clarifies the global topology (i.e., thicker bundles for high intra-cluster connectivity). Users can choose alternative layouts for cluster bubble positioning. “Lin-log cluster layout” is a variation of the force-directed model [<xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] where highly connected clusters are arranged in closer proximity.</p>
        <p>“Circos cluster layout” is an innovative algorithm we developed as a 3D adaptation of the popular 2D Circos layout [<xref rid="bib73" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. In this algorithm, we arrange the nodes in 3D space as in hemispherical layout, where the most connected node is located at the center of the hemisphere. We then slice the hemisphere with (pie-like) panels that correspond to separate clusters. Cluster representations can be optimized by variations in node/slice colorings or edge bundling. Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref> illustrates different cluster layout options using a metabolite network.</p>

        <p>Within iCAVE's user interface, investigators can easily toggle between alternative layouts of a single graph to emphasize different network aspects. Users without stereo equipment can rotate, zoom, or scale the visual to investigate special structures, print 2D snapshots, and save movies of a rotating network. Rotation allows multiple views for users without 3D. Exporting and exchanging such movies is very convenient in the YouTube era, enabling easy publication and sharing with collaborators without iCAVE or stereo. Those with a stereo-enabled computer (or a CAVE facility) wear stereoscopic LCD shutter glasses that convey 3D image and allow immersive interaction. In a CAVE, sensors track the user's eye position and adjust perspective according to user movements. The mouse (or wand) gestures are mapped to logical events that the network layout application handles. Zoom and rotate options activated with a simple mouse (or wand) click help focus on a particular node or edge.</p>

These include the number of nodes, the number of edges, network diameter, node-betweenness centrality, closeness centrality, neighborhood connectivity, shortest path, topological coefficient, and node degree distribution properties of the network.</p>

Interaction data are read from an SQLite database. The user can modify the network in real time and store it in DB Browser (which is a light GUI editor for SQLite databases) as a .db file, so that it can be saved for later access. Output is the layout of the network drawn in the Virtual Reality User Interface (VRUI) environment, which can be saved as high-resolution 2D image snapshots (.png format) or movies (.gif format).</p>
      <p>In iCAVE visualizations, 3D spherical glyphs represent nodes.

      <title>Performance and scalability</title>
      <p>Visualization and analysis of large networks in 3D may end up using a significant amount of computational resources, which in turn can affect the user experience. Size and topology of the network play an important role both in (i) rendering visual elements on the screen and (ii) calculating the results of a requested operation (e.g., layout, edge bundling, etc.). To help ease the computational burden of such factors while displaying networks in iCAVE, we implemented rendering and other compute-intensive operations to be adaptable to the size of the network. For example, as the network size increases, 3D objects are rendered in lower render quality. Similarly, for those compute-intensive operations, the tunable parameters (e.g., the number of iterations used for accuracy) are adjusted based on the network size.</p>

    <p>iCAVE is a freely available open source biomolecular network visualization tool that leverages advanced 3D and immersive 3D display technologies and offers several display options integrated with an effective user interface. It incorporates a number of new and existing built-in network layout and graph clustering algorithms to enable automatic generation of 3D visualizations. Based on prior knowledge, input can additionally include (i) 3D node positions, (ii) cluster memberships, or (iii) multi-level hierarchies, or (iv) edge directionality. Utilizing iCAVE, investigators from diverse fields can gain insights from large, heterogeneous datasets and optimize the quality of their visualizations using different node color, size, and transparency options, as well as various edge weight, thickness, transparency, and directionality options. Network topological properties and centrality are also reported. While not extensive, the COMBO database enables disease researchers to conduct a quick query of their interactions among genes, drugs, and disease phenotypes.</p>
    <p>We designed iCAVE with a modular software structure to create a general and flexible community resource. Users with intermediate programming experience can add algorithms for network layout, cluster layout, or graph clustering without affecting the core functionality of the code. They can also add datasets to COMBO. iCAVE is at the leading edge of immersive 3D network visualization. More user and case studies are needed to understand how best we can make use of immersion, stereoscopy, and 3D. Other layouts could possibly work well within 3D or immersive 3D, which we will explore further in future studies. We hope that iCAVE will encourage both programmers and biologists to enter the world of 3D human–computer interfaces, in response to the growing demands in exploring large complex data, and to facilitate further developments.</p>

After layout coordinates are calculated, iCAVE utilizes OpenGL API for visualization. New algorithms are added as separate .cpp files, and the corresponding header files are imported to the main program (vrnetview.cpp).</p>

      <p>“Neighborhood connectivity metric” assists in identifying modularity, where small interconnected subgraphs may potentially represent specific enzymes, structures, or processes [<xref rid="bib78" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>, <xref rid="bib79" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>] and provide significant insights into perturbed disease mechanisms. For example, the degree of gene co-expression correlates strongly with the complexity of an embedded motif [<xref rid="bib80" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>].</p>
      <p>“Network average and local clustering coefficients” quantify the connectivity of the whole network or a single node. The local clustering coefficient is the ratio between the numbers of edges that connect the neighbors of a node versus the maximum possible number of edges. The network average clustering coefficient is the average of the local clustering coefficients of all nodes [<xref rid="bib81" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>]. Only nodes that belong to networks with &gt;3 nodes are considered. The range of coefficient values varies from 0 (no interconnection) to 1 (perfect interconnection).</p>
      <p>“Network closeness centrality and node closeness centrality” quantifies the velocity of information flow within a network (the reciprocal sum of the shortest paths from a selected node to all other nodes) [<xref rid="bib82" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>]. Only nodes in subnetworks with &gt;3 nodes are evaluated. When the shortest paths are calculated, each edge is scaled with corresponding weight, which can be a floating value. The average of all node closeness centrality values is the network closeness centrality value.</p>
      <p>“Network diameter” is the length of shortest path between the 2 farthest nodes. Unconnected nodes are not considered. Irregular networks usually have small diameters, while regular networks have large diameters.</p>
      <p>“Betweenness centrality” is a global metric on the importance of a node, which is equal to the number of shortest paths from all vertices to all others that pass through that node, calculating the “load” on a node [<xref rid="bib83" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>]. Real-world, scale-free networks usually involve short path lengths across the network, and a few nodes have high betweenness centrality. “Connector” or “high-traffic” biomolecules that are vulnerable to targeted attacks usually suggest potential non-hub drug targets [<xref rid="bib84" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>–<xref rid="bib86" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>].</p>
      <p>“Shared nearest neighbors” is a similarity metric based on the sharing of nearest neighbors between any 2 nodes, particularly useful in network topology-based motif, sub-graph, or cluster identification.</p>
      <p>“Shortest paths” quantifies the importance of a node within the network, calculated by the number of shortest paths going through the node. Purely random graphs exhibit a small average shortest path length (∼the logarithm of the number of nodes) along with a small clustering coefficient.</p>

      <title>Layout algorithms</title>
      <p>A graph <italic>G(V = {1, …, n}, E)</italic> represents a binary relation <italic>E</italic> over node set <italic>V</italic>. iCAVE both extends classical layouts to 3D and offers novel algorithms. Based on the underlying topology, a user can choose the best layout that helps with data interpretation. We provide below the details of algorithms we have implemented in iCAVE. Algorithms 1–5 are 3D extensions of 2D network layout algorithms that are based on the classical force-directed layout. In addition, we introduce two new layout algorithms, semantic layers and hemispherical, that we have developed to take advantage of the third dimension:

In the first phase, the graph is coarsened until it reaches a minimum size (default = 3) or it does not coarsen more than a specific coarsening rate (default = 0.75).

Long edges are cut based on a specified edge-cut value between 0 (no cut, resulting in standard FR) and 1 (aggressive cutting).

      <title>Network clustering and bundling algorithms</title>
      <p>The “edge-betweenness clustering algorithm” is an edge with a high EB value that potentially connects two or more “communities.” The edge with the highest EB value is removed at each step. The number of edges to be removed is user-defined (with a default of 0.2 times the number of edges). Any edge that leads to a single-node cluster is not removed.</p>
      <p>The “edge bundling algorithm” is based on application of forces (electrostatic and spring) on an edge subdivided into multiple points. Edge compatibility metrics edge angle, scale (length), position, and visual compatibility are multiplied for total compatibility. If two edges are compatible above a threshold, forces are calculated and added to each subdivision, and those subdivisions are bundled together.</p>
