    <abstract>
      <p>We read with considerable interest the study by Gusenbauer and Haddaway (Gusenbauer and Haddaway, 2020, Research Synthesis Methods, doi:10.1002/jrsm.1378) comparing the systematic search qualities of 28 search systems, including Google Scholar (GS) and PubMed. Google Scholar and PubMed are the two most popular free academic search tools in biology and chemistry, with GS being the number one search tool in the world. Those academics using GS as their principal system for literature searches may be unaware of research which enumerates five critical features for scientific literature tools that greatly influenced Gusenbauer's 2020 study. Using this list as the framework for a targeted comparison between just GS and PubMed, we found stark differences which overwhelmingly favored PubMed. In this comment, we show that by comparing the characteristics of the two search tools, features that are particularly useful in one search tool, but are missing in the other, are strikingly spotlighted. One especially popular feature that ubiquitously appears in GS, but not in PubMed, is the forward citation search found under every citation as a clickable <italic>Cited by N</italic> link. We seek to improve the PubMed search experience using two approaches. First, we request that PubMed add <italic>Cited by N</italic> links, making them as omnipresent as the GS links. Second, we created an open‐source command‐line tool, <italic>pmidcite</italic>, which is used alongside PubMed to give information to researchers to help with the choice of the next paper to examine, analogous to how GS's <italic>Cited by N</italic> links help to guide users. Find <italic>pmidcite</italic> at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/dvklopfenstein/pmidcite">https://github.com/dvklopfenstein/pmidcite</ext-link>.</p>

    <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
    <p>Modern literature reviews are primarily performed using online search engines.<xref rid="jrsm1456-bib-0001" ref-type="ref"><sup>1</sup></xref>, <xref rid="jrsm1456-bib-0002" ref-type="ref"><sup>2</sup></xref> The two most popular free academic search tools that are commonly used in health studies are PubMed and Google Scholar (GS).<xref rid="jrsm1456-bib-0003" ref-type="ref"><sup>3</sup></xref> Researchers worldwide are drawn to GS as the most common starting point for literature searches<xref rid="jrsm1456-bib-0001" ref-type="ref"><sup>1</sup></xref>, <xref rid="jrsm1456-bib-0003" ref-type="ref"><sup>3</sup></xref>, <xref rid="jrsm1456-bib-0004" ref-type="ref"><sup>4</sup></xref>, <xref rid="jrsm1456-bib-0005" ref-type="ref"><sup>5</sup></xref> because of its intuitive and familiar search interface,<xref rid="jrsm1456-bib-0001" ref-type="ref"><sup>1</sup></xref>, <xref rid="jrsm1456-bib-0006" ref-type="ref"><sup>6</sup></xref> a forward citation search <italic>Cited by N</italic> link under every document result, a <italic>Cite</italic> link to download a document's citation to bibliographic management software such as EndNote for every document result, high citation counts, immense literature coverage, and researcher profile pages. GS's massive citation count, reflected in the “N” in their <italic>Cited by N</italic> links is due to their highly effective web crawlers and to agreements with publishing houses (<xref rid="jrsm1456-supitem-0003" ref-type="supplementary-material">Data S3</xref>, Figure 13).</p>
    <p>But the GS search interface has severe deficiencies that make literature searches laborious and, most importantly, unreproducible. However, many researchers are unaware of the drawbacks of GS.<xref rid="jrsm1456-bib-0007" ref-type="ref"><sup>7</sup></xref> For example, search results for a given query are dropped from one month to another,<xref rid="jrsm1456-bib-0003" ref-type="ref"><sup>3</sup></xref>, <xref rid="jrsm1456-bib-0008" ref-type="ref"><sup>8</sup></xref>, <xref rid="jrsm1456-bib-0009" ref-type="ref"><sup>9</sup></xref>, <xref rid="jrsm1456-bib-0010" ref-type="ref"><sup>10</sup></xref> with no documentation as to what has been dropped. Additionally, there is no way to download full search results in bulk,<xref rid="jrsm1456-bib-0007" ref-type="ref"><sup>7</sup></xref>, <xref rid="jrsm1456-bib-0008" ref-type="ref"><sup>8</sup></xref> resulting in the need to click and click and click to page through up to a maximum of 1000 search results, 10 or 20 results at a time (<xref rid="jrsm1456-supitem-0003" ref-type="supplementary-material">Data S3</xref>, Figure 12). And there is no direct access in GS to a paper's digital object identifier (DOI), which is a unique standardized persistent identifier.</p>
    <p>It is important to call out the features and shortcomings of both PubMed and GS following two recent events. First, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) published a paper on October 11, 2019 announcing the NIH Open Citation Collection (NIH‐OCC), a free public citation database with citation data available for download in bulk.<xref rid="jrsm1456-bib-0011" ref-type="ref"><sup>11</sup></xref> Citation records in the NIH‐OCC database are accessible through a set of web and Application Programming Interface (API) tools, collectively called “iCite.” Second, on November 18, 2019 the U.S. National Library of Medicine (NLM) announced that the new PubMed<xref rid="jrsm1456-bib-0012" ref-type="ref"><sup>12</sup></xref>, <xref rid="jrsm1456-bib-0013" ref-type="ref"><sup>13</sup></xref> was available.<xref rid="jrsm1456-bib-0014" ref-type="ref"><sup>14</sup></xref> Highlights of the new PubMed include: a nimble mobile experience from a single responsive website for all screen sizes including mobile phones, tablets, and desktop computers; faster and more comprehensive search response; and advanced search features that GS simply lacks.</p>
    <p>While we argue that PubMed is superior to GS in many ways, there is room to improve the literature search user experience in PubMed. We compare the “forward citation search” implementation in GS to that of PubMed, finding that the PubMed user experience can be improved by adding a GS feature to the PubMed Graphical User Interface (GUI). Alternatively, command‐line users can immediately augment their PubMed search results using the <italic>pmidcite</italic> scripts and library, which download citation data from the NIH‐OCC database using NIH's “iCite” API.</p>

    <title>SCIENTIFIC SEARCH INTERFACE REQUIREMENTS</title>
    <p>Many researchers are unaware that there is more than one type of search,<xref rid="jrsm1456-bib-0008" ref-type="ref"><sup>8</sup></xref>, <xref rid="jrsm1456-bib-0015" ref-type="ref"><sup>15</sup></xref>, <xref rid="jrsm1456-bib-0016" ref-type="ref"><sup>16</sup></xref>, <xref rid="jrsm1456-bib-0017" ref-type="ref"><sup>17</sup></xref> with each search type oriented to different user goals. All search tools are not appropriate for all search types. Three types of search include lookup tasks, exploratory search, and systematic search.</p>
    <p>Lookup tasks are the most basic kind of search, usually involving a single query to obtain a well‐defined result. An example of a lookup task is searching for a specific paper by entering its title into the query box. GS excels at returning papers when provided with their title, even if there are errors in the query title text. Fellow researchers have complained that PubMed will sometimes not find a title if it is spelled incorrectly. Gehanno et al found that 100% of the 738 papers in their study were found using GS to search for each paper by entering its title into the query box.<xref rid="jrsm1456-bib-0018" ref-type="ref"><sup>18</sup></xref> From this, they concluded that GS could be used in systematic reviews.<xref rid="jrsm1456-bib-0018" ref-type="ref"><sup>18</sup></xref> This conclusion was quickly disputed by Giustini and Boulos whose paper is titled, “<italic>Google Scholar Is Not Enough to Be Used Alone for Systematic Reviews</italic>.”<xref rid="jrsm1456-bib-0019" ref-type="ref"><sup>19</sup></xref>
</p>
    <p>Exploratory search and systematic search are useful in evidence synthesis. The goal of exploratory search is the acquisition of new knowledge and is considered to be demanding and potentially time‐consuming for the researcher.<xref rid="jrsm1456-bib-0016" ref-type="ref"><sup>16</sup></xref> A researcher doing an exploratory search uses a number of queries to iteratively learn about a subject. The queries begin with a rudimentary understanding of the subject matter and become honed as the researcher's knowledge increases through the search process.<xref rid="jrsm1456-bib-0015" ref-type="ref"><sup>15</sup></xref> Search tools like Google are frequently used in exploratory searches because they are made to be “user friendly” to increase user engagement, which benefits Google by making their market bigger.<xref rid="jrsm1456-bib-0008" ref-type="ref"><sup>8</sup></xref> Google, with their user‐friendly interface nearly always returns search results, but the search results that are missing can not be known. Additionally, GS is not designed for systematic searches where researchers need control over the selection power of the query results.</p>
    <p>Systematic search is profoundly different than exploratory search. The goal of systematic search is to catalyze an objective account of the cumulative state of evidence for a specific research question. An example research question is “What is the best treatment for lupus nephritis that was classified as stage IV on a renal biopsy<xref rid="jrsm1456-bib-0017" ref-type="ref"><sup>17</sup></xref>?” A well‐founded question addresses a clinical need where there is uncertainty regarding the effects of different interventions, which may vary in practice.<xref rid="jrsm1456-bib-0017" ref-type="ref"><sup>17</sup></xref> The goal is to understand the costs and benefits of various treatments, so that together the doctor and patient can make an appropriate choice for their particular situation. Systematic reviews are an exacting evidence syntheses featuring numerous rigorous steps documented in method guidelines<xref rid="jrsm1456-bib-0020" ref-type="ref"><sup>20</sup></xref> with the goal of providing an exhaustive synthesis of a well‐studied area of research.<xref rid="jrsm1456-bib-0008" ref-type="ref"><sup>8</sup></xref>
</p>
    <p>Cochrane is one of the organizations that participate in systematic reviews.<xref rid="jrsm1456-bib-0008" ref-type="ref"><sup>8</sup></xref> Steps in a Cochrane systematic review include creating the research question, building a team of people that includes those that have previously done a systematic review, writing or updating a protocol for the review, and having the protocol reviewed. Only after those steps, the systematic search using search tools begins by attempting to find all published and unpublished literature that may answer the research question. First and second authors work independently to remove irrelevant results and upon completion, compare their findings. Many other steps occur, which are all reviewed, under the umbrella of data synthesis and specialized plots, data interpretation, and data presentation. Finally, the review is written. To learn more, we recommend researchers read “How to write a Cochrane systematic review.”<xref rid="jrsm1456-bib-0017" ref-type="ref"><sup>17</sup></xref>
</p>

The number of search results appears at the top of the list as “N result” in PubMed and “About N results” in GS. If “N” is less than 1000 results in GS, researchers may think they can copy and paste all “N” results, 20 citations at a time, by clicking, and clicking and clicking, advancing slowly through the search results. But researchers may be surprised to find that even if “N” is less than 1000 in GS, some of the “N” results may be missing.<xref rid="jrsm1456-bib-0009" ref-type="ref"><sup>9</sup></xref>
</p>
      <p>PubMed can display 10, 20, 50, 100, or 200 results at a time on one page. GS can display 10 or 20 results. Clicking “Show more” in PubMed causes another set of results to be appended to the current results on the screen. The previous result sets are visible by scrolling up or pressing the browsers back button, which will cause the view to move to the previous divider and will not cause any results to disappear.</p>
      <p>The “best match” relevance sort ordering in PubMed, described in a recent freely available peer‐reviewed research article,<xref rid="jrsm1456-bib-0025" ref-type="ref"><sup>25</sup></xref> uses a modern machine learning algorithm that is trained with aggregated user searches. The “best match” algorithm uses dozens of features to sort a list of citations, but its developers find that the most important document features are publication year and past usage.

      <p>In GS, the requirements are the article must be contained in a pdf file whose contents include a title, list of authors, and bibliography, and uploaded to a website. The affect of GS's regularly crawled data and loose indexing policies is that GS indexes records that are non‐academic. For example, the GS policies for “author manuscripts” has resulted in a number of lunch menus that are stored as a pdf file online to be indexed as scholarly citations in GS with various food items being listed as authors (<xref rid="jrsm1456-supitem-0003" ref-type="supplementary-material">Data S3</xref>, Figure 10 and 11).</p>
      <p>Additionally, some researchers have demonstrated that it is possible to deliberately trick the crawler and inflate the GS citation score.<xref rid="jrsm1456-bib-0036" ref-type="ref"><sup>36</sup></xref>

    <title>FORWARD CITATION SEARCH</title>
    <p>The NIH Open Citation Collection (NIH‐OCC),<xref rid="jrsm1456-bib-0011" ref-type="ref"><sup>11</sup></xref> is a free public citation database, which liberates researchers from the constraints of citation data that were previously locked behind barriers, such as citation lists which were not downloadable in bulk. Having full access to citation data could allow researchers to perform more efficient literature searches and analyze publishing trends in biomedicine.</p>
    <p>The NIH citation database differs from GS's citation database in coverage, usability, and content. The coverage and content of GS is huge and covers many disciplines, while the coverage of the NIH citation database is limited currently to about 30.5 million manuscripts that were assigned a PubMed ID (PMID). The usability of iCite citations is extremely high because they are accessible for free through the NIH “iCite” web site and downloadable in bulk through the NIH Application Programming Interface (API). Citations can not be downloaded in bulk in GS.</p>
    <p>The citation counts in GS will be higher because their index is massive. We have not experienced that the differing citation counts when using <italic>pmidcite</italic> vs GS are a hindrance during exploratory search tasks because the data needed to decide the next paper to investigate is how one paper performs relative to another. If all citation counts are scaled down in NIH's “iCite” compared to GS, we still can successfully compare the performance of papers relative to one another.</p>
    <p>Additionally, in NIH's “iCite,” new papers are easy to find and compare, even if they have few citations. Having the data, even if it is scaled down compared to GS, to choose the next paper will speed the exploratory literature search faster than having all of the citations that are available in GS, but not available in other search systems. Once the researcher has become familiar with the subject through their exploratory literature search, then they may choose to use GS to see what might have been missed.</p>
    <p>We have tested the practical usage of a <italic>Cited by N</italic> link by creating a set of command‐line interface (CLI) scripts and a Python library, called <italic>pmidcite</italic>, which glue PubMed search results and NIH's “iCite” citation data together using PMIDs to provide functionality that is equivalent to having the <italic>Cited by N</italic> link. The results were so successful that we hope PubMed can expand the access to all biomedical researchers, even if they do not use a CLI by adding the links, <italic>Cited by N</italic> and <italic>N References</italic> (<xref rid="jrsm1456-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">Data S1</xref>, Figure 6), to the PubMed GUI as soon as possible.</p>

      <title><styled-content style="fixed-case" toggle="no">NIH</styled-content>'s <styled-content style="fixed-case" toggle="no">iCite</styled-content></title>
      <p>PubMed does not have a clickable <italic>Cited by N</italic> link for all the citations, making it difficult to choose the next paper to investigate (<xref rid="jrsm1456-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">Data S1</xref>, Figures 5 and 6). But equivalent functionality can be had if, for a selected paper, the researcher downloads from PubMed the full list of citing papers as a list of PMIDs (<xref rid="jrsm1456-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">Data S1</xref>, Figure 7) and uploads this PMID list of citations to iCite for analysis (<xref rid="jrsm1456-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">Data S1</xref>, Figure 8). The list can then be sorted in the “citations” Table (<xref rid="jrsm1456-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">Data S1</xref>, Figure 9, red 2) by <italic>Total Citations</italic> by clicking on the <italic>Total Citations</italic> column header under the <italic>OpenCites</italic> Table (<xref rid="jrsm1456-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">Data S1</xref>, Figure 9, red 3).</p>
      <p>But comparing papers only using its number of citations is problematic because papers in small niche fields may get considerably less citations than papers in large fields because both papers may be of relatively equal scientific influence in their respective communities. The NIH normalizes the number of citations that a paper receives by comparing it to the citation numbers of papers in its co‐citation networks. This measurement is called the Relative Citation Ratio (RCR)<xref rid="jrsm1456-bib-0037" ref-type="ref"><sup>37</sup></xref> and can be used to sort a list of PMIDs. Only citation count is offered by GS and it cannot be used for sorting search results.</p>

      <title>pmidcite</title>
      <p>Functionality equivalent to having a <italic>Cited by N</italic> link can be had from the command‐line shown in the following example using a selected paper with a PMID of 25 505 874 by typing “icite 25505874 – verbose” and pressing the “Enter” button. This causes citation counts to be downloaded from NIH's iCite and a report to be written to the screen or to a file. In the report, the number of citations is seen under the “cit” column for the user‐requested paper (“TOP”), the full list of it's citing papers (“CIT”) and references (“REF”)<inline-graphic xlink:href="JRSM-12-126-g002.jpg" xlink:title="image"/>:</p>

    <title>CONCLUSIONS</title>
    <p>We hope to raise awareness that there are various types of search, including lookup tasks, exploratory search, and systematic search. Each search type requires unique search system features. GS is the system used as the starting point of most searches, rather than specialized tools like PubMed, by most researchers due to its intuitive, accessible interface, fast response, and best in class coverage.<xref rid="jrsm1456-bib-0003" ref-type="ref"><sup>3</sup></xref> GS excels for simple lookup tasks, like finding a paper by entering its title in the query box.<xref rid="jrsm1456-bib-0019" ref-type="ref"><sup>19</sup></xref>
</p>
    <p>Both GS and PubMed can be used for exploratory searches, but we urge biomedical researchers to use PubMed rather than GS, because PubMed is one of the top recommended primary sources for literature searches of peer‐reviewed research in the biomedical sciences and has search feature criteria that GS has lacked since its inception. CLI users, especially, should consider using PubMed with search results annotated using NIH's “iCite” citation data because this functionality is available immediately through <italic>pmidcite</italic>.</p>
    <p>Searching using the PubMed interface is a satisfying experience, even without the addition of the <italic>Cited by N</italic> link. But we hope that PubMed will soon add a clickable citation count link to every document entry in the search results list and to each paper listed in the document page sections, <italic>similar articles</italic>, <italic>cited by</italic>, <italic>references</italic>, and <italic>suggested reading</italic> so PubMed GUI users can enjoy similar benefits as CLI users.</p>
    <p>GS fails to implement the required search criteria for systematic searches<xref rid="jrsm1456-bib-0007" ref-type="ref"><sup>7</sup></xref> and should not be used as a primary search tool for systematic reviews.<xref rid="jrsm1456-bib-0007" ref-type="ref"><sup>7</sup></xref> However, GS can be used as a secondary source.<xref rid="jrsm1456-bib-0008" ref-type="ref"><sup>8</sup></xref>
</p>
    <p>Finally, we urge researchers to read the Gusenbauer and Haddaway paper to see how their own specialized search tool is or can be evaluated among the 28 extensively used academic search systems in the Gusenbauer study.</p>
