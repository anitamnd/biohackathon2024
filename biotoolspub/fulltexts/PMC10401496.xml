      <p>Predicting
peptide detectability
is useful in a variety of mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics
applications, particularly targeted proteomics. However, most machine
learning-based computational methods have relied solely on information
from the peptide itself, such as its amino acid sequences or physicochemical
properties, despite the fact that peptides detected by MS are dependent
on many factors, including protein sample preparation, digestion,
separation, ionization, and precursor selection during MS experiments.
DbyDeep (Detectability by Deep learning) is an innovative end-to-end
LSTM network model for peptide detectability prediction that incorporates
sequence contexts of peptides and their cleavage sites (by protease).
Utilizing the cleavage site contexts could improve the performance
of prediction, and DbyDeep outperformed existing methods in predicting
peptides recognizable from multiple MS/MS data sets with diverse species
and MS instruments. We argue for the necessity of a learning model
that encompasses several contexts associated with peptide detection,
as opposed to depending just on peptide sequences. There is a Python
implementation of DbyDeep at <uri xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://github.com/BISCodeRepo/DbyDeep">https://github.com/BISCodeRepo/DbyDeep</uri>.</p>

    <title>Introduction</title>
    <p>Proteomics allows for the detection and
quantification of proteins
for disease and cell biology research.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref></sup> In the bottom-up approach commonly used in shotgun proteomics, protein
mixtures are first digested into peptides by enzymes, and the digested
peptides are separated, ionized, and fragmented using high-performance
liquid chromatography (HPLC) coupled with tandem mass spectrometry
(MS/MS) instruments. Finally, the generated MS/MS spectra are examined
using database search techniques to identify matching peptides. The
bottom-up method permits the rapid and precise identification of a
large number of proteins but not all probable peptides derived from
the proteins. While some peptides are detected consistently across
experiments, others are detected infrequently or not at all. These
frequently detected peptides are not necessarily derived from the
most abundant proteins, establishing the concept of peptide detectability,
which represents how peptides are preferentially identified by MS.</p>
    <p>The detectability of peptides has been adopted in various MS applications.
In MS-based targeted proteomics, such as multiple reaction monitoring
(MRM) investigations, it is essential to design an MRM assay employing
“proteotypic” peptides, i.e., peptides that are unique
to target proteins and preferentially observable in MS experiments.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref></sup> Using peptide spectral libraries such as PRIDE
and MassIVE, proteotypic peptides can be collected empirically; however,
this method cannot be applied to proteins that have never been observed
by MS. In such circumstances, it would be incredibly valuable if we
could compute peptide detectability and predict proteotypic peptides,
for instance, by the application of machine learning techniques. Predicting
peptide detectability (i.e., quantifying the likelihood of peptide
identification) is not simple because it is dependent on a number
of variables, such as the abundance of proteins in a sample,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref></sup> the digestibility of proteins to peptides, the
ionization of peptides to MS precursors, and the fragmentation of
precursors to generate MS/MS spectra.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref></sup></p>
    <p>Computational methods for peptide detectability prediction have
utilized amino acid composition and AAindex features.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref></sup> Many machine learning models such as multilayer perceptron
(MLP), Gaussian, support vector machine (SVM), and random forest have
been employed to investigate combinations of dozens of or hundreds
of features.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>−<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref></sup> AP3 estimated the peptide detectability based on a random forest
classifier using 29 features.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref></sup> Recent advances
in deep learning have spawned a variety of methodologies based on
peptide sequences. DeepMSpeptide adopted a peptide sequence-based
one-dimensional–convolutional neural network (1D-CNN),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref></sup> and DeepDIA constructed a hybrid model based
on CNNs and bidirectional long-term and short-term memory (Bi-LSTM)
networks.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref></sup> PepFormer proposed transformer
embedding for the peptide sequence and the Siamese gated recurrent
unit (GRU) setup.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref></sup> In addition, they employed
the contrastive loss and cross entropy as an objective function to
properly evaluate the detectability label. A capsule network (CapsNet)
and convolutional block attention module (CBAM) were presented as
a hybrid model to examine the interrelationship of peptide sequences.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref></sup></p>
    <p>On the one hand, protein proteolytic digestion
in the bottom-up
proteomics closely links peptide digestibility to peptide detectability
so that only regularly digested peptides can be identified by MS/MS.
Physicochemical properties and the sequence contexts surrounding the
cleavage sites of identified peptides have also been proposed for
the prediction of cleavage sites. Several machine learning techniques,
including SVM,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref></sup> random forest,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref></sup> CNN/LSTM,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref></sup> and frequency-based information
theory,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref></sup> were employed to learn the N-mer
surrounding a cleavage site. Most methods have viewed cleavage site
prediction as a binary classification problem (cleaved or not). As
illustrated in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref></xref>, it has been ignored that certain cleavage sites are both cleaved
and not cleaved (i.e., missed). Cleavage site 3 in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref></xref> is, for example, missed for
one peptide but cleaved for the other two. In previous studies, such
multilabel sites were either disregarded or considered to have a single
label in terms of binary classification.</p>

their observed frequencies in MassIVE-KB. The aligned protein region
contains six cleavage sites in red. Based on identified peptides,
cleavage sites could be labeled as 1) cleaved or 2) missed. Certain
sites such as sites 2 and 3 are occasionally both cleaved and missed
(i.e., multilabel). For example, cleavage site 3 is missed by peptide
HREICTIQSSGGIMLLK, whereas it is cleaved for peptides EICTIQSSGGIMLLK
and VMDGLLVIAMNKHR.</p>

    <p>DbyDeep is an end-to-end
LSTM network model that
predicts the detectability
of peptides by simultaneously embedding the peptide sequence and cleavage
site contexts. DbyDeep does not require handcrafted feature selection
or domain knowledge, and the embedding successfully overcomes the
multilabel problem of cleavage sites because the labels of cleavage
sites are not required. DbyDeep surpassed previous methods in predicting
peptides recognizable from several MS/MS data sets, regardless of
species and MS instruments, by boosting the area under the ROC curve
(AUC) by an average of 5.6%. The value of DbyDeep model architecture
was further proved by training multiple models with the same data
set and achieving the highest learning performance. Notably, DbyDeep
required the fewest model parameters for learning, enabling quick
training with a small dataset in a short amount of time. Depending
on the approach, the number of model parameters varied by up to 32,000
percent.</p>

      <title>Datasets for Training Peptide Detectability</title>
      <p>A list
of peptides was downloaded from the MassIVE-KB peptide spectral library,
which contains 1,075,832 peptides derived from 19,300 proteins and
was validated beforehand.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref></sup> To select regularly
digested peptides from proteins with high confidence in their identification,
we retained 408,207 fully tryptic peptides (including up to two missed
cleavages and ignoring modifications on peptides) from 12,042 proteins
with at least 50% sequence coverage. After in silico trypsin digestion
of the proteins allowing for up to two missed cleavages, the retained
408,207 unique peptides were classified as detectable (i.e., positive
data), whereas the remaining peptides were regarded as negative. Because
there were a great deal more negative than positive data, downsampling
was undertaken to achieve a balance between positive and negative
data. A peptide can have three distinct types of cleavage sites: 1)
N-terminal, 2) C-terminal, and 3) missed cleavage sites. Each cleavage
site is represented as a 15-mer, consisting of the cleavage site amino
acid, Lys (K) or Arg (R) for trypsin, plus its 7 flanking amino acids
on each side. There were 518,018 cleavage sites associated with the
peptides: 312,822 sites were observed as cleaved and 37,945 sites
were observed as noncleaved (i.e., missed cleavage sites inside peptides);
167,251 multilabel sites were both cleaved and noncleaved.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec2.2">
      <title>Architecture
of the DbyDeep Model</title>
      <p>A novel end-to-end
machine learning model was fed the peptide sequence and cleavage site
contexts as inputs. <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref> shows the DbyDeep model architecture, which consists of three
modules: 1) the peptide sequence representation module, 2) the cleavage
site representation module, and 3) the prediction module. First, a
peptide sequence was embedded into learnable vectors at the amino
acid level through embedding and LSTM layers. Consequently, a sequence
is expressed as a matrix of embedding vectors. The cleavage sites
were embedded in the same manner. Each module employs the identical
LSTM architecture but with different weight values. Finally, in the
prediction module, the output vectors from the two networks were concatenated
and supplied to the fully connected layer to predict detectability
of peptides.</p>
      <fig id="fig2" position="float">

      </fig>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec2.3">
      <title>Peptide Sequence Representation Module</title>
      <p>By label encoding,
a peptide amino acid sequence is converted to a one-dimensional token
in numeric form, such as 1 for alanine (A), 2 for arginine (R), etc.
The maximum length of a sequence is 81, and zero padding was applied
to shorter peptides. For instance, the peptide “EICTIQSSGGIMLLKDQVLR”
is encoded as [7, 10, 5, 17, 10, 6, 16, 16, 8, 8, 10, 13, 11, 11,
12, 4, 6, 20, 11, 2, 0, ... 0, 0]. Each amino acid is represented
as an embedding vector in the encoding of the peptide sequence, which
is written as a two-dimensional embedding matrix (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>A). LSTM is a useful learning
model for sequential data because it concurrently stores long-term
and short-term information using hidden states and cell states to
alleviate recurrent neural networks (RNNs)’ long-term redundancy
issue.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref></sup> We used bidirectional LSTM to
consider information at both N- and C-termini of peptides. The final
outputs of LSTM were concatenated and used as vectors to represent
the peptide.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec2.4">
      <title>Cleavage Site Representation Module</title>
      <p>Each peptide cleavage
site could be represented as a 15-mer, consisting the cleavage site
amino acid and its seven flanking amino acids on each side. The 15-mer
amino acid sequence is embedded in a two-dimensional matrix using
the same technique as the module for peptide sequence representation.
As depicted in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>B, four embeddings were conducted for four cleavage sites per peptide
because a maximum of two missed cleavages were allowed.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec2.5">
      <title>Prediction
Module</title>
      <p>The last fully connected layer predicts
the peptide detectability. Its input was constructed by concatenating
the vectors from the peptide sequence representation and cleavage
site representation modules, and its output was a value between 0
and 1 from the sigmoid unit. If the output value exceeded 0.5, it
was considered positive (i.e., detectable); otherwise, it was classified
as negative. As the classifier loss function, the binary-cross-entropy
function was employed.<disp-formula id="ueq1"><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="ac3c00460_m001" position="anchor"/></disp-formula></p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec2.6">
      <title>Experimental Setting for Training and Validation</title>
      <p>We
trained the DbyDeep model using 408,207 positive peptides and the
same number of negative peptides. The positive peptide sequences were
unique (modifications on peptides were eliminated), and negatives
were selected at random from in silico protein digestion (see “<xref rid="sec2.1" ref-type="other">Datasets for Training Peptide Detectability</xref>”
for details). We used the open source framework tensorflow (version
2.4.0). Twenty percent was used for holdout testing, and fifteen percent
was used for validation. The training, validation, and test datasets
contained 536,492, 134,124, and 170,367 peptides, respectively. For
the peptide sequence, the embedding size was 32 and a bidirectional
LSTM layer comprised 32 units, whereas for cleavage sites, the embedding
size was 16 and a bidirectional LSTM layer comprised 16 units. Each
input is concatenated to 80 dimensions, and the ReLU activation function
is utilized in the fully connected layer. The batch size was 256,
and an early stopping strategy (200 epochs) was adopted to avoid overfitting.
The ADAM optimizer was used and the learning rate was 5 × 10<sup>–4</sup>.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec2.7">
      <title>Performance Comparison with Existing Methods</title>
      <p>To examine
the efficacy of DbyDeep, we first adopted the strategy and dataset
presented by DeepMSpeptide,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref></sup> which used
MS evidence from the HPP (Human Proteome Project) for human proteomes.
In brief, the dataset consisted of 3 nonoverlapping groups: 1) proteins

      <p>In addition, the usefulness of DbyDeep was demonstrated
by predicting
identifiable peptides from various MS/MS data sets with different

      <title>Performance Evaluation Using HPP Datasets</title>
      <p>To demonstrate
the utility of DbyDeep, comparisons were done with existing machine
learning-based peptide detectability prediction models, such as DeepMSpeptide,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref></sup> PepFormer,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref></sup> and
CapsNet+CBAM.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref></sup> Each tool was applied to
estimate the detectability of peptides in three groups for the HPP
dataset: 1) MS evidence (PE1) in 2019; 2) missing proteins (MPs) without
MS evidence in 2011, which, however, became PE1 proteins in 2019;
and 3) MPs in 2019 (see Methods for more details). The HPP dataset
and the DbyDeep training dataset were separate. <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref></xref> clearly shows that DbyDeep outperforms all
other models. DbyDeep reported high detectability for all peptides
in PE1 and recognized MP groups, while some peptides from MPs in 2019
were predicted with high detectability, indicating that the MPs may
be discovered in the future despite the fact that they are currently
missing proteins.</p>

      <title>Application to Various Data Sets</title>
      <p>DbyDeep was applied
to predict peptides identifiable from various MS/MS data sets (independent
of the training set) with different species and MS instruments (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref></xref>A). The protein sequences
of matching species were downloaded from Swiss-Prot, and hypothetical
peptides were generated via in silico digestion (see Methods for more
details). Different algorithms (DeepMSpeptide,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref></sup> DeepDIA,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref></sup> PepFormer,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref></sup> and CapsNet+CBAM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref></sup>) were used to predict detectable peptides, which were then compared
with peptides identified by Comet<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref></sup> and
MS-GF+<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref></sup> searches of multiple MS/MS data
sets. <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref></xref>B depicts
the AUCs of the prediction comparison on the six data sets. Regardless
of database search method, DbyDeep outperformed the other tools across
all six data sets, increasing the AUC by an average of 5.6% for Comet
search (solid lines) and 5.4% for MS-GF+ search (dashed lines). Different
experimental conditions and search methods led to variations in the
identified peptides, resulting in significantly different positive
and negative sets; for example, Comet and MS-GF+ identified different
numbers of peptides for the same data set and Comet identified different
numbers of peptides in two data sets from the same species (e.g.,
134,690 and 56,743 for two humans). It is possible for a peptide to
be positive in one data set but negative in another. DbyDeep consistently
demonstrated the highest performance regardless of species, MS instruments,
and the size of identified peptides (i.e., the size of the positive
set). The utility of DbyDeep was also demonstrated for open search
results using pFind<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref></sup> and MSFragger,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref></sup> which can identify modified peptides in an unrestrictive
manner (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.analchem.3c00460/suppl_file/ac3c00460_si_001.pdf">Figure S2</ext-link>). In general, distinct
search tools yield somewhat distinct results for the same data set.
We evaluated the predicted detectability of peptides that were identified
consistently by multiple search tools, which thus have a high likelihood
of being predicted to be detectable (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.analchem.3c00460/suppl_file/ac3c00460_si_001.pdf">Figure S3</ext-link>). DbyDeep predicted that the vast majority of peptides identified
by all search tools would be detectable.</p>

      <title>Model Evaluation on MassIVE-KB
Datasets</title>
      <p>To assess the
effectiveness of model designs, the learning performance of detectability
prediction models was compared using the same training data set. <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref></xref> depicts performance
metrics indicating that DbyDeep significantly outperforms the other
methods. DbyDeep achieved the highest scores on all performance measures:
accuracy (0.8391), sensitivity (0.8506), specificity (0.8278), and
precision (0.8278). In the ROC curves displayed in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref></xref>A, the AUC of DbyDeep is 0.9192,
which is 1.1, 1.4, 1.8, and 5.1% higher than those of PepFormer, CapsNet+CBAM,
DeepMspepide, and AP3, respectively. Notably, DbyDeep requires the
fewest model parameters required for training and may thus be rapidly
trained with a small dataset in a short amount of time. The number
of model parameters varied by up to 32,000%. <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref></xref> displays dashed lines for the ablation test
(DbyDeep_Ab), where only the peptide sequence feature was used as
an input to evaluate the efficacy of the cleavage site context feature.
The performance of the ablation model was comparable to that of PepFormer
that used only the peptide sequence feature. The performance drop
in the ablation test (e.g., 0.8% in AUC and 1.6% in sensitivity) revealed
that the cleavage site contexts were useful for the detectability
prediction.</p>
      <p>As trypsin digestion is quite efficient, peptides
with no missed cleavage sites are found substantially more frequently
in MS-based proteomics experiments than peptides with missed cleavage
sites. The limited observation of peptides containing missed cleavage
sites (i.e., the lack of positive samples) may make their detectability
difficult to anticipate. To measure the effect, we evaluated prediction
performance according to the number of missed cleavage sites within
peptides. <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref></xref> illustrates
the prediction performance of each tool. DbyDeep outperformed other
tools regardless of the number of missed cleavage sites within peptides;
its AUC, shown in red, was stable—0.8971 for peptides with
no missed cleavage site, 0.8715 for one, and 0.8866 for two. In contrast,
the AUC of AP3, shown in green, was drastically lowered with an increased
number of missed cleavage sites (0.7483 for two missed cleavage sites).
Sensitivity and specificity depended heavily on the number of missed
cleavage sites (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref></xref>B,6C). In all methods, the sensitivity decreased as the number of
missed cleavage sites increased, while the opposite holds for the
specificity, indicating a lack of positive training samples for peptides
with missed cleavage sites.</p>

    <title>Conclusions</title>
    <p>DbyDeep is the first method for predicting
peptide detectability
that accounts for the distinct behavior of the same cleavage site
on different peptides. The predicted peptide detectability can be
utilized to compile proteotypic peptides for MS-based targeted proteomics,
to score peptide-spectrum matches for peptide identification, and
to reduce the peptide database size for applications employing a huge
database such as proteogenomics and metaproteomics.</p>
    <p>Recent breakthroughs
in deep learning have spawned a variety of
peptide detectability prediction algorithms. DbyDeep outperformed
the existing methods in various evaluation tests. We want to emphasize
that DbyDeep has the fewest model parameters required for training.
In addition to RNN-based approaches such as GRU and LSTM, Transformer
models have also been adopted. In our test, there was no significant
difference in the predictive performance of the models (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.analchem.3c00460/suppl_file/ac3c00460_si_001.pdf">Figure S1</ext-link>). Transformer is a well-known NLP (natural
language processing) model for embedding sentences with more than
500 tokens. Given that the maximum peptide length is 40 amino acids,
the Transformer model yielded an excessively higher number of parameters
than required for predicting peptide detectability.</p>
    <p>In practice,
the true set of MS-detectable peptides would not be
well defined as the identified peptides may vary from experiment to
experiment. Even in technical replicates from the same sample, the
overlap between identified peptides is not 100%. Clearly, DbyDeep’s
great peptide detectability does not ensure the presence of the peptide
in every experiment. Peptide detection involves numerous variables.
Even though the peptides are experimentally ready to be detected,
the software’s algorithm inadequacy may impede peptide identification,
for instance. As a result, we aimed to develop a universal model capable
of predicting as many detectable peptides as possible and employed
the MassIVE-KB as a training set, which is the largest universal peptide
spectral library encompassing peptides identified in a variety of
investigations and circumstances. For particular experimental conditions,
transfer learning from the pretrained model is feasible. We demonstrated
that transfer learning can enhance prediction accuracy. Two data sets
used in this trial were obtained under the same experimental conditions
although their species were different (<italic>Mus musculus</italic> and <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref></sup> We used the <italic>M. musculus</italic> data set for transfer learning and then applied the transfer-learned
model to the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> data set
(this test was conducted for peptides identified by Comet). Remarkably,
the AUC of the pretrained model for the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> data set was 0.92 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref></xref>B), whereas the AUC of the transfer-learned model was 0.964.
It is worth noting that the prediction performance was substantially
improved even when the species of the data set for transfer learning
was different from that of the test data set.</p>
    <p>The current version
of DbyDeep works only for trypsin digestion,
but it could be expanded to predict the detectability of peptides
digested by other proteases if the peptide data were to be accumulated
in the future.</p>

      <p>Predicting
peptide detectability
is useful in a variety of mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics
applications, particularly targeted proteomics. However, most machine
learning-based computational methods have relied solely on information
from the peptide itself, such as its amino acid sequences or physicochemical
properties, despite the fact that peptides detected by MS are dependent
on many factors, including protein sample preparation, digestion,
separation, ionization, and precursor selection during MS experiments.
DbyDeep (Detectability by Deep learning) is an innovative end-to-end
LSTM network model for peptide detectability prediction that incorporates
sequence contexts of peptides and their cleavage sites (by protease).
Utilizing the cleavage site contexts could improve the performance
of prediction, and DbyDeep outperformed existing methods in predicting
peptides recognizable from multiple MS/MS data sets with diverse species
and MS instruments. We argue for the necessity of a learning model
that encompasses several contexts associated with peptide detection,
as opposed to depending just on peptide sequences. There is a Python
implementation of DbyDeep at <uri xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://github.com/BISCodeRepo/DbyDeep">https://github.com/BISCodeRepo/DbyDeep</uri>.</p>

    <title>Introduction</title>
    <p>Proteomics allows for the detection and
quantification of proteins
for disease and cell biology research.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref></sup> In the bottom-up approach commonly used in shotgun proteomics, protein
mixtures are first digested into peptides by enzymes, and the digested
peptides are separated, ionized, and fragmented using high-performance
liquid chromatography (HPLC) coupled with tandem mass spectrometry
(MS/MS) instruments. Finally, the generated MS/MS spectra are examined
using database search techniques to identify matching peptides. The
bottom-up method permits the rapid and precise identification of a
large number of proteins but not all probable peptides derived from
the proteins. While some peptides are detected consistently across
experiments, others are detected infrequently or not at all. These
frequently detected peptides are not necessarily derived from the
most abundant proteins, establishing the concept of peptide detectability,
which represents how peptides are preferentially identified by MS.</p>
    <p>The detectability of peptides has been adopted in various MS applications.
In MS-based targeted proteomics, such as multiple reaction monitoring
(MRM) investigations, it is essential to design an MRM assay employing
“proteotypic” peptides, i.e., peptides that are unique
to target proteins and preferentially observable in MS experiments.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref></sup> Using peptide spectral libraries such as PRIDE
and MassIVE, proteotypic peptides can be collected empirically; however,
this method cannot be applied to proteins that have never been observed
by MS. In such circumstances, it would be incredibly valuable if we
could compute peptide detectability and predict proteotypic peptides,
for instance, by the application of machine learning techniques. Predicting
peptide detectability (i.e., quantifying the likelihood of peptide
identification) is not simple because it is dependent on a number
of variables, such as the abundance of proteins in a sample,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref></sup> the digestibility of proteins to peptides, the
ionization of peptides to MS precursors, and the fragmentation of
precursors to generate MS/MS spectra.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref></sup></p>
    <p>Computational methods for peptide detectability prediction have
utilized amino acid composition and AAindex features.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref></sup> Many machine learning models such as multilayer perceptron
(MLP), Gaussian, support vector machine (SVM), and random forest have
been employed to investigate combinations of dozens of or hundreds
of features.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>−<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref></sup> AP3 estimated the peptide detectability based on a random forest
classifier using 29 features.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref></sup> Recent advances
in deep learning have spawned a variety of methodologies based on
peptide sequences. DeepMSpeptide adopted a peptide sequence-based
one-dimensional–convolutional neural network (1D-CNN),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref></sup> and DeepDIA constructed a hybrid model based
on CNNs and bidirectional long-term and short-term memory (Bi-LSTM)
networks.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref></sup> PepFormer proposed transformer
embedding for the peptide sequence and the Siamese gated recurrent
unit (GRU) setup.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref></sup> In addition, they employed
the contrastive loss and cross entropy as an objective function to
properly evaluate the detectability label. A capsule network (CapsNet)
and convolutional block attention module (CBAM) were presented as
a hybrid model to examine the interrelationship of peptide sequences.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref></sup></p>
    <p>On the one hand, protein proteolytic digestion
in the bottom-up
proteomics closely links peptide digestibility to peptide detectability
so that only regularly digested peptides can be identified by MS/MS.
Physicochemical properties and the sequence contexts surrounding the
cleavage sites of identified peptides have also been proposed for
the prediction of cleavage sites. Several machine learning techniques,
including SVM,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref></sup> random forest,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref></sup> CNN/LSTM,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref></sup> and frequency-based information
theory,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref></sup> were employed to learn the N-mer
surrounding a cleavage site. Most methods have viewed cleavage site
prediction as a binary classification problem (cleaved or not). As
illustrated in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref></xref>, it has been ignored that certain cleavage sites are both cleaved
and not cleaved (i.e., missed). Cleavage site 3 in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref></xref> is, for example, missed for
one peptide but cleaved for the other two. In previous studies, such
multilabel sites were either disregarded or considered to have a single
label in terms of binary classification.</p>

their observed frequencies in MassIVE-KB. The aligned protein region
contains six cleavage sites in red. Based on identified peptides,
cleavage sites could be labeled as 1) cleaved or 2) missed. Certain
sites such as sites 2 and 3 are occasionally both cleaved and missed
(i.e., multilabel). For example, cleavage site 3 is missed by peptide
HREICTIQSSGGIMLLK, whereas it is cleaved for peptides EICTIQSSGGIMLLK
and VMDGLLVIAMNKHR.</p>

    <p>DbyDeep is an end-to-end
LSTM network model that
predicts the detectability
of peptides by simultaneously embedding the peptide sequence and cleavage
site contexts. DbyDeep does not require handcrafted feature selection
or domain knowledge, and the embedding successfully overcomes the
multilabel problem of cleavage sites because the labels of cleavage
sites are not required. DbyDeep surpassed previous methods in predicting
peptides recognizable from several MS/MS data sets, regardless of
species and MS instruments, by boosting the area under the ROC curve
(AUC) by an average of 5.6%. The value of DbyDeep model architecture
was further proved by training multiple models with the same data
set and achieving the highest learning performance. Notably, DbyDeep
required the fewest model parameters for learning, enabling quick
training with a small dataset in a short amount of time. Depending
on the approach, the number of model parameters varied by up to 32,000
percent.</p>

      <title>Datasets for Training Peptide Detectability</title>
      <p>A list
of peptides was downloaded from the MassIVE-KB peptide spectral library,
which contains 1,075,832 peptides derived from 19,300 proteins and
was validated beforehand.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref></sup> To select regularly
digested peptides from proteins with high confidence in their identification,
we retained 408,207 fully tryptic peptides (including up to two missed
cleavages and ignoring modifications on peptides) from 12,042 proteins
with at least 50% sequence coverage. After in silico trypsin digestion
of the proteins allowing for up to two missed cleavages, the retained
408,207 unique peptides were classified as detectable (i.e., positive
data), whereas the remaining peptides were regarded as negative. Because
there were a great deal more negative than positive data, downsampling
was undertaken to achieve a balance between positive and negative
data. A peptide can have three distinct types of cleavage sites: 1)
N-terminal, 2) C-terminal, and 3) missed cleavage sites. Each cleavage
site is represented as a 15-mer, consisting of the cleavage site amino
acid, Lys (K) or Arg (R) for trypsin, plus its 7 flanking amino acids
on each side. There were 518,018 cleavage sites associated with the
peptides: 312,822 sites were observed as cleaved and 37,945 sites
were observed as noncleaved (i.e., missed cleavage sites inside peptides);
167,251 multilabel sites were both cleaved and noncleaved.</p>

      <title>Architecture
of the DbyDeep Model</title>
      <p>A novel end-to-end
machine learning model was fed the peptide sequence and cleavage site
contexts as inputs. <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref> shows the DbyDeep model architecture, which consists of three
modules: 1) the peptide sequence representation module, 2) the cleavage
site representation module, and 3) the prediction module. First, a
peptide sequence was embedded into learnable vectors at the amino
acid level through embedding and LSTM layers. Consequently, a sequence
is expressed as a matrix of embedding vectors. The cleavage sites
were embedded in the same manner. Each module employs the identical
LSTM architecture but with different weight values. Finally, in the
prediction module, the output vectors from the two networks were concatenated
and supplied to the fully connected layer to predict detectability
of peptides.</p>

    <sec id="sec2.3">
      <title>Peptide Sequence Representation Module</title>
      <p>By label encoding,
a peptide amino acid sequence is converted to a one-dimensional token
in numeric form, such as 1 for alanine (A), 2 for arginine (R), etc.
The maximum length of a sequence is 81, and zero padding was applied
to shorter peptides. For instance, the peptide “EICTIQSSGGIMLLKDQVLR”
is encoded as [7, 10, 5, 17, 10, 6, 16, 16, 8, 8, 10, 13, 11, 11,
12, 4, 6, 20, 11, 2, 0, ... 0, 0]. Each amino acid is represented
as an embedding vector in the encoding of the peptide sequence, which
is written as a two-dimensional embedding matrix (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>A). LSTM is a useful learning
model for sequential data because it concurrently stores long-term
and short-term information using hidden states and cell states to
alleviate recurrent neural networks (RNNs)’ long-term redundancy
issue.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref></sup> We used bidirectional LSTM to

      <p>Each peptide cleavage

amino acid and its seven flanking amino acids on each side. The 15-mer
amino acid sequence is embedded in a two-dimensional matrix using
the same technique as the module for peptide sequence representation.
As depicted in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>B, four embeddings were conducted for four cleavage sites per peptide

      <title>Experimental Setting for Training and Validation</title>
      <p>We
trained the DbyDeep model using 408,207 positive peptides and the
same number of negative peptides. The positive peptide sequences were
unique (modifications on peptides were eliminated), and negatives
were selected at random from in silico protein digestion (see “<xref rid="sec2.1" ref-type="other">Datasets for Training Peptide Detectability</xref>”
for details). We used the open source framework tensorflow (version
2.4.0). Twenty percent was used for holdout testing, and fifteen percent
was used for validation. The training, validation, and test datasets
contained 536,492, 134,124, and 170,367 peptides, respectively. For
the peptide sequence, the embedding size was 32 and a bidirectional
LSTM layer comprised 32 units, whereas for cleavage sites, the embedding
size was 16 and a bidirectional LSTM layer comprised 16 units. Each
input is concatenated to 80 dimensions, and the ReLU activation function
is utilized in the fully connected layer. The batch size was 256,
and an early stopping strategy (200 epochs) was adopted to avoid overfitting.

      <title>Performance Comparison with Existing Methods</title>
      <p>To examine
the efficacy of DbyDeep, we first adopted the strategy and dataset
presented by DeepMSpeptide,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref></sup> which used
MS evidence from the HPP (Human Proteome Project) for human proteomes.
In brief, the dataset consisted of 3 nonoverlapping groups: 1) proteins
having MS evidence (PE1) in 2019; 2) missing proteins (MPs) without
MS evidence in 2011, which, however, became PE1 proteins in 2019;
and 3) MPs in 2019. To ensure a fair comparison, the peptides in this
HPP dataset were excluded from DbyDeep training. Using DbyDeep, PepFormer,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref></sup> CapsNet+CBAM,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref></sup> and

      <p>In addition, the usefulness of DbyDeep was demonstrated
by predicting
identifiable peptides from various MS/MS data sets with different
species and MS instruments. As depicted in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref></xref>A, six MS/MS data sets were downloaded from

      <title>Performance Evaluation Using HPP Datasets</title>
      <p>To demonstrate
the utility of DbyDeep, comparisons were done with existing machine
learning-based peptide detectability prediction models, such as DeepMSpeptide,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref></sup> PepFormer,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref></sup> and
CapsNet+CBAM.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref></sup> Each tool was applied to
estimate the detectability of peptides in three groups for the HPP
dataset: 1) MS evidence (PE1) in 2019; 2) missing proteins (MPs) without
MS evidence in 2011, which, however, became PE1 proteins in 2019;
and 3) MPs in 2019 (see Methods for more details). The HPP dataset
and the DbyDeep training dataset were separate. <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref></xref> clearly shows that DbyDeep outperforms all
other models. DbyDeep reported high detectability for all peptides
in PE1 and recognized MP groups, while some peptides from MPs in 2019
were predicted with high detectability, indicating that the MPs may
be discovered in the future despite the fact that they are currently
missing proteins.</p>

      <title>Application to Various Data Sets</title>
      <p>DbyDeep was applied
to predict peptides identifiable from various MS/MS data sets (independent
of the training set) with different species and MS instruments (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref></xref>A). The protein sequences
of matching species were downloaded from Swiss-Prot, and hypothetical
peptides were generated via in silico digestion (see Methods for more
details). Different algorithms (DeepMSpeptide,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref></sup> DeepDIA,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref></sup> PepFormer,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref></sup> and CapsNet+CBAM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref></sup>) were used to predict detectable peptides, which were then compared
with peptides identified by Comet<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref></sup> and
MS-GF+<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref></sup> searches of multiple MS/MS data
sets. <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref></xref>B depicts
the AUCs of the prediction comparison on the six data sets. Regardless
of database search method, DbyDeep outperformed the other tools across
all six data sets, increasing the AUC by an average of 5.6% for Comet
search (solid lines) and 5.4% for MS-GF+ search (dashed lines). Different
experimental conditions and search methods led to variations in the
identified peptides, resulting in significantly different positive
and negative sets; for example, Comet and MS-GF+ identified different
numbers of peptides for the same data set and Comet identified different
numbers of peptides in two data sets from the same species (e.g.,
134,690 and 56,743 for two humans). It is possible for a peptide to
be positive in one data set but negative in another. DbyDeep consistently
demonstrated the highest performance regardless of species, MS instruments,
and the size of identified peptides (i.e., the size of the positive
set). The utility of DbyDeep was also demonstrated for open search
results using pFind<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref></sup> and MSFragger,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref></sup> which can identify modified peptides in an unrestrictive

search tools yield somewhat distinct results for the same data set.
We evaluated the predicted detectability of peptides that were identified
consistently by multiple search tools, which thus have a high likelihood
of being predicted to be detectable (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.analchem.3c00460/suppl_file/ac3c00460_si_001.pdf">Figure S3</ext-link>).

      <p>To assess the

prediction models was compared using the same training data set. <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref></xref> depicts performance
metrics indicating that DbyDeep significantly outperforms the other
methods. DbyDeep achieved the highest scores on all performance measures:
accuracy (0.8391), sensitivity (0.8506), specificity (0.8278), and
precision (0.8278). In the ROC curves displayed in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref></xref>A, the AUC of DbyDeep is 0.9192,
which is 1.1, 1.4, 1.8, and 5.1% higher than those of PepFormer, CapsNet+CBAM,
DeepMspepide, and AP3, respectively. Notably, DbyDeep requires the
fewest model parameters required for training and may thus be rapidly
trained with a small dataset in a short amount of time. The number
of model parameters varied by up to 32,000%. <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref></xref> displays dashed lines for the ablation test
(DbyDeep_Ab), where only the peptide sequence feature was used as
an input to evaluate the efficacy of the cleavage site context feature.
The performance of the ablation model was comparable to that of PepFormer
that used only the peptide sequence feature. The performance drop
in the ablation test (e.g., 0.8% in AUC and 1.6% in sensitivity) revealed
that the cleavage site contexts were useful for the detectability
prediction.</p>
      <p>As trypsin digestion is quite efficient, peptides
with no missed cleavage sites are found substantially more frequently
in MS-based proteomics experiments than peptides with missed cleavage
sites. The limited observation of peptides containing missed cleavage
sites (i.e., the lack of positive samples) may make their detectability
difficult to anticipate. To measure the effect, we evaluated prediction
performance according to the number of missed cleavage sites within
peptides. <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref></xref> illustrates
the prediction performance of each tool. DbyDeep outperformed other
tools regardless of the number of missed cleavage sites within peptides;
its AUC, shown in red, was stable—0.8971 for peptides with
no missed cleavage site, 0.8715 for one, and 0.8866 for two. In contrast,
the AUC of AP3, shown in green, was drastically lowered with an increased
number of missed cleavage sites (0.7483 for two missed cleavage sites).
Sensitivity and specificity depended heavily on the number of missed
cleavage sites (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref></xref>B,6C). In all methods, the sensitivity decreased as the number of
missed cleavage sites increased, while the opposite holds for the
specificity, indicating a lack of positive training samples for peptides
with missed cleavage sites.</p>

    <title>Conclusions</title>
    <p>DbyDeep is the first method for predicting
peptide detectability
that accounts for the distinct behavior of the same cleavage site
on different peptides. The predicted peptide detectability can be
utilized to compile proteotypic peptides for MS-based targeted proteomics,
to score peptide-spectrum matches for peptide identification, and
to reduce the peptide database size for applications employing a huge
database such as proteogenomics and metaproteomics.</p>
    <p>Recent breakthroughs
in deep learning have spawned a variety of
peptide detectability prediction algorithms. DbyDeep outperformed
the existing methods in various evaluation tests. We want to emphasize
that DbyDeep has the fewest model parameters required for training.
In addition to RNN-based approaches such as GRU and LSTM, Transformer
models have also been adopted. In our test, there was no significant
difference in the predictive performance of the models (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.analchem.3c00460/suppl_file/ac3c00460_si_001.pdf">Figure S1</ext-link>). Transformer is a well-known NLP (natural
language processing) model for embedding sentences with more than
500 tokens. Given that the maximum peptide length is 40 amino acids,
the Transformer model yielded an excessively higher number of parameters
than required for predicting peptide detectability.</p>
    <p>In practice,
the true set of MS-detectable peptides would not be
well defined as the identified peptides may vary from experiment to
experiment. Even in technical replicates from the same sample, the
overlap between identified peptides is not 100%. Clearly, DbyDeep’s
great peptide detectability does not ensure the presence of the peptide
in every experiment. Peptide detection involves numerous variables.
Even though the peptides are experimentally ready to be detected,
the software’s algorithm inadequacy may impede peptide identification,
for instance. As a result, we aimed to develop a universal model capable
of predicting as many detectable peptides as possible and employed
the MassIVE-KB as a training set, which is the largest universal peptide
spectral library encompassing peptides identified in a variety of
investigations and circumstances. For particular experimental conditions,
transfer learning from the pretrained model is feasible. We demonstrated
that transfer learning can enhance prediction accuracy. Two data sets
used in this trial were obtained under the same experimental conditions
although their species were different (<italic>Mus musculus</italic> and <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref></sup> We used the <italic>M. musculus</italic> data set for transfer learning and then applied the transfer-learned
model to the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> data set
(this test was conducted for peptides identified by Comet). Remarkably,
the AUC of the pretrained model for the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> data set was 0.92 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref></xref>B), whereas the AUC of the transfer-learned model was 0.964.
It is worth noting that the prediction performance was substantially
improved even when the species of the data set for transfer learning
was different from that of the test data set.</p>
    <p>The current version
of DbyDeep works only for trypsin digestion,
but it could be expanded to predict the detectability of peptides
digested by other proteases if the peptide data were to be accumulated
in the future.</p>
