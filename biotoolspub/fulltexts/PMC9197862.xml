      <p id="Par1">Plant genomes encode a complex and evolutionary diverse regulatory grammar that forms the basis for most life on earth. A wealth of regulome and epigenome data have been generated in various plant species, but no common, standardized resource is available so far for biologists. Here, we present ChIP-Hub, an integrative web-based platform in the ENCODE standards that bundles &gt;10,000 publicly available datasets reanalyzed from &gt;40 plant species, allowing visualization and meta-analysis. We manually curate the datasets through assessing ~540 original publications and comprehensively evaluate their data quality. As a proof of concept, we extensively survey the co-association of different regulators and construct a hierarchical regulatory network under a broad developmental context. Furthermore, we show how our annotation allows to investigate the dynamic activity of tissue-specific regulatory elements (promoters and enhancers) and their underlying sequence grammar. Finally, we analyze the function and conservation of tissue-specific promoters, enhancers and chromatin states using comparative genomics approaches. Taken together, the ChIP-Hub platform and the analysis results provide rich resources for deep exploration of plant ENCODE.

    <title>Introduction</title>
    <p id="Par3">Genome-wide charting of transcription factor (TF) binding and epigenetic status has become widely used to study gene-regulatory programs in animals and plants. Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) is a powerful method to capture DNA targets for TFs or histone modifications across the entire nuclear genome of any organism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. From a technical point view, the success of ChIP-seq experiments largely depends on the development and validation of highly gene-specific antibodies or tagged transgenic lines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. However, crosslinking-based ChIP techniques inherently suffer from several limitations, including low throughput, poor resolution, suboptimal signal-to-noise ratio, and a tendency to ‘detect’ false positives<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. In this regard, several recent techniques, such as ChIP-exo<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup> and CUT&amp;RUN<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>, are alternatives to the current standard of ChIP-seq to improve the resolution in identifying protein binding locations. The in vitro DAP-seq technique<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>, which is based on screening of a genomic DNA library with an affinity-purified TF followed by high-throughput sequencing, is fast, inexpensive, and more scalable than ChIP-seq for the generation of genome-wide TF binding-site maps. However, only a subset of the TF binding sites identified by DAP-seq is accessible in vivo, and typically individual TFs are analyzed – while in vivo, TFs may interact in a combinatorial, tissue-specific manner with other TFs thereby altering DNA-binding preferences. Complementary in vivo experimental approaches—for example, FAIRE-seq, DNase-seq and ATAC-seq—can identify binding sites in open chromatin regions for all associated factors simultaneously and can provide additional information about DNA-binding proteins and their regulatory functions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. Thanks to these rapidly developing techniques, a tremendous amount of data have been generated by several large consortia (such as the ENCODE consortium in human<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup> and mouse<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>, as well as the modENCODE consortium in fly<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup> and nematode<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>) or various smaller projects (such as the fruitENCODE project in flowering plants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>).</p>
    <p id="Par4">Several databases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup> were recently established for visualization and efficient deployment of public ChIP-seq data by the research community. However, no comprehensive resource is available for plant research. Another major bottleneck in current plant research is the lack of a standardized routine for evaluation and analysis of ChIP-seq data. Therefore, the comparison of data generated by different laboratories is not straightforward, hampering data integration to generate hypotheses for further investigation.</p>
    <p id="Par5">In this work, we comprehensively collect &gt;10,000 public regulatory genomic datasets from &gt;40 plant species and reanalyze them in a uniform way based on the ENCODE standards. All result data are bundled in an integrative platform named ChIP-Hub for visualization and meta-analysis. We explore the co-association of different developmental regulators and associated hierarchical regulatory networks. We provide an atlas of dynamic promoter and enhancer landscapes across representative plant tissues and predict the sequence grammar underlying the chromatin dynamics of tissue-specific regulatory elements. Finally, we apply comparative genomics approaches to investigate the function and conservation of tissue-specific regulatory elements and chromatin states across different plant species.</p>

      <title>The ChIP-Hub resource</title>
      <p id="Par6">ChIP-Hub collects all plant regulome data deposited at the NCBI SRA database. These data were generated by high-throughput sequencing experiments including ChIP-seq, DAP-seq, DNase-seq and ATAC-seq. By the time of finalizing this manuscript (as of July 2021), there are &gt;10,000 individual datasets (whose experiment IDs start with SRX, DRX, or ERX) available at NCBI SRA in &gt;40 plant species, with a nearly exponential growth in recent years (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a, b</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). Although most datasets were generated in model organisms (such as Arabidopsis, rice and maize), the high-throughput regulome experiments have also been widely used in non-model plant species. We manually curated all the datasets through assessing ~540 original publications and &gt;800 biological projects (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>) and categorized them into different experimental groups, including open chromatin (11.5%), TFs and other proteins (27.3%), histone-related (39.9%), and input control experiments (19.4%; Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><title>The ChIP-Hub platform: data collection and the computational pipeline.</title><p><bold>a</bold> Explosive generation of regulome and epigenome data in plants.

The resulting data are further integrated by ChromHMM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref></sup> for each plant species. All the metadata as well as analyzed data are bundled in our Shiny application ChIP-Hub for visualization and meta-analysis.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="41467_2022_30770_Fig1_HTML" id="d32e448"/></fig></p>
      <p id="Par7">We adapted the working standards provided by the ENCODE consortium<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup> to set up computational pipelines and to systematically reanalyze all public regulome data in plants (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1e</xref>; see Methods). To make our reanalysis results easily accessible to external users, we have developed an integrative web-based platform (ChIP-Hub) to explore all the reanalyzed data sets. Additional data (e.g., sample metadata, references, TF genes, miRNAs, TF motifs, chromatin states and comparative genomics) were also collected and deposited in the database (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1e</xref>). Therefore, the resources are bundled in a well-accessible application that also allows visualization and meta-analyses (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>). Furthermore, in order to continuously add more source data in the future, we have designed ChIP-Hub to be updated quarterly with semi-automatic pipelines, including systematic metadata curation and automatic data processing.</p>

      <title>Comprehensive evaluation of plant regulome data</title>
      <p id="Par8">One experiment may consist of multiple replicates of ChIP-seq samples and associated control samples. We therefore obtained &gt;6000 individual experiments (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>) with manual curation based on experimental designs in original publications or project descriptions. We assigned each experiment to a specific group based on the investigated regulatory factor. ChIP-Hub covers experiments for nearly all plant TF families and well-investigated histone modifications (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><title>Evaluation of plant regulome and epigenome data.</title><p><bold>a</bold> The annotated experiments by plant species (up) or experimental categories (bottom). <bold>b</bold> Treemap showing the classification of experiments in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> according to transcription factor (TF) families, the types of histone modifications or open chromatin experiments. <bold>c</bold> Donut charts showing different aspects of evaluation of the annotated experiments. <bold>d</bold> The bar chart showing the quality of experiments based on various quality metrics proposed by the ENCODE consortium<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. <bold>e</bold> Comparison of SPOT scores among different experimental categories.

Source data are provided as a Source Data file.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="41467_2022_30770_Fig2_HTML" id="d32e519"/></fig></p>
      <p id="Par9">We then systematically evaluated the data quality of individual experiments (<italic>n</italic> = 6055). Although 89.2% of the experiments have been published in peer-reviewed journals, nearly 40% of the experiments lack control datasets, and only 37.8% have technical or biological replicates (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>). Problems of lack of controls or replicates are more obvious in the earlier studies (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref>). Nevertheless, most of the evaluated experiments readily meet a variety of quality specifications based on the ENCODE criteria<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup> (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref>). More than 75% of the investigated datasets show moderate to high values of signal-to-noise ratio based on enrichment scores of FRiP (fraction of reads in peaks), NSC/RSC (normalized/relative strand cross-correlation coefficient)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup> and SPOT (signal portion of tags)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. Most of the experiments show good quality in terms of the library complexity, as measured by PBC (PCR bottleneck coefficient) and NRF (nonredundant fraction). Not surprisingly, all these quality metrics are positively correlated with each other (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5</xref>). As expected, the enrichment SPOT score of experimental groups is significantly higher than that of input control (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2e</xref>). In summary, the above results indicate overall high quality of individual experiments in the analysis.</p>
      <p id="Par10">We identified a total of 52.3 million high-confidence peaks (with an IDR, Irreproducible Discovery Rate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>, &lt;0.05; see Methods) from experiments for open chromatin, annotated TFs and widely-investigated histone H3 modifications (Supplementary Data <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">1</xref>). As expected, peak summits of TF-bound or open chromatin regions generally locate around the transcription start site (TSS) while genomic locations of histone-modified regions vary among different types of histone modifications (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2f</xref>). For genomes with more than 20 distinct experiments, the number of identified open chromatin regions, TF binding events or histone-modified genomic locations varies from 0.21 million (<italic>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</italic>; experiments <italic>n</italic> = 32) to 21.4 million (<italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>; <italic>n</italic> = 3479); the fraction of genome associated with TF-bound and histone-modified regions shows an average of 22.0% (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2g</xref>), with comparable proportions found in the mouse (12.6%) and human (~20%) genomes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. However, the proportion may be far underestimated for most plant genomes since many regulators have not yet been investigated. Of note, about 3500 individual experiments have been generated in Arabidopsis (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>), resulting in annotated genomic regions in terms of chromatin status or TF binding encompassing at least 82.1% of the Arabidopsis genomic sequence in aggregate (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2g</xref>). Interestingly, 68.8% of Arabidopsis genome is annotated as potential regulatory regions based on 347 ChIP-seq experiments (each has &gt;50 targets) for 157 distinct TFs (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6</xref> and Supplementary Data <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">2</xref>), suggesting pervasive regulatory potential in the compact Arabidopsis genome.</p>

      <title>Extensive TF co-associations and regulatory loops in Arabidopsis</title>
      <p id="Par11">We investigated TF co-associations and TF-targets gene regulatory networks using TF-related ChIP-seq experiments in Arabidopsis. Integrative analysis of TF-bound genomic regions revealed potential TF co-associations by regulating a similar set of target genes (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">7</xref>), as exemplified around the <italic>APETALA1</italic> (<italic>AP1</italic>) gene locus (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">8</xref>). We organized the pairwise TF co-association into networks with TFs as nodes and their co-binding possibility as edges (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">9</xref>). We observed three dominant co-associated TF modules (M1-M3). M1 consists regulators from TF families of bZIP, bHLH and MYB, while M3 includes MADS TFs response for flower development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. Interestingly, M2 contains various regulators for the regulation of histone modifications, including histone acetyltransferases (GENERAL CONTROL NON-REPRESSED PROTEIN5 [GCN5]), deacetylases (HISTONE DEACETYLASE 2 C [HD2C]), methyltransferases (ET DOMAIN GROUP2 [SDG2], FERTILIZATION-INDEPENDENT ENDOSPERM [FIE], SWINGER [SWN] and CURLY LEAF [CLF]), demethylase (JUMONJI 14 [JMJ14], RELATIVE OF EARLY FLOWERING 6 [REF6]/JMJ12) and bivalent histone readers (EARLY BOLTING IN SHORT DAY [EBS]) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>). These regulators tightly co-associate with timing regulators such as CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED1 (CCA1)/ LUX ARRHYTHMO (LUX) for the circadian clock and FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC)/ SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE (SVP) for the initiation of flowering.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><title>TF co-associations and hierarchical regulatory networks.</title><p><bold>a</bold> Co-binding relationships of TFs.

      <p id="Par12">Next, we constructed a hierarchical regulatory network by integrating potential direct TF target genes based on ChIP-seq and predicted miRNA-target interactions, with upstream TFs at the top of the hierarchy, miRNA genes and their target genes at the middle and bottom levels, respectively (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3d</xref>). This “meta-network” includes 117 upstream TFs, 134 miRNA genes, and 462 common target TF genes, and the predicted regulation relationship tends to show a regulator (TF or miRNA) family-specific manner.

      <title>Dynamics of tissue-specific regulatory elements</title>
      <p id="Par13">More than 1100 open chromatin datasets have been reanalyzed in ChIP-Hub, which offer an opportunity to comprehensively annotate plant regulatory elements such as enhancers. As a proof of concept, we predicted a catalogue of 18,753 promoters and 9976 enhancers in ten representative tissues of Arabidopsis by integrative analysis of 65 open chromatin datasets from nine studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup> (Supplementary Data <xref rid="MOESM7" ref-type="media">4</xref> and <xref rid="MOESM8" ref-type="media">5</xref>; see Methods). Clustering analysis based on chromatin accessibility reveals that both promoters and enhancers can distinguish different types of tissues, despite data generated by different studies (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">10a, b</xref>). Supporting this notion, we observed instances of promoters and enhancers that are specifically active in certain types of tissues (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">11</xref>). To compare tissue specificity of promoters and enhancers, we calculated their divergence of chromatin accessibility across tissues based on the Jensen-Shannon diversity (JSD) index. We found that enhancers are generally more tissue-specific than promoters (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c</xref>). Based on the distribution of JSD score, we defined regulatory elements with JSD &gt; 0.26 as highly specific ones (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c</xref>). We summarized the number of TF binding sites (including 157 TFs as analyzed above) in both promoters and enhancers and found that enrichment of TF binding in highly tissue-specific regulatory elements is significantly different between promoters and enhancers (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4d</xref>). However, there is no difference of enrichment of TF binding in low tissue-specific promoters and enhancers.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><title>Prediction of tissue-specific regulatory elements promoters and enhancers.</title><p><bold>a</bold> Sample similarity based on enhancer activity.

      <p id="Par14">We further investigated the sequence grammar underlying the chromatin dynamics of tissue-specific regulatory elements. We applied Basset<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup> to train a convolutional neural network (CNN) to discriminate one tissue from all other tissues on the basis of the sequence content within accessible sites (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">10c, d</xref>). The convolutional filters (<italic>n</italic> = 600) in the first CNN layer detect repeatedly occurring local sequence patterns, each comprising a weighted matrix of sequence features <italic>akin to</italic> a TF motif position weight matrix (PWM). The resulting PWMs were matched to known TF motif databases using the Tomtom motif comparison tool<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>. By this we were able to identify known or new motifs represented in tissue-specific promoters and enhancers for each tissue (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4e</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">10e</xref>). For example, the classification of root tissues is strongly associated with a filter matching the motif of WOX11, which is critical for initiation of the root primordium during root organogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>.</p>
      <p id="Par15">The highly tissue-specific regulatory elements (including 4702 promoters and 4234 enhancers) were grouped into ten different clusters based on their chromatin accessibility (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a</xref>). We associated potential target genes of these regulatory elements using the ‘nearest neighbor’ strategy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>, so that one gene may have multiple regulatory elements (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5b</xref>). Note that the nearest neighbor strategy could lead to false target associations due to chromatin loops which can help the formation of interactions between the regulator and its target genes. Nevertheless, the chromatin conformation in Arabidopsis is dominantly represented by kb-sized interactive regions based on Hi-C analyses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>, which indicates that enhancers mostly target their neighboring gene(s) in Arabidopsis. Regulatory elements in clusters 2 (C2) and C3 are highly active in flower-related tissues, and their target genes are largely involved in biological processes such as ‘flower development’ and ‘floral organ development’ (Supplementary Data <xref rid="MOESM9" ref-type="media">6</xref>), including a list of well-known genes controlling floral transition and flower development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>, such as <italic>LEAFY</italic> (<italic>LFY</italic>) <italic>APETALA1</italic> (<italic>AP1</italic>), <italic>FRUITFULL</italic> (<italic>FUL</italic>), <italic>STERILE APETALA</italic> (<italic>SAP</italic>) and <italic>AGAMOUS-LIKE 24</italic> (<italic>AGL24</italic>).

      <title>Evolution of regulatory elements across multiple plant species</title>
      <p id="Par16">To demonstrate the power of ChIP-Hub for comparative genomic analyses, we mapped the active promoter and enhancer elements in seedlings across 17 plant species, including five monocots and twelve dicots (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6a</xref> and Supplementary Data <xref rid="MOESM10" ref-type="media">7</xref>). A total of 14–28,000 open chromatin regions per species were identified in seedlings using selected ATAC-seq or DNase-seq experiments from ChIP-Hub (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6b</xref> and Supplementary Data <xref rid="MOESM10" ref-type="media">7</xref>). Although data used here were taken from different studies, the number of identified peaks was robust to variability in the sample size and the genome size (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">12a–c</xref>), revealing reliable data quality in our analyses. We predicted promoters and enhancers based on peak data using species-specific criteria since the distribution of distances to the nearest TSS varies largely among the investigated species (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6b, c</xref> and Supplementary Data <xref rid="MOESM11" ref-type="media">8</xref>; see Methods).<fig id="Fig6"><label>Fig. 6</label><caption><title>Evolutionarily tracking plant promoters and enhancers.</title><p><bold>a</bold> Phylogenetic tree showing the evolutionary relationships of plant species used in the analysis, including five monocots and twelve dicots. <bold>b</bold> The number of predicted promoters and enhancers in each species. <bold>c</bold> Distance of peak summits to the  nearest transcription start site (TSS). <bold>d</bold> Sankey plot showing conserved regulatory elements among seven representative species, using Arabidopsis as a reference.

      <p id="Par17">We then tracked the evolution of promoters and enhancers across the 17 plant species by pairwise comparison of peaks between species in a reciprocal manner using whole-genome alignments, a similar strategy used for evolutionary analysis of regulatory elements in mammalian species<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup>. In brief, conserved promoters or enhancers were defined if the underlying DNA sequence was alignable and the degree of conservation (referred as conservation score hereafter) was considered as the number of species in which the DNA could be aligned (see Methods). We plotted the conserved regulatory elements (including both promoters and enhancers) among seven representative species using Arabidopsis as a reference (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6d</xref>). We observed that, as expected, Arabidopsis regulatory elements were generally more conserved within eudicot plant species (<italic>Phaseolus vulgaris</italic>, <italic>Citrullus lanatus</italic> and <italic>Solanum lycopersicum</italic>) than within monocots (<italic>Oryza sativa</italic>, <italic>Zea mays</italic> and <italic>Sorghum bicolor</italic>). We further calculated the conservation score for each promoter and enhancer in Arabidopsis and found that promoters showed a significantly higher degree of conservation than enhancers by ruling out the bias due to sequence alignability between promoters and enhancers (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6e</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">12d-f</xref>). This observation suggests that promoter activity is evolutionarily stable while enhancer evolution is relatively more rapid.

      <p id="Par18">We highlighted genes associated with highly conserved promoters and enhancers in the Arabidopsis genome (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6e</xref>).

To investigate the functional relevance of promoters and enhancers with different degree of conservation, we performed gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis for the associated target genes. Interestingly, the most conserved promoters and enhancers were enriched GO terms related to ‘meristem development’ and ‘photosynthesis’, while less conserved regulatory elements related to various ‘metabolic process’ and ‘stress response’ (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6h</xref>).

      <title>Comparison and conservation of tissue-specific chromatin states</title>
      <p id="Par19">In order to predict the functional relevance of the genomic regions marked by histone modifications, we generated integrated maps of chromatin states in vegetative-, reproductive- or root-related tissues of wide-type plants for genomes with at least five distinct marks (Supplementary Data <xref rid="MOESM12" ref-type="media">9</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">13</xref>), using ChromHMM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref></sup> to segment the genome into distinct combinations of histone modification marks (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">14</xref>). As a proof of concept, a 12-state model was trained in Arabidopsis vegetative-related tissues (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7a</xref>). The resulting “marked” states included six active states, four repressed states and a bivalent state that showed distinct levels of gene expression, chromatin accessibility, TF binding and enrichment for evolutionary conserved noncoding sequences (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7b–f</xref>), accounting for 77.8% of the genome (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7d</xref>) and covering all the major states identified in previous studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref></sup>. Particularly, active chromatin states 2 and 3, which are proximal to the TSS, are associated with histone modifications of H3K4me2/H3K4me3 and TF binding for a diverse set of developmental regulators (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7a, e</xref>). State 2 differed from state 3 in that it is enriched with H3K9ac, H3K27ac and H3K36me3 towards TSS-proximal gene body regions. These two states can thus be considered as active promoter states. Interestingly, state 8 is associated with both active mark H3K4me2/H3K4me3 and inactive mark H3K27me3, and enriched with DNA-binding for Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) and Jumonji proteins, likely being a bivalent or bistable regulatory state<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref></sup>. This state is highly conserved in sequences between Arabidopsis and other crucifer species in terms of phastCons score<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref></sup> (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7f</xref>). State 9 is a repressed Polycomb state as it is solely associated with H3K27me3 in intergenic regions (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7a, f</xref>). States 10–12 are constitutively enriched with heterochromatin-associated H3K9me2, which is required for the silencing of transposable elements (TEs) and other repetitive DNA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref></sup>. The H3K27me3-marked heterochromatin state (state 10) can be facultative as it is enriched with binding for proteins such as nucleosome remodeling complexes and DNA methyltransferases.

    <title>Discussion</title>
    <p id="Par21">ChIP-seq and complementary assays are powerful methods to measure protein-DNA binding events and chemical modifications of histone proteins at genome-wide level. In recent years, massive research efforts resulted in generation of regulome and epigenome data in various plant species. Re-use and comparison of data from different source studies or among different plant species is not straightforward due to lack of a comprehensive regulome database in the plant field. Given this background, we launched a project in 2015 with an aim of uniform reanalysis and comprehensive evaluation of plant regulome data. Here we provide ChIP-Hub which serves as a comprehensive data portal to explore plant regulomes, especially based on ChIP-seq, DAP-seq and ATAC-seq/DNase-seq experiments. The ChIP-Hub platform is different from several representative plant regulatory element databases, including Plant Cistrome Database<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>, ReMap<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>, Plant Regulomics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>, PlantRegMap<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref></sup>, AGRIS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref></sup>, JASPAR<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref></sup> and CIS-BP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref></sup>, in terms of data content, data amount and function specificity. Omics-related datasets collected in ChIP-Hub far exceed data in all those relevant databases. In addition, ChIP-Hub provides predicted TF binding site (TFBS) information using DNA motifs taken from CIS-BP and JASPAR. Most importantly, ChIP-Hub allows comparative regulomic analyses, which provides a unique feature of ChIP-Hub among similar databases.</p>
    <p id="Par22">Although all the evaluated data in ChIP-Hub so far were taken from public databases, unpublished data provided by users can also be analyzed in the same way as published datasets (see online document under the “About” page). In principle, our computational pipeline is easy and ready to adapt to analyze new types of profiling data, such as CUT&amp;RUN experiments for mapping protein-DNA contacts and histone modifications. To this end, a routine to maintain and to update ChIP-Hub in the future has been established. In addition, we are currently improving ChIP-Hub to support the analysis and visualization of plant single cell sequencing data based on ATAC-seq and related techniques.</p>
    <p id="Par23">ChIP-Hub offers a new centralized resource for analysis and comparison of plant regulome and epigenome data. Integrative analysis of such large-scale datasets using machine-learning-based approaches provides a unprecedented opportunity to extract hidden regulatory genomic patterns and thus to advance our views of a specific biological question under investigation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref></sup>. For examples, several integrative studies based on large-scale analysis of TF ChIP-seq data provide a new perspective of gene regulatory networks underlying plant development and evolution<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref></sup>. In our study, we characterized a regulatory landscape across ten different tissues based on open chromatin datasets. We identified an extensive list of tissue-specific regulatory elements (i.e., promoters and enhancers), including those known for tissue-specific gene regulation. We believe that the amounts of data collected in ChIP-Hub will allow scientists to discover evidences for more specific research points. As an example, we analyzed public DNase-seq data treated by several environmental stresses and identified a set of regulatory elements whose target genes are response to heat shock and dark (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">20</xref>). The results may provide insights into how plants adapt to changing environments.</p>
    <p id="Par24">As more data are being generated in different plant species, direct comparisons of data among species become possible. As a start point, we tracked the evolution of active functional elements (including promoters and enhancers) across 17 plant species. Consistent with previous findings in mammalian species<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup>, we observed rapid enhancer and slow promoter evolution in plants (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6e, f</xref>), reflecting a fundamental characteristic of the regulatory genome. We also have compared the conservation of genomic DNA regions marked by different chromatin states in five plant species with comparable datasets, and found that at least some chromatin states are highly positionally conserved among the investigated species (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7g, h</xref>), suggesting a conserved histone code in plants. In the future, ChIP-Hub would allow to track the evolution of TF binding sites<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref></sup> and of other active regulatory elements in multiple plant species by comparative genomics.</p>
    <p id="Par25">In summary, we hope that ChIP-Hub will not only allow experimental biologists from various fields to comprehensively use all available regulome and epigenome information to obtain insights into their specific questions, but also allow theoretical biologists to model regulatory relationships under specific conditions and developmental regimes.</p>

ChIP-Hub has a focus on data in “green plants” (i.e., only considering plants in the taxonomy tree with a root ID 33090). Only data generated by Illumina platforms were kept. Firstly, each dataset was associated with publication(s) if available (about 90% of samples can be linked with publications). Then, each dataset was manually curated to determine its investigated factor (i.e., which TF or histone modification mark), its experimental type (whether ChIP or control) and its associated replicates (experiment may have several replicates), based on the metadata and the original publications. Note that it is important to manually check the metadata based on its corresponding publication since some metadata was misannotated in the database. For example, the dataset SRX4063234 in fact contains two different samples, one for ChIP experiment (SRR7142417) and another for control experiment (SRR7142416). In this case, “Run” accessions (start with SRR/ERR/DRR) were instead used as sample accessions (ca. 250 of such cases). For datasets without related publications so far, they were marked as a “unconfirmed” status and would be regularly checked in the future. In general, one experiment may contain replicate samples (i.e., datasets), ChIP sample(s) as well as input control sample(s) and it was designed to investigate regulation of a specific factor (e.g., TF or histone modification) of interest under specific conditions. In the analysis (see the section below), each experiment was processed independently. Furthermore, annotation information for investigated factors was also manually curated. Broadly, factors are grouped into “TFs and other proteins”, “histone-related” or “unclassified”. For TFs, their gene IDs and family information were also determined if applicable. Finally, a meta file was obtained for each experiment after curation (see Supplementary Data <xref rid="MOESM13" ref-type="media">10</xref> for examples), which is served as an input file for the ChIP-seq computation pipeline (see below).</p>
      <p id="Par27">Raw fastq files for each experiment were downloaded from the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena">https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena</ext-link>) database. If fastq files were not available at ENA, raw data in the SRA format were downloaded from the SRA database and converted into fastq format using the “fastq-dump” command provided by the SRA Toolkit (version 2.5.1). The “—split-files” option was used for paired-end reads. Fastq files were further checked for completeness before submitted to analysis.</p>
      <p id="Par28">Genome sequences and gene annotations were downloaded from public databases (Supplementary Data <xref rid="MOESM14" ref-type="media">11</xref>). Additional annotation data were also included in the ChIP-Hub database in order to better annotate the regulatory factors and their regulatory networks. Annotation for miRNA genes were obtained from miRbase<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref></sup> and their genomic locations were updated (by BLAST) based on current reference genomes. TF family information was retrieved from PlantTFDB<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">81</xref></sup>.

      <title>Data processing</title>
      <p id="Par29">We followed the ChIP-seq data analysis guidelines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup> recommended by the ENCODE project to develop the computational pipeline for various regulome data analyses (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1e</xref>). The analysis pipeline consists of quality control, read mapping, peak calling and assessment of reproducibility among biological replicates and was used to analyze all annotated experiments in a standardized and uniform manner. Specifically, potential adapter sequences were removed from the sequencing reads using the Trim Galore program (version 0.4.1) and the quality of sequencing data was then evaluated by FastQC (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/">http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/</ext-link>). Trimmed reads were mapped to the corresponding reference genomes using Bowtie2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">83</xref></sup> (version 2.2.6) with parameters “-q—no-unal—threads 8—sensitive”. The parameter “-k” was set to 1, 2 and 3 for diploid genomes (e.g., <italic>Oryza sativa</italic>), tetraploid genomes (e.g., <italic>Gossypium barbadense</italic>) and hexaploidy genomes (e.g., <italic>Triticum aestivum</italic>), respectively. Redundant reads and PCR duplicates were removed using Picard tools (v2.60; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/">http://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/</ext-link>) and SAMtools<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">84</xref></sup> (version 0.1.19).</p>
      <p id="Par30">Peak calling was performed using MACS2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">85</xref></sup> (version 2.1.0). Duplicated reads were not considered (“—keep-dup=1”) during peak calling in order to achieve a better specificity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86">86</xref></sup>. The shifting size (“—shift”) used in the model was determined by the analysis of cross-correlation scores using the phantompeakqualtools package (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://code.google.com/p/phantompeakqualtools/">https://code.google.com/p/phantompeakqualtools/</ext-link>). The parameter “—call-summits” was used to call narrow peaks. For broad marks of histone modifications (including H3K36me3, H3K20me1, H3K4me1, H3K79me2, H3K79me3, H3K27me3, H3K9me3 and H3K9me1), broad peaks were also called by turning on the “—broad” parameter in MACS2. A relaxed threshold of <italic>p</italic> value (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 1e-2) was used in order to enable the correct computation of IDR (irreproducible discovery rate) values<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>, because IDR requires input peak data across the entire spectrum of high confidence (signal) and low confidence (noise) so that a bivariate model can be fitted to separate signal from noise<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. Following the recommendations for the analysis of self-consistency and reproducibility between replicates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>, replicate control samples (if available) were combined into one single control in the same experiment. Peak calling was applied to all replicates, pooled data (pooled replicates), pseudo-replicates (half subsample of reads) of each replicate and the pseudo-replicates of pooled sample using the same merged control as input (if applicable). By default, “reproducible” peaks across pseudo-replicates and true replicates with an IDR &lt; 0.05 were recommend for analysis. Besides, peaks with different statistical thresholds are available upon request. For example, “significant” peaks were defined as a fold-change (fold enrichment above background) &gt;2 and a -log10 (<italic>q</italic> value) &gt;3; while “lenient” peaks as a fold-change &gt;2 and a -log10 (<italic>q</italic> value) &gt;2. “Relaxed” peaks without additional thresholding were also provided so that any custom threshold can be applied. All peak-based analyses in the pipeline (including peak overlapping, merging and summary) were performed using BEDTools<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87">87</xref></sup> (v2.25.0).</p>
      <p id="Par31">Various metric scores were calculated to assess different aspects of the quality of experiments (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://genome.ucsc.edu/ENCODE/qualityMetrics.html">https://genome.ucsc.edu/ENCODE/qualityMetrics.html</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.encodeproject.org/data-standards/terms/">https://www.encodeproject.org/data-standards/terms/</ext-link>; Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c, d</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5</xref>). For example, library complexity is measured using the non-redundant fraction (NRF) and PCR bottlenecking coefficients 1 and 2 (PBC1 and PBC2). The SPOT (signal portion of tags) score, characterizing the enrichment of signal for each experiment, was calculated by the Hotspot<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">88</xref></sup> algorithm by subsampling ten million reads. Fraction of reads in peaks (FRiP), another measure of enrichment, is highly correlated with the SPOT score (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5</xref>). NSC and RSC (normalized and relative strand cross-correlation coefficient) are related measures of enrichment without dependence on pre-defined peaks, which were calculated by the phantompeakqualtools program<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89">89</xref></sup>.

      <title>Assignment of target genes</title>
      <p id="Par34">Regulatory elements (in layman’s terms, called “peaks”) were assigned to putative target genes based on the following rules. For a regulatory region overlapping with any gene(s) (protein-coding genes or miRNAs), the overlapping gene(s) were considered as its targets. Otherwise, the regulatory element was assigned to its nearest annotated gene within up to N bp, where N is the median size of intergenic regions (N was set to 3000 if the median size exceeded 3000). The start of genes (i.e., the transcription start site [TSS] of protein-coding genes and the 5’ end of miRNA precursors [pre-miRNAs]) was used to calculate the distance. In general, this approach associates a single regulatory element with no more than two genes, with a few exceptions in the case of the regulatory element overlapping multiple genes. This procedure was performed in each species independently.</p>

      <title>Chromatin state analysis</title>
      <p id="Par35">In order to use the collected histone modification ChIP-seq data from diverse studies for chromatin state analysis and to make the data more comparable among different plant species, only well-characterized H3-related histone modification marks (including H3K9ac, H3K27ac, H3K4me1/2/3, H3K9me1/2/3, H3K27me1/2/3 and H3K36me1/2/3) were considered and only data generated in wild-type plants were used. Furthermore, the datasets were broadly categorized into vegetative-, reproductive- and root-related samples based on their tissue specificity (Supplementary Data <xref rid="MOESM12" ref-type="media">9</xref>). In general, these broadly defined “tissue” types (termed reference tissue types) are more comparative among different plant species and difference in tissue collection by different studies can be eliminated. Although the analysis is cell type agnostic, it is informative even when the relevant cell or tissue type has not been experimentally profiled (this is the most case in plants so far). In addition, we filtered out experiments with less than 1000 called peaks and only considered plant species with at least five distinct types of histone modification marks. In summary, 251 experiments from five plant species were retained for chromatin state analysis (Supplementary Data <xref rid="MOESM12" ref-type="media">9</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">13</xref>).</p>
      <p id="Par36">ChromHMM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref></sup> (version 1.19) was applied on the ChIP-seq data of histone modifications in three reference tissue types in five plant species to learn a multivariate HMM model for segmentation of genome in each tissue type. Specifically, the called peaks were first pooled from different ChIP-seq experiments for each type of the histone modifications in each tissue type for each genome separately. Peaks within blacklist regions were excluded from the analysis. The remaining pooled peaks were then processed by the “BinarizeBed” command (with the parameter “-peaks”) into binarized data in every 200 bp window over the entire genome. Models were trained independently for each reference tissue type in each genome since the composition of marks varied in different tissue types. We ran the “LearnModel” command with the number of states ranging from 2 states to 15 states and selected an “optimal-state” model based on a rule that the number of states appeared most parsimonious in terms of clearly distinct emission properties and clear interpretability of distinction between states (Supplementary Figs. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">15</xref>–<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">19</xref>). Furthermore, the resulting chromatin states were interpreted based on enrichment analysis of various types of functional annotations, such as gene elements, neighboring gene expression pattern, TF binding, chromatin accessibility and predicted enhancers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR93">93</xref></sup>. To this end, the “OverlapEnrichment” and “NeighborhoodEnrichment” commands were used in the analysis.

For regions mapped to multiple orthologous locations in the other genome (i.e., regions split over multiple alignment blocks), only the largest orthologous region in the same alignment block was considered. Marked regions were considered as conserved between species when their orthologous location in the second species overlapped a marked region by a minimum of 50%.
