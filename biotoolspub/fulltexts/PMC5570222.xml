      <title>Abstract</title>
      <p>Discovery of potentially deleterious sequence variants is important and has wide implications for research and generation of new hypotheses in human and veterinary medicine, and drug discovery. The GenProBiS web server maps sequence variants to protein structures from the Protein Data Bank (PDB), and further to protein–protein, protein–nucleic acid, protein–compound, and protein–metal ion binding sites. The concept of a protein–compound binding site is understood in the broadest sense, which includes glycosylation and other post-translational modification sites. Binding sites were defined by local structural comparisons of whole protein structures using the Protein Binding Sites (ProBiS) algorithm and transposition of ligands from the similar binding sites found to the query protein using the ProBiS-ligands approach with new improvements introduced in GenProBiS. Binding site surfaces were generated as three-dimensional grids encompassing the space occupied by predicted ligands. The server allows intuitive visual exploration of comprehensively mapped variants, such as human somatic mis-sense mutations related to cancer and non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms from 21 species, within the predicted binding sites regions for about 80 000 PDB protein structures using fast WebGL graphics. The GenProBiS web server is open and free to all users at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://genprobis.insilab.org">http://genprobis.insilab.org</ext-link>.</p>

    <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
    <p>Sequence variants that occur in coding regions of genes and alter protein's amino acid sequence presumably affect protein function. Variants can occur in genes of somatic cells, for example mis-sense mutations in cancers or germline cells, such as non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (nsSNPs). The latter can either substitute amino acids (mis-sense SNPs) or introduce premature stop codons, or nonsense codons resulting in incomplete proteins (nonsense SNPs) (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Non-synonymous SNPs affect phenotypic diversity, disease development and response to drugs. Both somatic and germline sequence variants have been linked to various cancers (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>) and other diseases (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Sickle-cell anemia is a classic example of a disease caused by a single nsSNP, where a glutamic acid residue is replaced by valine in hemoglobin (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>).</p>
    <p>Binding sites on proteins interact with various ligands and hence govern the biochemical functions of proteins. It was found that disease-causing nsSNPs are preferentially located at protein–protein interfaces rather than in non-interface regions of protein surfaces (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Significant enrichments of somatic mis-sense mutations were found within protein–protein, protein–nucleic acid and protein–metal ion binding sites in several proteins involved in tumorigenesis (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). As such, binding site sequence variants are of great interest to drug development chemists and clinicians who seek to predict an individual's response to a drug. A variety of algorithms, web servers and databases have been developed to identify nsSNPs which influence protein function (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>–<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>) and response to drugs (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Mapping of nsSNPs to Protein Data Bank (PDB) (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>) protein structures has been accomplished for human proteins (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>–<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>) as well as for both human and non-human proteins (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>) but to our knowledge, mapping of somatic mutations and nsSNPs from many different species to diverse types of binding sites and further, to each site's ligand specifically for all PDB protein structures, does not exist.</p>
    <p>Detection of protein binding sites is a challenging task. Proteins typically bind several different ligands, but any single protein structure in the PDB only contains one or a few co-crystallized ligands and thus shows an incomplete state of the actual binding sites. To finesse this problem, we define binding sites on proteins using the ProBiS-ligands approach (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>), which has been improved in GenProBiS. This accounts for the co-crystallized ligands from the same binding site, as well as for the ligands binding to similar binding sites in other PDB structures. The approach detects and aligns similar binding sites irrespective of their proteins' similar folding patterns using the ProBiS algorithm (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). In this algorithm, protein structures are represented as graphs, in which vertices represent functional groups of surface amino acids and edges are drawn between pairs of vertices that are &lt;15 Å apart. Two protein graphs are divided into several subgraphs that together completely sample the two protein surfaces. From each pair of protein subgraphs, a product graph is constructed, i.e. an approximate representation of all possible local superimpositions of the two protein structures. Using our maximum clique algorithm (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>), the largest complete subgraph is detected within each product graph, which corresponds to the best local superimposition of the two compared protein structures. Ligands, co-crystallized in the superimposed similar binding sites, are then transposed to the query protein based on this superimposition. The transposed ligands are clustered by their spatial proximity and each such cluster represents one binding site. Finally, degrees of structural evolutionary conservation are calculated for each query protein's amino acid residue from the multiple protein structure alignment (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Recently, a variation of this approach was successfully used for discovery of small-molecule inhibitors of InhA enzyme in <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> and this resulted in identification of three previously unrecognized inhibitors with novel scaffolds (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>).</p>
    <p>In this paper we describe a new web server, GenProBiS, which allows mapping of human somatic mis-sense mutations related to cancer and nsSNPs from genome sequences of 21 species to protein binding sites in the PDB. The concept of a binding site is understood in the broadest sense, which includes glycosylation and other post-translational modification sites. These are in GenProBiS classified under protein–compound binding sites. Binding sites are defined as the space occupied by atoms of all co-crystallized ligands transposed to the query protein from PDBs sharing similar binding sites with the query protein. Binding site grids are generated and visualized as solvent accessible molecular surfaces. GenProBiS enables detection of sequence variants within a protein binding site and visual exploration of interactions, or loss of interactions, of a specific mis-sense mutation with a specific ligand. We show the usability of GenProBiS on selected disease-related nsSNPs and somatic mutations whose importance in disease development and potential drug response effects can be explained by their presence in binding sites and their interactions with ligands.</p>

    <title>GENPROBIS WEB SERVER</title>
    <p>The GenProBiS web server implements a novel approach to the discovery of sequence variants that have potentially deleterious effect on protein function and ligand binding through gain or loss of the binding site (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Currently, the web server maps around 550 000 sequence variants to about 5 million amino acid residues in 80 000 PDB protein structures enriched with protein–protein, protein–nucleic acid, protein–compound and protein–metal ion binding sites. The sequence variants were collected from the UniProt variants dataset (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>), which contains data from various databases including around 95 000 somatic mis-sense mutations from human cancers from the COSMIC database (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>), 460 000 nsSNPs from 14 different species listed according to the decreasing numbers of nsSNPs, including <italic>Homo sapiens, Bos taurus, Mus musculus, Sus scrofa, Gallus gallus, Anopheles gambiae, Danio rerio, Canis familiaris, Equus caballus, Macaca mulatta, Oryza indica, Oryza sativa, Ovis aries</italic> and <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> from the dbSNP database (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>), around 500 polymorphisms from six plant species, <italic>Zea mays, Yitis vinifera, Sorghum bicolor, Solanum lycopersicum, Phytophtora infestans</italic> and <italic>O. sativa</italic> from the EnsemblPlants (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>) and around 60 polymorphisms from <italic>Aedes aegypti, Ixodes scapularis</italic> and <italic>A. gambiae</italic> species obtained from the EnsemblMetazoa database (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). UniProt amino acid sequence locations of sequence variants were converted to PDB structure locations using the Structure integration with function, taxonomy and sequence (SIFTS) project conversion table (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>).</p>

    <p>Binding sites were predicted by local structural comparisons of whole protein structures using the ProBiS algorithm (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>) and transposition of ligands from the similar binding sites found to the query protein using an updated ProBiS-ligands approach (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>) with the following major improvements introduced in GenProBiS:
<list list-type="roman-lower"><list-item><p>Protein, nucleic acid, compound and metal ion binding sites and ligands are predicted for ∼300 000 protein chains in the PDB.

    <p>Solvent accessible surfaces of binding site grids, which are visualized in the GenProBiS web server, have been precomputed using an in-house algorithm. Structurally mapped somatic mutations and nsSNPs were then assigned to one or more binding sites, and were labeled according to the binding site's ligand type (protein, nucleic acid, compound or ion) and the number of the binding site. To facilitate high-speed access to the binding sites, we precomputed protein binding sites for all protein structures in the PDB, i.e. around 300 000 combinations of PDB and Chain IDs. This binding site prediction across the entire PDB was computationally intensive. It was completed in about 2 months using 1400 CPUs. Future updates of the database will require considerably less time (about a week on a single CPU) since only the difference between the initial and the updated PDBs will need to be recomputed.</p>

  <sec id="SEC3">
    <title>INPUT</title>
    <p>GenProBiS requires as input the PDB and Chain ID (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). It also can use dbSNP's reference SNP cluster (rs) ID (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>), COSMIC's Mutation ID (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>), Uniprot ID or Uniprot's Gene Symbol (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). The basic input is a protein structure (PDB and Chain ID) and when these are entered, clicking the »Search« button takes the user directly to the results page. Alternatively, one may enter dbSNP's rs ID, COSMIC's Mutation ID, UniProt ID or Uniprot's Gene Symbol and then the »Conversion tool« opens and displays the list of PDB protein structures corresponding to the input. A user can then choose a specific structure for further exploration. Using the »Custom input« link the user can also upload a list of custom variants with UniProt sequence positions and chooses the PDB structure to which they are to be mapped.</p>

  <sec id="SEC4">
    <title>OUTPUT</title>
    <p>GenProBiS maps sequence variants to protein binding sites for the given query protein (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). The server allows intuitive visual exploration of mapped sequence variants within the predicted binding site regions using WebGL graphics implemented in the Molmil molecular viewer (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). Molmil allows visualization of large proteins and their multiple ligands in an internet browser. Users can explore three-dimensional (3D) poses of all the transposed ligands within the same query binding site and their potential interactions with mis-sense mutations, a feature not available elsewhere.</p>

      <p>Sequence variants that are within and outside the predicted binding sites are listed in this table in which each row contains: (i) three circular buttons to show (S), label (L) or zoom in (Z) on the sequence variant (e.g. nsSNP) as a stick model on the query protein structure in the »3D Viewer«; (ii) description of the amino acid change, for example Asn78Ser indicates that asparagine changes to serine at the 78th position in the protein sequence according to the UniProt sequence numbering; (iii) if a sequence variant is in one or more binding sites, this is shown as one or more small circles, whose colors indicate the ligand type—brown for metal ions, green for compounds, yellow for proteins and blue for nucleic acids. A number inside each circle is the binding site number; (iv) the variant's accession number, which also serves as an <italic>http</italic> link that allows exploring the sequence variant in its original database; (v) where available, links to various annotation databases, such as ClinVar (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>) and PharmGKB (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>).</p>

Binding sites can be selected according to their ligands' types with buttons labeled »Compound«, »Ion«, »Nucleic«, and »Protein«, and binding site numbers within each ligand type. Selecting a binding site results in a table with its mapped sequence variants. The »Sticks« and »Surface« buttons above this table allow each binding site to be displayed either as sticks or surface models, the latter being the default view.</p>

Each ligand (or several ligands at once) can be selected using (S) button, resulting in ligands’ 3D structures being displayed in the query protein in the »3D Viewer«. Interactions of ligands with sequence variants can be seen by clicking the (I) button, which opens a table listing the minimum distances between all the ligands with the same name and the sequence variant residues. Clicking on a row in this table zooms in and shows the corresponding interaction as a line in the »3D Viewer«. In the »Ligand« column is the name of the ligand (its PDB code or Ligand ID), which is also an <italic>http</italic> link to the ligand's PDB web page. The »Count« column provides the number of ligands with the same PDB code or Ligand ID. Clicking the »Ligand Player« near the top, opens a small console on the right side of the screen with »play«, »forward«, »backward« and »stop« buttons which allows the user to browse through the ligand's predicted 3D poses one by one. This allows the user to visually examine interactions as lines between ligands and variant amino acids and determine potential gain or loss of interactions, allowing for estimation of the impact of a sequence variant on protein's function and ligand binding.</p>

    <title>CASE STUDY 1: nsSNP AND SOMATIC MUTATION EFFECTS ON INHIBITOR BINDING</title>
    <p>Indoleamine 2, 3-dioxygenase (IDO1) is an enzyme that catabolizes tryptophan and has been demonstrated to have an immunosuppressive role (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). It is a validated oncotarget and is thought to be involved in one of the possible mechanisms by which cancer cells evade immune response. Developed inhibitors of this enzyme, aside from binding to heme, form several key interactions with binding site amino acids, for example, Phe163, Phe226 and Arg231 (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). Using GenProBiS with the IDO1 query protein structure (4pk6A), we identified two of these amino acids, Phe163 and Arg231, to be polymorphic (red sticks, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). To analyze the effects of these polymorphisms on inhibitor binding, we used the »Ligand Player« console (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>) to browse through all the available co-crystallized inhibitors (listed in the table in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). We discuss the recently developed imidazothiazole derivative inhibitors with PDB's Ligand IDs PKJ and PKL (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>):
<list list-type="roman-lower"><list-item><p>rs764150078 (Phe163Ser) results in loss of favorable pi–pi interaction of the imidazothiazole ring with phenylanine and reduces binding of both PKJ and PKL inhibitors (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>).</p></list-item><list-item><p>rs774225205 (Arg231Cys) and rs745677091 (Arg231Leu and Arg231His) delete favorable electrostatic interactions of arginine with inhibitor PKJ at the entrance to the binding site cavity.</p></list-item><list-item><p>COSM187719 (Arg231Cys) is a somatic mutation that results in loss of electrostatic interactions with PKJ inhibitor and could lead to drug resistance during cancer therapy with this inhibitor (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>).</p></list-item></list></p>
    <p>These polymorphisms are likely to result in reduced effectiveness of the inhibitors and should be considered in the design of future inhibitors and in their potential clinical usage.</p>

    <title>CASE STUDY 2: SOMATIC MUTATION IN P53 LINKED TO GLIOBLASTOMA MULTIFORME</title>
    <p>Glioblastoma multiforme is a most aggressive and malignant subtype of human brain tumor. Variant rs121913343 in the TP53 gene was found in tumor tissue of patients with glioblastoma and was linked to tumor growth (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). The TP53 gene encodes for the tumor suppressor protein p53, which plays an essential role in preventing cancer. Using the gene symbol TP53 as the query (the structure chosen in the »Conversion Tool« was 1gzhC), we observed that the mutation Arg273Ser corresponding to rs121913343 occurs in a nucleic acid binding site for BAX response element (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>) (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). We postulate that the replacement of arginine by serine vitiates the salt bridge interaction of the arginine with DNA's phosphate group. This weakens the p53-DNA interaction and decreases the tumor suppression activity of p53. The importance of this finding could be experimentally tested by comparing the stability of the wild-type to that of the mutated p53–DNA complex.</p>

    <title>CASE STUDY 3: INTERPRETATION OF GENOME-WIDE ASSOCIATION STUDIES</title>
    <p>Serum concentration levels of intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) have been associated with diverse conditions. In a genome-wide association study, several nsSNPs, including rs1799969, were associated with lower solubility of this protein in plasma (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). Using the rs1799969 as the query (the structure chosen in the »Conversion Tool« was 1p53B), we suggest that the decreased solubility may be due to this mutation disrupting glycosylation of this protein. Glycosylation has been shown to increase solubility of proteins (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>) and indeed, rs1799969 which describes the change Gly241Arg occurs in the N-glycosylation site (binding site #3) on ICAM-1. The substituted arginine (UniProt location: 241; PDB residue ID: 214) could form a salt bridge with the nearby aspartate (UniProt location: 268; PDB residue ID: 241) belonging to the N-glycosylation sequon Asn-Asp-Ser, thereby changing its structure and preventing glycosylation of ICAM-1. This result offers an alternative explanation for the effect of this polymorphism on the solubility of ICAM-1, which was previously thought to be due to the weakened binding to integrin MAC-1 (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>).</p>

    <title>CONCLUSION</title>
    <p>GenProBiS is a web server designed for detection and 3D visualization of sequence variants such as somatic mis-sense mutations and nsSNPs in protein binding sites. Binding sites and their ligands are predicted with no prior knowledge of binding sites, but based on detected local structural similarities in proteins and transposition of ligands between protein structures irrespective of protein folding. GenProBiS allows suggestion of functional effects of mutations on ligand binding and as such represents a key tool in both drug discovery and personalized medicine. The results of the GenProBiS web server could enable focused laboratory experiments based on targeted hypotheses in several research fields including human, veterinary medicine, animal and plant breeding.</p>
