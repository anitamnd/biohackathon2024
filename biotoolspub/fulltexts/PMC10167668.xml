    <abstract>
      <p>Protein conformational dynamics that may inform biology often lie dormant in high-resolution electron-density maps. While an estimated ∼18% of side chains in high-resolution models contain alternative conformations, these are underrepresented in current PDB models due to difficulties in manually detecting, building and inspecting alternative conformers. To overcome this challenge, we developed an automated multi-conformer modeling program, <italic toggle="yes">FLEXR</italic>. Using <italic toggle="yes">Ringer</italic>-based electron-density sampling, <italic toggle="yes">FLEXR</italic> builds explicit multi-conformer models for refinement. Thereby, it bridges the gap of detecting hidden alternate states in electron-density maps and including them in structural models for refinement, inspection and deposition. Using a series of high-quality crystal structures (0.8–1.85 Å resolution), we show that the multi-conformer models produced by <italic toggle="yes">FLEXR</italic> uncover new insights that are missing in models built either manually or using current tools. Specifically, <italic toggle="yes">FLEXR</italic> models revealed hidden side chains and backbone conformations in ligand-binding sites that may redefine protein–ligand binding mechanisms. Ultimately, the tool facilitates crystallographers with opportunities to include explicit multi-conformer states in their high-resolution crystallographic models. One key advantage is that such models may better reflect interesting higher energy features in electron-density maps that are rarely consulted by the community at large, which can then be productively used for ligand discovery downstream. <italic toggle="yes">FLEXR</italic> is open source and publicly available on GitHub at <ext-link xlink:href="https://github.com/TheFischerLab/FLEXR" ext-link-type="uri">https://github.com/TheFischerLab/FLEXR</ext-link>.</p>

    <title>Introduction</title>
    <p>Flexibility underscores many aspects of protein function such as ligand binding, catalysis and allostery (Buhrman <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2010<xref rid="bb5" ref-type="bibr"> ▸</xref>; Krojer <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2020<xref rid="bb28" ref-type="bibr"> ▸</xref>; Henzler-Wildman &amp; Kern, 2007<xref rid="bb24" ref-type="bibr"> ▸</xref>; Eisenmesser <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2005<xref rid="bb14" ref-type="bibr"> ▸</xref>). Rather than a single static structure, proteins exist as an ensemble of states, which repopulate in response to different perturbations and environments (Fraser <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2011<xref rid="bb19" ref-type="bibr"> ▸</xref>; Girard <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2022<xref rid="bb21" ref-type="bibr"> ▸</xref>; Russi <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2017<xref rid="bb46" ref-type="bibr"> ▸</xref>). Developing comprehensive movies of protein motion can communicate a deeper understanding of the relationship between structure and function and reveal new opportunities to design thera­peutics (Carlson, 2002<xref rid="bb8" ref-type="bibr"> ▸</xref>; Meagher &amp; Carlson, 2004<xref rid="bb35" ref-type="bibr"> ▸</xref>).</p>
    <p>X-ray crystallography is one of the foremost techniques used to develop three-dimensional protein structures with near-atomic spatial resolution. Crystallography is intrinsically an ensemble measurement, where the final electron-density map represents an average across all protein copies in the lattice. Therefore, maps contain information about conformational heterogeneity, which is often transient, sparse and difficult to detect. There has been a recent surge of new and sensitive crystallographic methods that link shifting conformational ensembles to different stimuli such as temperature (Stachowski <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2022<xref rid="bb48" ref-type="bibr"> ▸</xref>; Bradford <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2021<xref rid="bb4" ref-type="bibr"> ▸</xref>), photoactivation (Tenboer <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2014<xref rid="bb49" ref-type="bibr"> ▸</xref>) and ligand binding (Krojer <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2020<xref rid="bb28" ref-type="bibr"> ▸</xref>; Stachowski &amp; Fischer, 2022<xref rid="bb47" ref-type="bibr"> ▸</xref>; Pearce, Krojer &amp; von Delft, 2017<xref rid="bb40" ref-type="bibr"> ▸</xref>). For example, electron-density maps developed at elevated temperatures often contain a richer picture of protein dynamics that includes side-chain and backbone repositioning, which is often hidden or frozen out at cryogenic temperatures, at which crystallographic studies are typically performed (Fischer, 2021<xref rid="bb17" ref-type="bibr"> ▸</xref>). Time-resolved experiments can interrogate femtosecond conformational changes at X-ray free-electron laser facilities (Pandey <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2020<xref rid="bb38" ref-type="bibr"> ▸</xref>) and microsecond dynamics at third-generation synchrotron light sources (Pearson &amp; Mehrabi, 2020<xref rid="bb41" ref-type="bibr"> ▸</xref>). These experiments are progressing towards ‘molecular movies’ that show complete real-time conformational trajectories (Martin-Garcia <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2016<xref rid="bb34" ref-type="bibr"> ▸</xref>). The recent emergence of high-throughput protein–ligand crystallography can reveal weakly populated ligand-bound states (Pearce, Krojer, Bradley <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2017<xref rid="bb39" ref-type="bibr"> ▸</xref>) and allosteric sites (Krojer <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2020<xref rid="bb28" ref-type="bibr"> ▸</xref>). Together, these new methods are creating large amounts of crystallographic data and require corresponding advances in computational modeling that accurately, thoroughly and quickly describe alternate conformational states that either occur simultaneously or transition from one state to another. While there are several automatic approaches for building single-conformer models (Joosten <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2009<xref rid="bb25" ref-type="bibr"> ▸</xref>; Langer <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2008<xref rid="bb30" ref-type="bibr"> ▸</xref>; Cowtan, 2006<xref rid="bb11" ref-type="bibr"> ▸</xref>; Terwilliger, 2004<xref rid="bb50" ref-type="bibr"> ▸</xref>), there are fewer options for building multi-state models.</p>
    <p>Conformational heterogeneity in protein crystal structures can be represented by <italic toggle="yes">B</italic> factors, multi-copy and multi-conformer modeling (Riley <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2021<xref rid="bb45" ref-type="bibr"> ▸</xref>; van den Bedem &amp; Fraser, 2015<xref rid="bb3" ref-type="bibr"> ▸</xref>). Firstly, <italic toggle="yes">B</italic> factors represent the thermal displacement of individual atoms around a mean position isotopically and, at a sufficient ratio of observations to parameters, anisotropically (Merritt, 1999<xref rid="bb36" ref-type="bibr"> ▸</xref>). Yet, <italic toggle="yes">B</italic> factors also reflect the general uncertainty of the position of each atom and do not describe correlated positional changes of groups of atoms, for example transitions of side-chain rotamers (Lovell <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2000<xref rid="bb33" ref-type="bibr"> ▸</xref>). Secondly, multi-copy modeling produces more than one discrete and complete protein structure to explain a single set of experimental data. This is commonly practiced in cryo-electron microscopy via multi-body refinement (Nakane <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2018<xref rid="bb37" ref-type="bibr"> ▸</xref>), but one tool for crystallographic data is <italic toggle="yes">Phenix-MD</italic> (<italic toggle="yes">phenix.ensemble_refinement</italic>; Burnley <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2012<xref rid="bb7" ref-type="bibr"> ▸</xref>). <italic toggle="yes">Phenix-MD</italic> combines traditional <italic toggle="yes">Phenix</italic> crystallographic refinement with density-restrained molecular-dynamics (MD) simulations that focus on sampling local dynamics. However, MD using crystal structures as simulation starting points can be limited by energy barriers (Ploscariu <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2021<xref rid="bb42" ref-type="bibr"> ▸</xref>), especially with structures solved at cryogenic temperatures (Bradford <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2021<xref rid="bb4" ref-type="bibr"> ▸</xref>). While multi-copy approaches do comprehensively describe conformational heterogeneity, the main drawback is that they often unnecessarily inflate the number of parameters that are needed to describe the data. For instance, many of the atoms in each model that are not flexible will share the same position across copies, so there is no need to describe them more than once. In crystallography, this overfitting is detrimental and will overextend the data-to-parameter ratio and increase <italic toggle="yes">R</italic>
<sub>gap</sub> (Ginn, 2021<xref rid="bb20" ref-type="bibr"> ▸</xref>). Lastly, multi-conformer modeling aims to explain both areas of conformational heterogeneity and homogeneity in a single parsimonious model (Keedy, 2019<xref rid="bb26" ref-type="bibr"> ▸</xref>). A popular implementation of this is <italic toggle="yes">qFit</italic>, which has been developed through several iterations (Keedy <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2015<xref rid="bb27" ref-type="bibr"> ▸</xref>; van den Bedem <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2009<xref rid="bb2" ref-type="bibr"> ▸</xref>) and expanded to interrogate protein, ligand (van Zundert <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2018<xref rid="bb54" ref-type="bibr"> ▸</xref>) and cryo-EM data (Riley <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2021<xref rid="bb45" ref-type="bibr"> ▸</xref>). <italic toggle="yes">qFit</italic> works by computing an occupancy-weighted set of both main-chain and side-chain conformations that together best describe the electron density. <italic toggle="yes">qFit</italic> initially creates many conformations using mixed-integer quadratic programming and iteratively whittles the possibilities down to a handful of conformers using a convex optimization algorithm (Keedy <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2015<xref rid="bb27" ref-type="bibr"> ▸</xref>).</p>
    <p>Another tool is <italic toggle="yes">Ringer</italic>, which falls into its own class of ‘conformation-detection’ programs (Lang <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2010<xref rid="bb29" ref-type="bibr"> ▸</xref>). <italic toggle="yes">Ringer</italic> measures the electron density around side-chain dihedral angles, where peaks in density correspond to side-chain conformations. <italic toggle="yes">Ringer</italic> was used to systematically interrogate a subset of the PDB with resolution better than 1.5 Å and it was found that a surprisingly high number (∼18%) of side chains have alternative conformations, many of which are not accounted for in the deposited models (Lang <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2010<xref rid="bb29" ref-type="bibr"> ▸</xref>). <italic toggle="yes">Ringer</italic> detects weakly populated rotamers in electron density down to 0.3σ and can interrogate conformational changes from temperature (Stachowski <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2022<xref rid="bb48" ref-type="bibr"> ▸</xref>) and ligand binding (Bradford <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2021<xref rid="bb4" ref-type="bibr"> ▸</xref>) and validate cryo-EM models (Barad <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2015<xref rid="bb1" ref-type="bibr"> ▸</xref>). While <italic toggle="yes">Ringer</italic> typically requires complete manual inspection of per-residue ‘Ringer plots’, we have recently automated peak detection to highlight regions of interest and reveal ‘conformational barcodes’ (Stachowski <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2022<xref rid="bb48" ref-type="bibr"> ▸</xref>). Yet, for all its usefulness, explicitly including information from <italic toggle="yes">Ringer</italic> into protein models still requires tedious manual model building.</p>
    <p>To bridge this gap, we combined our previous <italic toggle="yes">Ringer</italic> peak-finding tools with the model-building functions of <italic toggle="yes">Coot</italic> (Emsley &amp; Cowtan, 2004<xref rid="bb15" ref-type="bibr"> ▸</xref>) into a pipeline: <italic toggle="yes">FLEXR</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">FLEXR</italic> automatically detects alternative side-chain conformations in <italic toggle="yes">Ringer</italic> measurements and builds them into protein models. To assess its utility, we compared <italic toggle="yes">R</italic> factors, geometry metrics and properties of side chains in <italic toggle="yes">FLEXR</italic> models against deposited and <italic toggle="yes">qFit</italic>-derived models using a test set of high-quality X-ray structures. We also inspected ligand-binding sites and found examples where <italic toggle="yes">FLEXR</italic> detected and built minor side-chain conformations that are missing in models produced by other methods. Although not inherently detected by <italic toggle="yes">Ringer</italic>, combining models from <italic toggle="yes">FLEXR</italic> with traditional refinement exposed examples of backbone heterogeneity. Ultimately, <italic toggle="yes">FLEXR</italic> simplifies initial and systematic examinations of protein flexibility in crystal structures and, more importantly, enables this information to be automatically incorporated in deposited models for the community at large.

        <p><italic toggle="yes">FLEXR</italic> automatically finds and builds alternative side-chain conformations into models based on <italic toggle="yes">Ringer</italic> electron-density measurements (Fig. 1<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig"> ▸</xref>). <italic toggle="yes">FLEXR</italic> is a command-line tool and is written in Python (version 3.9) using the <italic toggle="yes">Pandas</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">SciPy</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">NumPy</italic> packages. Automatic model building is performed using <italic toggle="yes">Coot</italic> (version 1.0.05; Emsley &amp; Cowtan, 2004<xref rid="bb15" ref-type="bibr"> ▸</xref>; Casañal <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2020<xref rid="bb9" ref-type="bibr"> ▸</xref>; Emsley <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2010<xref rid="bb16" ref-type="bibr"> ▸</xref>). <italic toggle="yes">FLEXR</italic> was tested on MacOS Monterey with Apple M1 and Intel processors.

        <p><italic toggle="yes">FLEXR</italic> relies on the original <italic toggle="yes">Ringer</italic> algorithm for electron-density sampling around each dihedral of each residue in the input model (Lang <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2010<xref rid="bb29" ref-type="bibr"> ▸</xref>). <italic toggle="yes">Ringer</italic> is available through the <italic toggle="yes">mmtbx</italic> module in the <italic toggle="yes">cctbx</italic> library (Grosse-Kunstleve <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2002<xref rid="bb22" ref-type="bibr"> ▸</xref>). <italic toggle="yes">FLEXR</italic> uses the peak-detection algorithm that we have recently implemented (Stachowski <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2022<xref rid="bb48" ref-type="bibr"> ▸</xref>) to find heightened levels of density that correspond to potential alterative side-chain positions. The angle where each density peak occurs is recorded.</p>

        <label>2.1.3.</label>
        <title><italic toggle="yes">FLEXR</italic> Part 2: assembling peaks into side-chain rotamers</title>
        <p>The angle for each detected peak from Part 1 is assembled across all dihedrals for a side chain into all possible combinations. Each combination is tested using the ideal rotamer library (Lovell <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2000<xref rid="bb33" ref-type="bibr"> ▸</xref>) to determine whether the measured dihedral angles are close to ideal rotameric angles based on a user-defined threshold (see below). Combinations that have tolerable geometry are assigned a ‘rotamer name’ from the matching entry, for instance ‘p’, ‘t’ or ‘m’ for the three ideal threonine rotamers, and will be incorporated based on this name into the model using <italic toggle="yes">Coot</italic> in Part 3. In the case where a measured rotamer matches multiple entries in the rotamer library, the rotamer that is most frequent in the PDB is selected for building. One caveat of this approach is that determining rotamers from density peaks alone is inherently ambiguous. For example, a residue with two dihedrals and two peaks at each dihedral creates up to four possible rotamers, but no less than two. This situation is exacerbated at moderate resolutions and especially with flexible residues such as lysine and arginine that have four dihedrals and often do not have well resolved electron density at higher dihedrals. <italic toggle="yes">FLEXR</italic> is designed to systematically build all possible rotamers (with reasonable geometry). Therefore, we strongly recommend that users refine the final model and manually inspect alternative conformers.</p>

      <title>Evaluating <italic toggle="yes">FLEXR</italic>
</title>
      <p>To test <italic toggle="yes">FLEXR</italic>, we used a set of 15 models with resolutions ranging from 0.80 to 1.85 Å that was first curated by Keedy and coworkers to evaluate <italic toggle="yes">qFit</italic> versions 2.0 (Keedy <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2015<xref rid="bb27" ref-type="bibr"> ▸</xref>) and 3.0 (Riley <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2021<xref rid="bb45" ref-type="bibr"> ▸</xref>). We chose this established benchmarking set as it contains high-quality data sets with missing alternative side-chain conformations and includes biomedical and ligand-bound targets. Coordinates and structure factors were obtained from the Protein Data Bank (Burley <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2022<xref rid="bb6" ref-type="bibr"> ▸</xref>). Alternate conformations in the deposited models were discarded prior to multi-conformer modeling. The deposited models were compared using the original deposited models (‘deposited’) and the deposited models after refinement using the same <italic toggle="yes">Phenix</italic> protocol as the <italic toggle="yes">FLEXR</italic> models (‘dep-refined’). <italic toggle="yes">FLEXR</italic> was performed with a peak-detection threshold of σ ≥ 0.35 and a tolerance for matching ideal rotameric geometries of ≤30°. The values of both parameters are close to those suggested by Lang <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> (2010<xref rid="bb29" ref-type="bibr"> ▸</xref>) to maximize sensitivity while avoiding false positives. <italic toggle="yes">FLEXR</italic> models were refined as described in Section 2.1.5<xref rid="sec2.1.5" ref-type="sec"/>. Alternate side-chain conformations were built using completely new residues (as opposed to branching at the C<sup>α</sup> atom). <italic toggle="yes">qFit</italic> (version 3.0) was performed with backbone modeling (‘<italic toggle="yes">qFit’</italic>) and without (using the <monospace>--no-backbone option</monospace>; ‘<italic toggle="yes">qFit</italic>-no-bb’), using default settings otherwise. <italic toggle="yes">qFit</italic> models were refined using their packaged refinement script (<monospace>qfit_final_refine_xray.sh</monospace>) using default settings. <italic toggle="yes">Phenix</italic> (version 1.20) was used throughout for refinement and <italic toggle="yes">R</italic>-value calculations (Liebschner <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2019<xref rid="bb32" ref-type="bibr"> ▸</xref>). Model-quality metrics were calculated with <italic toggle="yes">MolProbity</italic> (Williams <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2018<xref rid="bb53" ref-type="bibr"> ▸</xref>). <italic toggle="yes">Phenix</italic> tools were used to calculate real-space correlation coefficients (RSCCs; <italic toggle="yes">phenix.real_space_correlation</italic>) and rotamer geometries (<italic toggle="yes">phenix.rotalyze</italic>).

      <title>Validation of rotamers in <italic toggle="yes">FLEXR</italic> models</title>
      <p>To evaluate the performance of <italic toggle="yes">FLEXR</italic> we used a test set of 15 high-resolution X-ray structures (Keedy <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2015<xref rid="bb27" ref-type="bibr"> ▸</xref>). Running on a single processor, detecting and building side-chain conformers with <italic toggle="yes">FLEXR</italic> took ∼2 min for most structures. Notably, this step only trivially increased the total average time of 107 min spent to refine these structures with <italic toggle="yes">Phenix</italic> (<ext-link xlink:href="#suppinfoanchor" ext-link-type="uri">Supplementary Fig. S1</ext-link>). To validate the placement of rotamers in <italic toggle="yes">FLEXR</italic> models, we monitored the real-space correlation coefficient (RSCC), normalized <italic toggle="yes">B</italic> factors (<italic toggle="yes">B</italic>
<sub>norm</sub>) and occupancies. Some 65% of rotamers have all side-chain atoms with RSCC &gt; 0.70 (the suggested cutoff for modeling by <italic toggle="yes">MolProbity</italic>) and 19% of these rotamers have low occupancies (occupancy &lt; 0.25; Fig. 2<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig"> ▸</xref>
<italic toggle="yes">a</italic>). Meanwhile, 85% of rotamers had a median side-chain atom RSCC &gt; 0.8, 30% of which have low occupancies (Fig. 2<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig"> ▸</xref>
<italic toggle="yes">b</italic>). Similarly, less than 14% of rotamers exhibited high (&gt;1) <italic toggle="yes">B</italic>
<sub>norm</sub> values (<ext-link xlink:href="#suppinfoanchor" ext-link-type="uri">Supplementary Fig. S2</ext-link>). Interestingly, some of the rotamers with the highest <italic toggle="yes">B</italic>
<sub>norm</sub> values had reasonable occupancy and RSCC values.</p>
      <p>Considering that the proportions of alternative conformations are often inferred from <italic toggle="yes">Ringer</italic> peaks without being directly estimated from refinement, we next sought to test the relationship of occupancies to <italic toggle="yes">Ringer</italic> electron-density measurements. Since serines have a single, unbranched dihedral angle they present the most straightforward test case. Comparing refined occupancies with integrated electron-density peak areas relative to conformers of the same residue in <italic toggle="yes">FLEXR</italic> models showed a strong positive relationship with a Pearson correlation coefficient (<italic toggle="yes">r</italic>) of 0.83 (Fig. 2<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig"> ▸</xref>
<italic toggle="yes">c</italic>). Unsurprisingly, this relationship was weakest where electron-density peaks were also weak. For example, electron-density peaks with relative areas varying between 0.01 and 0.10 generally varied in refined occupancy between 0.00 and 0.40 and sometimes exceeded 0.60. Additionally, relative electron density does not appear to be a strong predictor of refined <italic toggle="yes">B</italic>
<sub>norm</sub> (<italic toggle="yes">r</italic> = −0.15; Fig. 2<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig"> ▸</xref>
<italic toggle="yes">d</italic>). For example, 26% of rotamers identified from weak <italic toggle="yes">Ringer</italic> peaks refined with low <italic toggle="yes">B</italic>
<sub>norm</sub> values, whereas 18% of rotamers identified from strong peaks had large <italic toggle="yes">B</italic>
<sub>norm</sub> values.</p>
      <p>Flexible residues such as arginine and lysine and aromatic residues are the most poorly modeled residues, while the sulfur-containing residues (cysteine and methionine) and small residues (such as serine and threonine) were modeled best (<ext-link xlink:href="#suppinfoanchor" ext-link-type="uri">Supplementary Fig. S3</ext-link>). Yet, relating RSCC (Figs. 3<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig"> ▸</xref>

<italic toggle="yes">d</italic>) of C<sup>α</sup> atoms to those of the more distant side-chain C atoms C<sup>β</sup> and C<sup>γ</sup> showed strong correlations throughout. Only 1–2% of side chains contained C<sup>α</sup> and C<sup>β</sup> or C<sup>γ</sup> with RSCC values both below 0.7. This suggests that while there might not be density to support the modeling of entire side chains there is sufficient electron density to identify flexibility at most sites. Inspecting the two side chains with the most egregious C<sup>β</sup> RSCC values showed that these side chains still have convincing density for the placement of an alternative conformation (<ext-link xlink:href="#suppinfoanchor" ext-link-type="uri">Supplementary Fig. S4</ext-link>).</p>

      <title>Improved multi-conformer model quality with <italic toggle="yes">FLEXR</italic>
</title>
      <p>To assess model quality, we compared five different variations of model building using the same 15 data sets: (i) deposited models, (ii) deposited models re-refined with the <italic toggle="yes">Phenix</italic> protocol outlined in Section 2<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec"/> (‘dep-refined’), (iii) <italic toggle="yes">FLEXR</italic>, (iv) <italic toggle="yes">qFit</italic> without backbone sampling (‘<italic toggle="yes">qFit</italic>-no-bb’) and (v) <italic toggle="yes">qFit</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">B</italic>-factor refinement was treated identically for each model across protocols except in one case (<ext-link xlink:href="#suppinfoanchor" ext-link-type="uri">Supplementary Table S1</ext-link>). <italic toggle="yes">qFit</italic> did not converge into a parsimonious model in five of 15 cases (<ext-link xlink:href="#suppinfoanchor" ext-link-type="uri">Supplementary Fig. S5</ext-link>); <italic toggle="yes">FLEXR</italic> generated models for all 15 cases. With neither <italic toggle="yes">qFit</italic> approach converging for one case, PDB entry <ext-link xlink:href="https://scripts.iucr.org/cgi-bin/cr.cgi?rm=pdb&amp;pdbId=1w0n" ext-link-type="uri">1w0n</ext-link>, this left 14 cases with at least one <italic toggle="yes">qFit</italic> model. Firstly, we compared how the <italic toggle="yes">R</italic> values of the various modeling approaches deviate from the original deposited models (Fig. 4<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig"> ▸</xref>). Re-refining the deposited structures produced models with the lowest <italic toggle="yes">R</italic>

<sub>free</sub> than when including backbone sampling in seven out of ten cases (<ext-link xlink:href="#suppinfoanchor" ext-link-type="uri">Supplementary Fig. S5</ext-link>). Relative to either <italic toggle="yes">qFit</italic> approach, <italic toggle="yes">FLEXR</italic> models had a lower <italic toggle="yes">R</italic>
<sub>free</sub> in nine out of 14 cases and for PDB entry <ext-link xlink:href="https://scripts.iucr.org/cgi-bin/cr.cgi?rm=pdb&amp;pdbId=2c6z" ext-link-type="uri">2c6z</ext-link>
<italic toggle="yes">FLEXR</italic> produced the model with the lowest <italic toggle="yes">R</italic>

<italic toggle="yes">a</italic> and <ext-link xlink:href="#suppinfoanchor" ext-link-type="uri">Supplementary Fig. S5</ext-link>). The median <italic toggle="yes">FLEXR</italic>
<italic toggle="yes">R</italic>

As expected, both <italic toggle="yes">qFit</italic> approaches typically produced models with lower <italic toggle="yes">R</italic>
<sub>work</sub> than the deposited and <italic toggle="yes">FLEXR</italic> models (Fig. 4<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig"> ▸</xref>
<italic toggle="yes">b</italic> and <ext-link xlink:href="#suppinfoanchor" ext-link-type="uri">Supplementary Fig. S6</ext-link>), and the <italic toggle="yes">qFit</italic>-no-bb models generally had the lowest <italic toggle="yes">R</italic>
<sub>work</sub> overall. <italic toggle="yes">FLEXR</italic> models have the smallest <italic toggle="yes">R</italic>
<sub>gap</sub> in five out of 15 cases and in 12 out of 14 comparisons to either <italic toggle="yes">qFit</italic> models (Fig. 4<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig"> ▸</xref>
<italic toggle="yes">c</italic> and <ext-link xlink:href="#suppinfoanchor" ext-link-type="uri">Supplementary Fig. S7</ext-link>). The clashscores for <italic toggle="yes">FLEXR</italic> models were close (&lt;5 points) to the deposited models in ten out of 15 cases and lower than the respective <italic toggle="yes">qFit</italic> model in four out of 14 cases (Fig. 4<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig"> ▸</xref>
<italic toggle="yes">d</italic> and <ext-link xlink:href="#suppinfoanchor" ext-link-type="uri">Supplementary Fig. S8</ext-link>). Yet, three <italic toggle="yes">FLEXR</italic> models had egregiously high clashscores, with one even exceeding a value of 100, whereas deposited models all had scores of less than 12. Inspecting some of these cases showed that weak alternative conformations were built in the interior of the protein in impossible positions despite having <italic toggle="yes">Ringer</italic> peaks at rotameric angles (<ext-link xlink:href="#suppinfoanchor" ext-link-type="uri">Supplementary Fig. S9</ext-link>). Notably, the <italic toggle="yes">FLEXR</italic> models with high clashscores were at higher resolutions. <italic toggle="yes">FLEXR</italic> models also generally had poorer Ramachandran statistics, which were the worst values overall in five out of 15 cases (Fig. 4<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig"> ▸</xref>
<italic toggle="yes">e</italic> and <ext-link xlink:href="#suppinfoanchor" ext-link-type="uri">Supplementary Fig. S10</ext-link>). Despite this, in terms of <italic toggle="yes">MolProbity</italic> scores, which compress many validation metrics, including clashscore, into a single score, <italic toggle="yes">FLEXR</italic> models scored well overall. Lower scores correspond to better models and <italic toggle="yes">FLEXR</italic> models had a median score of 1.66, which falls between those for dep-refined (1.58) and <italic toggle="yes">qFit</italic>-no-bb models (1.74). <italic toggle="yes">qFit</italic> models have the highest (worst) scores overall, with a median of 1.86 (Fig. 4<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig"> ▸</xref>
<italic toggle="yes">f</italic> and <ext-link xlink:href="#suppinfoanchor" ext-link-type="uri">Supplementary Fig. S11</ext-link>). Taking the final <italic toggle="yes">FLEXR</italic> models and re-refining them with the <italic toggle="yes">qFit</italic> refinement protocol, which contains an occupancy-based rotamer-culling step, removed many of these problematic side chains but notably produced models with worse <italic toggle="yes">R</italic>
<sub>free</sub> values (<ext-link xlink:href="#suppinfoanchor" ext-link-type="uri">Supplementary Figs. S12 and S13</ext-link>). Together, these results show that multi-conformer models produced by <italic toggle="yes">FLEXR</italic> typically have similar or better model quality metrics compared with models produced by the two <italic toggle="yes">qFit</italic> approaches that we tested.</p>

      <title><italic toggle="yes">FLEXR</italic> produces models with diverse side-chain populations</title>
      <p>To evaluate the model details, we next compared how side chains were modeled across methods. In the original <italic toggle="yes">Ringer</italic> paper, the authors estimated that ∼18% of side chains in models with resolutions &lt;1.5 Å had alternative conformations (Lang <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2010<xref rid="bb29" ref-type="bibr"> ▸</xref>). As expected, the deposited models typically have ∼5% of side chains with modeled alternative conformations (Fig. 5<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig"> ▸</xref>
<italic toggle="yes">a</italic> and <ext-link xlink:href="#suppinfoanchor" ext-link-type="uri">Supplementary Fig. S14</ext-link>). While <italic toggle="yes">FLEXR</italic> models have more alternate conformers, by &lt;10% on average, these are still much fewer than the anticipated 18%, but this could be caused by the lower resolution (up to 1.85 Å) of the test set that we used. However, <italic toggle="yes">qFit</italic>-no-bb models detected a median of &gt;40% alternate conformers, while <italic toggle="yes">qFit</italic> had a median of ∼35%, both of which are much higher than the expected frequency. Looking at the number of conformations per residue with multiple conformations shows that most deposited models typically contain two alternative conformers (for example A and B) and in these cases usually have even occupancies, suggesting that occupancies were not refined prior to deposition (Figs. 5<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig"> ▸</xref>
<italic toggle="yes">b</italic> and 5<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig"> ▸</xref>
<italic toggle="yes">c</italic> and <ext-link xlink:href="#suppinfoanchor" ext-link-type="uri">Supplementary Figs. S15 and S16</ext-link>), which may explain the improvement of <italic toggle="yes">R</italic>
<sub>free</sub> in deposited models using our simple refinement protocol (Fig. 4<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig"> ▸</xref>
<italic toggle="yes">a</italic>). This is also supported by the more heterogeneous distribution of occupancies after refinement (Fig. 5<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig"> ▸</xref>
<italic toggle="yes">b</italic>). Median occupancies in both <italic toggle="yes">qFit</italic> approaches are also generally lower than in the deposited models (Fig. 5<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig"> ▸</xref>
<italic toggle="yes">b</italic>) due to the larger number of built conformers compared with the other methods (Fig. 5<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig"> ▸</xref>
<italic toggle="yes">a</italic>). While side chains in <italic toggle="yes">FLEXR</italic> models have the lowest median occupancy, this is deflated by the 8% of conformers with occupancies of zero (<ext-link xlink:href="#suppinfoanchor" ext-link-type="uri">Supplementary Fig. S17</ext-link>). We recommend removing zero-occupancy conformers prior to the final refinement as described in the <ext-link xlink:href="#suppinfoanchor" ext-link-type="uri">supporting information</ext-link>; including them can lead to issues with occupancy refinement, bulk-solvent masking, map calculation and interpretation. Almost half of all zero-occupancy conformers were found in PDB entry <ext-link xlink:href="https://scripts.iucr.org/cgi-bin/cr.cgi?rm=pdb&amp;pdbId=1x9i" ext-link-type="uri">1x9i</ext-link> (<ext-link xlink:href="#suppinfoanchor" ext-link-type="uri">Supplementary Fig. S17</ext-link>). Counting the number of alternate conformations per multi-conformer residue further reveals the differences between manual model building, <italic toggle="yes">FLEXR</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">qFit</italic> approaches (Fig. 5<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig"> ▸</xref>
<italic toggle="yes">d</italic>). Again, most manually built models generally use only two alternative conformations to explain side-chain flexibility. <italic toggle="yes">qFit</italic> models contain a larger proportion of side chains with 3–4 conformations, and surprisingly <italic toggle="yes">qFit</italic> with backbone sampling allows some side chains to be modeled with up to five conformers. <italic toggle="yes">FLEXR</italic> models have the most heterogenous side-chain modeling as most side chains with alternative states contain 2–4 conformers and, rarely, up to nine (<ext-link xlink:href="#suppinfoanchor" ext-link-type="uri">Supplementary Figs. S15 and S16</ext-link>). Comparing the commonality of rotamers revealed that surprisingly few rotamers were found in all methods and each method produced many rotamers that were unique (Fig. 5<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig"> ▸</xref>
<italic toggle="yes">d</italic>). Specifically, <italic toggle="yes">FLEXR</italic> reproduced 32% of rotamers present in deposited models and <italic toggle="yes">qFit</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">qFit</italic>-no-bb reproduced 50% and 77%, respectively (Fig. 5<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig"> ▸</xref>
<italic toggle="yes">e</italic>). However, <italic toggle="yes">FLEXR</italic> produced the highest percentage of non-identical rotamers at 91% compared with ∼60% for both <italic toggle="yes">qFit</italic> approaches (Fig. 5<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig"> ▸</xref>

      <title><italic toggle="yes">FLEXR</italic> reveals new side-chain conformations at protein–ligand interfaces</title>
      <p>To explore the sensitivity of each method, we manually investigated flexibility in ligand-binding sites. We identified two instances where <italic toggle="yes">FLEXR</italic> finds hidden side-chain conformations that are missing in the deposited and <italic toggle="yes">qFit</italic> models and would likely have an impact on how ligand binding is interpreted. The first example is Tyr215 in the B chain of the 1.45 Å resolution structure of prostaglandin reductase 3 (MGC45594) bound to NAP (PDB entry <ext-link xlink:href="https://scripts.iucr.org/cgi-bin/cr.cgi?rm=pdb&amp;pdbId=2c0c" ext-link-type="uri">2c0c</ext-link>; Fig. 6<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig"> ▸</xref>
<italic toggle="yes">a</italic>). In the deposited and <italic toggle="yes">qFit</italic> models (Fig. 6<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig"> ▸</xref>
<italic toggle="yes">b</italic>) there is a single conformation of Tyr215 (occupancy of 1.0) which hydrogen bonds to NAP. Yet, inspection of the electron density around χ<sup>1</sup> with <italic toggle="yes">Ringer</italic> shows a second minor conformation (Fig. 6<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig"> ▸</xref>
<italic toggle="yes">c</italic>). This is automatically detected with <italic toggle="yes">FLEXR</italic> and built into the model, which reveals that in this minor conformation the tyrosine is positioned away from and no longer interacts with the ligand 12% of the time. The second example is Lys298 in the B chain of the 1.16 Å resolution <italic toggle="yes">Pyrobaculum aerophilum</italic> phosphoglucose isomerase structure complexed with glucose 6-phosphate (PDB entry <ext-link xlink:href="https://scripts.iucr.org/cgi-bin/cr.cgi?rm=pdb&amp;pdbId=1x9i" ext-link-type="uri">1x9i</ext-link>). Despite clear electron density, the deposited model contains a single conformation of the lysine (occupancy of 1.0) that forms two hydrogen bonds to the ligand (Fig. 6<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig"> ▸</xref>
<italic toggle="yes">d</italic>). <italic toggle="yes">qFit</italic> built two, apparently redundant, conformations of the lysine (occupancies of 0.69 and 0.31; Fig. 6<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig"> ▸</xref>
<italic toggle="yes">e</italic>). <italic toggle="yes">FLEXR</italic> detects a second peak in the χ<sup>3</sup>
<italic toggle="yes">Ringer</italic> plot and builds the conformer accordingly (occupancies of 0.74 and 0.26; Fig. 6<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig"> ▸</xref>
<italic toggle="yes">f</italic>). The weak conformer is positioned away from the ligand and no longer interacts with the ligand 26% of the time based on refined occupancies. These examples show that <italic toggle="yes">FLEXR</italic> can find and build hidden side-chain conformations and enable a more rigorous investigation of protein–ligand interactions.</p>

      <title><italic toggle="yes">FLEXR</italic> can reveal backbone conformational heterogeneity</title>
      <p><italic toggle="yes">Ringer</italic> measurements are limited to side-chain dihedrals; they do not provide any information on glycine and alanine residues or backbone conformations. To overcome the limitation of only modeling side-chain heterogeneity, we have given users the option to build in backbone atoms when adding alternative conformations as opposed to adding conformers beginning from the C<sup>α</sup> atom. Aside from improving geometries, this can reveal backbone conformational heterogeneity when combined with conventional crystallographic refinement of the <italic toggle="yes">FLEXR</italic> multi-conformer model. This feature is most powerful in cases where adjacent residues have alternative side-chain conformations. One example of this is a ligand-binding site loop formed by Pro181–Ile185 in the B chain of the 1.28 Å resolution structure of HIV-1 protease mutant bound to the inhibitor GRL-98065 (PDB entry <ext-link xlink:href="https://scripts.iucr.org/cgi-bin/cr.cgi?rm=pdb&amp;pdbId=2qd6" ext-link-type="uri">2qd6</ext-link>; Fig. 7<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig"> ▸</xref>). The deposited model contains a single backbone conformation, although most side chains contain multiple conformers. <italic toggle="yes">qFit</italic> did not converge to a multi-conformer model for this data set. The <italic toggle="yes">FLEXR</italic> model recapitulates most of the conformers contained in the original model and adds some additional weakly populated ones. By building in backbone atoms, <italic toggle="yes">FLEXR</italic> enables conventional refinement of backbone atoms to reveal conformational heterogeneity.</p>

    <title>Discussion</title>
    <p>Emerging crystallographic methods attempt to link conformational ensembles to function, especially as conformations repopulate in response to changing environments. These structural transitions are often subtle and require sensitive and accurate computational modeling tools. <italic toggle="yes">Ringer</italic> is a popular approach that successfully identifies conformational changes in a variety of contexts. Yet, the insights are not readily incorporable into protein models. This is problematic for two reasons. Firstly, it means that flexibility is underrepresented in deposited models and, since PDB users are often unaware of the specifics of the original study, such structural nuances are lost. Secondly, any flexibility incorporated into the deposited models can be biased by the original scientific question (Wankowicz <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2022<xref rid="bb52" ref-type="bibr"> ▸</xref>). To enable modeling of hidden, low-occupancy conformations in electron-density maps measured by <italic toggle="yes">Ringer</italic>, which is not currently possible, we combined tools that detect conformations in <italic toggle="yes">Ringer</italic> plots and <italic toggle="yes">Coot</italic> model-building functions into an automated multi-conformer model-building tool, <italic toggle="yes">FLEXR</italic>. Using a high-quality test set of 15 models, we validated the placement of <italic toggle="yes">FLEXR</italic> rotamers and compared the results of <italic toggle="yes">FLEXR</italic> with the original, deposited models and <italic toggle="yes">qFit</italic> models. The method is quick, and the longest step remains conventional crystallographic refinement. Three main strengths of <italic toggle="yes">FLEXR</italic> emerge from this work. Firstly, despite its simplicity, <italic toggle="yes">FLEXR</italic> generally performed similarly or better than other methods based on model validation and quality metrics, while avoiding overfitting. Secondly, the side-chain conformations in the models produced by <italic toggle="yes">FLEXR</italic> were more heterogeneous than other models. Thirdly, <italic toggle="yes">FLEXR</italic> captured conformations in ligand-binding sites that remained undetected using other methods.</p>
    <p>Modeling conformational ensembles requires extensive parameterization and is generally prohibitive even at high resolutions (Levin <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2007<xref rid="bb31" ref-type="bibr"> ▸</xref>; Burnley <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2012<xref rid="bb7" ref-type="bibr"> ▸</xref>). As such, while modeling additional states can better explain the electron density, <italic toggle="yes">R</italic>
<sub>free</sub> metrics usually do not improve significantly (Keedy <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2015<xref rid="bb27" ref-type="bibr"> ▸</xref>). Yet, nine out of 15 <italic toggle="yes">FLEXR</italic> models exhibited a lower <italic toggle="yes">R</italic>
<sub>free</sub> than their <italic toggle="yes">qFit</italic> counterpart. What could be perceived as a limitation of <italic toggle="yes">Ringer</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">i.e.</italic> its restriction to sampling side-chain dihedrals, is perhaps one of the strengths of the approach. <italic toggle="yes">FLEXR</italic> focuses only on local flexibility without making unnecessary alterations to other areas of the structure and, in the process, avoids overfitting. This is supported by the drastically smaller <italic toggle="yes">R</italic>
<sub>gap</sub> and the higher percentage of nonredundant rotamers in <italic toggle="yes">FLEXR</italic> models compared with <italic toggle="yes">qFit</italic> models. Due to the rigidifying effect of crystal packing (Halle, 2002<xref rid="bb23" ref-type="bibr"> ▸</xref>) or ligand binding (Wankowicz <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2022<xref rid="bb52" ref-type="bibr"> ▸</xref>), this restriction to local flexibility might be inconsequential for many proteins or at least might be a reasonable starting point for interrogating flexibility. For example, in large surveys of holo–apo pairs in the PDB by Wankowicz and coworkers and Clark and coworkers (Wankowicz <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2022<xref rid="bb52" ref-type="bibr"> ▸</xref>; Clark <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2019<xref rid="bb10" ref-type="bibr"> ▸</xref>), both found that most conformational heterogeneity was present at the side-chain level. In the case that larger, correlated motions are discovered, other available tools will be more suitable. Nonetheless, we integrated some modeling functions from <italic toggle="yes">Coot</italic> to reveal backbone conformational features and overcome the limitations set by simply starting from individual dihedrals. This can be useful for consecutive residues where including subtle backbone flexibility may improve the geometry without generally overparameterizing the model. Our results show that users can have the most confidence in finding rotamers with occupancies of ≥0.25 at resolutions better than 2 Å. Beyond 2 Å resolution, the retrieval of rotamers with occupancies between 0.1 and 0.25 becomes more difficult but may be informative for high-quality or high-flexibility data sets (manuscript in preparation).</p>
    <p>One caveat of our approach was found in monitoring clashscores, which is an important metric that is often omitted in validating multi-state models. Models with missing or improperly labeled alternate conformer IDs can inflate clashscores and complicate validation (Richardson <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2018<xref rid="bb44" ref-type="bibr"> ▸</xref>). Although on average <italic toggle="yes">FLEXR</italic> produced models with acceptable clashscores, there were three models with excessively high scores. Manual inspection revealed that these cases were largely driven by <italic toggle="yes">FLEXR</italic> building alternative conformations of bulky side chains in the protein core (<ext-link xlink:href="#suppinfoanchor" ext-link-type="uri">Supplementary Fig. S9</ext-link>). Confusingly, while these conformations were justified by <italic toggle="yes">Ringer</italic> plots and represented allowable rotamers, this demonstrated that seemingly genuine <italic toggle="yes">Ringer</italic> peaks can still reflect noise. From a user standpoint this might not be discernable from a true positive peak without placing the alternative conformation in the context of the rest of the protein via building and refinement. A second contribution to high clashscores arises from how <italic toggle="yes">FLEXR</italic> relies on combining peaks in the electron density across dihedrals to construct rotamers, which is inherently ambiguous. This ambiguity can lead to some overbuilding, especially with large, flexible residues such as arginine and lysine, and can create crowded regions with many clashes. Specifically, the <italic toggle="yes">FLEXR</italic> models with the worst clashscores tended to have the most residues with &gt;5 conformers. Hence, we advise the user to inspect these instances and pick relevant conformers carefully. While the automatic removal of seriously clashing side chains is possible, from the perspective of a <italic toggle="yes">Ringer</italic> user we believe that all of these potential rotamers should be built and inspected. This is especially true since we also noticed examples in which weak alternative conformations incorrectly displace water molecules that can be key to understand ligand binding (Darby <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2019<xref rid="bb12" ref-type="bibr"> ▸</xref>; <ext-link xlink:href="#suppinfoanchor" ext-link-type="uri">Supplementary Fig. S18</ext-link>). This is a common liability in current refinement programs (Richardson <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2018<xref rid="bb44" ref-type="bibr"> ▸</xref>) and remains so in <italic toggle="yes">FLEXR</italic>. A third contribution to high clashscores can be found in inconsistent alternative conformation labels (also known as ‘altloc ID’). By default, <italic toggle="yes">FLEXR</italic> builds in conformers with the largest electron-density peaks first, so conformers with lower alphabetic IDs generally correspond to the most common conformers. Yet, this approach is ignorant of the space in which the side chain is built so it does not necessarily agree with the conformations of nearby side chains. Although some progress has been made in creating an agreeable network of altloc labels, such as the simulated-annealing approach in <italic toggle="yes">qFit</italic>, it remains an unsolved problem in automated model building.</p>
    <p>Investigating model content also revealed distinct modeling patterns between methods. For example, comparing the number of alternative conformations in the deposited and multi-conformer models showed that the deposited models vastly underrepresent side-chain flexibility. Even when alternative conformations are present in the deposited models, they rarely contain more than A and B conformations. While <italic toggle="yes">FLEXR</italic> detected a similar number of flexible residues as the deposited models, it modeled these residues with greater heterogeneity than manually built models since it detects even weakly occupied states. We also observed that <italic toggle="yes">qFit</italic> built nearly identical alternative side-chain conformers about 40% of the time. The large discrepancy in the side-chain content between <italic toggle="yes">qFit</italic> models built with and without backbone sampling suggests that side-chain modeling is biased by other factors, such as, perhaps, satisfying backbone geometry or density. <italic toggle="yes">FLEXR</italic> also produced models with substantially fewer alternative side-chain conformations, &lt;10% on average, than previous <italic toggle="yes">Ringer</italic>-based estimates [∼35% (Fraser <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2011<xref rid="bb19" ref-type="bibr"> ▸</xref>) and ∼18% (Lang <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2010<xref rid="bb29" ref-type="bibr"> ▸</xref>)]. This might be particular to the small test set used here, which also includes lower resolution models than the previous test sets used by Lang and coworkers with resolutions of &lt;1.5 Å. Nonetheless, it is notable that both <italic toggle="yes">qFit</italic> approaches had the opposite behavior and modeled two or three times more than prior estimates. Lastly, about 8% of the alternative conformations built with <italic toggle="yes">FLEXR</italic> had occupancies of zero. Although we observed that generally there is a strong relationship between occupancy and electron-density peak size for serines (Fig. 2<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig"> ▸</xref>
<italic toggle="yes">c</italic>), this relationship varied greatly when the density peaks are small. We therefore advise against directly inferring occupancy from individual weak <italic toggle="yes">Ringer</italic> peaks, but also discourage disregarding conformers with <italic toggle="yes">prima facie</italic> low occupancy. We only investigated serines for this purpose, since distal atoms in more flexible or branched side chains will confound the relationship between occupancy and electron-density peak height. 50–75% of all low-occupancy conformers (occupancy &lt; 0.25) had acceptable RSCC and <italic toggle="yes">B</italic>
<sub>norm</sub> values (Fig. 2<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig"> ▸</xref>). Occupancy refinement is an ongoing area of research and several more rigorous methods are available to potentially tease out these subtleties (Pearce, Krojer, Bradley <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2017<xref rid="bb39" ref-type="bibr"> ▸</xref>; Pearce, Krojer &amp; von Delft, 2017<xref rid="bb40" ref-type="bibr"> ▸</xref>; De Zitter <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2022<xref rid="bb13" ref-type="bibr"> ▸</xref>), which might be key components in biological processes such as ligand binding. Until occupancy refinement improves, the user has the final word in interpreting the conformations in the context of the rest of the structure. The same logic applies to not limiting the number of conformers even though the &gt;5 rotamers per side chain that <italic toggle="yes">FLEXR</italic> sometimes identifies are rarely needed. In the spirit of reducing legwork, deleting unwanted conformers from the model before deposition is easier than including desired conformers manually. When it comes to automated model building, there is no one-fits-all solution. Creating deposition-quality models will require a combination of optimizing <italic toggle="yes">FLEXR</italic> parameters and manually inspecting individual cases: the responsibility is still with the crystallographer (Pozharski <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2013<xref rid="bb43" ref-type="bibr"> ▸</xref>).</p>
    <p>Lastly, we also noticed examples in which <italic toggle="yes">FLEXR</italic> detected weak conformations of side chains at the protein–ligand interface that were undetected by other methods. Firstly, it is worrisome that deposited models are missing these features, since binding sites often receive the most attention by crystallographers. Secondly, when using these structures as templates for molecular docking such changes in the protein conformation will produce different small molecules as starting points for drug design (Fischer <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2014<xref rid="bb18" ref-type="bibr"> ▸</xref>). While both approaches are automated, other models did miss these conformations despite clear electron density. In addition to the previously discussed possibilities, another reason for the behavior of <italic toggle="yes">qFit</italic> might be found in the iterative culling process that it uses to remove low-occupancy states (where occupancy &lt; 0.09) between many rounds of refinement. While this has the potential to reduce over-modeling, it might also be liable to removing the same weak conformers that structural biologists are searching for. For instance, the missing alternative Tyr215 conformer in prostaglandin reductase 3 (Figs. 6<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig"> ▸</xref>
<italic toggle="yes">a</italic>–6<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig"> ▸</xref>
<italic toggle="yes">c</italic>) could indicate either that the residue contributes less binding energy than anticipated or that the ligand may not be present at full occupancy, with the alternative Tyr215 conformer reflecting the apo state (Pearce, Krojer &amp; von Delft, 2017<xref rid="bb40" ref-type="bibr"> ▸</xref>). In the process of our analysis, we did not test the effects of varying <italic toggle="yes">qFit</italic> parameters or inspect intermediate <italic toggle="yes">qFit</italic> models that may unearth such features. Like most users would, we used <italic toggle="yes">qFit</italic> with default settings to benchmark the sensitivity and performance of our approach. Likewise, we used <italic toggle="yes">Ringer</italic> parameters that are suggested to maximize sensitivity and to minimize false positives (Lang <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2010<xref rid="bb29" ref-type="bibr"> ▸</xref>). Changing these parameters, especially the electron-density threshold for peak detection and geometric tolerances, will certainly vary the results. While the defaults worked well for most models in the test set, those with high clashscores are examples where these parameters should be optimized through a simple grid search. To facilitate parameter optimization, a script on the <italic toggle="yes">FLEXR</italic> GitHub repository will enable users to perform a grid search.</p>
    <p>The overall goal of this project was to produce a tool that automatically incorporates weakly populated, high-energy alternative side-chain conformations from <italic toggle="yes">Ringer</italic> measurements into models. This enables a more thorough examination of local flexibility in the context of the rest of the protein, especially for downstream users of deposited models such as ligand discoverers. <italic toggle="yes">FLEXR</italic> liberates the user from the tedious legwork of detecting conformations and model building. However, the final validation should always be performed by a meticulous crystallographer. <italic toggle="yes">FLEXR</italic> is a fast program that runs well on a personal laptop. It is open-source, freely available and installation is simple (see <ext-link xlink:href="#suppinfoanchor" ext-link-type="uri">supporting information</ext-link>). In the context of other model-building tools, <italic toggle="yes">FLEXR</italic> stands as an unassuming tool to explore flexibility in protein structures. Applied to high-resolution structures in the PDB, <italic toggle="yes">FLEXR</italic> can help reveal new information from old data (Touw <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2016<xref rid="bb51" ref-type="bibr"> ▸</xref>; Wankowicz <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2022<xref rid="bb52" ref-type="bibr"> ▸</xref>).</p>
