      <p id="Par1">Elucidating the spectrum of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET) states in clinical samples promises insights on cancer progression and drug resistance. Using mass cytometry time-course analysis, we resolve lung cancer EMT states through TGFβ-treatment and identify, through TGFβ-withdrawal, a distinct MET state. We demonstrate significant differences between EMT and MET trajectories using a computational tool (TRACER) for reconstructing trajectories between cell states. In addition, we construct a lung cancer reference map of EMT and MET states referred to as the EMT-MET PHENOtypic STAte MaP (PHENOSTAMP). Using a neural net algorithm, we project clinical samples onto the EMT-MET PHENOSTAMP to characterize their phenotypic profile with single-cell resolution in terms of our in vitro EMT-MET analysis. In summary, we provide a framework to phenotypically characterize clinical samples in the context of in vitro EMT-MET findings which could help assess clinical relevance of EMT in cancer in future studies.</p>

    <title>Introduction</title>
    <p id="Par3">Malignant cells often hijack biological processes that are utilized by their normal cell counterparts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. One example is the epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT), a developmental program critical to embryogenesis and wound healing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. During EMT, epithelial cells undergo dramatic biochemical and morphological changes and acquire migratory and stem-like traits<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. EMT is a dynamic process and under specific conditions is reversible (mesenchymal–epithelial transition, MET), highlighting a phenotypic plasticity that has been observed in both normal and malignant cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>.</p>
    <p id="Par4">The clinical significance of EMT in cancer is well documented, although controversial<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Mesenchymal signatures are indicators of poor prognosis in various adenocarcinomas, including lung<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. In addition, several studies have demonstrated the role of EMT in drug response and resistance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>, offering evidence that EMT signatures can be of therapeutic value. However, because most of these cancer-related EMT studies are based on bulk gene expression data from clinical specimens, it is often unclear whether clinical EMT signatures originate from mesenchymal malignant cells as opposed to tumor stromal cells (e.g., fibroblasts), which express EMT canonical markers. Furthermore, malignant cells with a purely mesenchymal phenotype are considered rare, with a small chance of clinical observation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>; thus, the existence of such malignant cells is debated.</p>
    <p id="Par5">Adding to the complexity in understanding the clinical significance of EMT is the recognition that EMT is not a binary process (strictly defined by epithelial and mesenchymal states), but instead a spectrum of states where transitioning cells exhibit partial EMT phenotypes with both epithelial and mesenchymal features. Partial EMT phenotypes have been observed in clinical cancer specimens and negatively correlate with survival<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>, but are poorly understood. Recent studies have attempted to better define EMT states using single-cell approaches; however, they were primarily focused on preclinical models or clinical samples without bridging the two. Pastushenko et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup> demonstrated the existence of partial EMT states in mammary and skin cancer by examining a large number of surface markers with flow cytometry and single-cell RNA-sequencing (sc-RNAseq). Gonzalez et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup> identified partial EMT states in ovarian cancer specimens with mass cytometry. While these studies provide important insights, they did not directly relate their findings to EMT states that have been well characterized in preclinical in vitro reference models. On the other hand, mass cytometry was used to study drug perturbations on tumor growth factor-β (TGFβ)-induced EMT in mouse epithelial cancer cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>, and sc-RNAseq was used to study TGFβ-induced EMT in human breast epithelial cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>; however, neither of these studies provided a means to assess the clinical relevance of their respective findings.</p>
    <p id="Par6">In this study, we use high-dimensional single-cell analysis to identify and characterize EMT states observed in lung cancer clinical specimens in terms of the spectrum of states observed in well-established lung cancer cell lines. Specifically, through mass cytometry time-course analysis of TGFβ-modulated EMT and MET in lung cancer cells, we computationally define eight EMT and MET states with which we create an EMT–MET PHENOtypic STAte MaP (PHENOSTAMP). In addition, we develop and apply the TRAjectory of CElls Reconstruction (TRACER) algorithm, which compares state transitions in EMT and MET. Finally, we develop and apply a machine learning algorithm to project malignant cells from clinical samples onto the EMT–MET PHENOSTAMP in order to assess clinically relevant EMT and MET states in terms of our in vitro time-course analysis. Use of the EMT–MET PHENOSTAMP, informed by our trajectory analysis, provides a means to distinguish whether cells are undergoing EMT or MET and thereby has the potential to identify EMT- or MET-related phenotypic cell properties such as state-specific differential drug sensitivities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>.</p>

      <title>Identifying canonical EMT states in lung cancer cells</title>
      <p id="Par7">To identify EMT states in lung cancer cells, we used TGFβ for EMT induction. First, we examined TGFβ responsiveness in three non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) cell lines (HCC827, A549, H3255) towards bulk expression of widely accepted EMT markers (E-Cadherin, Vimentin, CD44<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). A549 cells displayed partial EMT (pEMT) characteristics before TGFβ treatment (basal co-expression of epithelial (E-Cadherin) and mesenchymal (Vimentin, CD44) markers). With treatment, A549 cells exhibited loss of E-Cadherin and acquired mesenchymal-like morphology (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>, Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). H3255 cells exhibited strong basal epithelial features and retained their epithelial morphology and protein expression with TGFβ treatment without displaying EMT-related changes (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>, Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). The HCC827 cell line displayed epithelial features at basal conditions and underwent dramatic EMT marker and morphology changes with treatment (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a, b</xref>), and hence was chosen as the exemplary cell line for our EMT studies.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><title>Identifying canonical EMT states in lung cancer cells through TGFβ time-course analysis.</title><p><bold>a</bold> Immunoblot of EMT markers in the presence or absence of TGFβ in three NSCLC cell lines (2 week treatment in HCC827 and H3255 cells, 1 week treatment in A549 cells). <bold>b</bold> Representative confocal images of HCC827 cells stained for E-Cadherin (red) and Vimentin (green) in the absence (a, b) or presence of TGFβ (c, d) for 10 days.

      <p id="Par8">Morphological heterogeneity was observed in HCC827 cells during EMT, as evidenced by confocal imaging (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). Intriguingly, cells that were not incorporated in epithelial islands expressed Vimentin even in the absence of exogenous TGFβ, demonstrating that cell density likely affects EMT status (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref> (b)). This finding was corroborated when we examined EMT in HCC827 cells with flow cytometry under varying seeding conditions that controlled confluency (Supplementary Figs. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref> and <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>) and is consistent with previous reports for normal epithelial cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. Transition was also reflected by CD44 and CD24 gradual changes (stemness markers often used in breast cancer EMT studies), patterning four readily observed gating populations (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). These subpopulations—referred to as “states”—were characterized by progressive increase of CD44 and decrease of CD24 in only a small subset of cells (CD44<sup>hi</sup>/CD24<sup>lo</sup>), which represents a phenotypic state regarded as cancer stem cell-like (CSC-like)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>.</p>
      <p id="Par9">To adequately capture EMT states, we optimized a TGFβ time-course during which we kept confluency consistent by re-seeding cells at each experimental time-point. Cells efficiently underwent EMT within 10 days of TGFβ treatment towards morphology (Fig.<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>, top images) and changes in E-Cadherin, Vimentin, CD44 and CD24 expression (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>, biaxial plots). Since these markers are commonly used for EMT characterization, we refer to these four states, as canonical EMT states. As CD44/CD24 biaxial plots gave four well-separated populations for manual gating (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>), we used these to assess E-Cadherin/Vimentin expression (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>, bottom plots) and designated the four canonical states into (i) an epithelial (E) (E-Cadherin<sup>+</sup>/Vimentin<sup>−</sup>), (ii) a pEMT (E-Cadherin<sup>+</sup>/Vimentin<sup>+</sup>), (iii) a mixed pEMT/M (E-Cadherin<sup>+</sup>/Vimentin<sup>+</sup>, E-Cadherin<sup>−</sup>/Vimentin<sup>+</sup>), and (iv) a small mesenchymal CSC-like state (E-Cadherin<sup>−</sup>/Vimentin<sup>+</sup>/CD44<sup>hi</sup>/CD24<sup>lo</sup>), denoted here as M* (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref>, Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). Each state’s occupancy with time is depicted in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1e</xref>. Mean fold expression of the four markers recapitulated the observed changes towards both control conditions with time and towards the E state when examined in each state separately (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1f</xref>). Unexpectedly, E-Cadherin transiently increased in the pEMT state. We speculate this may be due to increased surface interactions between cells of enlarged size observed during initial EMT stages (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). We also observed time-dependent changes in the EMT transcription factor Twist<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup> (Fig.<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1f</xref>). Specifically, Twist expression was highest in the pEMT state and lowest in the M* state (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1f</xref>, right).</p>

      <title>Phenotyping canonical EMT states with mass cytometry</title>
      <p id="Par10">Manual gating based on the expression of just four markers was helpful for our initial assessment of canonical EMT states, albeit this approach does not fully characterize the heterogeneity of these states. For a more thorough characterization of the canonical EMT states, we performed a mass cytometry time-course experiment on HCC827 cells where TGFβ was added for 10 days and subsequently withdrawn to observe EMT and MET, respectively (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>). For optimal confluency conditions, at each time-point, cells were collected for both mass cytometry analysis and re-seeding for subsequent time-points. In total, 28 markers were chosen to characterize EMT states as well as proliferative, signaling, and apoptotic cell status (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>, Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). The four canonical EMT states were reproduced on mass cytometry (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>, Supplementary Figs. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref> and <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>) as were the fold expression trends of all previously discussed markers (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>, Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>). Upon TGFβ withdrawal, a proportion of cells that had undergone EMT returned to an epithelial state, an observation supported by canonical EMT marker expression and morphological assessment (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b, c</xref>).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><title>Mass cytometry time-series analysis offers deep single-cell resolution of canonical EMT states.</title><p><bold>a</bold> Workflow schematic of cell culture conditions for TGFβ time-course (addition and withdrawal (W) time-points) and mass cytometry analysis.

      <p id="Par11">Mass cytometry enabled us to examine dynamic changes of additional markers (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref>, Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>). Keratins and other epithelial cell surface markers (e.g., MUC1, TROP2) showed expected decreases during EMT and subsequent return to basal levels following MET. Most signaling and proliferative markers rapidly increased in expression on day 2 under TGFβ treatment, and subsequently decreased by day 10 in TGFβ. Decreased expression of these markers was sustained during the first 2 days of withdrawal, time-points for which M and M* cells were at highest numbers. Specifically, this pattern was observed for pSMAD2/3, a key TGFβ signaling molecule<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>, as well as for pEGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor) and pS6, suggesting that signaling is downregulated in the M state. Notably, pEGFR and pS6 were lowest in the CSC-like M* cells (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>), corroborating studies that have associated EMT with tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) resistance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup> and low p-mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) activity with stem cell maintenance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. We also observed an increase of PD-L1 during EMT, substantiating reports that link EMT with tumor immune evasion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. Among the measured EMT transcription factors, apart from the transient activation of Twist, we did not detect significant Snail or Slug expression. However, Oct3/4 and Nanog showed a substantial increase throughout the EMT time-course, consistent with a lung adenocarcinoma study where co-expression of Oct3/4 and Nanog were found to be critical for EMT<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>.</p>

      <title>Defining computationally derived EMT and MET states</title>
      <p id="Par12">Our above-described assessment of EMT states showed that at least at the protein level cells seem to transition through a spectrum of overlapping phenotypes. Given the high dimensionality of our data, we applied unsupervised cluster analysis to computationally derive well-defined EMT and MET states. From hereon, the previously described canonical EMT states hold no particular significance, but will be related to computationally derived EMT states. We first applied CCAST, a clustering algorithm that applies non-parametric tests to partition the data in the form of a decision tree on the pooled mass cytometry data across all time-points<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. Clustering markers E-Cadherin, Vimentin, CD44, CD24, MUC1, and Twist were selected based on principal component analysis (PCA) of the data (PCA and principal component loadings shown in Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref>, respectively). CCAST identified eight most prominent states, each state having ≥1% of total number of cells analyzed. The CCAST decision tree and downstream analyses, as well as the relation between the computationally derived with the four canonical EMT states are shown in Supplementary Figs. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5</xref> and <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6</xref>.</p>
      <p id="Par13">Heatmaps of the six clustering markers within each of the eight states revealed minimal within-state marker heterogeneity compared to between-state marker heterogeneity (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>). We labeled the derived EMT and MET states based on the expression profile (e.g., E-Cadherin<sup>+</sup>/Vimentin<sup>−</sup> in epithelial states, E-Cadherin<sup>+</sup>/Vimentin<sup>+</sup> in pEMT states, etc.) and respective time-course pattern, which helped distinguish, for example, mesenchymal cells from cells undergoing MET (i.e., cells appearing after TGFβ removal). Specifically, we identified three E states (E1, E2, E3), three pEMT states (pEMT1, pEMT2, pEMT3), one M state, and one MET state (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>). States E1, E2, and E3 displayed low expression of Vimentin and CD44, but varying degrees of E-Cadherin, CD24, and MUC1 expression. All E states were highest in numbers at time 0 and dramatically decreased with TGFβ treatment; only E1 and E2 rebounded following TGFβ withdrawal. States pEMT1, pEMT2, and pEMT3 co-expressed E-Cadherin and Vimentin, consistent with a pEMT phenotype. pEMT2 and pEMT3 specifically included a subgroup of Twist<sup>+</sup> cells (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>, boxed regions). All pEMT states emerged upon TGFβ treatment, decreased with continued TGFβ treatment, and with the exception of pEMT3, transiently re-emerged during withdrawal. State M was characterized by loss of epithelial markers (E-Cadherin, MUC1), and high Vimentin and CD44 expression, and was highest in numbers at day 10 in TGFβ. Interestingly, Twist<sup>+</sup> cells were not detected within this state, confirming a study that found that CSC-like properties arise following transient Twist activation during EMT<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. Although our analysis did not distinguish CSC-like cells as a separate cluster, interrogation of other markers in cells expressing the lowest CD24 levels (e.g., pS6) helped us define the CSC-like cells within the M state (M<italic>*</italic>, Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6</xref>). State MET, perhaps most interesting in our analysis, peaked upon withdrawal specifically, representing cells that had perhaps initiated MET. The MET state differed from the M state in only one of six clustering markers, exhibiting increased MUC1 expression. Of note, MUC1 has been reported to be a MET marker in nephrogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>, corroborating our findings here in lung cancer. MET cells also expressed higher levels of the epithelial markers TROP2 and cytokeratin 8 compared to M cells, confirming that these cells have initiated MET (Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>). Ordering the states according to temporal pattern and phenotype provided a quantitative examination of the expression changes of the six clustering markers (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>). Similar results were observed in an independent biological replicate experiment (Supplementary Fig. 6).<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><title>Unsupervised analysis of mass cytometry data reveals computationally derived EMT and MET states.</title><p><bold>a</bold> Heatmaps depicting the expression of the six clustering markers in each cell (E-Cadherin, Vimentin, CD44, CD24, Twist, and MUC1) per computationally derived EMT and MET state (normalized global expression).

Thus, we were able to visually decipher the EMT from the MET trajectory, and identify states that appeared to be transient (e.g., pEMT3), or revisited during (e.g., pEMT1, pEMT2), or at MET completion (e.g., E1, E2). Strikingly, MET state appeared to be specific to the withdrawal time-points, supporting studies proposing that the MET trajectory differs from the EMT one<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>.

      <title>Constructing an EMT–MET PHENOtypic STAte MaP</title>
      <p id="Par16">Apart from visualizing the phenotypic, time-dependent properties of EMT and MET states, our goal was to construct an EMT–MET PHENOtypic STAte MaP (PHENOSTAMP) for inferring the presence of the eight EMT and MET states in NSCLC clinical specimens with single-cell resolution. First, we generated a two-dimensional (2D) t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) projection of the eight states. Given that the EMT and MET states showed considerable phenotypic overlap on the t-SNE space, we employed Voronoi and Convex Hull analysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup> to achieve density-driven segmentation of the t-SNE landscape; each segment corresponding to an identified EMT/MET phenotypic state at its peak during our time-course analysis (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a, b</xref> and Supplementary Figs. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5</xref> and <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">7</xref>). Analysis of cell density over time on the EMT–MET PHENOSTAMP confirmed our previous assessment that the MET trajectory differs from the EMT one and is specifically characterized by the appearance of the MET state at the 2-day withdrawal time-point (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c</xref>). However, it also revealed the possibility that cells that belong to pEMT states exhibit plasticity that enables them to follow the same state trajectory back to E states under withdrawal. This observation is heuristically demonstrated in a density-driven preliminary assessment of transitions within the 2D map, depicted in a conceptual schematic model (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4d</xref>). When we applied the computational tool Slingshot<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup> to these data, it independently resolved the trajectory that involves the appearance of the MET state during withdrawal (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">7</xref>). However, it did not fully capture our empirical observations of likely state transitions, given that as most pseudotime algorithms, it forces cells onto a deterministic trajectory derived from prior knowledge.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><title>Construction of the EMT–MET PHENOSTAMP and TRACER analysis identify distinct EMT and MET trajectories.</title><p><bold>a</bold> Schematic of 2D t-SNE EMT–MET PHENOSTAMP.

      <title>TRACER analysis identifies distinct EMT and MET trajectories</title>
      <p id="Par17">Given that EMT is likely characterized by plasticity among states and not a single trajectory, we developed a trajectory algorithm, TRACER (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5</xref> and Methods), that does not rely on pseudotime assumptions. We assumed that EMT and MET are classical Markov processes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup> with transition probabilities that are constant between the states within EMT and MET, but can differ when comparing the two. We applied our model separately for the EMT and MET time-points and, through bootstrap analysis, we generated a distribution of transition probabilities between states under EMT and MET, as shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4e</xref>. The resulting medoid networks for EMT and MET are provided in Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4f</xref>. The bootstrap analysis shows less non-zero state transition probabilities under MET compared to EMT, demonstrating that the transition between M and MET states is unique to MET. Our analysis also shows that cells in the identified states may transverse a set of possible EMT trajectories representing perhaps differing state kinetics (differentially weighted EMT transition probabilities, Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4f</xref>). These results demonstrate statistically significant differences between EMT and MET trajectories as well as bi-directionality (plasticity) between certain states (e.g., the transition probability from pEMT1 to pEMT2 during EMT is 0.33, whereas during MET the transition from pEMT2 to pEMT1 is 0.27).</p>

      <title>Projection of NSCLC cell lines onto the EMT–MET PHENOSTAMP</title>
      <p id="Par18">Given the wide range of phenotypic, and presumably functional, EMT–MET states across NSCLC cell lines, we tested whether our EMT–MET PHENOSTAMP could serve as a reference to reconcile known heterogeneity between cell lines and experiments. To project independent samples onto PHENOSTAMP, we trained a neural net algorithm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup> that predicts the bivariate t-SNE outputs of our EMT–MET PHENOSTAMP in terms of the selected six clustering markers (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5</xref> and Methods). We verified the performance of the projection using lung cancer cell lines with known features. First, we projected independently analyzed TGFβ HCC827 samples, and these matched previously observed mappings (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a</xref>, left). Next, we projected two NSCLC cell lines analyzed with mass cytometry (A549, H3255), given that we had prior knowledge of their EMT status (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). In agreement with our previous findings, A549 cells mapped onto pEMT and M regions in control conditions and extended into the M region upon TGFβ treatment (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a</xref>, middle, Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">8</xref>), and H3255 cells mapped mostly on E, and to a lesser degree on pEMT1 regions, with minimal changes upon TGFβ treatment (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a</xref>, right, Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">8</xref>).

      <title>Phenotyping NSCLC clinical samples with EMT–MET PHENOSTAMP</title>
      <p id="Par19">We proceeded to determine the spectrum of EMT and MET states in NSCLC clinical specimens with single-cell resolution by projecting them onto the EMT–MET PHENOSTAMP. Five fresh NSCLC adenocarcinoma samples were obtained immediately after patient resection under Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval and underwent immediate dissociation for single-cell suspension. For mass cytometry analysis, we used the antibody panel developed for our time-course analysis, augmented with antibodies to sort out immune (CD45<sup>+</sup>), endothelial (CD31<sup>+</sup>), and stromal fibroblast (FAP<sup>+</sup>) populations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Thus, we were able to discriminate immune, endothelial, and stromal cells from cells that were of varying levels of cytokeratins 7 and 8 that were negative for CD45, CD31, and FAP (Supplementary Figs. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref> and <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">9</xref>). The specimens harbored different mutations and differentiation status (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>, Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref>). We validated both the mass cytometry run and projection, by analyzing in parallel independent HCC827 samples as a control (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">9</xref>). Upon projection, all clinical specimens showed the presence of a variety of EMT states that agreed with their respective E-Cadherin/Vimentin expression profiles (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>, Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">9</xref>). Reassuringly, given the single-cell resolution of the mapping function, each clinical sample demonstrated a continuous sweep of EMT states, as opposed to occupying disjoint regions. Case nos. 1, 2, and 3 (all EGFR mutated) mapped primarily onto E regions with some extent into the pEMT1 regions, and expressed, as expected, higher pEGFR levels (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">10</xref>). This mapping is consistent with EGFR-mutated cell lines HCC827 and H3255 in basal conditions and confirmed by morphological assessment (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">9</xref>). Case No. 3, harboring an additional TP53 mutation, broadly extended into the pEMT regions, with a small fraction of cells in the M and MET regions. Case nos. 4 and 5, harboring TP53 and KRAS mutations, respectively, showed the most pEMT features, occupying pEMT2 and pEMT3 regions (and to a lesser degree M), reassuringly similar to A549 cells that are also KRAS mutated (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). Interestingly, case nos. 4 and 5, in comparison to case nos. 1–3, were graded as poorly differentiated and showed higher levels of immune infiltration (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>, Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">9</xref>), suggesting the association of these clinical features with specific EMT states. While a larger sample size is necessary to solidify conclusions, these results are consistent with studies reporting correlations between NSCLC mutations and immune infiltration with EMT status<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>.

    <p id="Par20">Elucidating what is believed to be a spectrum of EMT–MET states with single-cell resolution promises insights on their role in cancer. We provide an integrated experimental–computational framework to define discrete lung cancer EMT and MET states and assess their clinical relevance. First, we identified EMT and MET states leveraging high-dimensional mass cytometry time-course analyses of lung cancer cell lines undergoing EMT and MET through TGFβ treatment and withdrawal. We then constructed EMT–MET PHENOSTAMP, and using a neural net algorithm, we projected clinical samples onto the map to evaluate their EMT and MET state profile with single-cell resolution. This integrated approach provides in vitro insights on EMT–MET biology and establishes a framework to translate in vitro observations to clinical samples.</p>
    <p id="Par21">The EMT process has been described as a spectrum of intermediate phenotypic states<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>, and this is something we observe when we interrogate transitioning cells towards their protein expression changes. Cells appear to occupy a continuum of phenotypic space (biaxial plots in Figs. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> and <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>), making it difficult to discern discrete EMT populations. This is also evident by our clinical specimen projections (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>) as these occupy connected regions on our EMT–MET PHENOSTAMP. Other investigators have defined a discrete number of EMT states in various systems, albeit using either bulk gene expression data or surface-only protein markers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. In this study, we used CCAST analysis of mass cytometry time-course data to define eight distinct EMT–MET states at the single-cell proteomic level; thus, providing a well-defined EMT–MET state map that discretizes the EMT spectrum in order to gain an in-depth view of phenotypic transitions.</p>
    <p id="Par22">With our single-cell EMT–MET time-course analysis, we demonstrated not only the heterogeneity of EMT cell states but also transient properties that provide a deeper appreciation of the dynamism of EMT. For example, we showed that in NSCLC, epithelial states can be quite heterogeneous towards E-Cadherin, CD24, and, interestingly, MUC1 expression. Heterogeneity was also observed within the pEMT states for various markers, most notably Twist. Expression of EMT-specific transcription factors during EMT was recently reported to be dispensable for some cells, featuring an alternative EMT program that involved protein internalization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>. We observed phenotypically distinct, transient Twist<sup>+</sup> cells that retained some epithelial identity and proliferative capacity, consistent with prior work<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. Although transient Twist activity has been reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>, these prior observations were made in cells where Twist was exogenously overexpressed; instead, we examined changes in <italic>endogenous</italic> Twist during EMT induction. Twist has been shown to be overexpressed in human lung adenocarcinoma and specifically correlated to EGFR mutations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>, as observed in two of three EGFR-mutated clinical samples we analyzed (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">9</xref>). Although we did not detect other EMT-specific transcription factors (i.e., Slug, Snail, Zeb1, Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>), we cannot exclude the possibility that these may be activated in earlier EMT time-points not tested here.</p>
    <p id="Par23">Our time-course analysis of MET is a key aspect of our study. MET is thought to be critical for the establishment of secondary distant tumors. Yet, compared to EMT, MET is less studied, particularly with single-cell resolution. Some studies have shown that EMT is reversible among cells in pEMT states, but not necessarily among cells that have become mesenchymal, although this seems to be cell type dependent<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>. Even so, for cells undergoing MET, it is unclear whether the MET trajectory mirrors or differs from the EMT trajectory. Differing trajectories that we found is evidence of hysteresis, a phenomenon in which a future state depends on its history. Several mathematical modeling studies have provided evidence of hysteresis when comparing EMT and MET; however, these were based on gene expression or were not associated with specific phenotypic states<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. By analyzing time-course data using TRACER, we found statistically significant evidence of hysteresis. In particular, we showed that some mesenchymal cells undergo MET utilizing a trajectory not observed under EMT and transit through a distinct identified state that we defined as MET. More specifically, our study supports two possible scenarios. In the first scenario, cells in the M state have undergone such significant (presumably epigenetic) changes that in order for some of them to undergo MET, they utilize a different trajectory. Of note, a significant proportion of cells failed to undergo MET after 10 days TGFβ withdrawal. It is possible that if we had prolonged withdrawal, more cells could have returned to E states, presumably through a combination of epigenetic/transcriptional mechanisms that regulate phenotypic switches<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>. Moreover, we found that if cells have not efficiently undergone EMT (majority of cells transition to pEMT rather than M states), most of them are able to undergo MET within 10 days of TGFβ withdrawal (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">7c</xref>). This observation is linked to the second scenario, in which, if during conditions that promote MET a cell is in a pEMT state, it utilizes a mirrored trajectory back to an epithelial state. Supporting this, TRACER detected bi-directionality between pEMT states (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4e, f</xref>). Notably, TRACER enables the interrogation of the bi-directional and plastic nature of EMT and MET processes, as opposed to pseudotime trajectory algorithms (e.g., Wanderlust, Monocle, Slingshot<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>) that are deterministic in nature, forcing the ordering of transitioning cells on a predefined developmental path. Specifically, TRACER utilizes the proportion of cells in each state per time-point to generate a distribution of transition probabilities, and presents more than one possible EMT trajectories (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4f</xref>). Nevertheless, TRACER’s current limitation is that it does not account for the expression of intracellular markers that would offer insights on each state’s cell cycle and death kinetics, features that could better inform state transitions. Our data show that M cells express significantly lower levels of the mitotic marker pH3<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup> compared to MET cells by ~34% (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">7</xref> and Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>), suggesting that our hysteresis findings (M to MET transition) are not due to an expanding population of cells. Future studies involving live cell tracing and incorporation of marker expression in our analysis will be critical towards deciphering EMT–MET dynamics.</p>
    <p id="Par24">We introduce a neural net algorithm for projecting samples on the EMT–MET PHENOSTAMP with single-cell resolution. This map can be used as a potential tool to assess NSCLC clinical specimens in terms of their EMT status, as defined along a well-established and reproducible in vitro time-course analysis. Our mapping of five clinical samples serves as proof of concept that PHENOSTAMP can offer insights on the clinical relevance of of EMT and MET states. For example, we observed a potential association of EMT with immune infiltration. Such a correlation has been previously reported but not linked to mutation status<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup>, supporting the necessity of a larger scaled study and the importance of a well-defined EMT reference map. Furthermore, PHENOSTAMP can help detect EMT-related drug-resistant or -sensitive cell phenotypes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup> per patient tumor sample. For instance, studies suggest that inducing MET could be beneficial by restoring sensitivity to TKI inhibitors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup>. Indeed, our data showed that pEGFR signaling increased by ~20% in cells undergoing MET compared to cells in the M state, and this would hypothetically constitute TKI sensitivity (Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>). Our data also showed that cells in the MET state significantly differ from M cells in MUC1 expression, a molecule that is being studied as a lung cancer therapeutic target<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref></sup>. Therefore, depending on the situation and timing, one may choose to target or induce the MET state. Having an EMT–MET map that can theoretically distinguish whether a specimen has cells undergoing EMT or MET with targetable markers could benefit such future efforts.</p>
    <p id="Par25">Our study proposes an approach for interrogating and mapping EMT states, but has its limitations. Although here we chose TGFβ to induce EMT in lung cancer cells, it is well known that EMT can be triggered by a variety of conditions, including hypoxia and drug treatments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref></sup>. It would be therefore reasonable to compare different modes of EMT induction and examine how these would affect the EMT–MET map, or the projections onto it. In addition, incorporating different mutational backgrounds in our analysis would also be a worthy pursuit. It is important to note that projecting individual specimens on a reference map differs from traditional approaches where multiple samples are pooled for analysis, allowing each specimen to be examined within its own heterogeneous identity. Also, by using single-cell proteomic data, our approach differs from similar studies that have employed basic concepts from machine learning to classify and diagnose clinical samples based on gene profiling alone<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref></sup>. Functional characterization of each state is also worth pursuing, given that this would inform each state’s metastatic, drug resistance and stem-like properties. For example, although we used common markers (CD44<sup>hi</sup>/CD24<sup>lo</sup>) for defining CSC-like cells, we did not functionally test stemness of these cells. In this regard, it has been shown that CD44<sup>hi</sup>/CD24<sup>hi</sup> pEMT cells can exhibit stem-like behavior<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref></sup>. Given that we show that pEMT cells are plastic in nature (TRACER results), examining the stemness and drug resistance of the identified pEMT states would be warranted. Finally, our work can be extended to multiplexed imaging<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref></sup> to delineate the spatiotemporal relationships between EMT malignant cell phenotypes and composition of the surrounding microenvironment.</p>
    <p id="Par26">In summary, we have defined a landscape of EMT and MET states with single-cell resolution from an in vitro time-course analysis where we modulated EMT states with TGFβ treatment and withdrawal. With this information, we created PHENOSTAMP that could be used in the future to phenotypically assess clinical samples. Furthermore, our experimental and computational approaches provided insights on aspects of EMT basic biology, EMT/MET trajectories, and the heterogeneity of transient cell subpopulations undergoing phenotypic transitions. Combining our work with functional characterization of the states we have presented here and incorporation of single-cell data across more patient samples will enable a more a comprehensive understanding of the relevance of EMT in cancer.</p>

      <title>TRACER algorithm</title>
      <p id="Par42">To more rigorously test the hypothesis of hysteresis when comparing EMT and MET, we developed a trajectory reconstruction analysis TRACER that does not rely on pseudotime assumptions and allows branching. We assumed that EMT and MET are classical Markov processes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup> with constant transition probabilities between the states within EMT and MET but can differ between EMT and MET. Because our observations of the proportion of cells in each state are made at discrete, nonuniform time-points, and because we do not observe the trajectories of individual cells, we cannot employ standard methods to estimate for the state transition probabilities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref></sup>. Also, because the number of states is relatively large compared to the number of observations, we employed sparsity assumptions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref></sup>. We modeled the state transition probabilities <italic>p</italic><sub><italic>jkt</italic></sub> between states <italic>j</italic> and <italic>k</italic> at time <italic>t</italic> by imposing sparsity penalties on <italic>p</italic><sub><italic>jk</italic>t</sub> for <italic>j</italic> not equal to <italic>k</italic>, but no penalty on <italic>p</italic><sub><italic>jjt</italic></sub>, with the idea that there is no cost for staying in a state, but switching between states is discouraged. Under these assumptions, the transition probabilities EMT and MET can be estimated by convex optimization, with the sparsity parameter <italic>λ</italic> selected through cross-validation. We chose by the 1-standard error rule<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref></sup>, that is, we chose the largest λ such that its error is within 1-standard error of the error of the minimizing. This leads to a more parsimonious solution. Using bootstrap analysis, we provide a distribution of the transition probabilities for EMT and MET, as shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4e</xref>. For the bootstrap analysis, we first independently sampled a multinomial distribution for cell counts in each state. We split the bootstrap sample into 2-folds. The first fold was used to estimate the sparsity parameter <italic>λ</italic>. We evaluated the estimator with the chosen λ on the second fold. For representative EMT and MET networks, the medoid networks for EMT and MET was selected among all the bootstrap samples as the network for which the average distance to all other networks (entry-wise L1 distance between transition matrices) was smallest (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4f</xref>).</p>

    <p>PHENOSTAMP and TRACER codes used for the construction of the EMT–MET PHENOSTAMP and projections and the interrogation of EMT–MET trajectories, respectively, have been deposited on GitHub under [<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/anchangben/PHENOSTAMP">https://github.com/anchangben/PHENOSTAMP</ext-link>] and [<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/nignatiadis/TRACER">https://github.com/nignatiadis/TRACER</ext-link>] and are available to the public. PHENOSTAMP relies on R (≥3.5.0) and other R libraries. The implementation provided on the github link runs on Mac OS X 10.7 and above operating systems. The TRACER algorithm has been implemented as a R package (R version 3.6.1), which uses the tidyverse (version 1.2.1), ggplot2 (version 3.2.1), and JuliaCall<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref></sup> (version 0.16.6) packages. The optimization problem is solved in Julia (version 1.2) through the JuMP.jl<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref></sup> (version 0.18.6) and Gurobi.jl (version 0.7.2) packages by interfacing to the Gurobi optimizer (version 8.1.0).</p>
