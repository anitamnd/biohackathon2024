      <p>Cross-linking mass spectrometry has become a powerful
tool for
the identification of protein–protein interactions and for
gaining insight into the structures of proteins. We previously published
MS Annika, a cross-linking search engine which can accurately identify
cross-linked peptides in MS2 spectra from a variety of different MS-cleavable
cross-linkers. In this publication, we present MS Annika 2.0, an updated
version implementing a new search algorithm that, in addition to MS2
level, only supports the processing of data from MS2–MS3-based
approaches for the identification of peptides from MS3 spectra, and
introduces a novel scoring function for peptides identified across
multiple MS stages. Detected cross-links are validated by estimating
the false discovery rate (FDR) using a target-decoy approach. We evaluated
the MS3-search-capabilities of MS Annika 2.0 on five different datasets
covering a variety of experimental approaches and compared it to XlinkX
and MaXLinker, two other cross-linking search engines. We show that
MS Annika detects up to 4 times more true unique cross-links while
simultaneously yielding less false positive hits and therefore a more
accurate FDR estimation than the other two search engines. All mass
spectrometry proteomics data along with result files have been deposited
to the ProteomeXchange consortium via the PRIDE partner repository
with the dataset identifier PXD041955.</p>

    <title>Introduction</title>
    <p>Cross-linking mass spectrometry (XLMS)
has become a prominent tool
in structural, molecular, and systems biology.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref></sup> XLMS is able to detect amino acid residues that are in close spatial
proximity and therefore facilitating the structural analysis of proteins
or protein complexes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref></sup> and capturing protein–protein
interactions, potentially uncovering whole interactomes on a system-wide
level.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref></sup> Various in-depth reviews that already exist
not only highlight successful applications but also the limitations
of XLMS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>−<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref></sup> In a typical cross-linking experiment, the sample is incubated with
a reagent, the cross-linker, that forms covalent bonds between reactive,
surface-exposed amino acid side chains, which are within the cross-linker’s
distance threshold. The sample is subsequently enzymatically digested
(usually with trypsin) and optionally enriched for cross-linked peptides.
Analysis is then carried out by liquid chromatography tandem mass
spectrometry (LC–MS/MS) and cross-linked peptides and binding
sites are identified from the resulting spectra by a cross-linking
search engine.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref></sup></p>
    <p>XLMS started out
with studies on smaller proteins and protein complexes,
using cross-linking reagents such as disuccinimidyl suberate or bis-(sulfosuccinimidly)suberate,
that are still in use today.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref></sup> These reagents
belong to the class of so-called non-cleavable cross-linkers since
they do not break during fragmentation. Identification of peptides
cross-linked with a non-cleavable cross-linker is complicated by the
fact that only the complete mass of the cross-linked entity is known
rather than the individual masses of the two cross-linked peptides.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref></sup> As a result, all possible pairs of peptides
need to be considered during the search, quadratically increasing
the search space which is often referred to as the <italic>n</italic>-squared problem.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref></sup> Estimation of the
false discovery rate (FDR) is also more complex because the peptide
identifications are interdependent on each other (a more detailed
overview of FDR estimation in XLMS is given by Fischer and co-workers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref></sup>). Especially the increase in search space and
therefore runtime makes proteome-wide XLMS studies with non-cleavable
cross-linkers challenging. These limitations led to the development
of a new class of cross-linking reagents denoted as (MS-)cleavable
cross-linkers, such as disuccinimidyl dibutyric urea (DSBU)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref></sup> and dissuccinimidyl sulfoxide (DSSO).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref></sup></p>
    <p>In comparison to non-cleavable cross-linkers,
cleavable cross-linkers
incorporate an off-center labile moiety which can be cleaved during
the fragmentation in the mass spectrometer, preferably at a lower
collision energy before peptide backbone cleavage.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref></sup> Because cleavable cross-linkers break at an off-center position,
they generate characteristic fragmentation patterns called doublets
in the MS2 scan that allow the mass calculation of the two individual
cross-linked peptides. As the name suggests, these doublets consist
of two peaks that exhibit a cross-linker-specific mass difference
(as shown in <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.jproteome.3c00325/suppl_file/pr3c00325_si_001.pdf">Figure S2</ext-link>). The two cross-linked
peptides are often denoted as alpha and beta peptides, respectively;
however, there is no clear consensus within the cross-linking community
as to which of the two peptides should be the alpha and which the
beta. Initial work by Schilling and co-workers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref></sup> proposes naming the longer peptide alpha and the shorter
beta. For MS Annika, we have adopted the naming convention suggested
by Kao and co-workers in the publication of DSSO<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref></sup> that is widely used for cleavable cross-linkers, where
the alpha peptide is the one associated with the doublet of lower <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic>. Another advantage of cleavable cross-linkers
is that the two cross-linked peptides can be selected for a third-stage
tandem MS (MS3) scan, ideally acquiring an MS3 spectrum for each of
the doublet peaks which contain the cross-linked peptides in linear
form.</p>
    <p>Even though the MS2 scan contains fragment ions of both
cross-linked
peptides, theoretically sufficient for identification of both peptides,
usually an additional MS2 scan with a complimentary fragmentation
method or doublet MS3 scans are required to obtain a satisfying sequence
coverage for unambiguous cross-link identification.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref></sup> Alternatively, more recent studies have shown that stepped
higher-energy C-trap dissociation (HCD)-based fragmentation methods
are also performing well for cross-link identification.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref></sup> Using MS2–MS3 acquisition generally yields more cross-link
identifications than traditional (non-stepped HCD) MS2- and MS2–MS2-based
workflows while also providing higher sequence coverage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref></sup> and more accurate results for quantification
than stepped HCD-based workflows.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref></sup> The
advancements in acquisition methods and incorporation of ion-mobility<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref></sup> or FAIMS filtering<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref></sup> have further improved
cross-link identification rates, and XLMS using cleavable cross-linkers
is nowadays being used for experiments up to system wide level.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref></sup></p>
    <p>The increasing number of cross-linking
reagents, different acquisition
methods, and various experimental setups led to the implementation
of over 20 different software tools (usually denoted as cross-linking
search engines) from different research groups specializing in the
identification and validation of cross-linked peptides.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>−<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34">34</xref></sup> It should also be noted here that most traditional database search
engines for the identification of linear peptides can be used to detect
cross-linked peptides specifically in MS3 scans, in that regard Protein
Prospector<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref35">35</xref></sup> has been successfully applied,
as shown in recent publications.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref37">37</xref></sup> However, combining
the identified peptides to cross-links via their precursor MS2 spectra
and subsequent validation is a substantial part of cross-link identification
that still needs to be done manually or by another software afterward.
Cross-linking search engines typically incorporate all of these steps
with very little need for manual work.</p>
    <p>To our knowledge, only
two cross-linking search engines support
data from MS2–MS3 acquisition, namely, MaXLinker<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref></sup> and XlinkX.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34">34</xref></sup> However,
both tools have significant drawbacks: MaXLinker requires multiple
manual pre-processing steps that complicate data analysis while also
often identifying substantially less cross-links than XlinkX. On the
other hand, XlinkX usually identifies a high number of unique cross-links,
but it suffers from poor FDR estimation, often highly underestimating
the actual FDR and therefore identifying a lot of false positive cross-links.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref></sup> This highlights the need for a cross-linking
search engine that is capable of reliably identifying cross-linked
peptides from MS3 spectra while providing accurate FDR estimates.</p>
    <p>In this work, we present MS Annika 2.0, a new version of our cross-linking
search engine that we previously published.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref38">38</xref></sup> The updated MS Annika 2.0 now supports data from any MS2–MS3-based
cross-linking workflow and introduces a new algorithm for identifying
cross-linked peptides from MS3 spectra that reliably detects high
numbers of cross-links while providing accurate FDR estimates. MS
Annika 2.0 is available free of charge for Thermo Scientific Proteome
Discoverer versions 2.5, 3.0, and 3.1 at <uri xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://ms.imp.ac.at/index.php?action=ms-annika">https://ms.imp.ac.at/index.php?action=ms-annika</uri>.</p>

  <sec id="sec2">
    <title>Methods</title>
    <p>Our newly developed search algorithm for MS2–MS3-based
cross-linking
workflows builds upon the characteristic fragmentation patterns created
by MS-cleavable cross-linkers in MS2 spectra as well as the product
MS3 spectra containing the cross-linked peptides in linear form. The
detection of these characteristic fragmentation patterns in the MS2
spectra is facilitated by the MS Annika Detector node that we described
in our previous MS Annika publication.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref38">38</xref></sup> In order to adapt MS Annika 2.0 for MS2–MS3-based workflows
and identify cross-linked peptides also from MS3 spectra, every MS3
spectrum is first mapped to its corresponding precursor peak in the
associated MS2 spectrum. This mainly serves two functions: (1) to
verify that the MS3 spectrum indeed originates from a cross-linked
peptide and (2) to determine the cross-linker modification attached
to that peptide. Subsequently, deisotoping of the cross-link peaks
in the MS2 spectrum is performed to calculate the monoisotopic mass
of the cross-linked peptides. Then the MS2 and MS3 spectra are adjusted
for identification by our in-house developed search engine, MS Amanda,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref39">39</xref></sup> that identifies both cross-linked peptides.
If the same peptide is found in an MS2 spectrum and one or more of
the associated product MS3 spectra, its confidence is boosted using
a novel scoring function. All identified peptides are then grouped
to cross-link spectrum matches (CSMs) and validated using a target-decoy
approach to estimate the FDR. Similarly, the CSMs are grouped to cross-links
and validated again using the same target-decoy strategy. A schematic
workflow of the MS2–MS3 search in MS Annika 2.0 is depicted
in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref></xref>.</p>

→ the cross-link doublet peaks are deisotoped for calculating
the peptide’s monoisotopic mass → spectra are adjusted
and then searched with MS Amanda<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref39">39</xref></sup> to identify
the cross-linked peptides → scores of hits of the same precursor
that appear in more than one MSn scan are boosted to reflect the increased
confidence.</p>

    <sec id="sec2.1">
      <title>MS3 Spectrum to MS2 Doublet Peak Mapping</title>
      <p>The first
step in our MS3 search algorithm is, as aforementioned, creating a
mapping connecting MS2 doublet peaks to their corresponding MS3 product
spectra. The MS Annika detector node searches for cross-linker-specific
fragmentation patterns in the MS2 spectrum and annotates peaks that
are likely to originate from cross-linked peptides as doublet peaks:
either alpha or beta, describing if it belongs to the first or second
peptide, and light or heavy depending on the attached cross-linker
modification. MS Annika 2.0 is then searching for any product MS3
spectra of that MS2 scan within a 5 min retention time window after
being recorded by looking for MS3 scans that share the same MS1 precursor
mass as the MS2 scan. All eligible MS3 spectra are attempted to be
matched to one of the doublet peaks (or peaks of the same isotopic
envelope) using a given tolerance. If a match is found, key information
about the peptide contained in the MS3 can be deducted: first, the
accurate monoisotopic mass of the cross-linked peptide can be determined
(if the isotopic distribution is present in the precursor MS2 spectrum).
Second, the cross-linker modification is given by the doublet peak
annotation as the peptide originating from the lighter peak carries
the short arm of the cleavable cross-linker while the heavier peak
carries the long arm. Third, by considering the distance between the
two peaks in the doublet, we can detect if the cross-linker has undergone
any additional modifications, which is important for an accurate calculation
of the unmodified peptide’s mass (see also <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.jproteome.3c00325/suppl_file/pr3c00325_si_001.pdf">Figure S3</ext-link>). Furthermore, another advantage of this matching
process is the verification that an MS3 spectrum indeed stems from
a peak of a cross-linked peptide. Even though mass spectrometers are
tuned to select one of the doublet peaks for subsequent fragmentation
and recording of an MS3 scan, it has been shown that they sometimes
fail to do so and analyze another close (in terms of <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic>) but non-cross-linked peak instead.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref></sup> Therefore, rather than searching all MS3 spectra
and potentially identifying a lot of false positives, we only search
those whose precursor MS2 spectrum shows cross-link evidence and where
the precursor peak in the MS2 spectrum is part of a cross-link doublet.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec2.2">
      <title>Spectrum Preparation and Search</title>
      <p>The second step in
our MS3 search algorithm is preparing both MS2 and MS3 spectra for
search with our in-house developed database search engine, MS Amanda,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref39">39</xref></sup> to identify the cross-linked peptides. Deisotoping
of the doublet peaks in the MS2 spectra is performed to determine
the monoisotopic masses of the peptides since the instrument does
not always select the monoisotopic peak for the MS3 scan. Furthermore,
for identification, the algorithm tries to infer the charge of the
peptide from the isotopic distribution of the MS2 or MS3 scan, or
if it cannot be inferred, all charge states up to a user-definable
limit (by default 4) are considered. The precursor <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> of any candidate MS3 spectrum is then adjusted
to that of the monoisotopic precursor peak minus the <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> of the cross-linker modification(s), and the
precursor charge is set to the detected charge state. Moreover, MS
Annika does not only consider the short and long fragments of the
cross-linker as modifications but also any potential mass changes
due to alternative cleavages or losses (see DSSO<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref></sup>/DSBSO<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref40">40</xref></sup> and <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.jproteome.3c00325/suppl_file/pr3c00325_si_001.pdf">Figure S3</ext-link>). The precursor masses (mass of the
peptide without
the cross-linker) of the MS3 spectra are calculated as the following<disp-formula id="eq1"><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="pr3c00325_m001" position="anchor"/><label>1</label></disp-formula><disp-formula id="eq2"><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="pr3c00325_m002" position="anchor"/><label>2</label></disp-formula><disp-formula id="eq3"><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="pr3c00325_m003" position="anchor"/><label>3</label></disp-formula><disp-formula id="eq4"><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="pr3c00325_m004" position="anchor"/><label>4</label></disp-formula>where peak is the mass of the monoisotopic
doublet peak in the associated MS2 precursor spectrum and XL<sub>product</sub> is the mass of any potential change that the cross-linker fragment
underwent.</p>
      <p>Additionally, if only one of the peptides is captured
in an MS3 scan, the MS2 scan is used for the identification of the
other peptide, where the precursor mass of the MS2 is adjusted in
the same manner. Optionally, this is also carried out if there are
MS3 scans for both peptides. Moreover, the approach described in our
previous publication<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref38">38</xref></sup> is still utilized
to identify cross-linked peptides from MS2 spectra; on the one hand,
to gather more evidence for identifications and on the other hand,
to cover all cases where none of the peptides are featured in one
of the MS3 scans.</p>
      <p>MS2 and MS3 spectra are then searched with
MS Amanda<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref39">39</xref></sup> to identify the cross-linked
peptides, considering
individual mass tolerances for the different spectra.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec2.3">
      <title>Peptide Hit Pooling and Boosting</title>
      <p>In MS2–MS3-based
workflows, the same peptide can often be identified in the MS2 scan
and in one or more of the corresponding product ion MS3 scans. If
so, there is more evidence that the identified peptide is correct,
which should be reflected in the peptide’s identification score.
We therefore designed a new scoring function that boosts the peptide’s
identification score based on its maximum MS Amanda score<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref39">39</xref></sup> and the number of MSn scans in which it was
identified. The scoring function is defined as the following<disp-formula id="eq5"><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="pr3c00325_m005" position="anchor"/><label>5</label></disp-formula>where scores<sub>peptide</sub> is a vector
of all MS Amanda scores of the given peptide for an MS2 scan and its
corresponding MS3 scans. Variable <italic>n</italic> is the number
of unique corresponding MSn scans the peptide was identified in and <italic>p</italic> is the boost parameter that defines how much a hit is
boosted.</p>
      <p>For the choice of <italic>p</italic>, we tested several
distinct values ranging from 0 (not boosting) to 100 (doubling the
maximum score for every additional scan) on the dataset by Matzinger
and co-workers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref></sup> that we describe later.
By default, <italic>p</italic> is set to 20 which we validated to
perform well across all tested datasets featuring various cross-linkers,
acquisition methods and fragmentation methods.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec2.4">
      <title>Validation</title>
      <p>The two identified cross-linked peptides
are then combined into one CSM that associates the two peptides with
the MS2 spectrum that contains them (independently of whether the
identifications are from the MS2 or MS3 scan). Since the same pair
of peptides can usually be found in more than one spectrum, several
CSMs of the same peptide pair are then grouped into one cross-link.
Scoring and validation of CSMs and cross-links in the MS2–MS3
search works exactly the same as in the MS2 search: the score of the
CSM is the smaller MS Amanda score of the two peptides and the score
of the cross-link is the maximum score of all CSMs that form the cross-link.
For FDR estimation, we employ a two-step validation approach, first
on the CSM level and subsequently on the cross-link level, using a
target-decoy strategy where decoys are generated by reversing the
database. A more detailed description of our validation algorithm
is given in our previous publication of the MS2 search of MS Annika.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref38">38</xref></sup></p>

      <p>For the first dataset—from hereon denoted as
dataset A—we
used a synthetic peptide library that we published previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref></sup> and that was specifically designed for benchmarking
cross-linking workflows and search engines. This peptide library features
a total of 141 peptides from 38 different proteins of the <italic>E. coli</italic> ribosomal complex with a theoretical limit
of 1018 cross-links that can be found. The peptides are split into
groups of 6–10 peptides and cross-linked groupwise, allowing
the calculation of the experimentally validated FDR after identification
since it is known which peptides can be cross-linked. Specifically,
any cross-links between peptides of different groups or non-synthesized
peptides are false positives. For this publication, we re-analyzed
the synthetic peptide library using four additional MS2–MS3-based
cross-linking experiments. The library was cross-linked once with
DSSO and once with DSBSO, and samples were analyzed on an Orbitrap
Eclipse (Thermo Scientific) using collision-induced dissociation (CID)
acquisition mode for MS2 and MS3 spectra. MS3 scans were recorded
once using the Orbitrap and once using the ion trap, which allowed
us to compare the performance of MS Annika 2.0 not only across different
cross-linkers but also across different mass analyzers. All mass spectrometry
proteomics data have been deposited to the ProteomeXchange consortium
via the PRIDE partner repository<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref42">42</xref></sup> with
the dataset identifier PXD041955.</p>
      <p>Additionally, we tested MS
Annika 2.0 on the data that we published
along with the synthetic peptide library,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref></sup> from hereon denoted as dataset B. Similar to dataset A, the peptide
library was cross-linked with DSSO and analyzed on an Orbitrap Eclipse
(Thermo Scientific) using CID acquisition for MS2 and MS3 scans. Both
MS2 and MS3 spectra were recorded in the Orbitrap at a resolution
of 30 and 15 K, respectively. The sample for this workflow was analyzed
in triplicates—in contrast to dataset A which was not replicated.
The dataset is available via the PRIDE public repository<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref42">42</xref></sup> using the identifier PXD029252.</p>
      <p>The third
dataset that we used for benchmarking is the synthetic
peptide library by Beveridge and co-workers,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref></sup> from hereon denoted as dataset C. Analogous to our synthetic peptide
library of the ribosomal complex, their peptide library was also explicitly
developed for evaluating cross-linking workflows and search engines,
which allows us to calculate an experimentally validated FDR and assess
how accurate a search engine’s FDR estimation is. The peptide
library consists of 95 peptides from <italic>S. pyogenes</italic> Cas9 that were divided into 12 groups and cross-linked within their
groups, yielding a theoretical limit of 426 cross-links that can be
identified. Again, the premise is that any identified cross-link that
is composed of two peptides of different groups or non-synthesized
peptides is a false positive. Beveridge and co-workers applied their
peptide library to two different MS2–MS3-based cross-linking
workflows using DSSO with samples analyzed on an Orbitrap Fusion Lumos
(Thermo Scientific). In the first workflow, MS2 and MS3 scans were
acquired using CID fragmentation, while in the second workflow, an
additional MS2 scan was recorded using electron-transfer/higher-energy
collision dissociation (EThcD). In both workflows, MS3 scans were
recorded in the ion trap. The dataset is available via the PRIDE public
repository using the identifier PXD014337.</p>
      <p>The fourth dataset
was established by Ruwolt and co-workers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref></sup> for optimizing tandem mass tag-based quantification
of protein–protein interactions in XLMS. We refer to this dataset
from hereon as dataset D. As part of their optimization process, Ruwolt
and co-workers compared different acquisition methods for cross-link
identification, where one of the methods was an MS2–MS3-based
workflow that we re-analyzed to benchmark our new MS3 search. In this
workflow, they cross-linked HEK293T cell lysates with DSSO and prepared
three strong cation exchange (SCX) fractions, which they analyzed
using an Orbitrap Fusion Lumos with FAIMS Pro device (both Thermo
Scientific) using stepped HCD for MS2 (Orbitrap) and CID for MS3 (ion
trap) acquisition. Samples were analyzed in two technical replicates,
and the data is available via the PRIDE public repository using the
identifier PXD031114.</p>
      <p>The fifth and final dataset—from
hereon denoted as dataset
E—that we used for testing MS Annika 2.0 is from a cross-linking
experiment for the structural investigation of the non-structural
protein 7 (NSP7) and non-structural protein 8 (NSP8) complex of SARS-CoV-2
by Courouble and co-workers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref41">41</xref></sup> Specifically,
we analyzed data from their NSP8 MS2–MS3 experiment, where
they cross-linked NSP8 with DSSO and analyzed the sample on an Orbitrap
Fusion Lumos (Thermo Scientific) using CID MS2 (Orbitrap) and HCD
MS3 (ion trap) acquisition. The dataset consists of technical triplicates
and can be retrieved via the PRIDE public repository using dataset
identifier PXD026191.</p>

      <title>Data Acquisition</title>
      <p>Except for dataset A, all data was
retrieved via the PRIDE public repository<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref42">42</xref></sup> using the respective identifiers. For dataset A, the samples were
prepared as given in our publication.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref></sup> In order to acquire MS3 scans from the Orbitrap and the ion trap,
the samples were analyzed on an Orbitrap Eclipse Tribrid mass spectrometer
with a FAIMS pro interface (both Thermo Scientific). The Orbitrap
Eclipse was operated in data-dependent mode using a full scan (<italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> range 375–1500, a nominal resolution
of 120 K, and an automatic gain control (AGC) target value of 4 ×
10<sup>5</sup>). MS2 scans were acquired in the Orbitrap using CID
fragmentation at a collision energy of 25, an isolation width of 1.2 <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic>, a resolution of 30 K, and an AGC target
value of 5 × 10<sup>4</sup>. Precursor ions selected for fragmentation
(±10 ppm) were put on a dynamic exclusion list for 25 s. MS3
scans were triggered by the cross-linker-specific mass difference
(DSSO: 31.9721 Da and DSBSO: 182.0071 Da) and either acquired in the
Orbitrap or in the ion trap, depending on the experiment, using CID
fragmentation at a collision energy of 35 and an isolation width of
2.0 <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic>. For MS3 scans recorded
in the Orbitrap, the resolution was set to 15 K, a maximum injection
time of 22 ms, and an AGC target value of 2 × 10<sup>4</sup>.
For MS3 scans recorded in the ion trap, the ion trap was operated
in rapid mode with a maximum injection time of 150 ms and an AGC target
value of 4 × 10<sup>3</sup>. The compensation voltage for FAIMS
was set to −55 V. The MS3 acquisition was designed as described
by Wheat and co-workers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref36">36</xref></sup> All mass spectrometry
data along with our result files have been deposited to the ProteomeXchange

    <sec id="sec2.7">
      <title>Data Processing and Evaluation</title>
      <p>To assess the performance
of our MS2–MS3 search algorithm, we compared MS Annika 2.0
to XlinkX<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34">34</xref></sup> and MaXLinker<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref></sup> which are—to our knowledge—the only other
two cross-linking search engines capable of MS2–MS3 searches.
The metrics that we used to compare the different search engines were,
on the one hand, the total number of unique cross-link identifications
at an estimated 1% FDR and, on the other hand, how close the estimated
FDR was to the experimentally validated FDR for datasets where this
calculation was possible. We applied all search engines to the datasets
mentioned previously.</p>
      <p>We analyzed the datasets using MS Annika
2.0 (version 1.1.3, Proteome Discoverer version 2.5.0.400), XlinkX
(version 2.5, Proteome Discoverer version 3.0.0.757), and MaXLinker
(version 1.0.0). For searches with MS Annika 2.0 and XlinkX, RAW files
were loaded into Proteome Discoverer, and MS Annika 2.0 and XlinkX
were used as nodes within the software. We employed the workflow design
proposed by XlinkX for both XlinkX and MS Annika 2.0. Mass spectra
were first searched with a traditional database search engine such
as Sequest HT (version 2.0.0.26, Proteome Discoverer version 3.0.0.757)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref43">43</xref></sup> for XlinkX workflows or MS Amanda (version 2.5.0.16129,
engine version 2.0.0.16129, Proteome Discoverer version 2.5.0.400)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref39">39</xref></sup> for MS Annika 2.0 workflows for the purpose
of identifying linear peptides. Subsequently, spectra with highly
confident identifications of a linear peptide were filtered out and
not considered for the cross-link search.</p>
      <p>For searches with
MaXLinker, we followed the steps given in their
publication.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref></sup> Spectra were converted to
MGF using the Spectrum Exporter node in Proteome Discoverer 2.5 (version
2.5.0.400) and to DTA format using the Spectrum Exporter node in Proteome
Discoverer 2.1 (version 2.1.0.81). The Sequest HT searches necessary
for MaXLinker for the identification of cross-linked peptides were
carried out using Sequest HT (version 2.0.0.24) and validated using
Percolator (version 3.05.0),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref44">44</xref></sup> both in
Proteome Discoverer 2.5 (version 2.5.0.400).</p>
      <p>Wherever possible,
we used comparable settings across the different
search engines for parameters which they all share, for example, precursor
mass tolerance and fragment mass tolerance. We applied a precursor
mass tolerance of 5–10 ppm, a fragment mass tolerance of 10–20
ppm for spectra recorded in the Orbitrap, and a 0.5 Da fragment mass
tolerance for spectra recorded in the ion trap. Any search engine-specific
parameters were set to the defaults recommended by the developers
or to values used by the authors of the datasets if they were given.
Moreover, for the data of the synthetic peptide libraries, we attempted
to identify the parameters that yielded the maximum number of unique
cross-link identifications at an experimentally validated FDR that
is as close as possible to the estimated FDR. A complete overview
of the applied search settings is given in the <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.jproteome.3c00325/suppl_file/pr3c00325_si_001.pdf">Supporting Information</ext-link> and shown in Table S1, the applied
workflow design of the search is depicted in Figure S1.</p>
      <p>For
datasets A and B, we used the FASTA database provided in the
respective PRIDE repository in combination with 116 sequences of common
contaminants for search. For the datasets by Beveridge and co-workers
(dataset C), we used the FASTA database given in the <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.jproteome.3c00325/suppl_file/pr3c00325_si_001.pdf">Supporting Information</ext-link> of their publication,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref></sup> which featured the sequence of <italic>S. pyogenes</italic> Cas9 and common contaminant proteins. Furthermore, for searching
the datasets by Ruwolt and co-workers (dataset D), we used the FASTA
database given in their PRIDE repository, including 5812 proteins
from human UniProt/Swiss-Prot. We additionally added the proteome
of <italic>E. coli</italic> (strain K12, proteome ID
UP000000625, retrieved 03.10.2022) for better FDR control. In order
to identify cross-links in the NSP8 datasets by Courouble and co-workers
(dataset E), we used the reference sequence of NSP8 of SARS-CoV-2
from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) with
the identifier YP_009725303.1 (retrieved 12.10.2022).</p>
      <p>Since
MaXLinker only supports FASTA files in a specific format,
all FASTA files used for analysis with MaXLinker were pre-processed
with an in-house-developed Python script. To facilitate the comparison
between the different tools, all cross-links identified by MaXLinker
were manually grouped by sequence and cross-linker position to be
consistent with the grouping that is applied by XlinkX and MS Annika
2.0. Finally, MaXLinker result files were converted to resemble the
same structure as MS Annika 2.0 result files if needed to make downstream
analysis easier as not all tools support MaXLinker files as input.
We have published all the scripts that we developed as part of our
analysis and which we imagine will increase the usability of MaXLinker
for other researchers on GitHub via the repository <uri xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://github.com/hgb-bin-proteomics/MaXLinker_extensions">https://github.com/hgb-bin-proteomics/MaXLinker_extensions</uri>.</p>
      <p>Results of the synthetic peptide libraries (datasets A, B, and
C) were post-processed using the tool IMP-X-FDR (version 1.1.0)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref></sup> that can calculate the experimentally validated
FDR. The premise for FDR calculation is that peptides are cross-linked
groupwise, and therefore any cross-link consisting of peptides that
are not within the same group or cross-links involving non-synthesized
peptides are considered false positives. The experimentally validated
FDR is then calculated as the fraction of false positive cross-links
divided by the number of all identified cross-links. Furthermore,
for dataset D, we validated the identified cross-links, on top of
the FDR estimation by the search engines, by using a strategy well
established in traditional database search, which is usually referred
to as entrapment search.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref45">45</xref></sup> Sequences of
an organism not contained within the analyzed sample are added to
the database for search in order to estimate the FDR among the target
hits after target-decoy validation. Several publications have shown
that this can also be applied to XLMS for validating cross-linking
results.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref47">47</xref></sup> We used the
proteome of <italic>E. coli</italic> for entrapment
as there was no <italic>E. coli</italic> in the sample,
consequently, any identification containing an <italic>E. coli</italic> peptide was considered a false positive hit. For validation, we
therefore post-processed MS Annika 2.0, MaXLinker, and XlinkX results
by filtering out the lowest scoring cross-link until less than 1%
of identified cross-links contained an <italic>E. coli</italic> peptide.</p>

      <title>MS Annika 2.0 Provides High Numbers of True Cross-link Identifications
and Realistic FDR Estimates for Ion Trap and Orbitrap MS3 Data</title>
      <p>Using the synthetic peptide library datasets (datasets A, B, and
C) allows us to calculate the experimentally validated FDR of our
results and compare it to the estimated FDR of our search engine.
The results for dataset A are depicted in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>, which shows the performance of the MS2–MS3-based
search approach of MS Annika 2.0 in comparison to the other cross-linking
search engines MaXLinker and XlinkX at 1% estimated FDR. Additionally,
we also compared this new search approach to the MS2-only search approach
of the MS Annika version that we previously published<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref38">38</xref></sup> (from hereon denoted as MS Annika 1.0). <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref> splits into four subplots
for the different cross-linkers and mass analyzers. In all cases,
MS Annika 2.0 yields true FDRs that are very close to the estimated
FDR of 1% while still reporting high numbers of correctly identified
cross-links. MS Annika 2.0 outperforms MS Annika 1.0 in terms of identified
cross-links in all cases, as expected since the 1.0 version does not
make use of the MS3 data. MS Annika 2.0 also yields more true cross-links
and better experimentally validated FDRs than MaXLinker for all four
of the different experiments, identifying between 104 and 286 more
cross-links than MaXLinker at an experimentally validated FDR between
1.08 and 1.56%. For MaXLinker, the experimentally validated FDR ranges
from 2.67 to 8.02%, noticeably worse than that of MS Annika 2.0. In
comparison to XlinkX, MS Annika 2.0 identifies less true cross-links
in three of the four cases but provides better FDR estimates in all
cases as the experimentally validated FDR for XlinkX ranges between
4.16% and up to 17.07%. However, a direct comparison of the number
of true cross-link identifications may not be suitable for cases where
the experimentally validated FDR differs by a lot, for example, in
the DSBSO ion trap dataset, where MS Annika 2.0 reports 4 false positive
cross-links while XlinkX reports 56. We therefore also looked at the
number of cross-link identifications at an experimentally validated
1% FDR (removing cross-links with the lowest score until less than
1% are false positives) and could confirm that MS Annika 2.0 provides
the highest number of true cross-link identifications at an experimentally
validated 1% FDR for all four datasets, outperforming MS Annika 1.0,
MaXLinker, and XlinkX (see <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.jproteome.3c00325/suppl_file/pr3c00325_si_001.pdf">Figures S4–S7</ext-link>). <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.jproteome.3c00325/suppl_file/pr3c00325_si_001.pdf">Figure S8</ext-link> shows the overlaps of the
identified true cross-links of the different search engines. Generally,
there is good agreement between MS Annika 2.0, MaXLinker, and XlinkX,
except for the DSSO Orbitrap dataset, where XlinkX only has small
overlaps with both MS Annika 2.0 and MaXLinker.</p>

FDR. MS Annika 2.0 yields more true cross-links and better FDR estimates
than MaXLinker in all cases, reporting between 104 to 286 more cross-links
across the four datasets. Compared to XlinkX, MS Annika 2.0 finds
less cross-links in 3 of the 4 datasets but provides better FDR estimates
in all cases, with values ranging between 1.08 and 1.56% for MS Annika
2.0 and 4.16% up to 17.07% for XlinkX.</p>

      <p>Interestingly, independently of the used search
engine, more cross-links
were identified in workflows using ion trap MS3 acquisition compared
to workflows using Orbitrap MS3 acquisition, even though the Orbitrap
yields higher resolution spectra. This can be attributed to the Orbitrap
having longer cycle times and therefore a reduced scan rate, missing
out on cross-linked peptides that cannot be sampled fast enough. The
ion trap records spectra at a much lower resolution, but its speed
and therefore ability to sample more cross-linked peptides make up
for the reduced confidence in identifications that is caused by the
lower resolution.</p>
      <p>For dataset B,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref></sup> which is using the
same synthetic peptide library as dataset A, the results are shown
in <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.jproteome.3c00325/suppl_file/pr3c00325_si_001.pdf">Figure S9</ext-link>. For this dataset, the library
was cross-linked with DSSO, and the MS3 was recorded in the Orbitrap,
similar to one of the experiments of dataset A that we show in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>. The results are
also in line with what we could show for the experiment of dataset
A: MS Annika 2.0 outperforms all other tools in terms of the number
of true cross-link identifications, reporting 339 more cross-links
than MaXLinker and 6 more than XlinkX, on average across the 3 replicates.
MS Annika 2.0 simultaneously yields better FDR estimates than MaXLinker
and XlinkX, providing an experimentally validated FDR of 4.09% on
average, compared to 4.23% for MaXLinker and 10.15% for XlinkX. We
also looked at overlaps in cross-link identification between the three
replicates and the different search tools, which we show in the Venn
diagrams depicted in <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.jproteome.3c00325/suppl_file/pr3c00325_si_001.pdf">Figure S10</ext-link>. The Venn
diagrams show good agreement across replicates and between the search
engines.</p>
      <p>For dataset C, which is the synthetic peptide library
of Beveridge
and co-workers,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref></sup> MS Annika 2.0 exceeds
MS Annika 1.0, MaXLinker, and XlinkX in the number of identified true
cross-links in both the CID-MS2-CID-MS3 experiment and the CID-MS2-EThcD-MS2-CID-MS3
experiment, as shown in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref></xref>. MS Annika 2.0 identifies up to 23 more cross-links than
MaXLinker and up to 53 more cross-links than XlinkX. Moreover, MS
Annika 2.0 also yields better FDR estimates than MaXLinker and XlinkX
for both datasets, yielding experimentally validated FDRs of 2.87
and 2.80%, respectively. In comparison, MaXLinker provides experimentally
validated FDRs of up to 9.00% and XlinkX up to 6.25%. These were also
the only two datasets where we employed a score cut-off of 45 for
XlinkX, as recommended by Beveridge and co-workers,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref></sup> which should improve FDR. Noticeably, MS Annika 2.0 still
yields more true cross-links and better FDR estimates than XlinkX
with the employed score cut-off. Omitting the score cut-off for XlinkX
leads to slightly higher numbers of unique cross-link identifications
of 165 and 161 true cross-links for the two datasets, respectively,
but at the cost of much worse experimentally validated FDRs going
up to 21.10 and 16.60%, respectively.

      <title>MS Annika 2.0 Is the Cross-Linking Search Engine of Choice for
Stepped HCD MS2 + CID MS3 Data</title>
      <p>The datasets by Ruwolt and
co-workers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref></sup> (dataset D) featured spectra
from a novel workflow design that uses stepped HCD for MS2 acquisition
while additionally recording MS3 scans for cross-linked peptides using
CID fragmentation. We analyzed these datasets using the human protein
database they provided via PRIDE in combination with sequences from
the <italic>E. coli</italic> proteome for better FDR
control. Search results of MS Annika, MaXLinker, and XlinkX that were
validated for 1% estimated FDR were post-processed as described in
Section <xref rid="sec2.7" ref-type="other">Data Processing and Evaluation</xref> by
filtering out the lowest scoring cross-link until less than 1% of
identified cross-links contained an <italic>E. coli</italic> peptide (which we know are false-positive hits as there was no <italic>E. coli</italic> in the sample). The post-processed results
are summarized in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref></xref> for all SCX fractions and replicates. MS Annika 2.0 outperforms
all other tools and yields approximately twice as many cross-links
as XlinkX and more than three times as many as MaXLinker in all cases.
More specifically, MS Annika 2.0 identifies 244 and 237 cross-links,
respectively, in the two replicates of the early SCX fraction (Sample
A). In comparison, MS Annika 1.0 identifies 231 and 223 cross-links,
approximately 14 less than MS Annika 2.0. MaXLinker detects the lowest
number of cross-links at 68 and 67 identifications, respectively,
finding roughly 173 cross-links less than MS Annika 2.0. XlinkX does
slightly better than MaXLinker at 114 and 116 cross-link identifications,
respectively, but is still behind by about 126 cross-links compared
to MS Annika 2.0. For the intermediate SCX fraction (sample B), MS
Annika 2.0 provides 303 and 264 cross-links for the two replicates,
respectively, again exceeding MS Annika 1.0, MaXLinker, and XlinkX.
On average, MS Annika 2.0 identifies 18 more cross-links than MS Annika
1.0, 202 more cross-links than MaXLinker, and 149 more cross-links
than XlinkX for sample B. In the late SCX fraction (sample C), MS
Annika 2.0 again yields the highest number of cross-link identifications
at 244 and 300 identifications for the two replicates, respectively.
MS Annika 2.0 identifies 19 cross-links more than MS Annika 1.0, 187
cross-links more than MaXLinker, and 137 cross-links more than XlinkX
on average for this SCX fraction. MS Annika 1.0 trails MS Annika 2.0
with anywhere from 9 to 28 less cross-links across all fractions and
replicates, indicating that most of the cross-links can be identified
in the MS2 spectra. Stepped HCD fragmentation has established itself
as the method of choice for XLMS as the resulting spectra allow reliable
identification of both cross-linked peptides.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref></sup> We can also observe this in our results, as the number of additional
identifications, that are only found in MS3 spectra is considerably
small. <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.jproteome.3c00325/suppl_file/pr3c00325_si_001.pdf">Figure S12</ext-link> shows the overlaps of

      <p>In the cross-linking experiment
by Courouble and co-workers,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref41">41</xref></sup> that we
re-analyzed, NSP8 was cross-linked with DSSO to uncover the structural
plasticity of the protein. In <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref></xref>A, we show the number of unique cross-links identified
by MS Annika 2.0, MaXLinker, and XlinkX at 1% estimated FDR across
the three replicates and the overlap of the results between the three
search engines. MS Annika 2.0 yields the highest number of cross-link
identifications at 33 unique cross-links, while MaXLinker identifies
13 and XlinkX identifies 19 unique cross-links in total. All cross-links
detected by MaXLinker are also found by MS Annika 2.0, and of the
19 cross-links identified by XlinkX, 16 are also detected by MS Annika
2.0. Out of the 33 cross-links identified by MS Annika 2.0, 19 are
also detected by either MaXLinker or XlinkX, leaving 14 cross-links
that are exclusively detected by MS Annika 2.0. We additionally compared
our results to the cross-links reported in the publication by Courouble
and co-workers, who also used XlinkX for cross-link identification.
The comparison is depicted in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref></xref>B, which shows that MS Annika 2.0 also finds 16 of
the 21 cross-links they reported. Moreover, MS Annika 2.0 identifies
17 additional cross-links that are not reported in their publication.
In order to validate these 17 cross-links, we mapped them to the 3D
structure of the NSP7-NSP8-complex that we retrieved from the protein
data bank<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref55">55</xref></sup> (PDB) using the identifier
6YHU,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref56">56</xref></sup> which was also used by Courouble
and co-workers in their publication. The 3D structure including the
mapped cross-links is shown in Supplementary <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.jproteome.3c00325/suppl_file/pr3c00325_si_001.pdf">Figure S13</ext-link>. Out of the 17 additional cross-links found by MS Annika
2.0, we could map four to the 3D structure, the other 13 correspond
to peptide sequences that are not resolved in this PDB complex. Since
the NSP7-NSP8 complex is a multimer consisting of two NSP7 and two
NSP8, three of the four cross-links are ambiguous as the cross-linked
peptides appear in two different chains, thereby creating four pairs
of cross-linked residues per cross-link. As shown in <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.jproteome.3c00325/suppl_file/pr3c00325_si_001.pdf">Figure S13</ext-link>, the four mappable cross-links found by MS Annika
2.0 result in 13 pairs of cross-linked residues when they are mapped
to this structure. Even though the spacer arm of DSSO is only 10.1
Å long,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref></sup> the maximum Cα –
Cα distance for DSSO cross-linked residues is reported to be
between 27 and 35 Å<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref57">57</xref></sup> due to the flexibility
of lysine side chains and backbone dynamics. We used the more conservative
distance threshold of 27 Å for validating the cross-links identified
by MS Annika 2.0. Most importantly, for each of the four cross-links,
we could find a corresponding cross-linked residue pair that falls
within this distance constraint of 27 Å. This validates that
at least the four mappable cross-links are indeed true identifications
by MS Annika 2.0.</p>

    <title>Discussion and Conclusions</title>
    <p>We have implemented a novel
MS2–MS3 search algorithm in
our cross-linking search engine, MS Annika 2.0, that allows the analysis
of data originating from MS2–MS3-based cross-linking workflows.
Our algorithm utilizes MS2 and MS3 spectra to derive accurate precursor
masses that allow reliable identification of the cross-linked peptides.
Furthermore, we developed a new scoring function that boosts peptides
identified across multiple tandem MS stages. We benchmarked our algorithm
against MaXLinker and XlinkX, two other search engines commonly used
for cross-link identification in MS2–MS3-based cross-linking
experiments. For this benchmarking process, we used datasets from
five different cross-linking experiments of independent labs covering
a variety of cross-linkers, workflow designs, instruments, acquisition
methods, and fragmentation methods, as well as different use cases.
We could show that our MS2–MS3 search algorithm identifies
high numbers of cross-links in both low- and high-resolution MS3 spectra
across all datasets, outperforming MaXLinker and XlinkX in almost
all of the cases. Three of the experiments were analyzing synthetic
peptide libraries that allow the calculation of an experimentally
validated FDR, and we could show that our MS2–MS3 search algorithm
yields more accurate FDR estimates than both MaXLinker and XlinkX
for every dataset. Additionally, we have shown that our search algorithm
is able to uncover cross-linked residues that are not detected by
any of the other search tools, providing further insight into the
structural and functional relationships of the underlying proteins.</p>
    <p>Several publications have shown that stepped HCD MS2 acquisition
can outperform current MS2–MS3-based approaches in terms of
the number of identifiable cross-links.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>−<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref></sup> Ruwolt and co-workers supplemented
stepped HCD MS2 acquisition with additional MS3 scans for detected
cross-link doublets, which performed better than traditional CID-MS2-CID/HCD-MS3
acquisition but ultimately still fell short to the standard stepped
HCD MS2 approach due to the longer duty cycles,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref></sup> however, only by a small margin (as seen in <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.jproteome.3c00325/suppl_file/pr3c00325_si_001.pdf">Figure S14</ext-link>). Even though stepped HCD acquisition
potentially yields more unique cross-link identifications, MS2–MS3
workflows are still widely used in the cross-linking community for
several reasons: first, MS2–MS3 acquisition outperforms regular
MS2 and MS2–MS2 acquisition and is therefore the method of
choice when stepped HCD is not an option. Second, MS2–MS3 acquisition
provides higher sequence coverage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref></sup> and
more accurate quantification results<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref></sup> than
stepped HCD workflows. Third, stepped HCD acquisition results are
highly dependent on the used collision energies,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref></sup> making it necessary to tune acquisition parameters to optimize
performance. On the other hand, MS2–MS3 acquisition is well
established and uses fixed collision energies of usually 25% for MS2
acquisition and 35% for MS3 acquisition, with very little need for
manual tuning. Moreover, continuous research is conducted aiming to
improve MS3 acquisition, for example, Kolbowski and co-workers recently
proposed a novel algorithm for MS3 decision-making that could improve
which peptides are selected for MS3 acquisition.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref58">58</xref></sup> Considering the ongoing developments in MS3 acquisition,
we believe that MS2–MS3-based workflows have the potential
to overtake stepped HCD MS2 acquisition in the future. With our updated
MS Annika 2.0 algorithm capable of analyzing MS3 data, we present
a tool that makes the most of the available information, reliably
detecting high numbers of cross-links at accurate FDR estimates. We
are convinced that the results will improve further with the continuing
advancements in mass spectrometry instruments and MS3 acquisition.</p>

    <title>Availability and Limitations</title>
    <p>The new MS2–MS3
search algorithm is implemented in C# in
our existing cross-linking search engine MS Annika that is available
as node for Proteome Discoverer. The updated version—MS Annika
2.0—including the MS2–MS3 search is available free of
charge for Proteome Discoverer 2.5, 3.0, and 3.1 at <uri xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://ms.imp.ac.at/index.php?action=ms-annika">https://ms.imp.ac.at/index.php?action=ms-annika</uri> or via the GitHub repository <uri xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://github.com/hgb-bin-proteomics/MSAnnika">https://github.com/hgb-bin-proteomics/MSAnnika</uri>. The MS Annika 2.0 plugin node can be run with a free version of
Proteome Discoverer, which you can download from the Thermo Fisher
Web site <uri xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://www.thermofisher.com/at/en/home/industrial/mass-spectrometry/liquid-chromatography-mass-spectrometrylc-ms/lc-ms-software/multi-omics-data-analysis/proteomediscoverer-software.html">https://www.thermofisher.com/at/en/home/industrial/mass-spectrometry/liquid-chromatography-mass-spectrometrylc-ms/lc-ms-software/multi-omics-data-analysis/proteomediscoverer-software.html</uri>. MS Annika 2.0 makes use of the graphical user interface for workflow
generation in Proteome Discoverer so users can easily set up searches
with minimal bioinformatics knowledge. The MS2–MS3 search algorithm
uses the isotope patterns in the MS2 spectra at several steps, it
is therefore important to not deisotope the MS2 spectra before cross-link
search. Furthermore, since MS Annika 2.0 uses MSn spectra, it needs
MSn stage as well as MS2- and MS3-precursor information, which is
why MGF files are not supported. A detailed user manual, including
descriptions of all tunable parameters and step-by-step instructions
for running MS Annika 2.0, as well as license information is also
given on the MS Annika 2.0 webpage. Pre- and post-processing scripts
have been published via the GitHub repositories <uri xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://github.com/hgb-bin-proteomics/MaXLinker_extensions">https://github.com/hgb-bin-proteomics/MaXLinker_extensions</uri> and <uri xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://github.com/hgb-bin-proteomics/MSAnnika_exporters">https://github.com/hgb-bin-proteomics/MSAnnika_exporters</uri>.
