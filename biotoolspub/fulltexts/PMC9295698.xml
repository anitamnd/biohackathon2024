      <p>Rapid and flexible
plasmid construct generation at scale is one
of the most limiting first steps in drug discovery projects. These
hurdles can partly be overcome by adopting modular DNA design principles,
automated sequence fragmentation, and plasmid assembly. To this end
we have designed a robust, multimodule <italic>golden gate</italic> based cloning platform for construct generation with a wide range
of applications. The assembly efficiency of the system was validated
by splitting <italic>sfGFP</italic> and <italic>sfCherry3C</italic> cassettes and expressing them in <italic>E. coli</italic> followed
by fluorometric assessment. To minimize timelines and cost for complex
constructs, we developed a software tool named FRAGLER (FRAGment recycLER)
that performs codon optimization, multiple sequence alignment, and
automated generation of fragments for recycling. To highlight the
flexibility and robustness of the platform, we (i) generated plasmids
for SarsCoV2 protein reagents, (ii) automated and parallelized assemblies,
and (iii) built modular libraries of chimeric antigen receptors (CARs)
variants. Applying the new assembly framework, we have greatly streamlined
plasmid construction and increased our capacity for rapid generation
of complex plasmids.</p>

  <p id="sec1">Construct
generation for protein
expression and cell line engineering is one of the main bottlenecks
for progression of early drug discovery projects. Achieving optimal
expression, identifying the right construct, expressing host, and
producing an active and soluble target protein is a process that often
requires numerous iterative cycles. Similarly, chimeric antigen receptor
(CAR) constructs for T-cell engineering may require extensive modulating
to tune the affinity and specificity of CAR interactions with target
antigens, which in turn may have major consequences on the therapeutic
outcome. With each new target antigen, a new optimal CAR design is
often required. The design–test–build cycle for both
protein expression and complex cell line engineering is greatly facilitated
by using modular, standardized parts and robust high throughput assembly
methods.</p>
  <p>Over the past decade numerous modular Golden Gate based
(Type IIS
restriction enzyme) cloning kits have been published. Most of these
toolkits support construct generation for common model systems such
as bacteria (MoClo, EcoFlex), yeast (YTK, Golden<italic>Pi</italic>CS), and plant based synthetic biology.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref></sup> Recently, a <italic>Komagataeibacter</italic> multigene toolkit
(KTK) was developed to tune cellulose producing bacteria.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref></sup> Mammalian synthetic biology toolkits have a higher
level of complexity, in which EMMA is the most comprehensive to date
supporting up to three transcription units (TUs) over a 25-module
assembly reaction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref></sup> The EMMA toolkit also
has an associated design tool to facilitate building of complex circuits.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref></sup> The Mammalian ToolKit (MTK) supports up to 8
modules that can be used in subsequent assembly reactions to build
up to nine TUs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref></sup> There are also examples
of broader toolkits for complex hierarchical assemblies that span
multiple species kingdoms (MK).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref></sup> Similarly,
the Modular Protein Expression Toolbox (MoPET) supports multiple species
and is built for expression optimization.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref></sup> Both EMMA and MoPET make use of predefined junctions of codons for
glycine, serine, and alanine which are commonly found in coding sequence
linker regions. Building junctions from these amino acids cause minimal
interference in the coding sequence of the target protein. With increasing
complexity and number of modules, the assembly efficiency has come
more in to focus recently in which computationally optimized junctions
between modules have been defined and a junction optimization tool
has been made available.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref></sup> Any modular system
to be used in a high throughput laboratory automation setting needs
to have intermodular junctions optimized for high assembly efficiencies.
The system also needs to be flexible to support protein reagent generation
or cell-line engineering constructs. Last, short construct turnaround
times are critical in any dynamic drug discovery process which is
why one-step assemblies are preferable. To date, no system exists
that fulfills all criteria.</p>
  <p>Here, we describe a comprehensive
and robust DNA assembly framework
to support rapid and cost-efficient construct generation at scale.
Our modular system combines features of computationally optimized
junctions (NEB), Gly/Ser/Ala codon-junctions (EMMA, MoPET) with a
novel software application that we named FRAGLER (FRAGment recycLER)
that performs codon optimization, multiple sequence alignment, and
fragmentation of long coding sequences into short fragments that may
be recycled indefinitely. To assess junction fidelity, we developed
a fluorometric assay based on <italic>sfGFP</italic> and <italic>sfCherry3C</italic> expression cassettes. For a 12 and 19 module assembly, the assembly
efficiency was 99.3% and 96%, respectively. We utilized this assembly
framework to build multiple large and complex SarsCoV2 spike protein
constructs for protein expression optimization. We further optimized
assembly and transformation conditions to support automated, high
throughput cloning by parallelizing assemblies using liquid transformation
and plasmid preparations. Combining the modular system with the optimized
process for assembly and liquid transformation, we applied this process
for rapid CAR-T cell variant library generation.</p>

    <title>Module Validation</title>
    <p>A modular system was designed to support multiple applications
within early drug discovery. The system is constituted by 19 modules
supporting up to three TUs in a one-pot, one-step assembly (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref></xref>a). Each module is
defined in a functional category and flanked by <italic>BsaI</italic> or <italic>BsmBI</italic> sites to generate 4 base pair (bp) junction
overhangs following digestion (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.2c00106/suppl_file/sb2c00106_si_001.pdf">Figure S1a,b</ext-link>). Module 1–4 contains regulatory modules including enhancer,
promoter and 5′UTR. Module 5 to 9 contains a coding sequence
with the possibility to add in typically used parts for protein engineering
such as a signal peptide or N-terminal epitope tag (5), linker (6),
target protein (7), linker (8), and C-terminal epitope tag (9) (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.2c00106/suppl_file/sb2c00106_si_001.pdf">Figure S1c</ext-link>). Module 9 to 12 contains further
regulatory sequences and modules 1 and 12 may be used for including
homology arms for cell line engineering. Module 13–17 constitutes
a second TU with one promoter (13), one “N-terminal modification
(14), a target protein II module (15), a “C-terminal modification”
(16), and a terminator (17). The third TU is normally a fluorescent
or selectable marker cassette (19) with some degree of flexibility
in terms of promoter (18) choice (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.2c00106/suppl_file/sb2c00106_si_001.pdf">Figure S1d–f</ext-link>). Six junctions were selected based on their common representation
in flexible linkers: A<underline>TCC</underline> (Ser), C<underline>AGC</underline> (Ser), T<underline>GCC</underline> (Ala), C<underline>GGG</underline>(Gly) and A<underline>GCG</underline> (Ala) (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.2c00106/suppl_file/sb2c00106_si_001.pdf">Figure S1c–e</ext-link>). In addition, the module
4/5 junction (CCAC) is part of the canonical Kozak-sequence, and the
module 9/10 junction can be used to generate two stop codons (TG-<underline>ATAG</underline>). The remaining junctions were designed with respect
to compatibility with these eight junctions using a recently described
junction fidelity design tool (<uri xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://ggtools.neb.com/viewset/run.cgi">https://ggtools.neb.com/viewset/run.cgi</uri>).</p>

whereas green, red, and white colonies are various forms of mis-assemblies.
The 12-module set formed 99.3% (<italic>n</italic> = 553) correct
assemblies (green = correct) set and the 19-module set formed 96%

    </fig>
    <p>Next, we built an assay for functional validation
and assessing
assembly efficiency based on the selected junctions. The assay relies
on correct assembly and expression of one superfolder <italic>GFP</italic> (<italic>sfGFP</italic>) and one <italic>sf</italic>C<italic>herry3C</italic> expression cassette in <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref></xref>b top). These two cassettes
were split over the 19 modules so that a correct assembly results
in 1–12 (green colony), 13–19 (red colony), and 1–19
(yellow colony). A white colony represents a miss-assembly event.
Using precloned fragments, we observed an assembly efficiency of 99.3%
(<italic>n</italic> = 553) for the 12-module set and 96% (<italic>n</italic> = 227) for the 19-module set. For the 19-module set, increasing
DNA concentration to 100 fmol/fragment increased efficiency from 87%
to 96% (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref></xref>b bottom).
Sanger sequencing validation of 24 clones showed that all clones were
as intended (data not shown). Taken together, increasing the DNA fragment
amount resulted in a higher assembly efficiency than the <italic>in-silico</italic> prediction. Similarly, the junction optimization assay described
herein provided a means to functionally validate <italic>in silico</italic> designed junctions quickly. However, it provides no insight into
synergies between junction selection, fragment size, or repetitive
sequences and how they influence assembly efficiency.</p>

    <title>Automated Fragmentation
Reduces Construct Generation Turnaround
Time and Enables DNA Recycling</title>
    <p>We next sought to improve
our modular system to address the issues
of costly and long turnaround times for generating large or complex
constructs from synthetic DNA. Production success rate by most synthetic
DNA vendors is significantly higher for noncomplex, codon optimized,
and short DNA sequences (300–1200 bps). To this end, we developed
the FRAGLER R shiny application to codon optimize fragment longer
amino acid sequences and convert them into 300–1200bp DNA fragments
suitable for golden gate assembly. Importantly, the application performs
multiple sequence alignments to identify regions of homology so that
these fragments may be recycled to build multiple constructs. The
fragmentation process described here takes amino acid sequences in
module 7 as input and user specified flanking junctions with <italic>BsaI</italic> sites, which are defined based on overhangs of adjacent
modules. Briefly, one or multiple amino acid sequences may be used
as input where sequences are aligned to identify the longest shared
sequence (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>a).
Subsequently, sequences are back-translated, codon optimized (GeneArt),
and fragmented in an automated manner. The user may adjust sequence
constraints (prevent <italic>BsaI, BsmBI, etc</italic>. recognition
sites), junction overhangs that split the coding sequence, and fragment
length. Any system compatible junctions may be selected, but a set
of 5 junctions are routinely used for splitting long coding sequences
(CCGA, GGGC, AGAA, CTTA, TCAA). On the basis of the user input requirements,
a heuristic search is applied to minimize the number of fragments
necessary to reconstitute the original input sequences. Finally, an
assembly matrix is generated which serves as basis for liquid handling
instructions and pooling of fragments for the assembly reaction. The
code to the tool and instructions for how to install and run the tool
is available in GitHub (<uri xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://github.com/AstraZeneca/fragler">https://github.com/AstraZeneca/fragler</uri>).</p>

    <title>Protein
Expression Constructs for Rapid Generation of SarsCoV2
Protein Reagents</title>
    <p>Next, we sought to combine the modular system
with FRAGLER to generate
a suite of complex SarsCoV2 spike protein constructs. First, we processed
30 full-length SARS2 spike protein (90% identity) amino acid sequences
from Uniprot. A multiple sequence alignment was performed to highlight
sequence similarities (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref></xref>a). The same 30 sequences were fragmented and analyzed based
on the fragment recycling matrix (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref></xref>b). The total sequence space of the 30 sequences
was 113 868 nucleotides. Of these nucleotides, 55.3%, corresponding
to 62 974 over 65 fragments, could be recycled (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref></xref>c). Next, we selected one full
length SARS2 spike protein sequence and combined it with modules coding
for varying trimerization domains (foldons) and signal peptides. Improving
expression and yields of the SarsCoV2 spike protein is critical to
support development of serological tests and antibody discovery for
the ongoing COVID19 pandemic. Briefly, we synthesized a set of signal
peptides: AMBP, IL2, IFNB, and HSA (module 5), one GSGS linker (module
6), trimerization domains: T4- Fibritin, IZN4 (GCN4), IZ, MTQ, and
Tetranectin, (foldons, module 8), and an 8xHIS purification tag (Module
9)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref></xref>d). Importantly, the 1273 aa long sequence of the spike
protein was fragmented resulting in four module 7 subfragments (here
named 7a–d). <italic>BsaI</italic> mediated assemblies were
performed into a mammalian expression vector containing promoter and
terminator (CMV/BGH) but lacking modules 5–9 to generate the
desired combinations of signal peptides and foldons. Compatible dropout
vectors were generated also for baculovirus and <italic>E. coli</italic> expression (data not shown). The Module 7 subfragments were reused
in all assemblies enabling fragment recycling, both reducing the initial
synthesis turnaround time and allowing cost efficient testing of multiple
variants. Transient transfection and expression screening of the generated
constructs in HEK293 cells showed that the IZN4 (GCN4) foldon improved
expression of the spike protein ∼2-fold compared to the bacteriophage
T4 derived fibritin trimerization domain (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref></xref>e). The signal peptide was kept constant
between the foldon constructs. Substituting signal peptides (with
a constant T4-fibritin) did not further increase expression (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref></xref>e). Expression levels
were confirmed by two separate Western blots (data not shown). By
combining the modular system with FRAGLER, we successfully generated
multiple complex (&gt;1200 amino acids) codon optimized spike proteins
and small-scale expression screening data in ∼3 weeks starting
from <italic>de novo</italic> synthesized DNA (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref></xref>c).</p>

or using the fluorescent expression cassettes from <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref></xref>. For the latter, single colonies
were inoculated prior to readout. A GFP positive signal was expected
for the colonies harboring the 12-fragment product and a mix of <italic>sfGFP</italic>–<italic>sfCherry3C</italic> was expected for
the 19-fragment product. A representative result is shown (middle

    <title>Optimization
of High Throughput Parallelized Assembly and Screening</title>
    <p>Next,
we looked at the potential to use the modular system to generate
multiple variants in parallel and streamline the process for high
throughput assembly and screening using liquid transformations and
polyclonal cultures. The assembly protocol was adjusted in order to
be fully compatible with automated liquid handlers and miniaturized
to reduce the reaction volume from 20 μL to 2 μL. DNA
fragments represented as modules 1–19 were used to generate
polyclonal DNA preparations (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref></xref>a). Plasmids extracted from these cultures were Sanger
sequenced, reads aligned and analyzed to confirm correct assembly
(<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref></xref>b). A homogeneous
read was obtained for all assemblies up to 6 fragments, excluding
backbone (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref></xref>b).
For each case, multiple polyclonal cultures were plated, and all analyzed
clones were correct indicating nearly 100% assembly (up to 6 fragments).
The analysis of 70 different (8-fragment assemblies) constructs indicated
that 99% of the polyclonal cultures were homogeneous with the expected
plasmid. However, analysis of single clones obtained from a fraction
of these cultures demonstrated that only 86% of extracted plasmids
were correct. For a 12-fragment assembly, 95% clones were correct.
In multiple repetitions of a 19-fragment assembly, the homogeneous
read of the expected plasmid was obtained in 37% of the polyclonal
cultures, in which 24% of the colonies contained the correct final
plasmid. Importantly, by using liquid transformation and assembly
parallelization combined with automation we can efficiently build
8 × 96 constructs per run. Moreover, this workflow greatly facilitates
combinatorial screening of regulatory elements. Utilizing the high
assembly efficiency, we could also streamline the process for up to
6 fragment assemblies in liquid culture reducing timelines by 1 day
for this workflow (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref></xref>c). Although miniaturization facilitates assembly by ECHO
acoustic dispensing, low volume reactions seem to affect assembly
efficiency negatively. This was evident by the discrepancy between
plating and the liquid transformation of the 19-fragment fluorescent
reporter cassette assembly. The issue was potentially due to evaporation
of the 2 μL miniaturized assembly reaction. Furthermore, we
detected certain combinations displaying biological bias resulting
in a nonhomogenous plasmid population.</p>

  <sec id="sec6">
    <title>Chimeric Antigen Receptor
Library Generation</title>
    <p>We next sought to apply our cloning framework
of optimized junctions
and polyclonal cultures to build CAR constructs and multi-modular
variant libraries. CARs are designed in a modular fashion with four
major modules: an extracellular target-binding domain, a hinge, a
trans-membrane domain, and one or more intracellular domains that
transmit activation signals (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref></xref>a). Combining different modules with different properties
allows modulating the affinity and specificity of CAR interaction
with target antigens, the cytotoxic properties of CAR T-cells, their
proliferative capacity, and their persistence in the organism, with
major consequences on the therapeutic outcome. With each new target-antigen
a new optimal CAR design is often required. The length of the hinge
for instance must be optimized for individual epitopes to provide
the optimal intercellular distance for immunological synapse formation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref></sup> The transmembrane domain of choice can favor
CAR expression and stability or can be involved in synapse formation
or T cell signaling depending on the activation domain of choice.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref></sup> We used the modular system to quickly test many
variants and optimize CAR expression cassettes. CAR cassettes are
often delivered to the target cells using a lentiviral vector (LV),
owing to their higher transduction efficiency and transgene expression
in T cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref></sup> For this application we therefore
generated a lentiviral entry vector designed to assemble modules 3
to 10 of the general platform (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.2c00106/suppl_file/sb2c00106_si_001.pdf">Figure S2a</ext-link>). In particular, modules 5 to 8 were assigned to the CAR domains
coding sequence. Module 9 was assigned to a different coding sequence
linked to the CAR by a 2A ribosomal skip peptide in a bicistronic
configuration. Module 9 provides the expression of a selection marker/reporter
or an “armor” protein, which is typically a cell-surface
or secreted immunomodulatory molecule that enhances T-cell function
or favorably modifies the tumor microenvironment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref></sup> We adapted a LV backbone and ran a test assembly of CAR
domains reaching a cloning efficiency of ∼95% (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.2c00106/suppl_file/sb2c00106_si_001.pdf">Figure S2b</ext-link>). For this application we used <italic>BsmBI</italic> in place of <italic>BsaI</italic> due to the presence
of a <italic>BsaI</italic> site in the LTR of the lentiviral backbone.
Mutating the <italic>BsaI</italic> sites had a negative impact on
functional lentiviral particle production (data not shown). The resulting
plasmids were used to generate lentiviral particles and transduce
T-cells <italic>in vitro</italic>. We then carried out an <italic>in vitro</italic> functional assay to demonstrate the expected activity
of the transduced CAR-T cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref></xref>b). Due to its high cloning efficiency this platform
can be used for a rapid and cost-effective generation of CAR-LV variants
through combinatorial assembly for a systematic optimization of CAR
via arrayed or pooled screenings. As a proof of concept, we performed
a one-pot assembly and optimized library protocol to generate a combinatorial
CAR-LV library consisting of different hinges and transmembrane domains.
An NGS-based quality control confirmed a representative library of
all the possible CAR domains combinations (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssynbio.2c00106/suppl_file/sb2c00106_si_001.pdf">Figure S3</ext-link>). However, we also observed a hinge-TM bias for some combinations
in the CAR library making the combinatorial library approach less
suitable for testing larger number of combinations. For more complex
libraries, plating out transformations to avoid library bias is preferable.</p>

    <p>Taken together the DNA assembly framework described herein reduces
cost and timelines for complex plasmid construct generation for cell-line
engineering as well as protein expression projects. The core of this
process is powered by FRAGLER, a novel fragment recycling application
that performs multiple sequence alignment, codon optimization, and
identification of shared sequence regions that can be recycled, thus
reducing DNA production time and cost for synthetic DNA. Looking ahead,
our vision is to perform fragmentation based on structural information
and domain boundaries by integrating with databases such as Uniprot
and PDB. Moreover, we envision that FRAGLER will be improved with
an automated search algorithm to identify sequences that we already
have in-house. Such implementations will improve FRAGLER and further
streamline recycling of DNA fragments ultimately resulting in a more
sustainable way of working.</p>

      <p>For 1 to 6 fragments (excluding backbone), 2 fmol

2 μL reaction volume containing 1X T4 ligase buffer. For 8 to
19 fragments, 10 fmol of each plasmid were mixed in 4 U of <italic>BsaI-HF</italic>v2 with 80 U of T4 ligase in a final 2 μL reaction
volume with the same buffer. The assemblies were performed in 96-well
plates (Eppendorf ref 0030128.648) as described under “Assembly

U PlasmidSafe ATP-Dependent DNase and 1.25 mM ATP (both from Cambio
ref E3101K) in a final 2.5 μL reaction with 1X T4 ligase buffer.
An additional step of 5 min 60 °C was performed just before transformation
of <italic>E. coli</italic> cells. Following the transformation reaction,
the cells were transferred into a 96 W deep plate (Greiner ref 780285)

with a final Kanamycin concentration of 50 μg/mL, and cells
were grown for 2 h at 330 rpm. From this 600 μL culture, 50
μL of cells was grown in 1 mL final volume LB with Kanamycin
overnight at 37 °C 330 rpm. Then, 50 μL of this grown culture
was used to generate glycerol stock while the rest of the culture
was processed using the CosMCPrep Plasmid Purification kit (Beckman
Coulter ref A29174). The identity of the polyclonal culture plasmid
preparations was confirmed using Sanger sequencing. A fraction of

HUH7 cancer cells were detached with Accutase, washed, and counted.
Cancer cells were dispensed in a 96 flat bottom plate (Corning 3595),
and they were allowed to attach to the bottom of the plate for 1 h
before transferring them into the Incucyte S3 imaging platform. After
24 h, the plate was removed from Incucyte S3 and the CAR-T cells were
added on top of the cancer cells. To quantify cancer cells apoptosis,
CellEvent Caspase-3/7 Green Detection Reagent was added in each well
at 4× the concentration to obtain a final concentration of 1
μM. The apoptosis of HUH7 cells was registered with the Incucyte
