    <abstract>
      <p id="P1">Large scale, quantitative proteomic studies have become essential for the analysis of clinical cohorts, large perturbation experiments and systems biology studies. While next-generation mass spectrometric techniques such as SWATH-MS have substantially increased throughput and reproducibility, ensuring consistent quantification of thousands of peptide analytes across multiple LC-MS/MS runs remains a challenging and laborious manual process. To produce highly consistent and quantitatively accurate proteomics data matrices in an automated fashion, we have developed the TRIC software which utilizes fragment ion data to perform cross-run alignment, consistent peak-picking and quantification for high throughput targeted proteomics. TRIC uses a graph-based alignment strategy based on non-linear retention time correction to integrate peak elution information from all LC-MS/MS runs acquired in a study. When compared to state-of-the-art SWATH-MS data analysis, the algorithm was able to reduce the identification error by more than 3-fold at constant recall, while correcting for highly non-linear chromatographic effects. On a pulsed-SILAC experiment performed on human induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells, TRIC was able to automatically align and quantify thousands of light and heavy isotopic peak groups and substantially increased the quantitative completeness and biological information in the data, providing insights into protein dynamics of iPS cells. Overall, this study demonstrates the importance of consistent quantification in highly challenging experimental setups, and proposes an algorithm to automate this task, constituting the last missing piece in a pipeline for automated analysis of massively parallel targeted proteomics datasets.</p>

    <title>Introduction</title>
    <p id="P2">Molecular biology is increasingly becoming a data-driven science which enables researches in biology and medicine to investigate large numbers of biological systems on a genome-wide scale. Underlying this transition is the ability to generate robust, comprehensive and fully quantitative “data matrices” capturing measurements across many samples (first dimension) in a genome-wide fashion (second dimension). In nucleic acid sequencing-based fields, this transition has advanced enough to allow for large-scale inference from thousands of samples in a reproducible and comparable manner [<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p>
    <p id="P3">In contrast, in the field of proteomics the transition to high-throughput measurements across large numbers of samples has proven challenging (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Note 1</xref> and Röst et al. [<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]). While discovery-oriented techniques, such as data-dependent acquisition (DDA) [<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], have recently allowed the identification of a large part of the human proteome [<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], it has become apparent that these methods suffer from poor reproducibility in large scale experiments. Particularly when applied in high throughput to complex protein mixtures, e.g. whole proteomes, the resulting data matrices contain many missing values. To improve reproducibility, alternative approaches based on targeted proteomics were developed which provide high consistency and quantitative accuracy across many experimental conditions due to their deterministic acquisition strategy. Specifically, selected reaction monitoring (SRM) proved to be invaluable for large-scale measurements geared towards systems biology [<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] or biomarker discovery [<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. However, while SRM-based targeted proteomics produces highly consistent data matrices, it is limited by low throughput, resulting in output matrices with typically only few tens of quantified proteins per study (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Note 1, Fig. S1</xref>).</p>
    <p id="P4">Recently, we developed SWATH-MS based on the principle of targeted analysis of data-independent acquisition (DIA) data as a method for massively parallel targeted proteomics [<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Our targeted analysis of DIA data based on OpenSWATH was able to increase the throughput of targeted proteomics by several orders of magnitude compared to SRM-based approaches, and is, in principle, able to to generate proteome-wide data matrices [<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. However, obtaining consistent and accurate matrices from targeted proteomics data is challenging as most current software was developed for low-throughput SRM data and focused on manual analysis and visualization of the data [<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Even fully automated software solutions for peak picking and error rate estimation [<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] generally only operate on a single MS run at a time and are unable to efficiently integrate experimental information from multiple targeted MS runs. However, a single MS run may not contain sufficient information to confidently select the correct peptide elution time point among multiple detected peak groups of similar quality in a given chromatogram (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1 a</xref>). Analyzing single MS runs in isolation, therefore, cannot ensure consistent peak picking across all the measurements constituting a whole experiment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Note 2</xref>).</p>
    <p id="P5">Here we describe the TRIC (TRansfer of Identification Confidence) algorithm, an automated method which integrates all information from a targeted proteomics experiment to accurately and consistently determine the correct elution peak in each MS run. The software is designed to exploit the particular structure of chromatographic fragment ion-based peak data found in targeted proteomics, providing quantification and identification in the same algorithm. The TRIC algorithm uses a reference-free alignment approach based on individual, pairwise non-linear retention time (RT) de-warping which allows it to scale to hundreds of targeted proteomics LC-MS/MS runs. Together with the OpenSWATH framework [<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], TRIC allows fully automated analysis of next-generation targeted proteomics datasets with high throughput. The software is vendor-independent and provided as an open-source package (Modified BSD Licence) at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/msproteomicstools">https://pypi.python.org/pypi/msproteomicstools</ext-link>.</p>

      <title>Design and Structure of the TRIC Algorithm</title>
      <p id="P6">The TRIC algorithm was developed to perform integrative analyses of a large number of targeted MS injections with a focus on robustness, scalability and performance (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Note 3 and 4</xref>). Inherently, the algorithm was designed to correct for non-linear chromatographic distortion between the runs, minimize the effect of outlier runs, and be scalable to hundreds of MS runs. This is achieved through a guidance tree learned from the data which removes the need for a reference run in alignment and by using a locally adaptive retention time tolerance for each pairwise alignment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Note 5</xref>) [<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The algorithm does not rely on MS1 measurements but works directly on chromatographic peak identifications from primary identification tools, such as OpenSWATH [<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] or PeakView, which usually identify multiple potential peakgroups in an extracted fragment ion chromatogram. Using the fragment ion data, the algorithm is able to boost identification confidence for peaks consistently detected across multiple runs and can provide improved peak boundaries for analyte quantification. Starting from a typical targeted proteomics dataset with a number of individually analyzed and scored runs containing multiple potential peak group candidates for identification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1 a</xref>), the algorithm performs the following steps: <list list-type="simple" id="L1"><list-item><label>(a)</label><p id="P7"><italic>Alignment</italic>: Using a set of high-confidence endogenous peptides, an estimate of the pairwise chromatographic distance between all MS runs is obtained (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1 b</xref>) and used to generate a guidance tree. Then, for each edge in the tree, a pairwise non-linear transformation between the RT domains of the two MS runs (nodes) is computed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1 c</xref>; step I). Note that TRIC does not rely on spike-in peptides and that the alignment using a guidance tree removes the need for a reference run, leading to an optimal alignment strategy which prevents direct alignment of chromatographically dissimilar runs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Note 5, Figs. S10 and S11</xref>).</p></list-item><list-item><label>(b)</label><p id="P8"><italic>Confidence transfer</italic>: Traversal of the global guidance tree starts for each measured peptide (targeted proteomics assay) from a suitable “seed” (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1 c</xref>; step II). During traversal, each node (LC-MS/MS run) of the tree is visited sequentially (step III, iterations 2 and 3) and a confident identification is mapped from one node (run <italic>n</italic>) to an adjacent node (run <italic>m</italic>), where our choice of guidance tree ensures that the mapping only occurs between chromatographically similar runs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Note 3</xref>). During confidence transfer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1 d</xref>), the identification confidence of all peakgroups in run <italic>m</italic> within the adaptive retention time window (area indicated in gray) is increased; if the confidence score of the best peakgroup passes the user-defined threshold, it gets added to the final result matrix. The approach automatically adopts the retention time window for different parts of the tree, depending on the quality of the pair-wise alignment, thus increasing robustness and decreasing the influence of outlier runs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Note 5, Figs. S12 and S13</xref>).</p></list-item><list-item><label>(c)</label><p id="P9"><italic>Re-quantification</italic>: In the last (optional) step, runs in the guidance tree where no peakgroup passed the confidence filter can be re-visited for re-quantification. In these cases, the software can infer the peak boundaries from the closest neighboring run (node) and quantify the fragment ion signal within those boundaries. These imputed values, however, are <italic>not</italic> substitutes for quantification events, but merely serve as upper bounds of the analyte signal for the run in question (orange circles, step IV).</p></list-item></list>
</p>
      <p id="P10">In order to control the false discovery rate (FDR), our software also offers the option to perform an error-rate correction based on known false signals (“decoy signals”) at the assay level [<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], preventing the accumulation of false positive identifications when analyzing multiple runs. This step can remove individual rows from the data matrix if they do not pass the filter criteria (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S8">Methods</xref>). This is achieved by requiring a more stringent quality threshold for the “seed” identification, similar to the way the Mayu software [<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] operates.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="S4">
      <title>Technical Validation</title>
      <p id="P11">To validate the alignment and FDR control approach implemented in TRIC, we created a manually validated data set of 7,232 chromatograms which were extracted from the <italic>Streptococcus pyogenes</italic> dataset of Röst et al. [<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Note 4</xref>). First, 452 peptides were randomly selected from the data, giving rise to 7,232 chromatograms that were loaded into the Skyline software where the correct elution peak, if present, was identified by visual inspection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). In parallel, we analyzed the same data with TRIC and compared its performance to the current state-of-the-art, that is applying a fixed q-value cutoff in each run individually (“naïve approach”). We found that the TRIC algorithm decreased the error rate substantially compared to the naïve approach, while maintaining high recall for peakgroups across all runs (see FDR-Recall behavior in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2 a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Note 4, Figs. S2–S5</xref>). At the same FDR cutoff, TRIC was able to reduce the error rate by more than 3-fold from 1.8 % to 0.5 % (better than the expected 1 %, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2 a,b</xref>). Running TRIC with non-linear RT alignment substantially outperformed linear alignment strategies as well as the naïve approach (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2 b</xref>).</p>
      <p id="P12">Next, we evaluated the accuracy of the fragment ion peak boundaries reported by TRIC in the “re-quantification” step. From a dataset of eight <italic>S. pyogenes</italic> runs with large chromatographic differences, we removed 506 high-confidence peakgroups to test whether TRIC could recover them. We observed clear non-linearities in the retention times which TRIC was able to correct satisfactorily (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2 c</xref> top <italic>versus</italic> bottom panel). After correction, over 96.6 % of all data fell within ±30 <italic>s</italic> (that is within 2 chromatographic peak widths and less than 1 % of the chromatographic gradient) around the true retention time, compared to 82 % and 47 % for linear or no alignment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2 d</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Note 4, Fig. S8</xref>). Similarly, we found that 80 % of all reported intensity values deviated less than 25 % from the true intensity value (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Note 4, Fig. S8</xref>). We conclude that the alignment and confidence transfer procedure performed by TRIC improves accuracy, reduces the error rate and correctly accounts for large non-linear chromatographic effects.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="S5">
      <title>Application to microbial virulence</title>
      <p id="P13">We then applied the TRIC algorithm to the full 12 SWATH-MS runs described in Röst et al. [<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], comparing cultures of strain SF370 grown in 0 % and 10 % human plasma to study proteomic changes that occur upon vascular invasion of <italic>S. pyogenes</italic>. TRIC substantially lowered the overall number of missing values as well as the number of incomplete rows generated with each newly added run in the label-free, quantitative proteomics data matrix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3 a</xref>). The guidance tree created by the alignment mostly reflected the biological condition (case <italic>versus</italic> control) and not the acquisition order, while chromatographically dissimilar runs were correctly placed at the periphery of the tree, decreasing their influence on the alignment process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3 b</xref>).</p>
      <p id="P14">The final assay-level data matrix (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Note 6, Fig. S14</xref>) was to 87 % populated with quantified peakgroups, compared to 69 % using a “naïve approach” with a fixed q-value cutoff of 0.0015 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3 a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Note 6</xref>). Using the aligned data matrices, we identified 130 <italic>S. pyogenes</italic> proteins that significantly change upon exposure to human plasma (adjusted p &lt;0.01 and effect size larger than 1.5), up by 37 % from 95 proteins without alignment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Tables 2 and 3</xref>). The number of assays quantified in all 12 runs increased by 39 % from 4971 to 6914 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3 c,d</xref>) and substantially fewer peptides were identified in a single run only (down by over 15-fold, compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3 c,d</xref>); TRIC thus added additional quantitation events to singleton peptides (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Note 6, Fig. S15</xref>).</p>
      <p id="P15">We then investigated whether our algorithm was able to improve the identification consistency and error rate control across the whole experiment. We found that TRIC increased identification consistency across all runs, and the cumulative number of peptide identifications shows early saturation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3 e, f</xref>; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Note 6, Figs. S16–S18</xref> for data on assay level and protein level). This is consistent with a complete mapping of the expressed peptides, while a continuing increase in cumulative identifications, as seen without alignment, would be consistent with an accumulation of false positive identifications.</p>

To study protein degradation using targeted proteomics, we performed a pulsed-SILAC experiment on induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) obtained from a healthy human donor, allowing us to measure <italic>in vitro</italic> protein turnover rates in a personalized fashion: After growing the iPSCs in biological duplicates, we replaced the light medium with heavy labeled medium at timepoint zero, harvested samples after 1.5, 4.5 and 13.5 hours and analyzed their proteomes on an AB Sciex 5600 plus TripleTOF system in SWATH mode (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4 b</xref>). Using a matching spectral library, OpenSWATH quantified 5,484 heavy-light pairs mapping to 1,427 proteins (achieving 87 % library coverage for the light precursors).</p>
      <p id="P17">We reasoned that this dataset would allow us to evaluate our algorithm on a highly heterogeneous time-course dataset with interesting biological applications. First, this setup allowed us to directly test whether TRIC over-annotated the resulting data-matrices, i.e. by falsely aligning heavy species at time point zero (before heavy amino acids were added). Furthermore, it provided a straight-forward metric to assess the quality of the data by checking the elution time difference error between corresponding heavy and light peptides (the two channels were treated completely independently for the purpose of this analysis). Third, as heavy lysine and arginine get incorporated into the proteome starting from time point zero, the algorithm would have to accurately quantify very low abundant heavy peptide species, as expected in the early time points–a very challenging task.</p>
      <p id="P18">Applying TRIC increased the number of quantified SILAC pairs by 62 % and 40 % in the time points 1.5 h and 4.5 h, respectively, while only adding few false positive heavy identifications at time point zero (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4 d</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Note 7</xref>). Similarly, the number of quantified proteins detected in fewer than three samples decreased by a factor of 1.9, while the number of quantified proteins identified in five or more samples increased by 59 %. The additional quantification events reported by TRIC increased the error in heavy/light elution only slightly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4 c</xref>). When matched within their respective intensity range, the error distributions are very similar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4 a</xref>, top distribution). Thus, by applying TRIC to a data structure typically encountered in time-course experiments, the number of quantification events increased by up to 60 % without any significant impact on accuracy.</p>
      <p id="P19">We then used the SILAC ratios to compute the relative isotopic abundance (RIA) for each peptide over time and fitted an exponential decay model as described by Pratt et al. [<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S8">Methods</xref>). After filtering and correction for dilution, we obtained the median <italic>k</italic><sub>loss</sub>, the rate of loss of light isotope over time, for 1075 proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5 a</xref>). The computed protein-level turnover rates ranged from less than 10 h to several hundred hours with a median protein turnover time of 39.0 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5 b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 4 and 5</xref>). A gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis on the proteins with the highest and lowest turnover rates using GORILLA [<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] identified 20 significantly (q-value &lt;0.05) enriched terms (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 6</xref>); with an enrichment of 3.44-fold, the “cell adhesion” GO term was significantly (p &lt;10<sup>−7</sup>) enriched in the set of proteins with high turnover (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5 c</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Note 7, Fig. S19</xref>). The enrichment in cell adhesion molecules is both consistent with the hypothesis of a generally faster turnover of these molecules in human cells as well as with the critical involvement of this class of molecules in the regulation of pluripotency (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Note 7</xref>). Thus, TRIC enables the accurate identification of protein turnover rates in human iPSCs in a highly challenging time-series experiment.</p>

    <title>Discussion</title>
    <p id="P20">The availability of accurate, consistent and complete protein quantification data matrices is crucial for systems biology investigations in the field of proteomics. They are the basic currency of data-driven experiments and their accuracy largely determines the success of downstream analyses [<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The TRIC algorithm described here is capable of creating consistent targeted proteomics data matrices by performing retention time alignment of fragment ion chromatograms and subsequent identification and quantification. The algorithm is specifically designed for targeted proteomics data and works directly with chromatographic peaks identified by upstream tools on MS2 level [<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, <xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. By relying on fragment ion-based identification in all runs, TRIC omits the error-prone step of mapping unidentified MS1 features across runs commonly performed in MS1-based alignment software (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Note 2</xref>) [<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>, <xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>, <xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>, <xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Instead, the TRIC algorithm employs a “confidence transfer” step where identification confidence (and not the identification itself) is transferred across runs.</p>
    <p id="P21">The chosen alignment strategy using a globally optimal guidance tree results in minimal alignment error since every alignment step is local and performed between two highly similar runs (as opposed to aligning all runs against a more distant reference run). This makes TRIC scalable to a large number of samples, tolerant to outlier runs and applicable to heterogeneous experimental conditions; which we demonstrate in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Note 5</xref> using a dataset with over two hundred blood plasma samples [<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. On this dataset, our reference-free strategy has better precision-recall characteristics than a reference-based approach and the data indicate direct benefits of the adaptive retention time windows (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Note 5, Figs. S10-S13</xref>).</p>
    <p id="P22">Using a validation dataset of 7,232 manually curated ion chromatograms, we find that our algorithm can reach high recall rates while reducing the error rate by a factor of three or more compared to state-of-the-art per-run analyses. TRIC also compares favorably to untargeted data analysis tools such as DIA-Umpire [<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], which performs orthogonal peptide identification using demultiplexed pseudo-spectra and subsequent RT alignment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Note 4</xref>). TRIC achieves higher recall (85 % <italic>versus</italic> 59 %) at lower error rate (0.3 % <italic>versus</italic> 3.8 %) than DIA-Umpire, thus highlighting the benefits of using targeted fragment ion information for identification and alignment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Note 4, Figs. S6 and S7</xref>). Furthermore, when applying TRIC to large-scale microbial and human targeted proteomics datasets, the number of quantified values consistently increases by 30-60 %, which directly leads to an improvement of statistical power and biological information (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Notes 5, 6 and 7</xref>). When applying TRIC to small and large scale data sets (hundreds of injections), we observe consistent performance and scalability to large sample numbers, thus making SWATH-MS amenable to multi-center studies and, through TRIC, achieve consistent and reproducible research data across labs.</p>

      <title>Decoy based FDR control</title>
      <p id="P32">In a separate step from the actual alignment, our approach allows for the adjustment of the false discovery rate based on a decoy model. This approach can be applied before or after alignment (for convenience, it has been integrated into the TRIC executable). The algorithm applies a q-value threshold based on the score of the best peakgroup per row (since quantification events are likely not independent, this is the most conservative approach). This approach attempts to control the number of decoy <italic>rows</italic> in the output matrix by using the estimate of <italic>r</italic>, the ratio of false positives to decoys as computed by the Storey-Tibshirani method implemented in mProphet and pyProphet [<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. First, this ratio <italic>r</italic> is used to estimate the number of false positive rows <italic>n<sub>fp</sub></italic> in the data matrix based on the number of decoy rows <italic>n<sub>decoy</sub></italic> in the matrix: <italic>n<sub>fp</sub></italic>=<italic>r</italic>⋅<italic>n<sub>decoy</sub></italic>. The q-value threshold is lowered until the desired number of false positives rows (as estimated with the above formula) is reached, for example until <italic>n<sub>fp</sub></italic>/<italic>n<sub>tot</sub></italic> reaches 0.01 (where <italic>n<sub>tot</sub></italic> represents the total number of target rows). Thus, a more stringent score-cutoff is chosen that limits the number of decoy rows in the final data matrix to the user-defined FDR value. In the examples described here, the q-value cutoffs used to achieve a 1 % FDR were 0.0015 for the <italic>S. pyogenes</italic> study, 0.0022 for the pulsed-SILAC study and 2.1×10<sup>−5</sup> for the blood plasma dataset in the supplementary (generally, the more samples are analyzed, the lower the q-value threshold).

      <p id="P36">For the pulsed-SILAC analysis of the iPS cells, TRIC was run as described earlier. The <monospace>–max_fdr_quality</monospace> parameter was lowered to 0.05 (to only include higher quality peak groups) and TRIC calculated a <monospace>m_score</monospace> cutoff of 0.002198 for the whole dataset. The data was filtered by <monospace>m_score</monospace> at the calculated cutoff (0.002198) to produce the data for the “naïve” approach (simple FDR filter) and filtered at 0.025 for the TRIC alignment data. To compare the difference in error between SILAC pairs, only points with an error less than 30 seconds were plotted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref> (148 high quality pairs and 165 aligned pairs were omitted as they fall outside the plotting window). At each time point, the amount of heavy (<italic>I<sub>H</sub></italic>) and light (<italic>I<sub>L</sub></italic>) precursor was extracted and used to calculated the relative isotopic abundance (<italic>RIA<sub>t</sub></italic>): <disp-formula id="FD1"><label>(1)</label><mml:math display="block" id="M1" overflow="scroll"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mi>I</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>I</mml:mi><mml:mi>L</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>I</mml:mi><mml:mi>L</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>I</mml:mi><mml:mi>H</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac><mml:mspace width="3em"/><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mi>I</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>I</mml:mi><mml:mi>L</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo>/</mml:mo><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>I</mml:mi><mml:mi>L</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>I</mml:mi><mml:mi>H</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula> analogous to Pratt et al .[<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] (with heavy and light switched due to our experimental design being reversed). The value of <italic>RIA<sub>t</sub></italic> is time dependent as unlabelled proteins are replaced with heavy-labelled proteins during the course of the experiment. This is due loss due to dilution of the cells as well as loss due to intracellular protein turnover, where the rate of loss can be modelled as an exponential decay process: <disp-formula id="FD2"><label>(2)</label><mml:math display="block" id="M2" overflow="scroll"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mi>I</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mi>I</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:mo>⋅</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mi>k</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msup><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:msup><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>⋅</mml:mo><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula> where <italic>RIA</italic><sub>0</sub> denotes the initial isotopic ratio and <italic>k<sub>loss</sub></italic> the rate of (hourly) loss of unlabelled protein. We assumed <italic>RIA</italic><sub>0</sub>=1 as no heavy isotope was present at <italic>t</italic>=0, thus the value of <italic>RIA<sub>t</sub></italic> will decay exponentially from initially one to zero after infinite time. As discussed in Pratt et al. [<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], these assumptions may reduce measurement error especially at the beginning of the experiment where isotopic ratios are more inaccurate due to the low absolute number of heavy precursor ions. Next, a linear model was fitted per peptide to the logarithmized data to obtain <italic>k<sub>loss</sub></italic> values for all individual peptides. The <italic>k<sub>loss</sub></italic> for each protein was computed as the median of all peptide-level rates. We excluded proteins quantified in a single timepoint only (241 proteins), proteins without a significant correlation (p &lt;0.25 of a linear model) between isotope ratio and time (90 proteins) and increasing isotope ratio over time (21 proteins). After filtering, 1075 proteins were used to compute turnover rates. In order to obtain the protein turnover rate <italic>k<sub>turnover</sub></italic>, we subtracted the dilution ratio D which we obtained by MTS assay from independent experiments on the same cell line at comparable confluence: <disp-formula id="FD3"><label>(3)</label><mml:math display="block" id="M3" overflow="scroll"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>k</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>u</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>v</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>k</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mi>D</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula> Assuming the cells are in steady state and protein synthesis is equal to degradation, the computed <italic>k<sub>turnover</sub></italic> is equal to the degradation rate: <italic>k<sub>turnover</sub></italic>=<italic>k<sub>degradation</sub></italic>. Please note for the specific purpose of illustrating the TRIC alignment in this paper, we treated heavy and light channels separately, which could be further optimized (e.g., by combining heavy and light assays in the library generation step) for future SILAC experiments.</p>
      <p id="P37">For gene ontology (GO) term enrichment, we used the Gene Ontology enrIchment analysis and visualization tool (GORILLA) at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://cbl-gorilla.cs.technion.ac.il">http://cbl-gorilla.cs.technion.ac.il</ext-link> as described in Eden et al. [<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. We selected the proteins with the highest and lowest turnover rates (10 % and 25 % quantiles) and used all identified proteins as background in GORILLA. We identified 20 significantly (q-value &lt;0.05) enriched GO terms. Most terms enriched for proteins with high turnover (fast degradation) were related to cell signaling, radiation and light response, cell-cell adhesion, extracellular matrix and locomotion (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 6</xref>).</p>

      <title>TRIC: Alignment algorithm for targeted proteomics data.</title>
      <p>(<bold>a</bold>) In a targeted proteomics experiment, each run is typically analyzed individually, giving rise to multiple putative peak groups per run that may not be directly mappable due to chromatographic shifts. (<bold>b</bold>) The TRIC algorithm selects a set of high-confidence “anchor points” (peptides) for pairwise non-linear alignment and chromatographic distance estimation. (<bold>c</bold>) Based on the chromatographic distance, an optimal guidance tree (I) is computed (nodes are runs, edges are pairwise alignments). Next (II), the algorithm uses a starting point (1) to transfer identification confidence to nearby runs (iterations 2 and 3) using the guidance tree (III). In an optional last step (IV), runs without suitable peakgroups are re-visited to perform optional noise re-quantification (integration of all fragment ion signal at the aligned position is integrated; orange circles). (<bold>d</bold>) The confidence transfer step uses a starting peakgroup (top run) to select a narrow region in a neighboring run (gray region in second run) from which a peak gets selected. This procedure is repeated across all runs to identify the correct peak or establish peak boundaries in runs without any analyte signal (bottom run). In a real application, the alignment order may not be linear but follow the guidance tree.</p>

      <title>Identification and alignment accuracy of TRIC on manually annotated data.</title>
      <p>We used a set of over 7,000 manually validated peakgroups to validate the TRIC algorithm. (<bold>a</bold>) FDR-Recall plot displaying recall rate <italic>versus</italic> the false discovery rate allows evaluation of the performance of TRIC compared to the naïve approach of using a fixed q-value cutoff applied to each run individually. As mis-classified peaks cannot be recovered even at high score cutoffs, a recall of 100 % cannot be reached. (<bold>b</bold>) Error rates at reported FDR cutoffs of 1 % for the naïve approach and TRIC without RT alignment (None), linear alignment (Linear) and non-linear k-nearest neighbor alignment (LLD). (<bold>c</bold>) The error of reported retention times are plotted without (top) and with (bottom) non-linear alignment on a sample run. (<bold>d</bold>) The cumulative fraction of peaks having less than a given error in retention time is plotted. TRIC with k-nearest neighbor smoothing (LLD) achieves high peak counts at low RT errors and outperforms linear or no alignment.</p>

      <title>Analysis of a microbial dataset investigating <italic>S. pyogenes</italic> virulence.</title>
      <p>A dataset of 12 runs of <italic>S. pyogenes</italic> exposed to human plasma was analyzed with TRIC. (<bold>a</bold>) The data matrix occupancy is higher after alignment with TRIC (fewer missing values are observed). (<bold>b</bold>) The computed guidance tree captures orthogonal information to injection order (root mean square deviation between runs is indicated for each edge). Control samples are in blue and plasma-exposed samples are in red (note that the tree is substantially different from injection order as samples were shot in three batches: R1, R2 and R3). (<bold>c</bold>) Number of precursors appearing in a specific number of runs before (left; N=95 685) and after (right; N=120 348) running TRIC; fully aligned precursors increased by 39 % while precursors found in only a single run decreased by 93.7 %. (<bold>d</bold>) The cumulative number of the number of peptides quantified using a fixed 0.01 q-value cutoff without alignment (left) and after applying TRIC and a minimal q-value cutoff of 0.0015 (right). While TRIC decreased the variance of the number of identifications across runs, the cumulative number of peptides also saturates more quickly indicating less accumulation of false positive identifications.</p>

      <title>Pulsed-SILAC experiment performed on human iPSCs.</title>
      <p>A human iPS cell line was exposed to a pulse of heavy amino acids and sampled at four time points in duplicates (see Panel <bold>b</bold>). (<bold>a</bold>) The RT difference between the light and heavy signal as a function of the intensity. Aligned values reported by TRIC (in red) have lower intensity and higher RT error (distribution on top only displays values below 10<sup>4</sup> in intensity) (<bold>c</bold>) Standard deviation of the RT difference between heavy and light pairs with and without TRIC alignment. For the analysis without alignment, a simple FDR cutoff was applied (naïve approach). Alignment increases the number of quantified SILAC pairs at the cost of slightly higher variance. Pairs from both replicates are aggregated. No heavy-light pairs are expected at <italic>t</italic>=0 as heavy amino acids were added afterwards. (<bold>d</bold>) The number of isotopic SILAC pairs quantified per sample increases through the TRIC alignment, especially for the earlier time points with little heavy isotope signal. For each timepoint, average values across two replicates are shown with standard deviation.</p>
