    <abstract>
      <p>Sequence logos have been widely used as graphical representations of conserved nucleic acid and protein motifs. Due to the complexity of the amino acid (AA) alphabet, rich post-translational modification, and diverse subcellular localization of proteins, few versatile tools are available for effective identification and visualization of protein motifs. In addition, various reduced AA alphabets based on physicochemical, structural, or functional properties have been valuable in the study of protein alignment, folding, structure prediction, and evolution. However, there is lack of tools for applying reduced AA alphabets to the identification and visualization of statistically significant motifs. To fill this gap, we developed an R/Bioconductor package dagLogo, which has several advantages over existing tools. First, dagLogo allows various formats for input sets and provides comprehensive options to build optimal background models. It implements different reduced AA alphabets to group AAs of similar properties. Furthermore, dagLogo provides statistical and visual solutions for differential AA (or AA group) usage analysis of both large and small data sets. Case studies showed that dagLogo can better identify and visualize conserved protein sequence patterns from different types of inputs and can potentially reveal the biological patterns that could be missed by other logo generators.</p>

    <title>Introduction</title>
    <p>Since their first introduction in 1990, sequence logos have been widely used to visualize conserved patterns among large sets of nucleic acid and peptide sequences [<xref rid="pone.0242030.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0242030.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Dozens of sequence logo generators with different functionalities and performances have been developed; these generators require various types of inputs and background models, and use different algorithms and graphical representations [<xref rid="pone.0242030.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0242030.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0242030.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0242030.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. A comprehensive list of these tools, along with their features, is available in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0242030.s004">S1 Table</xref>. Almost all tools provide no alignment utilities but require multiple sequence alignments in various formats, or position weight/frequency matrices as inputs. A majority of these tools are also based on information theory without statistical significance tests [<xref rid="pone.0242030.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0242030.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. More than two thirds of the existing tools cannot effectively display both over- and under-represented residues (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0242030.s004">S1 Table</xref>), even though the information on under-represented residues may be as valuable as that of over-represented residues [<xref rid="pone.0242030.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0242030.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p>
    <p>It is known that both background models and sizes of input sets affect the identification and visualization of sequence patterns [<xref rid="pone.0242030.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0242030.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0242030.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0242030.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. However, a majority of logo generators do not allow users to choose a dataset-specific background model. For those that do allow it, the only option for a majority of them is a background model based on global residue frequencies or GC%, which can be specified by users, calculated from input sequences, or derived from a species-specific whole genome or proteome (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0242030.s004">S1 Table</xref>). These simple background models usually work well for identifying and visualizing nucleic acid patterns due to the simple nucleotide alphabet and limited modifications of nucleic acids, especially DNA. However, in many cases, they may not be optimal for protein pattern discovery because of the complexity of the amino acid (AA) alphabet, rich post-translational modification of proteins, diverse subcellular localization, cell or tissue type-specific expression profiles, and experimental protocol-specific biases. To our knowledge, only Two Sample Logo [<xref rid="pone.0242030.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], iceLogo [<xref rid="pone.0242030.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0242030.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], pLogo [<xref rid="pone.0242030.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], kpLogo [<xref rid="pone.0242030.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], and PTM-Logo [<xref rid="pone.0242030.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] offer some advanced options of background models. Among them, iceLogo offers the most choices, i.e., i) species-specific, proteome-wide AA frequencies as the background; ii) position-specific AA frequencies as the background; and iii) an experimental protocol bias-aware background.</p>
    <p>To date, there are no tools that have the functionalities to group AAs based on their physicochemical or other properties and test the differential usage of AA groups. Historically, twenty naturally occurring AAs have been classified into two to 19 groups based on some measures of their relative similarity in physicochemical, structural, and functional properties; this has resulted in a variety of reduced (degenerate or simplified) alphabets [<xref rid="pone.0242030.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0242030.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. With reduced alphabets, several AAs of a similar property are lumped together and represented by one letter. Reduced AA alphabets have been shown to be valuable for protein pattern discovery [<xref rid="pone.0242030.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0242030.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] and in the study of protein alignment, folding, structure prediction, and evolution [<xref rid="pone.0242030.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0242030.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0242030.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. For example, serine (Ser) and threonine (Thr) are highly interchangeable as phosphorylation sites of Ser/Thr kinase substrates [<xref rid="pone.0242030.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], and thus the two AAs can be binned into the same degenerate group to reduce the complexity of resulting logos showing conserved patterns of Ser/Thr kinase (STK) substrates. Thus, unsurprisingly, coloring AA residues based on their similarity of physicochemical properties has been a general practice of many logo generators long before [<xref rid="pone.0242030.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0242030.s004">S1 Table</xref>). However, applying reduced AA alphabets to motif identification and visualization had rarely been practiced until recent [<xref rid="pone.0242030.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0242030.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. This limitation is more obvious for sequence patterns of proteins than sequence patterns of nucleic acids because protein sequences have a greater alphabet complexity and variability of the occurrences of individual residues. Even though RaacLogo [<xref rid="pone.0242030.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] and logoJS [<xref rid="pone.0242030.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] allow degenerate representations of reduced AA alphabets [<xref rid="pone.0242030.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0242030.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], both were based on information theory without statistical significance tests, and most importantly, neither offers alternative background models (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0242030.s004">S1 Table</xref>).</p>
    <p>Taken together, none of the existing tools has implemented all the following functionalities: allowing flexible formats for input sets, providing comprehensive options to build optimal background models, and implementing reduced AA alphabets to group AAs of similar properties. To fill this gap, we have developed an open source R/Bioconductor package dagLogo for identifying and visualizing conserved peptide patterns with the probability theory. In addition to having the functionality to generate various background models, dagLogo also accepts aligned subsequences or unaligned subsequences of different lengths as input, and it visualizes significantly over- and under-represented AA residues or AA residue groups in experimental context-aware ways. We demonstrate here that dagLogo can better identify and visualize conserved patterns hidden in peptide sequences regardless of length and alignment status, and can potentially reveal patterns that could be missed by other logo generators.</p>

      <title>Workflow of dagLogo analyses</title>
      <p>A flowchart for a typical dagLogo-based analysis is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0242030.g001">Fig 1</xref>. A dagLogo analysis can start with creating a <italic>Proteome</italic> object, which stores protein identifiers (IDs), protein sequences, species information, and the source of sequences. One can prepare the <italic>Proteome</italic> object with the <italic>prepareProtome</italic> function by providing a fasta file containing the proteome sequences of the species. Alternatively, the user can specify the species’ scientific name or NCBI taxonomy ID with the same function, which will automatically download the species-specific proteome data from the UniProt database.</p>

        <caption>
          <title>dagLogo workflow.</title>
          <p>When whole proteome sequences in the fasta format are not available for a species, the NCBI taxonomy ID or scientific name of the species is needed to query the UniProt database to obtain the desired fasta file (1) and to build a Proteome object using the prepareProteomeByFTP or prepareProteomeByUniprotws function. These two functions are wrapped into the prepareProteome function. Otherwise, an existing fasta file (2) is directly used to build a Proteome object with the prepareProteome function. A dagPeptides object for an input set can be constructed in three ways with unaligned (i and ii) subsequences in different lengths or aligned (iii) subsequences: i) When a pre-aligned sequence set is not available, Entrez gene IDs or UniProt SwissProt protein IDs, as well as anchoring AAs (such as “K” for Lys) or anchoring AA position information of the input set, can be used to obtain sequences from the species-specific Biomart database for creating a dagPeptides object using the fetchSequence function. An anchoring AA within a peptide sequence is represented by a lowercase single-letter symbol or an uppercase single-letter symbol followed by an asterisk, e.g., the anchoring AA Lys in “ASTRSkSSTD” or “ASTRSK*SSTD”. Meanwhile, an anchoring AA position is represented as a string consisting of the anchoring AA followed by the AA’s position, such as “K123” for the 123th residue ─ Lys (3); ii) With the same input information as the previous method, a dagPeptides object can be built from the species-specific Proteome object rather than the Biomart database using the fetchSequence function (4); iii) If the peptide sequences of the input set have already been aligned, the dagPeptides object can be built from the species-specific Proteome object using the formatSequence function. Twelve different background models for Fisher’s exact test or Z-test can be built from the Proteome object using the buildBackground function with different parameter settings (6). A differential AA or AA group usage (DAU) analysis for the input set (the dagPetides object) can be performed using the testDAU function, with the appropriate background model represented by a backgroundModel object). Heatmaps and logos generated by the functions dagHeatmap and dagLogo, respectively, can be used to visualize the results of the DAU analysis.</p>
        </caption>
        <graphic xlink:href="pone.0242030.g001"/>
      </fig>
      <p>Next, a <italic>dagPeptides</italic> object representing a formatted input set can be created in several ways. For pre-aligned input subsequences, one can use the <italic>formatSequence</italic> function with the specified <italic>proteome</italic> object, as well as upstream and downstream offsets relative to the anchoring positions of the input subsequences. If pre-aligned input subsequences are unavailable, the <italic>dagPeptides</italic> object can be created by using the <italic>fetchSequence</italic> function in four different ways by providing IDs of protein sequences from which input subsequences originate, the options to access full-length protein sequences from an Ensembl Biomart database or a <italic>proteome</italic> object, the anchoring AA(s) and the anchoring AA’s positions. Prior to fetching sequences, input data can be cleaned up with the <italic>cleanPeptides</italic> function, which can remove peptides without anchoring AAs or duplicated peptides, and can generate an individual entry for each anchoring AA if an original entry contains multiple anchoring AAs.</p>
      <p>Like iceLogo, dagLogo requires a background model, which is derived from background subsequences of the same length as those in the input set, to properly calculate the probability of the number of occurrences of given AAs at each position in the input set. Choosing an appropriate background model is therefore of great importance, and the background set should suit the actual technical and biological contexts. Twelve background models can be generated for <italic>Z</italic>-test or Fisher’s exact test (see below) using the <italic>buildBackgroundModel</italic> function by specifying i) the proteome-level background-generating space as the whole proteome (“WholeProteome”), proteins corresponding to the input set (“InputSet”), or the whole proteome excluding those proteins in “InputSet” (“NonInputSet”); ii) the protein-level background-generating space as N-termini only, <italic>C</italic>-termini only, or anywhere of full-length proteins; iii) anchoring AAs or not when the protein-level background-generating space is not restricted to protein termini. A proper background model should be considered to meet experimental and analytical needs [<xref rid="pone.0242030.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. UniProt, Biomart, and/or anchored AAs are leveraged to fetch the peptide sequences, which have characteristics or constraints similar to those of the experimental data, to build a specific background model. For example, if an experiment only focuses on the mitochondrial proteome, then an appropriate background model would be built from the entire or a subset of the mitochondrial proteome that is anchored to the AA(s) of interest. If the experiment is to identify peptides with acetylated lysine, then an appropriate background model would be derived from all peptide fragments containing anchoring lysine.</p>
      <p>Once the type of background model to build is decided, a Fisher’s exact test or <italic>Z</italic>-test approximation can be applied to identify significantly enriched/depleted AAs or AA groups. For Fisher’s exact test, a single background set with all available background subsequences will be generated. If both the input set’s size and the number of subsequences for the background set are large enough, <italic>Z</italic>-test approximation may be preferred, as it can speed up the tests of differential AA or AA group usage (DAU). To do so, bootstrapping is used to generate multiple background sets that conform to the background-generating rules, with each background set consisting of the same number of equal-length sequences as those in the input set.

Herein P15 to P1 are residues at positions 15 to 1 N-terminal to the cutting sites, while P1’ to P15’ are residues at position 1 to 15 <italic>C</italic>-terminal to the cutting sites. The letter X was used to pad the peptide sequences when the fetched sequence’s length was shorter than 30. These 416 subsequences were used as the input set to build a dagPeptides object. The background set consisted of the 300 subsets of 416 subsequences of 30 AA residues randomly sampled from the UniProt human reference proteome (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.uniprot.org/proteomes/UP000005640">https://www.uniprot.org/proteomes/UP000005640</ext-link>).</p>

The N-terminal Met residue was removed from each protein sequence in the entire proteome for subsequent analysis for two reasons: i) the first Met residue is cleaved co-translationally <italic>in vivo</italic> if the next residue is glycine, alanine, serine, threonine, cysteine, proline, or valine [<xref rid="pone.0242030.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]; ii) all eukaryotic NatA does not acetylate a peptide or protein with a Met N-terminus [<xref rid="pone.0242030.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0242030.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. The data used for mining the substrate sequence specificity of yeast NatA was extracted from the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0242030.s006">S3 Table</xref> with the following modifications [<xref rid="pone.0242030.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Obsolete IDs of six substrates (P04451, P26781, P26782, P35271, P40213, and P53030) were updated to the current UniProt Swiss-Prot IDs. Misinformation of the mature N-terminal 5-AA peptide sequences (column name: “mature_N_term_P5”) of 11 substrates (Q12074, P02829, P00360, P38720, P04076, P15019, P10591, Q03048, P53880, P38088, and P35187) were corrected based on the yeast reference proteome.

      <title>Case study 1: dagLogo successfully identifies the substrate sequence specificity of granzyme B at both individual AA and physicochemical property levels</title>
      <p>Granzyme B (GRB) is an apoptotic serine protease found in secretory granules of cytotoxic T lymphocytes and natural killer cells [<xref rid="pone.0242030.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0242030.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. Early <italic>in vitro</italic> screening studies revealed that GRB preferentially cleaves the peptide bonds immediately proceeded by aspartate residues at P1 positions [<xref rid="pone.0242030.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>], and determinants of its substrate specificity span from residues at P4 to P2’ (for notation Px and Px’, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0242030.g002">Fig 2</xref>) [<xref rid="pone.0242030.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. Harris <italic>et al</italic>. identified an optimal consensus substrate of GRB with (I/V)-(E/Q/M)-X-(DꜜX)-G at positions P4 to P2’, where X is any AA residue and the peptide bond between D and X is the GRB cleavage site [<xref rid="pone.0242030.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. Later, an <italic>in vivo</italic> study identified the proteome-wide substrates for the human as well as the mouse GRB [<xref rid="pone.0242030.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>], which not only confirmed the <italic>in vitro</italic> findings about the determinants of GRB substrate specificity but also revealed that more residues from P3’ to P9’ are related to substrate specificities and cutting efficiency [<xref rid="pone.0242030.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Van Damme <italic>et al</italic>. further revealed the physicochemical property constraints in the substrate sequence pattern in terms of charge, hydrophobicity, and side chain size of residues [<xref rid="pone.0242030.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. GRB prefers negatively charged AAs at P3 and P2’-P8’, and slightly dislikes positively charged AAs around the cleavage site. They also found that AAs at P4 tend to be hydrophobic, followed by less hydrophobic AA at P3. Additionally, AAs at positions P3, P2, and P1’ flanking the cleavage site tend to be small residues [<xref rid="pone.0242030.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. These observations are consistent with the molecular structure of the GRB substrate binding pocket [<xref rid="pone.0242030.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0242030.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>].</p>

The significance level is set as 0.05 for DAU tests. (A) <italic>Z</italic>-scores of DAU tests for each residue at each pattern position are shown in the heatmap. (B, C, E, and G) Over- and under-represented AA residues with significant DAU at each pattern position are shown as sequence logos. Individual AA residues are colored differently and according to their hydrophobicity indices, pI indices, or sizes, respectively. (D, F, and H) AA residues are grouped and collapsed based on their hydrophobicity indices, charge status under physiological conditions, and sizes, respectively. Over- and under-represented AA residue groups with significant DAU at each pattern position are shown as degenerate logos. AA residue groups are colored according to their hydrophobicity indices: (D) hydrophobic AAs = {W, F, Y, L, I, V, M, C}, neutral AAs = {H, A, T, P, G, N, A, S}, and hydrophilic AAs = {R, K, D, E}; their charge status under physiological conditions: (F) positively charged AAs = {H, K, R}, neutral AAs = {A, C, F, G, I, L, M, N, P, Q, S, T, V, W, Y}, and negatively charged AAs = {D, E}; or sizes: (H) tiny = {G, S, A}, small = {D, N, C, E, H}, medium = {R, Q, K, T}, large = {M, P, Y, F}, and gigantic = {I, L, V, W}. Van Damme <italic>et al</italic>. proposed that the weak arginine conservation from P11’ to P15’ is probably due to technical artifacts caused by the N-terminal COFRADIC sorting procedure [<xref rid="pone.0242030.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>].</p>

      <p>We reanalyzed the proteome-wide substrate data of the human GRB [<xref rid="pone.0242030.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>] using our dagLogo package and compared the resulting logo with logos generated by other common tools with the same input and background sets of subsequences, wherever possible. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0242030.s001">S1 Fig</xref> displays the sequence patterns among the human GRB substrates revealed by dagLogo, iceLogo, pLogo, and WebLogo. Although all logo generators successfully identified the major determinant of substrate specificity, i.e., enriched Asp in P1, both pLogo and WebLogo failed to reveal the important determinants flanking P1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0242030.s001">S1C and S1D Fig</xref>). pLogo calculates the log odds, log (<italic>p</italic>/(1−<italic>p</italic>)), where <italic>p</italic> is the binomial probability of an AA residue occurring at a given position. pLogo emphasizes the big differences but downplays the minor differences. This may explain why residues flanking P1, which contributes less to substrate specificity, are not as clearly represented. WebLogo does not allow users to provide a background model. As a result, a uniform background frequency of 20 AA residues was used as the background model by default. In addition, it can only display positively scored residues based on the information theory. Logos generated by dagLogo (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0242030.s001">S1A Fig</xref>) and iceLogo (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0242030.s001">S1B Fig</xref>) are very similar, which clearly displays both the major and minor determinants of the substrate specificity. The subtle differences might be because the two tools calculate the variances differently (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec014">Discussion</xref>).</p>
      <p>Next, we performed more analyses of the human GRB substrate specificity, using dagLogo to display other important features of our package. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0242030.g002">Fig 2A</xref> displays the differential usage of each AA residue from P15 to P15’ through a heatmap.

By contrast, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0242030.g002">Fig 2D, 2F and 2H</xref> show significant differential usages of AA groups using degenerate logos, where AAs sharing a similar physicochemical property are grouped using the reduced AA alphabets and are tested for differential usage. dagLogo-based analyses, as displayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0242030.g002">Fig 2</xref>, recapitulated the previous <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> findings. These findings not only confirm the properties of GRB substrate specificity in terms of sequence preferences at individual AA level, but also illuminate the restrictions in physical properties like hydrophobicity, charge, and sizes of residues [<xref rid="pone.0242030.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0242030.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0242030.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>].</p>

      <title>Case study 2: dagLogo successfully differentiates substrate specificities of three human Ser/Thr protein kinases</title>
      <p>One of the most common, important, and dynamically reversible post-translation modifications is phosphorylation, which is controlled by various protein kinases and phosphatases [<xref rid="pone.0242030.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0242030.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. Protein kinases employ combinatorial mechanisms to define their substrate specificities, including substrate peptide specificity and substrate recruitment specificity [<xref rid="pone.0242030.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0242030.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. Substrate motifs of protein kinases have been identified over the past 70 years, though different studies have resulted in more or less different forms of motifs [<xref rid="pone.0242030.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0242030.ref075" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>] (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.phosphosite.org/">https://www.phosphosite.org</ext-link>). According to the AA residues phosphorylated by protein kinases, eukaryotic kinases are classified into Ser/Thr kinases (STKs), Tyr kinases, and dual-specificity kinases, which can phosphorylate Ser, Thr, and Tyr residues. At least 125 of the 568 human protein kinases are STKs [<xref rid="pone.0242030.ref076" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0242030.ref077" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>], and more than 86% of phosphorylated residues are Ser, followed by 11.8% being Thr and 1.8% being Tyr in the human HeLa cells [<xref rid="pone.0242030.ref078" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>].</p>
      <p>PKACA (cAMP-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit alpha) and PKCA (protein kinase C alpha) are members of the AGC protein kinase superfamily. The consensus substrate motif of PKACA is (R/K)(R/K)X(S*/T*), where S*/T* is the phosphorylated Ser or Thr [<xref rid="pone.0242030.ref079" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0242030.ref080" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>] (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.phosphosite.org/">https://www.phosphosite.org</ext-link>). It prefers hydrophobic AAs at position +1 and basic AAs at positions -7 to -2. PKCA, like other PKC family members, preferentially phosphorylate peptides with hydrophobic AAs at position +1. It also favors substrates with basic residues at positions -7 to -1, and +2 to +4 [<xref rid="pone.0242030.ref081" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>]. An established consensus substrate motif for PKCA is (R/K)(R/K)X(S*/T*)X(R/K) [<xref rid="pone.0242030.ref081" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>].</p>
      <p>In contrast to most STKs whose substrate phosphorylation sites are preferentially flanked by basic AA residues, sequences flanking the canonical substrate phosphorylation sites of the protein kinase CK2A1 (catalytic subunit of a constitutively active serine/threonine-protein kinase, Casein Kinase 2 (CK2)) are preferentially occupied by acidic residues [<xref rid="pone.0242030.ref082" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0242030.ref083" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>]. A consensus CK2 substrate motif is (S*/T*)(D/E)X(E/D) [<xref rid="pone.0242030.ref083" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0242030.ref085" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>]. Acidic residues at positions +1 and +3 are the most important specificity determinants, but additional acidic residues at positions from -2 to +7 and even further contribute to substrate specificity too. Basic and bulky hydrophobic residues at these positions are depleted [<xref rid="pone.0242030.ref082" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0242030.ref083" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>]. Besides local sequence determinants, the overall protein conformation and accessibility of candidate substrate can affect phosphorylation efficiency of the substrates by CK2 [<xref rid="pone.0242030.ref082" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>]. Additionally, CK2 can use phosphoserine residues as consensus specificity determinants to phosphorylate non-canonical substrates via hierarchical phosphorylation [<xref rid="pone.0242030.ref086" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>].</p>
      <p>Using a background set which consisted of randomly sampled peptide sequences of 15 AA residues from the human proteome we reanalyzed the substrate phosphorylation motifs of three human STKs—PKACA, PKCA, and CK2A1—using dagLogo. The substrate sequence patterns identified for PKACA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0242030.g003">Fig 3A</xref>), PKCA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0242030.g003">Fig 3B</xref>), and CK2A1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0242030.g003">Fig 3C</xref>) by dagLogo are largely consistent with those curated by the PhosphoSitePlus database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.phosphosite.org/">https://www.phosphosite.org</ext-link>). Interestingly, we detected significant frequencies of serine residues flanking the phosphorylation sites of CK2A1, where acidic residues are usually preferred. This is consistent with the hierarchical phosphorylation property of CK2 [<xref rid="pone.0242030.ref086" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>]. The substrate motif of PKACA is much more similar to that of PKCA than to that of CK2A1.</p>

      <p>Next, we compared the substrate preferences of the three human STKs using all known substrates curated by the PhosphoSitePlus database, with the subsequences of each other’s substrates as background sets. The differential phosphorylation site analyses further indicated that the substrate motif of PKACA is much more similar to that of PKCA than to that of CK2A1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0242030.g003">Fig 3</xref>). PKCA prefers basic residues at the <italic>C</italic>-terminal of the phosphorylation sites more than PKACA does, while PKACA prefers basic residues at positions -2 and -3 more than PKAC does, which is evident in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0242030.g003">Fig 3D</xref>. Degenerate logos displaying differential usage of AA residues grouped by charge under physiological conditions further highlight the differential substrate preferences and similarities of the three STKs in terms of charge of residues flanking phosphorylation sites (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0242030.s002">S2 Fig</xref>). The frequencies of Thr and Ser residues at the phosphorylation sites (position 0) of PKCA and PKACA substrates are significantly different (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0242030.g003">Fig 3D</xref>).

      <title>Case study 3: dagLogo confirms substrate specificity of the yeast N-terminal acetyltransferase</title>
      <p>N-terminal acetylation of proteins by N-terminal acetyltransferases (Nat) is evolutionarily conserved from bacteria to humans [<xref rid="pone.0242030.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0242030.ref087" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0242030.ref089" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>]. More than 80% of human proteins and more than 50% of yeast proteins are N-terminal acetylated [<xref rid="pone.0242030.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0242030.ref090" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>]. Different N-terminal acetyltransferases (NatA to NatG) have different substrate preferences depending on the N-terminal AA residue context, especially the first and second residues, of mature proteins [<xref rid="pone.0242030.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0242030.ref088" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>]. About 57% and 84% of N-terminal acetylation of yeast and human proteins are mediated by NatA [<xref rid="pone.0242030.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>], which preferentially acetylates proteins with Ser-, Ala-, Thr-, Val- or Gly- N-termini [<xref rid="pone.0242030.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0242030.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>].</p>
      <p>We reanalyzed the yeast NatA substrate specificity using dagLogo with the first 25 residues of yeast NatA substrate as the input set and the first 25 N-terminal residues of yeast proteins excluding the NatA substrates as the background set. Fisher’s exact test was performed to determine the significantly differential usage of AAs in the yeast NatA substrate motif. Our analysis demonstrated that the yeast NatA preferentially acetylates proteins with Ser, followed by Ala, as the first residue at the mature N-termini, which is consistent with previous studies [<xref rid="pone.0242030.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0242030.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0242030.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0242030.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0242030.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). However, the original publications [<xref rid="pone.0242030.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0242030.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>] also reported that proteins with mature N-termini starting with Thr, Val, or Gly residue are preferred by NatA, although no statistical test was performed. In contrast, our analysis does not support such findings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0242030.g004">Fig 4A</xref>), which is consistent with a reanalysis of the data with a proper background model using iceLogo [<xref rid="pone.0242030.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Besides the first residues, the residues at positions 2 to 25 also seem to be involved in determining substrate specificity. Glutamine (Q) residues are preferred at multiple positions of the N-terminal sequences. By grouping AAs based on charge, we also found that yeast NatA strongly prefers uncharged AA residues at position 1 and slightly prefers negatively charged residues at positions 2, 3, 6, 10, 11, 17, 20, and 23, but prefers positively charge residues at position 12 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0242030.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). Positively charged residues are disliked at positions 1 to 6, and uncharged residues are disfavored at positions 11 and 12 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0242030.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). When grouping AAs based on size, we observed that yeast NatA strongly prefers tiny residues as the starting AA. In addition, tiny to medium size AAs are favored, and large to gigantic residues are disliked at multiple positions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0242030.g004">Fig 4C</xref>).</p>

(A) Over- and under-represented AA residues with significant DAU at each pattern position are shown as sequence logos. Individual AA residues are colored differently. (B and C) AA residues in both the input and background sets are grouped, collapsed, and represented by single letters based on their charge status under physiological conditions and sizes, respectively. Positively charged AAs = {H, K, R}, neutral AAs = {A, C, F, G, I, L, M, N, P, Q, S, T, V, W, Y}, and negatively charged AAs = {D, E}. Tiny = {G, S, A}, small = {D, N, C, E, H}, medium = {R, Q, K, T}, large = {M, P, Y, F}, and gigantic = {I, L, V, W}. Fisher’s exact test was performed with a significance level of 0.05. Over- and under-represented AA residue groups with significant DAU at each pattern position are shown as sequence logos. AA residue groups are colored according to their charge status (B) and sizes (C). (D and E) Background models for Fisher’s exact test with a significance level of 0.05 were built from the first 25 N-terminal residues of all yeast proteins and from randomly sampled subsequences of 25 AA residues from the yeast reference proteome, respectively.</p>

      <p>Next, we investigated how different background models affect the results of differential AA usage analysis of the yeast NatA substrate motifs. Background models were built using a background set of the first 25 N-terminal residues of all yeast proteins and a background set of randomly sampled subsequences of 25 AA residues from the yeast reference proteome separately. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0242030.g004">Fig 4D and 4E</xref> show differential AA usage for NatA substrate motifs given the two different background models. It is evident that the identities and percentages of differential usage of some AAs at multiple positions are different when different background models were adopted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0242030.g004">Fig 4D and 4E</xref> versus <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0242030.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). This result underscores the importance of choosing the correct background model based on the study objectives and the advantage of dagLogo.</p>

      <title>Comparison of statistical test methods for differential AA usage analyses</title>
      <p>We compared how different statistical test methods, <italic>Z</italic>-test and Fisher’s exact test, affect differential AA usage analysis results. For this purpose, we analyzed the human GRB substrate data [<xref rid="pone.0242030.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>] and the yeast NatA substrate data [<xref rid="pone.0242030.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>] to represent both ends of the proteome size spectrum with the human proteome (74,823 proteins) as a large and the yeast proteome (6,049 proteins) as a small proteome. Although Fisher’s exact test runs slower than z-test for the larger proteome, results based on both methods are largely similar to each other regardless of proteome size (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0242030.s003">S3 Fig</xref>). However, the identities and percentage of differential usage of some AAs are slightly different (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0242030.s003">S3 Fig</xref>).</p>

    <title>Discussion</title>
    <p>To facilitate the discovery of conserved patterns from increasingly accumulated proteomic data, we developed the dagLogo package, which have been well downloaded and cited by researchers [<xref rid="pone.0242030.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0242030.ref080" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0242030.ref091" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0242030.ref092" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>]. Though it does not provide a graphic user interface as other web applications for sequence logo generators (See <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0242030.s004">S1 Table</xref>), our package helps to identify and visualize differentially used AA residues or AA residue groups in given protein sequences, improving and extending the sophisticated logo generator iceLogo. First, dagLogo corrects the way of calculating standard deviation of position-specific AA frequencies implemented by iceLogo. In iceLogo, standard deviation of <inline-formula id="pone.0242030.e010"><alternatives><graphic xlink:href="pone.0242030.e010.jpg" id="pone.0242030.e010g" mimetype="image" position="anchor" orientation="portrait"/><mml:math id="M10"><mml:mover accent="true"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>p</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>^</mml:mo></mml:mover></mml:math></alternatives></inline-formula> is not correctly computed; it should be <inline-formula id="pone.0242030.e011"><alternatives><graphic xlink:href="pone.0242030.e011.jpg" id="pone.0242030.e011g" mimetype="image" position="anchor" orientation="portrait"/><mml:math id="M11"><mml:msqrt><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mover accent="true"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>p</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>^</mml:mo></mml:mover><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mover accent="true"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>p</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>^</mml:mo></mml:mover><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo>/</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>N</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:msqrt></mml:math></alternatives></inline-formula> instead of <inline-formula id="pone.0242030.e012"><alternatives><graphic xlink:href="pone.0242030.e012.jpg" id="pone.0242030.e012g" mimetype="image" position="anchor" orientation="portrait"/><mml:math id="M12"><mml:msqrt><mml:mover accent="true"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>p</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>^</mml:mo></mml:mover><mml:mo>/</mml:mo><mml:mi>N</mml:mi></mml:msqrt></mml:math></alternatives></inline-formula>, where <inline-formula id="pone.0242030.e013"><alternatives><graphic xlink:href="pone.0242030.e013.jpg" id="pone.0242030.e013g" mimetype="image" position="anchor" orientation="portrait"/><mml:math id="M13"><mml:mover accent="true"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>p</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>^</mml:mo></mml:mover></mml:math></alternatives></inline-formula> is the sample estimate of the proportion of a given AA residue at a given pattern position, and <italic>N</italic> is the total number of sequences in a background set [<xref rid="pone.0242030.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Second, dagLogo implements both <italic>Z</italic>-test and Fisher’s exact test, whereas iceLogo only implements <italic>Z</italic>-test. Fisher’s exact test computes the exact p-value, while Z-test uses a normal distribution as an approximation of a binomial distribution, which becomes problematic when the background sets or input sets are small [<xref rid="pone.0242030.ref093" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>]. When the background sets are large, such as the whole human proteome, both tests produce very similar results, though the Z-test-based method is faster than the Fisher’s exact test-based one. However, our analysis also shows that the identities and percentages of differential usage of some AAs can be different (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0242030.s003">S3 Fig</xref>).</p>
    <p>Unlike most logo generators, our tool allows multiple different types of inputs. These flexible options can easily eliminate users’ efforts to prepare aligned subsequences. Peptide sequences identified by proteomic assays can be directly used as input for pattern discovery. As far as we know, only RNALogo can perform alignment if the input is not pre-aligned [<xref rid="pone.0242030.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. More importantly, twelve background models can be easily generated for <italic>Z</italic>-test or Fisher’s exact test using dagLogo. It is very important to choose an appropriate background model based on the biological questions and experimental protocols. Using the yeast NatA substrate data, we demonstrated the importance of choosing the most appropriate background model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0242030.g004">Fig 4A and 4D</xref>). Of note, to build the most relevant background model, users may need to focus only on proteins expressed under a given condition, in a specific tissue or cell type, or even in a subcellular compartment.</p>
    <p>Additionally, in logos generated by all existing tools, the occurrence of individual residue at a given position is displayed either without considering statistical significance or without allowing degenerate representation based on residue similarity. dagLogo provides more than ten grouping schemes to lump together AA residues of similar physicochemical properties—such as charge, hydrophobicity, and size—into single-letter symbols at given positions. In addition, the function <italic>addScheme</italic> can be used for adding more customized grouping schemes. AA groupings reduce the AA alphabet for testing and visualization. Tests of differential usage of grouped AAs can increase the chances of discovering and visualizing subtle differences that might not be detectable or obvious at the individual AA level (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0242030.g002">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0242030.g003">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0242030.g004">4</xref>).</p>

    <title>Conclusions</title>
    <p>We developed a Bioconductor package, dagLogo, for identifying and visualizing differential AA and AA group usage in proteomics data. Re-analyses of three datasets using dagLogo demonstrated that dagLogo can recapitulate previous findings about the substrate motifs of human granzyme B, three human serine/threonine kinases, and yeast N-terminal acetyltransferase A. Most importantly, analysis with dagLogo at the AA group level revealed important physicochemical property of substrate preferences that would have been hidden with the analysis at the individual AA level alone. The package is well downloaded and already cited in quite a few peer-reviewed journal articles, exemplifying dagLogo as a valuable tool for the analysis of proteomics data.

    <p>
      <bold>Comments to the Author</bold>
    </p>
    <p>1. Is the manuscript technically sound, and do the data support the conclusions?</p>
    <p>The manuscript must describe a technically sound piece of scientific research with data that supports the conclusions. Experiments must have been conducted rigorously, with appropriate controls, replication, and sample sizes. The conclusions must be drawn appropriately based on the data presented. </p>
    <p>Reviewer #1: Yes</p>
    <p>Reviewer #2: Yes</p>
    <p>**********</p>
    <p>2. Has the statistical analysis been performed appropriately and rigorously? </p>
    <p>Reviewer #1: N/A</p>
    <p>Reviewer #2: Yes</p>
    <p>**********</p>
    <p>3. Have the authors made all data underlying the findings in their manuscript fully available?</p>
    <p>The <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.plosone.org/static/policies.action#sharing">PLOS Data policy</ext-link> requires authors to make all data underlying the findings described in their manuscript fully available without restriction, with rare exception (please refer to the Data Availability Statement in the manuscript PDF file). The data should be provided as part of the manuscript or its supporting information, or deposited to a public repository. For example, in addition to summary statistics, the data points behind means, medians and variance measures should be available. If there are restrictions on publicly sharing data—e.g. participant privacy or use of data from a third party—those must be specified.</p>
    <p>Reviewer #1: Yes</p>
    <p>Reviewer #2: Yes</p>
    <p>**********</p>
    <p>4. Is the manuscript presented in an intelligible fashion and written in standard English?</p>
    <p>PLOS ONE does not copyedit accepted manuscripts, so the language in submitted articles must be clear, correct, and unambiguous. Any typographical or grammatical errors should be corrected at revision, so please note any specific errors here.</p>
    <p>Reviewer #1: Yes</p>
    <p>Reviewer #2: Yes</p>
    <p>**********</p>
    <p>5. Review Comments to the Author</p>
    <p>Please use the space provided to explain your answers to the questions above. You may also include additional comments for the author, including concerns about dual publication, research ethics, or publication ethics. (Please upload your review as an attachment if it exceeds 20,000 characters)</p>
    <p>Reviewer #1: In this manuscript the authors present the dagLogo R package, a software for identifying and visualizing differential amino acids in protein sequences. Citation of previous related work was properly made; the algorithm and R implementation are well described, and utilization of the tool was properly evaluated with publicly available data. The package could be installed and tested.</p>
    <p>The following suggestions are made to improve the manuscript.</p>
    <p>1. In the introduction the several advantages of dagLogo over other tools are described. While an R package certainly provides more flexibility, it would be fair to mention that other tools provide graphical user interfaces which are easier to use.</p>
    <p>2. The structure or order of sections should be revised. For example, Materials and Methods should be moved up and Discussion should be the last one.</p>
    <p>3. The resolution of the images is not good enough to see details.</p>
    <p>4. Line 99, “AAs has been” --&gt; “AAs have been”.</p>
    <p>5. Line 159, definition of “DAU”. This was defined later with the current structure, it could be addressed if the sections are re-organized, as mentioned previously.</p>
    <p>6. Line 173, “Van Damme et al. thinks that”. Use a more formal term, e.g. “Van Damme et al. propose that”.</p>
    <p>Reviewer #2: Ou et al. present the dagLogo R package to generate sequence logos from protein and peptide input. Some of the major features of dagLogo are its support of custom background models for differential amino acid analysis and the ability to group amino acids based on physicochemical properties.</p>
    <p>The article is well written and contains relevant examples.</p>
    <p>It is mentioned that a disadvantage of existing tools is that they do not provide alignment functionality (page 3 line 72). However, I could not find a description of alignment functionality built into dagLogo either; instead the examples always use aligned sequences of a fixed length (optionally padded). Can it be made clearer whether alignment is available within dagLogo, and if this is not the case, can the authors discuss the lack of this functionality?</p>
    <p>Additionally I am wondering how well dagLogo is supported. Although it is a project with proven longevity (available since 2013), there is an open issue on GitHub from 2018 that has not yet been addressed. Furthermore, the latest available version on Bioconductor (1.26.2) seems to lag behind the last GitHub version (1.27.9).</p>
    <p>Minor comments:</p>

    <p>- Page 22 line 475: "Uniport" -&gt; UniProt</p>
    <p>- Page 22 line 476: How does dagLogo determine which characteristics are relevant to fetch similar sequences?</p>
    <p>- Information on data and software versions is largely missing. For example, what is the version of the UniProt and SwissProt proteomes that were used, or the versions of the logo generators against which was compared in figure S1, etc.?</p>
    <p>- The figures are of low quality: they are pixelated and some of the text is hard to read. Potentially this is an artefact of the upload procedure, but if not the figures should be exported in a higher quality.</p>

    <p>Reviewer #1: Yes</p>
    <p>Reviewer #2: Yes</p>
    <p>5. Review Comments to the Author</p>
    <p>Please use the space provided to explain your answers to the questions above. You may also include additional comments for the author, including concerns about dual publication, research ethics, or publication ethics. (Please upload your review as an attachment if it exceeds 20,000 characters)</p>
    <p>Reviewer #1: In this manuscript the authors present the dagLogo R package, a software for identifying and visualizing differential amino acids in protein sequences. Citation of previous related work was properly made; the algorithm and R implementation are well described, and utilization of the tool was properly evaluated with publicly available data. The package could be installed and tested.</p>
    <p>The following suggestions are made to improve the manuscript.</p>
    <p>1. In the introduction the several advantages of dagLogo over other tools are described. While an R package certainly provides more flexibility, it would be fair to mention that other tools provide graphical user interfaces which are easier to use.</p>
    <p>Response: We thank the reviewer for the great suggestion! We added this in the Discussion section of the revised manuscript as tracked.</p>
    <p>2. The structure or order of sections should be revised. For example, Materials and Methods should be moved up and Discussion should be the last one.</p>
    <p>Response: We reordered the sections per the reviewer’s request.</p>
    <p>3. The resolution of the images is not good enough to see details.</p>
    <p>Response: We have generated high-quality figures as suggested. We notice that the figure quality is low in the auto-generated pdf file with all files together. We suggest the reviewer download individual TIFF files to obtain high resolution figures.</p>
    <p>4. Line 99, “AAs has been” --&gt; “AAs have been”.</p>
    <p>Response: We thank the reviewer for spotting this error which we have fixed.</p>
    <p>5. Line 159, definition of “DAU”. This was defined later with the current structure, it could be addressed if the sections are re-organized, as mentioned previously.</p>
    <p>Response: As the reviewer suspected, this has been addressed after we reorganized the sections per the reviewer’s suggestion. </p>
    <p>6. Line 173, “Van Damme et al. thinks that”. Use a more formal term, e.g. “Van Damme et al. propose that”.</p>
    <p>Response: We thank the reviewer for a better word choice. We changed “thinks” to “proposed” in the revised manuscript.</p>
    <p>Reviewer #2: Ou et al. present the dagLogo R package to generate sequence logos from protein and peptide input. Some of the major features of dagLogo are its support of custom background models for differential amino acid analysis and the ability to group amino acids based on physicochemical properties.</p>
    <p>The article is well written and contains relevant examples.</p>
    <p>It is mentioned that a disadvantage of existing tools is that they do not provide alignment functionality (page 3 line 72). However, I could not find a description of alignment functionality built into dagLogo either; instead the examples always use aligned sequences of a fixed length (optionally padded). Can it be made clearer whether alignment is available within dagLogo, and if this is not the case, can the authors discuss the lack of this functionality?</p>
    <p>Response: dagLogo accepts aligned subsequences as well as unaligned subsequences of different lengths as input. With unaligned input sequences, dagLogo align them using the input positions or identities of anchoring amino acid (AA), and the upstream and downstream offsets relative to the anchoring AA. For examples with unaligned input sequences, please type help(fetchSequence) or refer to <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://rdrr.io/bioc/dagLogo/man/fetchSequence.html">https://rdrr.io/bioc/dagLogo/man/fetchSequence.html</ext-link>. </p>
    <p>To make it clearer, we have added more descriptions in line 165 – 166.</p>
    <p>Additionally, I am wondering how well dagLogo is supported. Although it is a project with proven longevity (available since 2013), there is an open issue on GitHub from 2018 that has not yet been addressed. Furthermore, the latest available version on Bioconductor (1.26.2) seems to lag behind the last GitHub version (1.27.9).</p>
    <p>Response: We thank the reviewer for bringing our attention to the posted issue. We have posted our response to the issue. There is a central support site <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://support.bioconductor.org">https://support.bioconductor.org</ext-link> for all Bioconductor packages. We have been closely monitoring and actively supporting a dozen of our Bioconductor packages through this site. In fact, we have posted more than 5400 messages at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://support.bioconductor.org">https://support.bioconductor.org</ext-link>/user/list/?sort=reputation&amp;limit=all%20time&amp;q=. In the future, we will periodically check for issues in the GitHub as well.</p>
    <p>Regarding the fact that the latest available version on Bioconductor (1.26.2) seems to lag behind the last GitHub version (1.27.9), this is usually the case because the GitHub version is the development version while the Bioconductor version 1.26.2 is the released version. In fact, Bioconductor hosts development version as well at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/html/dagLogo.html">http://bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/html/dagLogo.html</ext-link>, which should be consistent with the GitHub version. Bioconductor has two releases each year, one in April and the other in October. Once a version has been released, only bug fixes and documentation improvements can be made. Any other types of improvements can only be made to the development branch and be included in the subsequent releases.</p>
    <p>Minor comments:</p>
    <p>- Page 11 line 233: Highlight the modified S/T residues similarly as on lines 227 and 239.</p>
    <p>Response: We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. We highlighted all the S/T residues to make the style consistent between lines.</p>
    <p>- Page 21 line 444: The acronym DAU is only defined here, whereas it is repeatedly used in the preceding text. Please define this acronym upon first use.</p>
    <p>Response: We reorganized the sections per the other reviewer’s recommendation. DAU is now defined in the Materials and Methods section at its first appearance.</p>
    <p>- Page 22 line 475: "Uniport" -&gt; UniProt</p>
    <p>Response: We thank the reviewer for spotting the error which we have corrected.</p>
    <p>- Page 22 line 476: How does dagLogo determine which characteristics are relevant to fetch similar sequences?</p>
    <p>Response: The fetchSequence() function in the dagLogo package provide parameters for user to specify the identity of anchoring amino acid, upstream and downstream offsets relative to the anchoring amino acids. By setting these parameters, dagLogo can fetch subsequences containing anchoring amino acids at the specified positions.</p>
    <p>- Information on data and software versions is largely missing. For example, what is the version of the UniProt and SwissProt proteomes that were used, or the versions of the logo generators against which was compared in figure S1, etc.?</p>
    <p>Response: We thank the reviewer for the advice! We have added the version of the database (Materials and Methods) and software (Fig S1. Legend) in the revised manuscript.</p>
    <p>- The figures are of low quality: they are pixelated and some of the text is hard to read. Potentially this is an artefact of the upload procedure, but if not the figures should be exported in a higher quality.</p>
    <p>Response: We regenerated all figures in high-quality TIFF format. We notice that the figure quality is low in the auto-generated pdf file with all files together. We suggest the reviewer download individual TIFF files to obtain high resolution figures.</p>
