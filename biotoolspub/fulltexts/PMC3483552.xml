    <abstract>
      <p>Long-range gene–gene interactions are biologically compelling models for disease genetics and can provide insights on relevant mechanisms and pathways. Despite considerable effort, rigorous interaction mapping in humans has remained prohibitively difficult due to computational and statistical limitations. We introduce a novel algorithmic approach to find long-range interactions in common diseases using a standard two-locus test that contrasts the linkage disequilibrium between SNPs in cases and controls. Our ultrafast method overcomes the computational burden of a genome × genome scan by using a novel randomization technique that requires 10× to 100× fewer tests than a brute-force approach. By sampling small groups of cases and highlighting combinations of alleles carried by all individuals in the group, this algorithm drastically trims the universe of combinations while simultaneously guaranteeing that all statistically significant pairs are reported. Our implementation can comprehensively scan large data sets (2K cases, 3K controls, 500K SNPs) to find all candidate pairwise interactions (LD-contrast <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="2230inf1.jpg"/></inline-formula>) in a few hours—a task that typically took days or weeks to complete by methods running on equivalent desktop computers. We applied our method to the Wellcome Trust bipolar disorder data and found a significant interaction between SNPs located within genes encoding two calcium channel subunits: <italic>RYR2</italic> on chr1q43 and <italic>CACNA2D4</italic> on chr12p13 (LD-contrast test, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="2230inf2.jpg"/></inline-formula>). We replicated this pattern of interchromosomal LD between the genes in a separate bipolar data set from the GAIN project, demonstrating an example of gene–gene interaction that plays a role in the largely uncharted genetic landscape of bipolar disorder.</p>

<body>
  <p>Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have successfully identified hundreds of genetic markers associated with a wide range of diseases and quantitative traits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">Hindorff et al. 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">Manolio et al. 2009</xref>). Unfortunately, for most common diseases, nearly all associated variants have small effect sizes and taken together explain very little of the genetically heritable variation of the phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">Craddock 2007</xref>)—a phenomenon often posed as the conundrum of “missing heritability” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">Maher 2008</xref>). Furthermore, single-locus association methods tend to implicate individual genes in a particular disease or trait, which in turn highlight a single biological entity involved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">Saunders et al. 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">Hugot et al. 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">Neale et al. 2010</xref>). They do not, by definition, seek to implicate links between the functional elements of a system or elucidate pathway connections that may be broken. Investigation of joint gene–gene effects can therefore improve the explanatory ability of genetics twofold. Firstly, interaction—or statistical epistasis, as defined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">Fisher (1918)</xref>—is hypothesized to explain a part of disease heritability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">Marchini et al. 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">Evans et al. 2006</xref>). Secondly, finding significant statistical links (epistatic or otherwise) between genes could provide strong indications of molecular-level interactions that differ between cases and controls.</p>
  <p>However, an all-pairs (or all-triples) scan of SNPs genome-wide still poses widely discussed computational challenges due to the sheer size of the combinatorial space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">Marchini et al. 2005</xref>), both for data sets typed on genotyping arrays (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="2230inf3.jpg"/></inline-formula> SNPs) and sequencing technologies (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="2230inf4.jpg"/></inline-formula> SNVs). Some methods address this problem by restricting the analysis to a small subset of candidate markers—those identified through single-locus analysis or those of biological interest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">Emily et al. 2009</xref>), or by only checking for interactions between SNPs that are physically close to one another (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">Slavin et al. 2011</xref>). Others like EPIBLASTER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">Kam-Thong et al. 2010</xref>) and SHIsisEPI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">Hu et al. 2010</xref>) make use of specialized hardware like multiple Graphical Processing Units (GPUs) to finish computation on genome-wide data sets on the order of days, rather than weeks or months. While it is known that reductionist, candidate SNP-based approaches can miss many real interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">Culverhouse et al. 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">Evans et al. 2006</xref>) and fail to provide novel biological insights in an unbiased manner, brute-force approaches that rely on hardware for speedup may also scale poorly as data sets increase in size and interaction tests increase in complexity.</p>
  <p>For genome-wide interaction analysis to become pervasive, there is a pressing need for algorithmic insights that make interaction testing on large data sets a scalable proposition, without placing undue computing or hardware demands on the investigator. The contribution of our work is such a method. Recently, others had exploited the fact that contrasting the linkage disequilibrium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">Zhao et al. 2006</xref>), Pearson correlation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">Kam-Thong et al. 2010</xref>) and log-odds ratio (Plink “--fast-epistasis” option) between a pair of SNPs in cases and controls could be computed more efficiently than maximum likelihood estimates in a logistic regression. Usefully, these computationally efficient contrast tests showed high congruence with statistical epistasis under a variety of genetic models. In this study, we do not devise a new statistical test; rather, we use a simplified version of the LD-contrast test for interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">Zhao et al. 2006</xref>) to demonstrate our computational principles. Our version seeks pairs of physically unlinked (often interchromosomal) SNPs that are in strong LD in cases, but in weak LD, no LD, or reverse LD in controls.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2">2</xref></p>
  <p>Our computational approach is driven by the intuition that most genome-wide interaction methodologies only report SNP pairs that are statistically significant (as per the test used) after correcting for the number of tests. The question we ask is this: Given a statistical test, is it possible to identify all the significant SNP pairs with high probability (power), without actually applying the test to all possible combinations genome-wide? In other words, can we design a search algorithm that accepts an arbitrary significance cutoff (as input from the user), and then finds all SNP pairs that will pass this cutoff without a brute-force search? We show here that for some contrast tests, this is indeed possible. At this juncture, it is imperative that we point out the two distinct meanings of “<italic>power</italic>”: Here, unless otherwise specified, we mean the power of an algorithm to identify SNP pairs for which a test statistic is large (i.e., significant), whereas in the broader context of genome-wide interaction mapping literature, power is the ability of a statistical test to detect a real interaction in the data set. Our work focuses on addressing the computational issues that plague an exhaustive search for interaction, leaving issues of statistical power for a separate discussion.</p>
  <p>The rest of this study is structured as follows. First, we briefly review a simple LD-contrast test that compares LD between binary allelic states (rather than 0/1/2 genotypes) in cases and controls. Next, we present a novel computational framework—probably approximately complete (PAC) testing—that quantifies the power of a search done by an algorithm. PAC is an intuitive concept: For example, a brute-force method that tests all-pairs of SNPs genome-wide is considered fully powered at finding all significant pairs in our framework (i.e., 100% probability of finding all pairs whose test statistic clears the significance cutoff) and have no element of approximation at all (i.e., 100% complete scan of the interaction space in the case-control data set). In this study, we design a two-stage PAC test for common complex diseases that is guaranteed to find all significant pairwise interactions with high power (e.g., probability &gt;95% of finding all pairs with a significant statistic) by looking at almost the entire space of possibilities (e.g., ∼99% complete scan of interaction space). In return for accepting a small loss of certainty and power, we show that algorithms that offer tremendous computational gains can be designed. We evaluate the performance of our implementation of this framework (SIXPAC) on genome-scale data and then present the results of our analysis on bipolar disorder (BD) in the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium (WTCCC) data set (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">Craddock 2007</xref>).</p>

      <title>Outline</title>
      <p>The goal of our method is to efficiently identify the set of SNP pairs that have vastly different LD in cases and controls from the universe of pairs genome-wide—if any such pairs exist at all. First, we define the LD-contrast statistic and establish a minimum cutoff value that determines whether a pair of SNPs has a statistically significant contrast in a genome-wide study or not. Next, we devise a stage 1 filtering step that identifies potential case–control differences in LD by looking for LD in cases alone. We quantify the losses that stage 1 incurs (false negatives) by applying this “approximate” version of the full LD-contrast test.</p>
      <p>In stage 2, the candidates shortlisted based on their LD in cases are tested using the full cases-versus-controls LD-contrast test and either validated or discarded based on the difference. Stage 2 is needed to distinguish stage 1 shortlisted candidates that are true interactions from false positives. False positives may include SNP pairs drawn by pure chance, and also pairs that show large LD in cases, but also show large LD in controls in the same direction. Such a systemic inflation of disequilibrium between alleles in cases and controls might be due to other factors like population stratification, technical artifacts, or ascertainment bias and is, by definition, not associated with phenotype.</p>
      <p>The motivation for dividing the search into two stages is because the stage 1, case-only, “<italic>approximate</italic>” filtering step can be processed extremely rapidly by exploiting computer bitwise operations, making it much faster than a brute-force approach. We present the novel randomization technique called <italic>group-sampling</italic> with which we can efficiently find SNP pairs that are in strong LD in cases. However, like every randomization algorithm, we need to stop sampling when we are reasonably certain that all significant (high LD) candidates have already been encountered and shortlisted. Consequently, at the end of stage 1, we are left with a “<italic>probably complete</italic>” list of pairs that demonstrate severe LD in cases. Taken in conjunction, this design outputs a “<italic>probably approximately complete</italic>” (PAC) catalog of interacting SNP pairs at the end of the filtering stage, which are subsequently screened by the full test. We demonstrate that our software implementation of this PAC-testing framework can find approximately all significant SNP pairs in current GWAS data sets with arbitrarily high power (e.g., &gt;99% probability) at a fraction of the computational cost of an exhaustive search.</p>

      <title>Definitions and notation</title>
      <p>For purposes of illustration, consider two binary matrices <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="2230inf5.jpg"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="2230inf6.jpg"/></inline-formula>, representing the cohorts of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="2230inf7.jpg"/></inline-formula> haploid cases and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="2230inf8.jpg"/></inline-formula> haploid controls typed at <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="2230inf9.jpg"/></inline-formula> polymorphic sites, respectively (we extend this to the diploid human case below). <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="2230inf10.jpg"/></inline-formula> denotes the allele carried by case <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="2230inf11.jpg"/></inline-formula> at variant site <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="2230inf12.jpg"/></inline-formula> (0 for major, 1 for minor), while <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="2230inf13.jpg"/></inline-formula> similarly denotes the allele carried of control <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="2230inf14.jpg"/></inline-formula> at that site. Furthermore, we respectively denote <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="2230inf15.jpg"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="2230inf16.jpg"/></inline-formula> as the number of cases and controls that carry allele <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="2230inf17.jpg"/></inline-formula> at <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="2230inf18.jpg"/></inline-formula>. Therefore, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="2230inf19.jpg"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="2230inf20.jpg"/></inline-formula> are the corresponding allele <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="2230inf21.jpg"/></inline-formula>-frequencies of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="2230inf22.jpg"/></inline-formula> in cases and controls. Since we are only discussing binary <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="2230inf23.jpg"/></inline-formula> carrier states <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="2230inf24.jpg"/></inline-formula>, for ease of notation, we henceforth use <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="2230inf25.jpg"/></inline-formula> instead of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="2230inf26.jpg"/></inline-formula>, and (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="2230inf27.jpg"/></inline-formula> instead of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="2230inf28.jpg"/></inline-formula> (and analogously, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="2230inf29.jpg"/></inline-formula> and for controls).</p>
      <p>We are interested in examining whether a haploid individual carries a certain combination of alleles at two (or more) sites. Consider <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="2230inf30.jpg"/></inline-formula> different binary sites <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="2230inf31.jpg"/></inline-formula>, at which an individual can carry any one of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="2230inf32.jpg"/></inline-formula> unique allelic combinations. We say an individual carries allelic state <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="2230inf33.jpg"/></inline-formula> at these sites if she carries allele <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="2230inf34.jpg"/></inline-formula> at each one of the respective sites <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="2230inf35.jpg"/></inline-formula>. Analogous to individual sites, we can also denote the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="2230inf36.jpg"/></inline-formula> different <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="2230inf37.jpg"/></inline-formula>-frequencies of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="2230inf38.jpg"/></inline-formula> by <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="2230inf39.jpg"/></inline-formula> in cases and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="2230inf40.jpg"/></inline-formula> in controls, where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="2230inf41.jpg"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="2230inf42.jpg"/></inline-formula> are the number of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="2230inf43.jpg"/></inline-formula> carriers at <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="2230inf44.jpg"/></inline-formula> in cases and controls, respectively. For example, if an individual carries 1-alleles (i.e., minor alleles) at each of the sites <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="2230inf45.jpg"/></inline-formula>, then we say she is a <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="2230inf46.jpg"/></inline-formula>-carrier of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="2230inf47.jpg"/></inline-formula>. The <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="2230inf48.jpg"/></inline-formula>-frequency of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="2230inf49.jpg"/></inline-formula> in cases (controls) is the fraction of cases (controls) that are <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="2230inf50.jpg"/></inline-formula>-carriers of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="2230inf51.jpg"/></inline-formula>.</p>

      <title>Binary representation of diploid genomes</title>
      <p>For diploid genomes like humans, equivalent matrices of cohorts would be <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="2230inf52.jpg"/></inline-formula> for cases and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="2230inf53.jpg"/></inline-formula> for controls, where each entry <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="2230inf54.jpg"/></inline-formula> in these matrices represents the number of minor alleles at the site, rather than the presence or absence of a minor allele. Depending on the model of interaction the investigator is interested in, these may be transformed into an appropriate binary representation in several ways. For our purpose, we represent each ternary genotype as two binary variables. The first variable asks whether the individual carries <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="2230inf55.jpg"/></inline-formula> copies of the minor allele (i.e., is dominant) at this SNP, while the second asks whether the individual carries exactly <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="2230inf56.jpg"/></inline-formula> copies of the minor allele (i.e., is recessive) at this SNP. In this format, cases and controls are represented by the binary matrices <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="2230inf57.jpg"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="2230inf58.jpg"/></inline-formula>, respectively, where each genotype <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="2230inf59.jpg"/></inline-formula> is recoded as two binary values <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="2230inf60.jpg"/></inline-formula> for cases,<disp-formula id="DEU1"><graphic xlink:href="2230equ1"/></disp-formula>and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="2230inf61.jpg"/></inline-formula> is recoded equivalently as <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="2230inf62.jpg"/></inline-formula> for controls. For example, case #6 is represented as a recessive carrier of SNP #12 (variable coordinates: row 6, column <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="2230inf63.jpg"/></inline-formula> by setting <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="2230inf64.jpg"/></inline-formula>. If case #6 is a dominant carrier of SNP #12, then we set both <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="2230inf65.jpg"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="2230inf66.jpg"/></inline-formula>. The notations for number of carriers and frequency of variables (and combination of variables) all follow analogously.</p>

      <title>Statistical test for two-locus effect</title>
      <p>We adapt the LD-contrast test for interaction between a pair of unlinked genotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">Zhao et al. 2006</xref>) into a similar two-tailed test between a pair of unlinked binary variables <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="2230inf67.jpg"/></inline-formula>,<disp-formula id="DE1"><graphic xlink:href="2230equ2"/></disp-formula>where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="2230inf68.jpg"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="2230inf69.jpg"/></inline-formula> represent the estimated LD between these variables in cases and controls, respectively, while <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="2230inf70.jpg"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="2230inf71.jpg"/></inline-formula> represent the standard error of these estimators (see Supplemental Section 1 for derivation and details) and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="2230inf72.jpg"/></inline-formula> is their LD contrast. This normalized statistic behaves as a <italic>Z</italic>-score, and for variable pairs that pass the significance cutoff in a genome-wide pairwise analysis (typically <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="2230inf73.jpg"/></inline-formula> or less on present day data sets), this statistic will assume large values (typically 6 or more).</p>
      <p>Variable pairs with large differences in LD are of interest to several genetic models, and their signal can be dissected to reveal either statistical (epistatic) or biological interaction. Based on what is known about the genetic architecture of a specific disease, the relevant community of geneticists can bring different model assumptions to bear on a test for interaction. Here, we do not attempt to dictate a specific model that might cause such a difference in LD between the cases and controls. Rather, we focus on presenting a general method that can report all SNP pairs with a significant contrast and provide expert users with the flexibility to filter the results from such an analysis according to relevant assumptions. This can be done either a priori (e.g., removing SNPs with marginal signals before running a search for interaction), or a posteriori (e.g., discarding reported SNP pairs that do not provide evidence for statistical epistasis).</p>

      <title>Two-stage testing design</title>
      <p>A widely used simplification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">Piegorsch et al. 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">Yang et al. 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">Cordell 2009</xref>) in genome-wide interaction scans is to divide the search effort into two stages: first filter candidates, and then verify interaction. The crucial insight that permits this step is that we can expect physically unlinked markers to be in (or almost in) linkage equilibrium in large outbred populations. Even for common diseases, the general population is mostly composed of healthy controls (disease prevalence &lt;50%). We show that in the absence of confounding factors like population stratification, a pair of physically unlinked variables showing large LD contrast will be a pair that has large LD in cases rather than large LD in controls. Without loss of generality, we focus our discussion on identifying pairs with strong positive LD in cases <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="2230inf74.jpg"/></inline-formula>. Pairs with strong negative LD between variables are easily modeled (with a trivial change in binary encoding) as strong positive LD between the major allele at one and a minor allele at the other. Alternative variable pairings of this kind would only require a different binary encoding scheme but introduce more confusing notation. A separate (but limiting) issue is that of the statistical testing burden incurred by encoding alternate models, which we address in the Discussion.</p>

We shortlist only those variable pairs that reject the stage 1 null hypothesis at a significance level of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="2230inf78.jpg"/></inline-formula>. In other words, for a pair to be shortlisted as a candidate for follow-up, we require that the LD in cases between its variables should exceed some threshold, i.e., <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="2230inf79.jpg"/></inline-formula>. We determine this threshold to satisfy sensitivity/specificity constraints below.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>Stage 2 (validating)</title>
        <p>Next, we apply the LD-contrast test on candidates shortlisted by stage 1. This helps us to determine, for each candidate, whether the observed LD is indeed case-specific (and therefore a putative indicator of interaction) or pervasive in the population (and hence unrelated to disease). The stage 2 null hypothesis posits that there is no LD difference between cases and controls:</p>

          <graphic xlink:href="2230equ4"/>
        </disp-formula>
        <p>Putative significant pairs will reject this null hypothesis at a significance level of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="2230inf80.jpg"/></inline-formula> (i.e., <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="2230inf81.jpg"/></inline-formula>).</p>
        <p>To appreciate how such a two-stage design can capture almost all significant pairs in the data set and what the appropriate significance cutoff <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="2230inf82.jpg"/></inline-formula> in the stage 1 analysis must be, we now introduce the concept of a probably approximately complete search. A numerical example depicting the concepts that follow is provided in Supplemental Section 9.</p>

        <title>Complete search</title>
        <p>To find all significant variable pairs in the data set, current algorithms would sequentially visit each pair of SNPs, genome-wide, and check whether each LD contrast exceeds the user-prescribed significance threshold <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="2230inf83.jpg"/></inline-formula> by comparing cases and controls.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>Approximately complete search</title>
        <p>Here we ask, what threshold <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="2230inf84.jpg"/></inline-formula> can we apply in the filtering step, so as to capture almost all significant pairs by means of their disequilibrium in cases alone? In other words, can most significant pairs (pairs for which <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="2230inf85.jpg"/></inline-formula>) be captured without explicitly determining <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="2230inf86.jpg"/></inline-formula> at all? Furthermore, we wish to determine the proportion of significant pairs that such an approximation might miss. We show that for most common diseases, an adequate cutoff for LD in cases is usually <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="2230inf87.jpg"/></inline-formula> (see Supplemental Section 2)—i.e. SNP-pairs with a severe LD-contrast (difference in LD between cases and controls) are usually observable from their severe LD in cases alone.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>Probably approximately complete (PAC) search</title>
        <p>So far, our two-stage design has reduced the cumbersome task of counting the number of carriers for all variable pairs (genome-wide) in cases and then again in controls, to the simpler task of shortlisting the small set of pairs that demonstrate <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="2230inf88.jpg"/></inline-formula>. From a complexity standpoint, however, such a simplification (restricting the stage 1 analysis to cases only) does not change the order or magnitude of the number of tests: This is still quadratic in the number of SNPs genome-wide. To address this computational problem, we now introduce the novel randomization technique called “group sampling,” which can rapidly perform the case-only shortlisting with arbitrarily high power, without explicitly checking all pairs of variables.</p>

      <title>Group sampling</title>
      <sec>
        <title>Rationale</title>
        <p>From our observation that the LD statistic in cases is usually more severe than LD contrast (Supplemental Section 2), we deduce that significant interacting pairs <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="2230inf89.jpg"/></inline-formula> will show a minimum number of excess <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="2230inf90.jpg"/></inline-formula>-carriers in cases: <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="2230inf91.jpg"/></inline-formula>. In a genome-wide analysis, as the universe of variable pairs tested grows, so does the burden of multiple test correction that is applied to characterize statistical significance. Consequently, the number of excess of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="2230inf92.jpg"/></inline-formula>-carriers required in order for <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="2230inf93.jpg"/></inline-formula> to achieve statistical significance in cases—<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="2230inf94.jpg"/></inline-formula>—grows commensurately. Group sampling overcomes the computational burden of a genome-wide analysis by using this “side effect” of multiple-test correction to its advantage: The larger the number of variants typed, the larger is the universe of pairs to be tested, and the larger the excess <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="2230inf95.jpg"/></inline-formula>-carriers needed to make statistically significant pairs stand apart from the crowd. This observation allows us to quickly prune the universe of pairs into a much smaller candidate set that is “guaranteed” to contain all significant pairs with arbitrarily high probability.</p>
        <p>For illustration purposes, let us consider a simplified version of the problem at hand. In this version, we are only interested in searching through pairs of distal variables <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="2230inf97.jpg"/></inline-formula>, where both variables have 1-frequencies (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="2230inf98.jpg"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="2230inf99.jpg"/></inline-formula>) that lie within the narrow frequency window <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="2230inf100.jpg"/></inline-formula>. Let the set of all variables that lie within this frequency window be labeled <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="2230inf101.jpg"/></inline-formula>. We wish to determine whether there exists a pair <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="2230inf102.jpg"/></inline-formula>, such that <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="2230inf103.jpg"/></inline-formula> rejects <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="2230inf104.jpg"/></inline-formula>. We can compute a lower bound on <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="2230inf105.jpg"/></inline-formula> for all such <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="2230inf106.jpg"/></inline-formula> as:</p>
        <disp-formula id="DE4">
          <graphic xlink:href="2230equ5"/>
        </disp-formula>
        <p>This is because the excess <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="2230inf107.jpg"/></inline-formula>-carriers required for any <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="2230inf108.jpg"/></inline-formula> to reject <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="2230inf109.jpg"/></inline-formula> is at least as many as the excess <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="2230inf110.jpg"/></inline-formula>-carriers required by the least frequent <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="2230inf111.jpg"/></inline-formula> in that set: when <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="2230inf112.jpg"/></inline-formula>. Therefore, the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="2230inf113.jpg"/></inline-formula>-frequency of all pairs that reject <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="2230inf114.jpg"/></inline-formula> is at least:<disp-formula id="DE5"><graphic xlink:href="2230equ6"/></disp-formula>where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="2230inf115.jpg"/></inline-formula> is the minimum LD in cases for all significant pairs <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="2230inf116.jpg"/></inline-formula>.</p>

        <title>Sampling a single group</title>
        <p>Consider a group of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="2230inf117.jpg"/></inline-formula> cases drawn randomly (with replacement). If <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="2230inf118.jpg"/></inline-formula> rejects <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="2230inf119.jpg"/></inline-formula>, then the probability that all <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="2230inf120.jpg"/></inline-formula> cases in the group will be <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="2230inf121.jpg"/></inline-formula>-carriers of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="2230inf122.jpg"/></inline-formula> has a lower bound <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="2230inf123.jpg"/></inline-formula>. On the contrary, if <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="2230inf124.jpg"/></inline-formula> does not reject <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="2230inf125.jpg"/></inline-formula>, then the probability that such a group will contain all <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="2230inf126.jpg"/></inline-formula>-carriers of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="2230inf127.jpg"/></inline-formula> purely by chance has an upper bound <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="2230inf128.jpg"/></inline-formula>—corresponding to the most frequent variable pair in <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="2230inf129.jpg"/></inline-formula>. It is easy to see that if <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="2230inf130.jpg"/></inline-formula>, we are much more likely to observe a random group of cases that are all <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="2230inf131.jpg"/></inline-formula>-carriers of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="2230inf132.jpg"/></inline-formula> when it rejects <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="2230inf133.jpg"/></inline-formula>.</p>
        <p>The reason for drawing cases in groups (as opposed to one by one) is that it allows us to rapidly find the subset of variables for which all <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="2230inf134.jpg"/></inline-formula> cases are <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="2230inf135.jpg"/></inline-formula>-carriers. This is done with a native bitwise AND operation using computers, which is very fast in practice. In fact, the larger the group size, the exponentially smaller the subset of variables carried by all cases in the group becomes. Furthermore, long stretches of binary genotype data can be processed per CPU clock cycle, making this step even more attractive. Subsequent to finding this small subset of variables, it is computationally efficient to enumerate all pairs (or indeed, triplets) among them, and pass them on to stage 2.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>Sampling multiple groups</title>
        <p>If the group of cases we draw is sufficiently large (i.e., <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="2230inf136.jpg"/></inline-formula> is high), then it is extremely unlikely to contain only <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="2230inf137.jpg"/></inline-formula>-carriers, not only when <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="2230inf138.jpg"/></inline-formula> accepts <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="2230inf139.jpg"/></inline-formula>, but also when this null is rejected because both <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="2230inf140.jpg"/></inline-formula>. We can counter this by drawing up to <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="2230inf141.jpg"/></inline-formula> independent groups (each containing <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="2230inf142.jpg"/></inline-formula> random cases), so that the probabilities of not witnessing even a single group containing only <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="2230inf143.jpg"/></inline-formula>-carriers decreases at diverging rates for the two realities:</p>

        <p>In fact, if <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="2230inf144.jpg"/></inline-formula> does reject <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="2230inf145.jpg"/></inline-formula>, then by varying the two parameters <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="2230inf146.jpg"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="2230inf147.jpg"/></inline-formula> the probability of observing at least one group of all <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="2230inf148.jpg"/></inline-formula>-carriers can be driven arbitrarily high (type II error rate &lt;<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="2230inf149.jpg"/></inline-formula>) while keeping the probability of a chance observation relatively low (type I error rate &lt;<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="2230inf150.jpg"/></inline-formula>). In other words, given fixed specificity and sensitivity constraints <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="2230inf151.jpg"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="2230inf152.jpg"/></inline-formula> (provided as input by the user), when <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="2230inf153.jpg"/></inline-formula>, we can always find group-sampling parameter values <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="2230inf154.jpg"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="2230inf155.jpg"/></inline-formula> for which:</p>

    <title>Results</title>
    <p>The major methodological contribution of this work is a novel randomization algorithm (group sampling), which can focus the computational effort toward finding significant pairwise interaction candidates, without testing all pairs genome-wide. To determine whether a candidate SNP pair is significant or not and to minimize the risk of false positives, in all our analyses, we subject the results to the most conservative threshold for significance in a genome-wide analysis—the Bonferroni corrected <italic>P</italic>-value of 0.05—unless otherwise stated. More sophisticated treatment of the multiple testing issues in interaction testing (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">Emily et al. 2009</xref>) is equally applicable and can be plugged into our method without violating any of the principles or assumptions. We also restrict our analysis to pairs of genetic markers (SNPs) only and choose to ignore gene–environment interactions for the moment. These simplifications serve to highlight the fundamental concepts of our approach, without loss of interpretable results. Our software implementation of this algorithm (SIXPAC) is available for download at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~snehitp/sixpac">http://www.cs.columbia.edu/∼snehitp/sixpac</ext-link>.</p>
    <sec>
      <title>Data set</title>
      <p>SIXPAC was used to analyze 1868 cases of the bipolar disorder (BD) cohort in the WTCCC against <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="2230inf165.jpg"/></inline-formula> combined controls from the 1958 British birth cohort (58C) and UK national blood service (NBS), all typed on the Affymetrix 5.0 platform, after cleaning all data as per requirement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">Craddock 2007</xref>). Each of the remaining 455,566 SNPs remaining in the data set was encoded into two binary variables (dominant and recessive), giving 911,132 binary variables genome-wide and a universe of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="2230inf166.jpg"/></inline-formula> potential variable pairs to be tested. Although we only report pairwise interactions that are significant at the Bonferroni level in this data set <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="2230inf167.jpg"/></inline-formula>, investigators who use less stringent multiple test correction can use SIXPAC to discover interactions at a different cutoff as well.</p>
      <p>To verify that the LD-contrast statistic follows a standard normal distribution, we drew random variable pairs genome-wide and constructed a QQ plot. Like others before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">Liu et al. 2011</xref>), we observed that WTCCC data cleaning was inadequate for interaction analysis and systematically applied more stringent filters to preemptively screen out false positives that can be a result of bad genotype calls on a few individuals. Specifically, 81,085 additional SNPs that had &lt;95% confidence calls (CHIAMO) in &gt;1% of the individuals (cases and controls combined) were removed. For the cleaned data set of 374,481 SNPs that remain, we verified that the LD-contrast statistic <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="2230inf168.jpg"/></inline-formula> for randomly drawn pairs of unlinked variables &gt;5 cM apart was indeed a <italic>Z</italic>-score (QQ plots and additional cleaning details in Supplemental Section 5), in agreement with our null hypothesis.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec>
      <title>Power analysis on spiked data</title>
      <p>Next, we tested SIXPAC's computational sensitivity by searching for synthetic interactions inserted into the bipolar cases while keeping the joint controls unchanged. Eleven recessive–recessive interaction pairs between 22 SNPs on successive autosomal chromosomes (chr1 and chr2, chr3 and chr4, etc.) were simulated over a range of different parameters. Interactions between each pair of SNPs were simulated in a manner not to introduce a main effect, but effectively introduce only interaction effects. Details of this procedure are outlined in Supplemental Section 6.</p>
      <p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Algorithm 2</xref> configures the search parameters according to two user inputs: (1) a significance cutoff (LD-contrast test <italic>P</italic>-value), and (2) the minimum search power (defined as the power to discover all variable pairs that exceed the given significance cutoff, assuming such interactions exist). We tested SIXPAC on the synthetic data sets over a range of different input value combinations, to check whether we could discover the spiked interactions in accordance with theoretical estimates, and confirmed finding all of them at (or above) the power guaranteed to the user (Supplemental Section 7).</p>

    <sec>
      <title>Computational savings from group sampling</title>
      <p>To put the computational savings of our novel approach in context, we reviewed the literature for published, high-performance, genome-wide pairwise search methodologies that either (i) contrast a statistic for a pair of SNPs between cases and controls or (ii) directly test for statistical epistasis between a pair of SNPs using a regression model. Plink (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">Purcell et al. 2007</xref>) offers a <italic>--fast-epistasis</italic> option that tests pairs of SNPs using a statistic similar to ours: Specifically, it collapses each pair of SNPs completely into a 2×2 table of major versus minor allele counts, and subsequently contrasts the odds ratios of each combination between cases and controls. On the other hand, EPIBLASTER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">Kam-Thong et al. 2010</xref>) operates on the entire 3×3 table of genotypes to contrast the exact Pearson's correlation of each SNP pair between cases and controls. Like Plink, SHEsisEPI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">Hu et al. 2010</xref>) also contrasts odds-ratios of all SNP pairs reduced to a 2×2 table. Both EPIBLASTER and SHEsisEPI achieve speedup through the use of a GPU stack.</p>
      <p>Among the methods that directly test for statistical epistasis, we report TEAM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">Zhang et al. 2010a</xref>) and FastEpistasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">Schüpbach et al. 2010</xref>). The authors of FastCHI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">Zhang et al. 2009</xref>), FastANOVA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">Zhang et al. 2008</xref>), COE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">Zhang et al. 2010b</xref>) and TEAM presented a review (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">Zhang et al. 2011</xref>) in which TEAM was reported as the most appropriate for handling human data sets, and was therefore chosen to represent the family of methods. TEAM achieves computational speedup by a novel approach that allows it to accurately identify interacting SNP pairs (for most statistical tests) by checking only a small subset of individuals in the cohort. Unlike EPIBLASTER, Plink <italic>--fast-epistasis</italic>, and SIXPAC, TEAM works directly on the logistic regression framework—giving it the ability to test a broader range of interaction models. The other method, FastEpistasis, reports epistasis in the analysis of quantitative traits (and is particularly built for gene-expression analysis) by implementing a rapid linear regression that takes advantage of multicore processor architectures. Notable among methods omitted in this comparison are Multifactor Dimensionality Reduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">Ritchie et al. 2001</xref>) and the Restricted Partition Method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">Culverhouse et al. 2004</xref>), both of which partition the data according to genotypic effect in a relatively model agnostic manner. Consequently both methods test a variety of interaction models (alternate parameterizations) that are not currently captured by high-performance computational techniques like ours and others previously discussed. Another widely cited method, BEAM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">Zhang and Liu 2007</xref>), does not scale to present day data sets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">Cordell 2009</xref>) and was left out of this analysis. There are numerous other methods that perform whole-genome interaction scans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">Emily et al. 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">Zhang et al. 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">Greene et al. 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">Liu et al. 2011</xref>), including some that utilize sampling subsets of individuals for computational speedup (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">Achlioptas et al. 2011</xref>). An older review of a few of these is provided elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">Cordell 2009</xref>).</p>
      <p>Except for SIXPAC, all the time scales presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref> are performance figures as self-reported by the authors of each method (or in the case of TEAM, extrapolated from performance figures reported therein) on a data set of this size. Our synopsis does not constitute a comprehensive methods comparison and is presented solely to highlight the computational savings achieved by group sampling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>). The reason SIXPAC is able to achieve its speedup without GPUs is because it does not need to exhaustively test all pairs of SNPs to identify the significant combinations.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3">3</xref> On the other hand, all other methods are burdened by a brute-force test of all pairs to identify such combinations. In confirmation of our estimates, they also report that genome-wide testing on ordinary CPUs requires several weeks of compute time (some report weeks even on a small cluster of computers). The application of group sampling was able to reduce this computational investment to ∼8 h.</p>

          <p>Computational efficiency. Our implementation of the two-stage PAC-testing framework (SIXPAC, orange line) was benchmarked on the cleaned WTCCC bipolar disorder data set (approximately 2K cases, 3K controls, 450K SNPs, four genetic models tested per distal SNP pair, 400 billion pairwise tests genome-wide). (<italic>A</italic>) The factor reduction in the universe of SNP pairs achieved by stage 1, for each power setting. Note that unlike brute force, this does not mean down-sampling the universe of SNP pairs, but rather involves reducing the probability of identifying any one of them. For example, a brute-force method would presumably test 40 billion pairs (and ignore the remaining 360 billion) to achieve 10% power on this data set. However, PAC testing scans all 400 billion pairs, but simply reduces the probability of finding the significant interactions among them to 10%. This results in shortlisting ∼68× fewer combinations through stage 1. (<italic>B</italic>) The efficiency of our software implementation of this method. We compare the performance of SIXPAC against the time taken by a brute-force approach of applying the LD-contrast test directly to all pairs (green line). All tests were benchmarked on a common desktop computer configuration (Intel i7 quad-core processor, 2.67 GHz with 8 GB RAM). The last data point shows the 90% power benchmarks, followed by dotted lines that illustrate how these estimates may continue as we approach 100% power. SIXPAC, like any randomization algorithm, will require infinite compute time to achieve 100% power but can approach very close at a small fraction of the brute-force cost. Lastly, we note that these measurements only reflect the performance of our Java program rather than what might be feasible with a different implementation of the algorithm.</p>

      <title>Novel significant interaction in bipolar disorder</title>
      <p>We ran SIXPAC on the BD data set with &gt;95% power to check whether there exist any significant LD contrasts between pairs of physically unlinked variables (SNPs &gt;5 cM apart). We report the presence of only one statistically significant two-locus contrast (BD cases vs. NBS+58C controls LD contrast, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="2230inf172.jpg"/></inline-formula>) between SNPs lying within two calcium channel genes: rs10925490 within <italic>RYR2</italic> on chr1q43, and rs2041140 and rs2041141 within <italic>CACNA2D4</italic> on chr12p13.33. We successfully replicated the signal from this region at Bonferroni significance levels in a different bipolar data set of Europeans (653 BARD cases, 1034 GRU controls) from the GAIN initiative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">The GAIN Collaborative Research Group 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">Smith et al. 2009</xref>) (also see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.genome.gov/19518664">http://www.genome.gov/19518664</ext-link>), which were typed on a different platform (Affymetrix 6.0). Deeper investigation revealed that the SNP in <italic>CACNA2D4</italic> is 200 kb away from <italic>CACNA1C</italic>—a known calcium channel gene whose association to BD was only recently confirmed by combining large GWAS data sets for meta-analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">Ferreira et al. 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">Sklar et al. 2008</xref>). Functional experiments have also confirmed the role played by genes at this locus in bipolar disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">Perrier et al. 2011</xref>). Although channel ideopathies (and, more specifically, faults in calcium channels and signaling) have long been known to play a major role in bipolar disorder, single-locus association methods were underpowered to implicate genes in these pathways without considerably boosting their sample sizes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">Craddock 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">Ferreira et al. 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">Sklar et al. 2008</xref>). Neither gene that we report—either at the known locus or novel locus—was identified as a candidate by the original WTCCC analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">Craddock 2007</xref>), which focused on effects visible to single-locus association.</p>
      <p>Specifically, we found that the dominance variable of rs10925490 (one or more minor alleles) was in severe positive linkage disequilibrium with the recessive variables of adjacent SNPs rs2041140 and rs2041141 (two minor alleles each) in BD cases, and slight negative disequilibrium with them in controls, giving an LD-contrast <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="2230inf173.jpg"/></inline-formula>. To verify that this signal was not due to any unaccounted biases, we first confirmed that high LD between the two variables was specific to BD cases only, even when contrasted against samples from all other WTCCC disease phenotypes (six tests of BD vs. other-disease-cases all show LD-contrast <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="2230inf174.jpg"/></inline-formula>). Next, we performed a permutation analysis to characterize the empirical distribution of the LD-contrasts statistic at the theoretical significance level of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="2230inf175.jpg"/></inline-formula> (i.e., to check if <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="2230inf176.jpg"/></inline-formula>). We ran SIXPAC on 100 phenotype permuted versions of the same data set (i.e., 100 whole-genome, all-pairs scans for interaction) and observed <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="2230inf177.jpg"/></inline-formula> between a pair of SNPs in only one such permutation (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="2230inf178.jpg"/></inline-formula>).</p>
      <p>Finally, we sought to replicate the observed difference in LD at these loci. In the GAIN data set, we considered all LD contrasts in an area of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="2230inf179.jpg"/></inline-formula> SNP immediately upstream and downstream of rs10925490 in the dominant allelic mode, against <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="2230inf180.jpg"/></inline-formula> SNP immediately upstream and downstream of rs2041140 in the recessive allelic mode. In other words, we tested <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="2230inf181.jpg"/></inline-formula> pairs (around and including the original interaction), to test if any pair in this area bore an LD contrast that passed the conservative Bonferroni significance cutoff <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="2230inf182.jpg"/></inline-formula>. This roughly translates to a region <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="2230inf183.jpg"/></inline-formula> kb upstream and downstream of each SNP in the original pair. Although there was no appreciable difference in LD between the same SNPs (rs2041140/rs10925490 shows LD-contrast <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="2230inf184.jpg"/></inline-formula>), we observed a significant LD contrast <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="2230inf185.jpg"/></inline-formula> between rs2041140 and rs677730 (the SNP immediately upstream of rs10925490 on the Affymetrix 6.0 platform). To confirm that this observation was not likely by chance, we randomly picked 5000 pairs of physically unlinked (&gt;5 cM apart) SNPs genome-wide and tested an equal neighborhood of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="2230inf186.jpg"/></inline-formula> LD contrasts around each pair in the GAIN data set. Only one out of 5000 random areas contained a SNP pair with a more significant LD contrast <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="2230inf187.jpg"/></inline-formula>.</p>
      <p>To get a better picture of the LD-contrast landscape between SNPs in this region, we conducted a wider survey of the area spanning <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="2230inf188.jpg"/></inline-formula> SNPs (upstream, downstream, and including both rs2041140 and rs10925490) <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="2230inf189.jpg"/></inline-formula>. The scan reveals several additional pairs of SNPs that show differences in LD going in the same direction (strong LD in cases, weak negative LD in controls), arranged in a strikingly similar pattern in both data sets, presenting strong evidence of an interlocus effect. The two-dimensional LD-contrast spectrum for this larger area is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>, alongside the Manhattan plots for marginal association at each locus. The top SNP pair in the area (rs677730, d × rs11062012, r) had LD-contrast <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="2230inf190.jpg"/></inline-formula> in GAIN: A similar phenotype permutation analysis as earlier reveals that only 19 out of the 5000 randomly chosen <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="2230inf191.jpg"/></inline-formula> areas genome-wide contained a more significant pair <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="2230inf192.jpg"/></inline-formula>. It can also be seen that there is no marginally significant association at these loci in either data set. <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref> present a summary of these results.</p>

          <p>Bipolar disorder interaction. In a genome-wide scan of all 400 billion variable pairs (four genetic models tested per SNP pair) in the WTCCC bipolar disorder data set (Affymetrix 500K), SIXPAC found one significant interaction <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="2230inf197.jpg"/></inline-formula> between SNPs &gt;5 cM apart that satisfied all our filtering criteria. The SNPs rs10925490 and rs2041140 lie within the <italic>RYR2</italic> gene on chr1q43 and the <italic>CACNA2D4</italic> gene on chr12p13.33, respectively. Each figure shows the −log(<italic>P</italic>-value) from a standard single-locus association test (allelic model) of the two SNPs as well as 25 SNPs immediately upstream and downstream from each of them, along the <italic>x</italic>-axis and <italic>y</italic>-axis. Also shown in the grayscale area is the −log(<italic>p</italic>) from the pairwise LD-contrast test of all <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="2230inf198.jpg"/></inline-formula> variable pairs. As suggested by the original finding, SNPs around rs10925490 were considered in dominant allelic mode, while SNPs around rs2041140 were in recessive mode. We replicated this signal by similarly testing <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="2230inf199.jpg"/></inline-formula> dominant–recessive pairs of variables around the very same SNPs in a much smaller bipolar disorder data set from the GAIN Consortium (Affymetrix 6.0). In the replication data set, we observe several pairs that cross the significance threshold and a strikingly similar visual pattern in the LD-contrast landscape (see main text for a permutation analysis). The top pair (rs677730–rs11062012) in this area is pinpointed with dashed lines (see main text for permutation analysis). Standard single-locus association analysis does not yield any significant result in either data set, as seen in the marginal Manhattan plots (the gray dashed line represents the genome-wide significance level).</p>

    <title>Discussion</title>
    <p>In this study, we introduced a novel method that defuses the computational challenge of a genome × genome interaction scan by using the statistical constraint toward, rather than against, our goal. Focusing only on interactions that have a chance of achieving statistically significant association, we developed a rapid filter that does not require the naive arduous scan of all pairs of variants. To demonstrate its utility, we implemented an established test for interaction that contrasts LD between cases and controls, to demonstrate how an exhaustive genome-wide multilocus association search is possible while saving an order of magnitude or more in computational resources. Usefully, we are also able to provide performance guarantees and quantify the approximate nature of our output, and our algorithm brings genome-wide three-locus scans into the realm of feasibility.</p>
    <p>While the focus of this contribution is computational methodology, we prove applicability in practice to a classical GWAS data set. Among widely investigated common diseases, bipolar disorder remains one of the most recalcitrant phenotypes to GWAS methodology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">Craddock and Sklar 2009</xref>), perhaps in part because of the limitations of single-locus association analysis. We highlight the power and utility of multilocus effects in terms of uncovering molecular processes by exposing two calcium channel–coding genes as affecting bipolar disorder, supporting recent discoveries that were only made possible through a significant increase in data set size. We have replicated this observation in an independent data set, strongly suggesting a bona fide underlying interaction between members of a gene family known to be functionally associated with bipolar disorder, making it suitable for further investigation.</p>
    <p>Compared to the number of single-locus associations, GWAS of common phenotypes in humans have uncovered very few reproducible gene–gene effects so far. This is partly because interaction analyses for human populations are difficult to design and interpret (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">Cordell 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">Phillips 2008</xref>). A conventional test for statistical epistasis is expected to only identify loci whose combined effect on phenotype is not explained by the addition of their individual effects, for an appropriately chosen scale. In case–control studies, this typically involves applying a logistic regression to check for significance of the interaction term(s) after accounting for main effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">Wang et al. 2010</xref>), which is equivalent to a test for deviation from multiplicative odds (or additive log-odds). However, there are several limitations to this approach—scale of choice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">Mani et al. 2008</xref>), assumption of a genetic model by which two loci combine their effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">Hallander and Waldmann 2007</xref>), limited models of interaction that can be tested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">Li and Reich 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">Hallgrímsdóttir and Yuster 2008</xref>), and limited sensitivity of logistic regression to non-normal residuals, among others. How these factors might cumulatively affect a test for other models of genetic interaction has not yet been decisively established.</p>
    <p>Furthermore, true biological interaction between two or more loci may or may not manifest itself as a departure from additivity. Two loci whose main effects appear to combine in an additive manner might also indicate their biological co-involvement (and hence “interaction”) underlying the disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">Wang et al. 2011</xref>). In general, two-locus association tests are known to contribute signal independently from what is seen by conventional single-locus association tests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">Marchini et al. 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">Kim et al. 2010</xref>), and comprehensive multilocus association strategies may be worth undertaking despite the increased multiple testing burden (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">Evans et al. 2006</xref>). Indeed, recent work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">Zuk et al. 2012</xref>) showing that alternative models of biological interaction could confound estimates of heritability has redirected the attention of the genetics community to the potential of interaction studies.</p>
    <p>A previous genome-wide scan for statistical epistasis on the same bipolar disorder data set had reported Bonferroni significant epistasis between rs10124883 and four other SNPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">Hu et al. 2010</xref>). As expected, all four pairs approached (but did not clear) Bonferroni significance levels as per the LD-contrast test as well <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="2230inf200.jpg"/></inline-formula>—and could therefore be captured simply by lowering the significance cutoff. This congruence between tests for statistical epistasis and contrast tests has been exploited by others (Plink, EPIBLASTER) and, indeed, also holds for the binary LD-contrast test (see tables in Supplemental Section 6). But whereas other methods would use a brute-force testing strategy to identify candidate SNP pairs, PAC testing will accomplish the same result much quicker by looking at a small fraction of the pairs.</p>
    <p>Our findings do suggest that unlike stepwise regression approaches that sequentially attribute residual variance/deviance to each of their components, tests that make fewer assumptions regarding scale may, indeed, be more powerful at capturing a wider range of interactions. Conversely, a distinct advantage of regression over our LD-contrast test remains its clear interpretation and measurement of effect size; although the difference in LD between cases and controls is consistent and reproducible across data sets, it does not immediately suggest a clear causal genetic model underlying this signal. We dissected this interaction using the standard logistic regression, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="2230inf201.jpg"/></inline-formula>, where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="2230inf202.jpg"/></inline-formula> codes for dominance carrier status at rs10925490 while <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="2230inf203.jpg"/></inline-formula> codes for recessive carrier status at rs2041140. The main effects <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="2230inf204.jpg"/></inline-formula> were observed to be not significant, while the epistasis term <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="2230inf205.jpg"/></inline-formula> was considerable (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="2230inf206.jpg"/></inline-formula>), suggesting deviation from multiplicative odds is one option. We also considered the standard full genotype model (0/1/2 parameterization of predictor variables) with 8 degrees of freedom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">Cordell and Clayton 2002</xref>) as implemented by INTERSNP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">Herold et al. 2009</xref>), where the most significant test (Test 6, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="2230inf207.jpg"/></inline-formula>) was the one comparing the full model against a model that accounts for just within-SNP additive and dominance effects. In a genome-wide search for interaction using logistic regression, these levels are likely to fall short of significance cutoffs after correcting for hundreds of billions of tests performed, which explains why other methods seeking statistical epistasis on the same BD data set did not report LD between the <italic>RYR2-CACNA2D4</italic> as a significant finding. A true etiological understanding of this persistent difference in LD may require sequencing at each locus to identify the interacting variants.</p>
    <sec>
      <title>Limitations and extensions</title>
      <p>The major contribution of this work is a computational technique to rapidly identify SNP pairs with large values of a test statistic without performing a brute-force search. While we assessed the issue of power with regard to our randomization algorithm, we left the separate (but equally important) concept of statistical power unaddressed—i.e., the ability of an interaction test to spot a true biological interaction in the data set. Although contrasting LD, correlation, and odds-ratios between cases and controls have all separately been characterized as powerful tests for interaction, each test makes specific model assumptions and is powerful only under its own regime. Consequently, the absence of interaction reported by SIXPAC (or, indeed, by any other software) does not imply the absence of interaction itself, but could simply mean lack of statistical power of the test, inadequate number of samples, or, simply, incorrect model assumptions. During the course of publishing this method, minor corrections were suggested for a range of contrast statistics to improve their power and decrease type I error rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">Ueki and Cordell 2012</xref>). Again, we note that modifications to these tests can be easily adopted into our computational methods—which are agnostic of statistics.</p>
      <p>In contrast to the performance gains offered by group sampling are its two notable weaknesses. First—like any other randomization algorithm—group sampling can never achieve 100% power (probability of completion), whereas brute-force approaches will. Second, by virtue of limiting itself to binary features, testing for genetic models that incorporate allelic dosage and trend effects using group sampling does not appear straightforward. Although extending our computational principles to implement rapid correlation and odds-ratio contrast tests (among others) may be appealing, the loss of statistical power from increasing the number of tests is less easily addressed. Where we currently encode recessive and dominance binary status, each additional test may require a different encoding of features (genotypes, or combinations thereof), thereby adding to the multiple testing burden. Overcoming these limitations appears nontrivial, and increases in sample size will almost certainly play a crucial role in discovering these hidden genetic connections.</p>
      <p>Extrapolating from the hardware speedups reported by others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">Hu et al. 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">Kam-Thong et al. 2010</xref>) may suggest that a high-performance GPU-enabled implementation of our method might offer a scan of all-pairwise interactions in a few minutes, and all three-way interactions on the order of a day(s) in large GWAS data sets. But a more immediate concern related to testing three-way interactions would be the statistical power and semantic interpretation of such a test (conceivably devised on a 2×2×2 binary table). In conclusion, we note that while the transition of association studies from SNP arrays to full ascertainment of variants may have led to analytical emphasis on rarer alleles, it has only increased the impetus to examine the spectrum of multilocus effects. With so many more variants to consider, the computational limitations will only become more severe, but the solutions reported will be ever more essential.</p>
