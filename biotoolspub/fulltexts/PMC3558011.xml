      <p>While the performance of liquid chromatography (LC) and
mass spectrometry (MS) instrumentation continues to increase, applications
such as analyses of complete or near-complete proteomes and quantitative
studies require constant and optimal system performance. For this
reason, research laboratories and core facilities alike are recommended
to implement quality control (QC) measures as part of their routine
workflows. Many laboratories perform sporadic quality control checks.
However, successive and systematic longitudinal monitoring of system
performance would be facilitated by dedicated automatic or semiautomatic
software solutions that aid an effortless analysis and display of
QC metrics over time. We present the software package SIMPATIQCO (<italic>SIMP</italic>le <italic>A</italic>u<italic>T</italic>omat<italic>I</italic>c <italic>Q</italic>uality <italic>CO</italic>ntrol) designed
for evaluation of data from LTQ Orbitrap, Q-Exactive, LTQ FT, and
LTQ instruments. A centralized SIMPATIQCO server can process QC data
from multiple instruments. The software calculates QC metrics supervising
every step of data acquisition from LC and electrospray to MS. For
each QC metric the software learns the range indicating adequate system
performance from the uploaded data using robust statistics. Results
are stored in a database and can be displayed in a comfortable manner
from any computer in the laboratory via a web browser. QC data can
be monitored for individual LC runs as well as plotted over time.
SIMPATIQCO thus assists the longitudinal monitoring of important QC
metrics such as peptide elution times, peak widths, intensities, total
ion current (TIC) as well as sensitivity, and overall LC–MS
system performance; in this way the software also helps identify potential
problems. The SIMPATIQCO software package is available free of charge.</p>

    <title>Introduction</title>
    <p>Proteomics workflows share one essential
requirement: they necessitate appropriate quality control (QC). Stringent
QC not only requires an evaluation of outcomes, rather QC starts with
adequate experimental design; it incorporates monitoring of processes,
protocols, and reagents; and it includes aspects such as adequate
training of personnel and a surveillance of the proper functioning
of instrumentation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>−<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref></sup> For proteomics workflows, QC must be established
at four steps: sample preparation, liquid chromatography (LC), mass
spectrometry (MS), and data interpretation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref></sup> A recent study showed that a major reason for the failure of a number
of laboratories to reliably identify proteins present in a relatively
simple test sample was due to inadequate data processing; the same
study suggested that this could be overcome by standardized operating
procedures involving appropriate protocols for data interpretation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref></sup> This is reassuring as a bioinformatics data interpretation
workflow, once established, can be maintained easily because software
algorithms continue to work reproducibly with moderate requirement
for maintenance.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>−<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref></sup> In contrast, all the other above-mentioned steps
are subject to variation from experiment to experiment, and suboptimal
system performance needs to be identified and corrected promptly.
For this reason, software which facilitates an effortless monitoring
of the performance of LC and MS systems is highly desirable.</p>
    <p>Improvements in LC and MS instrumentation contribute to the remarkable
performance of today’s LC–MS equipment, empowering researchers
to implement novel experimental protocols. However, challenging applications
require measures to ensure constant and optimal system performance.
Highly sophisticated QC approaches were reported previously such as
the NIST MSQC pipeline, which outputs 46 QC metrics,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref></sup> or QuaMeter a software which can compute up to 42 QC metrics
for instruments from different vendors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref></sup> QC software has also been reported for the detection of LC runs
that constitute outliers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref></sup> and for computation
and visualization of QC metrics from individual LC runs,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref></sup> and a real-time QC solution for monitoring electrospray
quality and LC backpressure was described recently.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref></sup> However, to our knowledge no currently available QC software
allows an automated upload of QC runs to a dedicated server postacquisition,
followed by seamless computation of QC metrics based on peptide identifications
and instrument parameters, storage of QC results in a database, and
the possibility for convenient plotting of the time course of QC metrics
via a web browser. Such a longitudinal analysis of QC data from multiple
LC runs could potentially reveal suboptimal LC–MS system performance
as a deviation outside the range of a QC metric when the LC–MS
system is operating under optimal conditions.</p>
    <p>We therefore developed
SIMPATIQCO (<italic>SIMP</italic>le <italic>A</italic>u<italic>T</italic>omat<italic>I</italic>c <italic>Q</italic>uality <italic>CO</italic>ntrol), a software suite specifically designed to aid routine longitudinal
monitoring of QC metrics and troubleshooting when using LTQ Orbitrap,
Q-Exactive, LTQ FT, and LTQ instruments. SIMPATIQCO is a server-based
application, designed to process raw files from the above-mentioned
Thermo Scientific instruments that can be uploaded either manually
(individually or in batch) via a web browser interface or in an automated
manner via a “hot folder” (Windows network share or
ftp). As Xcalibur can be configured to run a batch file postacquisition,
raw files can be copied instantaneously from mass spectrometers in
the laboratory to the “hot folder” on the SIMPATIQCO
host for automatic processing. SIMPATIQCO then extracts information
from the raw file, starts a Mascot search to identify spectra, and
calculates QC metrics. Results are stored in a database and can be
viewed for individual QC runs as well as plotted over time via a web
browser interface from any computer in the laboratory.</p>
    <p>To demonstrate
the successful usage and general utility of the software suite, we
present longitudinal QC data from six instruments and four laboratories
in the <xref rid="notes-2" ref-type="notes">Supporting Information</xref> (Figure S-1).
Three of the four laboratories installed a SIMPATIQCO server in-house,
while one laboratory uploaded data to a SIMPATIQCO server installed
and operated by one of the other laboratories (which is an option
for laboratories that do not have the resources to maintain the server
themselves).</p>
    <p>We also propose an LC–MS quality control
workflow based on the routine surveillance of QC metrics with two
types of QC samples that are intercalated with regular samples to
monitor two disparate aspects of overall system performance: a sample
of very low complexity designed to monitor sensitivity using an analyte
(peptide) concentration only modestly above the limit of detection
(LOD) of a system performing close to optimum; and another sample
of very high complexity that poses a challenge to the speed of data
acquisition.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref></sup> Metrics derived from these
samples thus reflect the sensitivity as well as the speed and overall
performance of the LC–MS system. Of note, SIMPATIQCO can be
configured to accommodate other types of samples, as disparate QC
samples are in use within the community. Indeed, some of the above-mentioned
participating laboratories preferred to use different standard proteins
and synthetic peptides and different concentrations in their QC samples.</p>
    <p>The purpose of SIMPATIQCO is to provide a set of key QC metrics
that are generated in an effortless manner and that can be displayed
conveniently. SIMPATIQCO facilitates a longitudinal surveillance of
the time course of system performance and within-laboratory reproducibility,
and it helps pinpoint potential suboptimal system performance. Identification
of outliers with regard to the performance metrics should prompt an
immediate enquiry so that the reason for deviant performance can be
identified and resolved. In this way, SIMPATIQCO may aid proteomics
laboratories achieve and maintain optimum quality of data acquisition.</p>
  </sec>
  <sec sec-type="methods" id="sec2">
    <title>Methods</title>
    <p>SIMPATIQCO was developed for deployment (installation)
on a Windows computer. Raw files from QC runs intercalated with regular
samples are uploaded to a server. SIMPATIQCO extracts data such as
ion injection times, TIC, and lock mass information, and estimates
the overfill or underfill ratio of the automatic gain control (AGC)
target value for each spectrum.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref></sup> MS/MS
spectra are submitted to a Mascot server for peptide identification.
SIMPATIQCO then calculates QC metrics that reflect the performance
of LC, electrospray, and MS such as peak widths and areas, peptide
elution times and intensities, TIC, the number of identified peptide–spectrum
matches per minute, and the sequence coverage of “proteins
of interest”. For each QC metric the range indicating optimal
system performance is learned from the data and displayed using a
background band colored in green, whereas yellow or red colored bands
highlight deviant system performance. We calculate robust statistics
on QC metrics, eliminating the requirement to manually remove outliers
(“bad runs”). Results are stored in a PostgreSQL database.
PHP scripts and Apache webserver allow comfortable display of results
from any computer in the laboratory.</p>
    <p>A description of the QC
samples and the LC and MS methods used by the four laboratories is
provided in the <xref rid="notes-2" ref-type="notes">Supporting Information</xref>,
illustrating that SIMPATIQCO is compatible with different QC work
flows established in various laboratories. A detailed overview of
the components and design of the SIMPATIQCO software package is also
provided in the Supplementary Materials and Methods section within
the <xref rid="notes-2" ref-type="notes">Supporting Information</xref>. Further information,

    <title>Results and Discussion</title>
    <p>Obtaining mass spectrometry
data for state-of-the-art proteomics studies requires QC measures.
In our view, the key to achieve and maintain optimum data quality
is successive, routine, and if possible automated rather than sporadic
and manual monitoring of system performance. In the following we present
a QC workflow as well as a software package aimed to aid the maintenance
of constant and optimum LC–MS system performance.</p>
    <p>Traditionally
the LC has been a major source of concern, and close surveillance
of LC performance is certainly an important prerequisite to ensure
high quality proteomics data. However, in our experience there is
likewise a requirement to monitor the performance of the MS instrumentation
as closely as that of the LC. For instance with the newer generations
of Orbitrap instruments that have enhanced sensitivity partly due
to increasing the overall gas throughput into the system,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref></sup> there may be the need to clean various components
of the instrument more often in order to maintain optimum performance,
as deposition of particles onto components of the ion optics can lead
to a decrease in ion transmission.</p>
    <p>Both LC and MS instruments
offer a variety of instrument-specific system tests. These tests may
provide very valuable hints during troubleshooting. For instance,
the latest version of Velos Orbitrap instrument software (Tune 2.7
SP1) offers several diagnostic procedures that have been added to
assist in determining whether a deposition of charged particles is
occurring and which part of the ion optics most likely has the contamination.
However, several types of system evaluation procedures on Orbitrap
instruments may require switching from the nanosource to the ESI source,
interrupting measurements in addition to the time required for the
tests themselves. For this reason system tests are costly to perform
on a daily or more than daily basis. In addition there is a risk that
the mounting and unmounting of system parts to perform these tests
might lead to a deterioration of system performance aside from the
time requirements. Cleaning procedures and the associated bake-out
of the instrument lead to prolonged instrument downtime, so that there
is a requirement to estimate appropriate timing of such maintenance
procedures. We therefore reasoned that it would be desirable to have
a system evaluation test at hand that can be performed without any
need to interrupt the running LC–MS system.</p>
    <p>We hence
suggest that the more time-consuming instrument-specific tests such
as those mentioned above be performed only at defined time points
dedicated to system maintenance and during setup or troubleshooting
of an LC–MS system. In these situations, considerable time
and effort is invested into optimizing system performance. Manual
evaluation of raw files and analysis with tools such as rawMeat (<uri xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="http://vastsci.com/rawmeat/">http://vastsci.com/rawmeat/</uri>), NIST MSQC,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref></sup> QuaMeter,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref></sup> LogViewer,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref></sup> and MaxQuant<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref></sup> can
provide valuable information at this stage. In addition parameters
for methods should be tested in order to evaluate their effect on
system performance. These time-consuming optimization steps are necessary
because monitoring the time course of performance metrics can only
be regarded as an indicator of optimum system performance when the
values of the metrics under optimal conditions have been established
in the first place. After these initial steps, we suggest a routine
analysis of two types of QC samples in short time intervals to monitor
QC metrics such as sensitivity as well as speed and overall performance
of the entire LC–MS system. The QC samples are measured intercalated
within the regular experiments, and analyzed automatically with the
help of SIMPATIQCO so that there is no interruption of system operation.</p>
    <p>The general concept is based on the consideration that relevant
system alterations involving a significant change in system performance
should lead to a change of QC metrics derived from either or both
of the two QC samples. As we want the QC samples to indicate whether
the LC–MS system is in an adequate status for measuring actual
samples, the choice of the two QC samples is such that one QC sample
is designed to evaluate sensitivity (QC 1) whereas the other one is
intended to monitor overall system performance and speed (QC 2). The
choice of a suitable amount of the QC 1 sensitivity sample is important.
One may first perform a dilution series to establish the LOD and then
decide to inject an amount only modestly above this value. When the
injected amount of QC 1 sample is too high, the test would constitute
a less sensitive indicator of impaired system performance. However
a concentration that is too low would also be suboptimal because this
would lead to on/off observations rather than a more robust performance
required for the calculation of meaningful performance statistics
on the QC metrics.</p>
    <p>Specifically the two QC samples that we suggest
are as follows:<list list-type="simple"><list-item><label>1.</label><p>A sensitivity analysis, typically based
on measuring a small amount of a well-defined sample such as, e.g.,
1 fmol of BSA, 2.5 fmol of a mixture of 10 phosphopeptides, and 500
fmol of cytochrome <italic>c</italic> over a short, e.g., a 0.5 h
gradient time (see Supplementary Materials and Methods section of
the <xref rid="notes-2" ref-type="notes">Supporting Information</xref>). We suggest
to measure this “QC 1” sample whenever there have been
alterations to any part of the LC–MS system, after calibration
of the MS (change to ESI source), and in general at least once or
if possible several times per day.</p></list-item><list-item><label>2.</label><p>A performance and speed analysis, usually based on the
injection of a highly complex sample such as 0.1 μg or 1 μg
of HeLa measured over a longer gradient time (for instance 3 h). This
“QC 2” sample is measured at least once per week, whenever
there have been alterations to any component of the LC–MS system,
and before the analysis of biological samples that require high speed
of acquisition and optimal overall performance.</p></list-item></list></p>
    <p>Other types of QC samples such as, e.g., other proteins,
synthetic peptides spiked at different concentrations, <italic>Escherichia
coli</italic>, <italic>Pyrococcus furiosus</italic>, or yeast, are
conceivable and can be configured for automatic analysis with SIMPATIQCO.
A schematic overview of the SIMPATIQCO software suite is shown in
Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>.</p>

        <p>Components and flow of information using
SIMPATIQCO. Two types of QC samples are analyzed on each LC–MS
system: QC 1 contains a simple digested protein mixture (e.g., cytochrome <italic>c</italic>, BSA, and synthetic phosphopeptides) that is measured
1–2×/day for an evaluation of sensitivity and LC metrics
such as peptide retention times. QC 2 is a HeLa digest that is analyzed
1–2×/week to evaluate system speed and overall performance.
After upload of the respective raw files to the SIMPATIQCO server,
QC metrics are calculated and stored in a PostgreSQL database. The
database is linked to a webserver and can be queried to visualize
the time course of QC metrics via a web browser.</p>

    <p>A single SIMPATIQCO server can be used to upload,
analyze, and visualize data from several LC–MS systems (Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> and Figure S-2 in the <xref rid="notes-2" ref-type="notes">Supporting
Information</xref>). The server can be accessed from any web browser
within the local network. The four main menu categories are as follows:
“Raw files” allows access to analyses of individual
uploaded raw files, and manual upload and deletion of raw files. “Time
course” permits visualization of the time course of QC metrics
based on information stored in the database. A virtual logbook can
be accessed under “Log” where the date and a short description
of events such as system maintenance or cleaning of the ion optics
can be entered for each system. “Settings” can be used
to set the URL of the Mascot server used for searching MS/MS spectra
and to configure predefined “Peptide lists” and “Proteins
of interest” as well as “Run-types” and settings
for the calculation of statistics from performance metrics. “Peptide
lists” allow a definition of peptides whose peak elution time,
apex intensity, peak width, and area can be plotted via the “Time
course” menu. “Proteins of interest” define
proteins for which the sequence coverage is shown when clicking on
a raw file in the “Raw files” menu, and for which the
time course of sequence coverage can be plotted in the “Time
course” menu. “Run-types” define settings specific
for a certain instrument and QC sample, such as precursor and fragment
ion tolerance, Mascot “instrument type” (ESI trap, ETD
trap, etc.), the FASTA database, enzyme, and Mascot peptide ion score
cutoff. In addition the “Settings” menu allows defining
the time period for the calculation of statistics on QC metrics (default
setting: inclusion of all runs), and whether the green, yellow, and
red background bands should be calculated based on a certain multiple
(e.g., 1×, 2×, or 3×) of the standard deviation or
the median absolute deviation (MAD).</p>
    <p>After data upload, SIMPATIQCO
derives several QC metrics from the raw files, searches MS/MS spectra
via Mascot, and then stores all extracted data and results in a database
that can be queried remotely by a web browser client. This is advantageous
because it provides researchers and technical personnel a convenient
access to the QC data reflecting the current performance of each LC–MS
system in the laboratory. In addition, SIMPATIQCO allows operators
to enter “system maintenance &amp; service messages”
into a virtual logbook, for instance when the S-lens was cleaned or
when a service engineer performed system maintenance work on the instrument.
The respective messages can be superimposed on the time course plots
so that the effect of system maintenance can be related to changes
in the QC metrics (Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). In this way,
SIMPATIQCO can help identify impaired system performance, monitor
whether system maintenance procedures were successful, and thus help
achieve and maintain close to optimum LC–MS system performance
to ensure high quality data acquisition.</p>

times (B) on a Velos Orbitrap system monitored over time. System maintenance
and service messages were entered manually by an operator and illustrate
the relationship between the two QC metrics and system maintenance
efforts such as venting and cleaning of the S-lens and exit lens (log
entry “S-lens cleaned”) by laboratory staff (which improved
BSA sequence coverage but led to an only transient reduction in average
MS<sup>1</sup> injection times) or venting and cleaning of the transfer
lens between the high pressure and the low pressure cells by a service
engineer. Green band: within 1 × median absolute deviation (MAD).

    </fig>
    <p>For each QC metric, SIMPATIQCO learns the range
reflecting adequate or inadequate system performance from the uploaded
data. This requires that the LC–MS system was operated under
adequate or possibly optimum conditions for the majority of QC runs.
Via the SIMPATIQCO “Raw files” menu, “bad”
runs can be deleted manually. However it may be difficult to judge
which data points actually represent outliers. We therefore decided
to implement robust statistics to find the range for each metric that
indicates adequate system performance, calculating median and MAD
(median absolute deviation) values as an alternative to average values
and standard deviation. Contrary to average values and standard deviations
that are sensitive to outliers, median values and MAD provide a more
robust estimation of adequate system performance that is insensitive
to outliers. This strategy therefore renders manual outlier removal
unnecessary. The default setting is that these statistics are calculated
for all LC runs of a certain run type that have been uploaded to the
database. However as soon as a time period that likely reflects “optimum
system performance” has been identified, operators may define
and configure this period in the “Settings” menu as
a fixed reference time for calculation of statistics of QC metrics
such as median, MAD, average values, and standard deviation. In this
way, the above-mentioned statistics reflect the ranges during “optimum
system performance”. For longitudinal monitoring of the time
course of QC metrics, the values of the respective metric are plotted
against a colored background where a green color band indicates optimum
system performance (median ± MAD) whereas deviant system performance
is highlighted by yellow (between 1 and 2 × MAD) or red color
(outside 2 × MAD). These plots of the time course of QC metrics
allow convenient and rapid pinpointing of adequate or likely suboptimal
system performance.</p>

    <p>The above-mentioned metrics are calculated and can be
visualized for both types of QC runs. However, we define peptide lists
only for the “sensitivity” QC 1 sample because the calculation
of retention times is more precise for this sample. Taken together,
these QC metrics provide a quick overview and help in monitoring the
entire LC–MS system, including performance of the LC, electrospray,
and MS.</p>
    <sec id="sec3.1">
      <title>Metrics Monitoring LC</title>
      <p>LC performance can be evaluated
via the peak apex retention times and intensities, peak widths, and
peak areas of peptides on definable “peptide lists”
(Figure S-1 in the <xref rid="notes-2" ref-type="notes">Supporting Information</xref>). These metrics are mandatory to monitor particularly when reproducible
retention time and constant ionization efficiency are required, e.g.,
for label-free quantification.</p>
      <p>There are myriads of reasons
for shifts in retention times such as alterations in solvent solutions,
temperature shifts, dead volume, and leaking connections. In general
malfunctioning of almost every part of the LC may lead to a change
in retention times; for this reason this metric is a valuable measure
of LC performance. Retention time shifts may also indicate that the
LC fails to generate an adequate flow rate, e.g., because of partial
occlusion of the trap column or the analytical column that the system
cannot compensate. In these cases, a change in the pressure curves
on the LC can confirm the cause. The large amount of cytochrome <italic>c</italic> (500 fmol) in the QC 1 sample permits a rapid inspection
of cytochrome <italic>c</italic> peptide retention times with LC software
whenever a UV detector is used. The “peptide list” feature
of SIMPATIQCO allows monitoring of this metric even without a UV detector
directly from mass spectrometry data. Additional usage of a UV detector
may still be helpful, e.g., for the identification of peak broadening
due to dead volume in fluidic connections between the UV cell and
the electrospray emitter. Moreover “peptide lists” permit
monitoring the retention time, e.g., of the phosphopeptides in the
QC 1 sample whose concentration would be too low to be detectable
on the UV trace.</p>
      <p>In addition, peak widths can be plotted for
peptides on a SIMPATIQCO “peptide list”. Again there
are many causes for peak broadening such as the presence of post-column
dead volume or a deterioration of the analytical column. In the absence
of a UV detector, SIMPATIQCO “peptide lists” provide
a possibility to monitor peak widths, which are an excellent indicator
of LC system performance.</p>
      <p>Monitoring peptide peak intensities
may also provide an indirect indication of impaired LC performance
and peak broadening that typically goes along with a lowering of peak
intensities. Alternatively, decreased peak intensities and peak areas
may suggest either an incorrect amount of injected sample or sample
loss on the part of the LC, or a problem on the part of the MS such
as less effective ionization or loss of ions before reaching the detector
or loss of detector sensitivity.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec3.2">
      <title>Metrics Monitoring Electrospray</title>
      <p>Electrospray quality
and stability can be evaluated indirectly by its impact on MS<sup>1</sup> and MS/MS ion injection times, number of acquired MS<sup>1</sup> and MS/MS scans, and suppressed (or absent) peak intensities
and areas of peptides on SIMPATIQCO “peptide lists”.
All these metrics can be plotted over time to help provide information
including the spray quality and stability. In addition, MS<sup>1</sup> and MS/MS TIC as well as the ratio “(%) of target value”
can be plotted over the retention time for individual raw files. High
ion injection times, low number of MS<sup>1</sup> and MS/MS scans,
a low TIC, and the presence of fluctuations of TIC between MS<sup>1</sup> scans can suggest problems with electrospray, and will often
prompt an exchange of the electrospray emitter. High injection times,
low number of MS<sup>1</sup> and MS/MS scans, and low TIC can also
be a sign of electron multiplier gain calibration being out of calibration.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec3.3">
      <title>Metrics Monitoring MS Sensitivity and Overall Speed and Performance</title>
      <p>For the QC 1 sensitivity sample that includes cytochrome <italic>c</italic>, BSA, and 10 phosphopeptides, plotting the sequence coverage
of BSA is recommended in the first place, as this value reflects overall
LC–MS system sensitivity. The status of a system may be considered
as appropriate for an analysis of, e.g., routine samples (such as
the identification of proteins from immunoprecipitation or tandem
affinity purification experiments) when the BSA sequence coverage
is adequate. QC 1 samples can be measured with disparate types of
fragmentation techniques, e.g., collision-induced dissociation (CID),
electron transfer dissociation (ETD), or higher energy collisional
dissociation (HCD) depending on the methods used in the ensuing regular
samples.</p>
      <p>Time course plots suggest that the average MS<sup>1</sup> ion injection time (calculated over the entire QC 1 run) may also
constitute a sensitive indicator of MS system performance. An increase
of the average MS<sup>1</sup> ion injection time can be reverted by
appropriate actions such as instrument calibration, or cleaning of
the contaminated parts of the ion optics (Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). In a series of several QC 1 runs the average MS<sup>1</sup> ion injection time already increased while the BSA sequence coverage
still remained within the range of stochastic variation, suggesting
that in certain situations the average MS<sup>1</sup> ion injection
time may constitute an even more sensitive indicator of subtle changes
before a drop in sensitivity becomes apparent (Figure S-3 in the <xref rid="notes-2" ref-type="notes">Supporting Information</xref>). We therefore monitor
both BSA sequence coverage and the MS<sup>1</sup> ion injection time
closely to schedule the appropriate maintenance or MS system tests
for an evaluation of possible contamination of the ion path when the
average MS<sup>1</sup> ion injection time starts to rise or when the
BSA sequence coverage drops below normal.</p>
      <p>As QC 1 sensitivity
samples are analyzed once or even more than once per day, the metrics
derived from these samples reflecting LC performance, electrospray,
and MS sensitivity are monitored closely.</p>
      <p>The QC 2 speed and
performance sample, a HeLa digest, is analyzed at least once per week
and in addition before an analysis of complex samples that require
optimum system speed. Similar to QC 1 samples, QC 2 runs can be performed
separately for each type of fragmentation method used for measuring
regular samples on the respective instrument (e.g., CID, ETD, or HCD).
The QC 2 sample is a complex protein digest, providing complementary
information with regard to system acquisition speed and performance
(Figure S-1 A in the <xref rid="notes-2" ref-type="notes">Supporting Information</xref>). The number of peptide-spectrum matches and identified proteins
indicate whether the LC–MS system is in an appropriate condition
for the analysis of complex samples. Hence these numbers constitute
a sensitive indicator of overall LC–MS system performance for
such samples.</p>
      <p>MS<sup>1</sup> and MS/MS ion injection times can
also be plotted over the retention time of a QC 2 raw file to determine
how frequently the ion injection time reached the maximum value, suggesting
that the AGC target value might not have been reached for the respective
scan. In addition SIMPATIQCO calculates “(%) of target value”,
an estimator of the number of ion charges present in each scan divided
by the AGC target value. More information on this metric can be found
in the <xref rid="notes-2" ref-type="notes">Supporting Information</xref>.</p>
      <p>Finally,
the average lock-mass deviation may serve as an indicator when the
next mass calibration should be scheduled.</p>
      <p>QC runs are repeated
when outliers are observed so that impaired system performance should
become apparent as a series of outliers. Whenever the pattern of the
time course of QC metrics suggests suboptimal performance, an investigation
of possible causes is undertaken. SIMPATIQCO also assists with this
task. For instance, one may wish to plot the lock mass<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref></sup> deviation, MS<sup>1</sup> TIC, the number of PSMs identified
per minute, and the <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> of triggered
precursor ions over the course of the QC run (Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>).</p>

minute (C) and <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> of triggered
precursors (D) plotted over the entire retention time range of the

      </fig>
      <p>Although SIMPATIQCO can assist in finding the reason
of suboptimal system performance, in many situations LC-specific and
MS-specific system evaluation tests need to be performed to find out
the actual cause. In severe cases, prolonged MS<sup>1</sup> ion injection
times are observed even when spraying calibration mixture solution
with the ESI source mounted. SIMPATIQCO also offers the possibility
to upload such data, for instance 100 off-line acquired MS<sup>1</sup> scans of a calibration mixture. A special type of QC-sample “run-type”
can be defined for such data and configured so that the data is not
searched with Mascot. When such data sets are uploaded on a regular
basis, SIMPATIQCO allows convenient monitoring of the time course
of average ion injection times of MS<sup>1</sup> scans of a calibration
mixture acquired off-line with the ESI source, which should be below
0.1 ms on Velos Orbitrap instruments (Figure S-4 in the <xref rid="notes-2" ref-type="notes">Supporting Information</xref>).</p>
      <p>Among MS-specific
system evaluation procedures, the so-called “Multipole Flight
Time evaluation” test, now called the “Source Optics
Flight Time evaluation” test, along with the “MP0 Flight
Time evaluation” test, can help provide an indication as to
whether there is a need to clean some element of the source ion optics
(including the S-Lens, Exit Lens, MP00, Lens 0, or MP0). In cases
where cleaning of the source optics does not lead to a sustained improvement
of the results of the QC metrics monitored by SIMPATIQCO, other parts
of the ion optics can be considered as a cause. In this case another
system evaluation procedure called the “Ion Optics Charging
Evaluation” can help pinpoint a contaminated device along the
entire optics path including the Exit Lens, MP00, Lens 0, MP0, Lens1,
MP1, Gate Lens, Front Lens, and Center Lens, by sequential exposure
to a negative ion beam. The Center Lens between the high and low pressure
cells can also be evaluated via the “transfer efficiency evaluation”
or “transfer lens calibration check”. Notably, appropriate
tuning of multipole offsets particularly with regard to MP0 can have
a strong effect on resisting contamination effects. With Tune 2.7
SP1, inadvertent setting of low voltages due to inappropriate tuning
is prevented to ensure robust ion transmission even in case of moderate
contamination.</p>
      <p>The first samples analyzed after starting the
LC–MS system again following troubleshooting and maintenance
procedures should always be further QC samples. At times, more than
one cleaning approach may be required until the source of impaired
system performance can be identified and resolved (Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>), which should then become apparent as long-term
sustained optimal performance, e.g., with regard to BSA sequence coverage
and MS<sup>1</sup> ion injection times and other performance metrics.</p>

    <title>Conclusion</title>
    <p>We developed SIMPATIQCO (<italic>SIMP</italic>le <italic>A</italic>u<italic>T</italic>omat<italic>I</italic>c <italic>Q</italic>uality <italic>CO</italic>ntrol), a software that aids
the successive and routine surveillance of sensitivity, speed, and
other QC performance metrics of LC–MS systems. The software
is designed for use with LTQ Orbitrap, Q-Exactive, LTQ FT, and ion
trap instruments manufactured by Thermo Scientific. SIMPATIQCO incorporates
data extraction, MS/MS spectra search, and storage of results within
a PostgreSQL database coupled to an Apache webserver, as well as calculation
of QC metrics that can be visualized remotely from a web browser client.
Taken together the available QC metrics allow monitoring of each step
of data acquisition. The time course of QC metrics can be plotted
over a background colored in green, yellow, or red reflecting optimal
or impaired system performance as learned from the uploaded data by
calculation of robust statistics (Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> and
Figure S-1 in the <xref rid="notes-2" ref-type="notes">Supporting Information</xref>). This helps operators identify suboptimal LC–MS system performance,
prompting an immediate system workup. SIMPATIQCO also offers further
features such as plots of the number of PSMs per minute, lock mass
deviation, peptide elution times, apex intensities, peak widths, and
areas that aid operators in tracking possible causes (Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> and Figures S-1 and S-4 in the <xref rid="notes-2" ref-type="notes">Supporting Information</xref>). The benefit of monitoring the time
course of QC metrics currently becomes more widely recognized. For
instance the Association of Biomolecular Resource Facilities (ABRF)
PRG 2012 study aims at evaluating within-laboratory instrument reproducibility
(study announcement on the webpage <uri xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="http://www.abrf.org/">http://www.abrf.org/</uri>). SIMPATIQCO may be used by research laboratories and core facilities
alike to achieve this goal. The software package is available free
of charge and can be downloaded from the webpage <uri xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="http://ms.imp.ac.at/">http://ms.imp.ac.at/</uri> together with installation instructions and a manual. We hope that
SIMPATIQCO will help proteomics laboratories achieve and maintain
optimal quality of proteomics data acquisition.</p>

      <p>While the performance of liquid chromatography (LC) and
mass spectrometry (MS) instrumentation continues to increase, applications
such as analyses of complete or near-complete proteomes and quantitative
studies require constant and optimal system performance. For this
reason, research laboratories and core facilities alike are recommended
to implement quality control (QC) measures as part of their routine
workflows. Many laboratories perform sporadic quality control checks.
However, successive and systematic longitudinal monitoring of system
performance would be facilitated by dedicated automatic or semiautomatic
software solutions that aid an effortless analysis and display of
QC metrics over time. We present the software package SIMPATIQCO (<italic>SIMP</italic>le <italic>A</italic>u<italic>T</italic>omat<italic>I</italic>c <italic>Q</italic>uality <italic>CO</italic>ntrol) designed
for evaluation of data from LTQ Orbitrap, Q-Exactive, LTQ FT, and
LTQ instruments. A centralized SIMPATIQCO server can process QC data
from multiple instruments. The software calculates QC metrics supervising
every step of data acquisition from LC and electrospray to MS. For
each QC metric the software learns the range indicating adequate system
performance from the uploaded data using robust statistics. Results
are stored in a database and can be displayed in a comfortable manner
from any computer in the laboratory via a web browser. QC data can
be monitored for individual LC runs as well as plotted over time.
SIMPATIQCO thus assists the longitudinal monitoring of important QC
metrics such as peptide elution times, peak widths, intensities, total
ion current (TIC) as well as sensitivity, and overall LC–MS
system performance; in this way the software also helps identify potential
problems. The SIMPATIQCO software package is available free of charge.</p>

    <title>Introduction</title>
    <p>Proteomics workflows share one essential
requirement: they necessitate appropriate quality control (QC). Stringent
QC not only requires an evaluation of outcomes, rather QC starts with
adequate experimental design; it incorporates monitoring of processes,
protocols, and reagents; and it includes aspects such as adequate
training of personnel and a surveillance of the proper functioning
of instrumentation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>−<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref></sup> For proteomics workflows, QC must be established
at four steps: sample preparation, liquid chromatography (LC), mass
spectrometry (MS), and data interpretation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref></sup> A recent study showed that a major reason for the failure of a number
of laboratories to reliably identify proteins present in a relatively
simple test sample was due to inadequate data processing; the same
study suggested that this could be overcome by standardized operating
procedures involving appropriate protocols for data interpretation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref></sup> This is reassuring as a bioinformatics data interpretation
workflow, once established, can be maintained easily because software
algorithms continue to work reproducibly with moderate requirement
for maintenance.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>−<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref></sup> In contrast, all the other above-mentioned steps
are subject to variation from experiment to experiment, and suboptimal
system performance needs to be identified and corrected promptly.
For this reason, software which facilitates an effortless monitoring
of the performance of LC and MS systems is highly desirable.</p>
    <p>Improvements in LC and MS instrumentation contribute to the remarkable
performance of today’s LC–MS equipment, empowering researchers
to implement novel experimental protocols. However, challenging applications
require measures to ensure constant and optimal system performance.
Highly sophisticated QC approaches were reported previously such as
the NIST MSQC pipeline, which outputs 46 QC metrics,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref></sup> or QuaMeter a software which can compute up to 42 QC metrics
for instruments from different vendors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref></sup> QC software has also been reported for the detection of LC runs
that constitute outliers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref></sup> and for computation
and visualization of QC metrics from individual LC runs,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref></sup> and a real-time QC solution for monitoring electrospray
quality and LC backpressure was described recently.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref></sup> However, to our knowledge no currently available QC software
allows an automated upload of QC runs to a dedicated server postacquisition,
followed by seamless computation of QC metrics based on peptide identifications
and instrument parameters, storage of QC results in a database, and
the possibility for convenient plotting of the time course of QC metrics
via a web browser. Such a longitudinal analysis of QC data from multiple
LC runs could potentially reveal suboptimal LC–MS system performance
as a deviation outside the range of a QC metric when the LC–MS
system is operating under optimal conditions.</p>
    <p>We therefore developed
SIMPATIQCO (<italic>SIMP</italic>le <italic>A</italic>u<italic>T</italic>omat<italic>I</italic>c <italic>Q</italic>uality <italic>CO</italic>ntrol), a software suite specifically designed to aid routine longitudinal
monitoring of QC metrics and troubleshooting when using LTQ Orbitrap,
Q-Exactive, LTQ FT, and LTQ instruments. SIMPATIQCO is a server-based
application, designed to process raw files from the above-mentioned
Thermo Scientific instruments that can be uploaded either manually
(individually or in batch) via a web browser interface or in an automated
manner via a “hot folder” (Windows network share or
ftp). As Xcalibur can be configured to run a batch file postacquisition,
raw files can be copied instantaneously from mass spectrometers in
the laboratory to the “hot folder” on the SIMPATIQCO
host for automatic processing. SIMPATIQCO then extracts information
from the raw file, starts a Mascot search to identify spectra, and
calculates QC metrics. Results are stored in a database and can be
viewed for individual QC runs as well as plotted over time via a web
browser interface from any computer in the laboratory.</p>
    <p>To demonstrate
the successful usage and general utility of the software suite, we
present longitudinal QC data from six instruments and four laboratories
in the <xref rid="notes-2" ref-type="notes">Supporting Information</xref> (Figure S-1).
Three of the four laboratories installed a SIMPATIQCO server in-house,
while one laboratory uploaded data to a SIMPATIQCO server installed
and operated by one of the other laboratories (which is an option
for laboratories that do not have the resources to maintain the server
themselves).</p>
    <p>We also propose an LC–MS quality control
workflow based on the routine surveillance of QC metrics with two
types of QC samples that are intercalated with regular samples to
monitor two disparate aspects of overall system performance: a sample
of very low complexity designed to monitor sensitivity using an analyte
(peptide) concentration only modestly above the limit of detection
(LOD) of a system performing close to optimum; and another sample
of very high complexity that poses a challenge to the speed of data
acquisition.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref></sup> Metrics derived from these
samples thus reflect the sensitivity as well as the speed and overall
performance of the LC–MS system. Of note, SIMPATIQCO can be
configured to accommodate other types of samples, as disparate QC
samples are in use within the community. Indeed, some of the above-mentioned
participating laboratories preferred to use different standard proteins
and synthetic peptides and different concentrations in their QC samples.</p>
    <p>The purpose of SIMPATIQCO is to provide a set of key QC metrics
that are generated in an effortless manner and that can be displayed
conveniently. SIMPATIQCO facilitates a longitudinal surveillance of
the time course of system performance and within-laboratory reproducibility,
and it helps pinpoint potential suboptimal system performance. Identification
of outliers with regard to the performance metrics should prompt an
immediate enquiry so that the reason for deviant performance can be
identified and resolved. In this way, SIMPATIQCO may aid proteomics
laboratories achieve and maintain optimum quality of data acquisition.</p>
  </sec>
  <sec sec-type="methods" id="sec2">
    <title>Methods</title>
    <p>SIMPATIQCO was developed for deployment (installation)
on a Windows computer. Raw files from QC runs intercalated with regular
samples are uploaded to a server. SIMPATIQCO extracts data such as
ion injection times, TIC, and lock mass information, and estimates
the overfill or underfill ratio of the automatic gain control (AGC)
target value for each spectrum.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref></sup> MS/MS
spectra are submitted to a Mascot server for peptide identification.
SIMPATIQCO then calculates QC metrics that reflect the performance
of LC, electrospray, and MS such as peak widths and areas, peptide
elution times and intensities, TIC, the number of identified peptide–spectrum
matches per minute, and the sequence coverage of “proteins
of interest”. For each QC metric the range indicating optimal
system performance is learned from the data and displayed using a
background band colored in green, whereas yellow or red colored bands
highlight deviant system performance. We calculate robust statistics
on QC metrics, eliminating the requirement to manually remove outliers
(“bad runs”). Results are stored in a PostgreSQL database.
PHP scripts and Apache webserver allow comfortable display of results
from any computer in the laboratory.</p>
    <p>A description of the QC
samples and the LC and MS methods used by the four laboratories is
provided in the <xref rid="notes-2" ref-type="notes">Supporting Information</xref>,
illustrating that SIMPATIQCO is compatible with different QC work
flows established in various laboratories. A detailed overview of
the components and design of the SIMPATIQCO software package is also
provided in the Supplementary Materials and Methods section within
the <xref rid="notes-2" ref-type="notes">Supporting Information</xref>. Further information,

    <title>Results and Discussion</title>
    <p>Obtaining mass spectrometry
data for state-of-the-art proteomics studies requires QC measures.
In our view, the key to achieve and maintain optimum data quality
is successive, routine, and if possible automated rather than sporadic
and manual monitoring of system performance. In the following we present
a QC workflow as well as a software package aimed to aid the maintenance
of constant and optimum LC–MS system performance.</p>
    <p>Traditionally
the LC has been a major source of concern, and close surveillance
of LC performance is certainly an important prerequisite to ensure
high quality proteomics data. However, in our experience there is
likewise a requirement to monitor the performance of the MS instrumentation
as closely as that of the LC. For instance with the newer generations
of Orbitrap instruments that have enhanced sensitivity partly due
to increasing the overall gas throughput into the system,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref></sup> there may be the need to clean various components
of the instrument more often in order to maintain optimum performance,
as deposition of particles onto components of the ion optics can lead
to a decrease in ion transmission.</p>
    <p>Both LC and MS instruments
offer a variety of instrument-specific system tests. These tests may
provide very valuable hints during troubleshooting. For instance,
the latest version of Velos Orbitrap instrument software (Tune 2.7
SP1) offers several diagnostic procedures that have been added to
assist in determining whether a deposition of charged particles is
occurring and which part of the ion optics most likely has the contamination.
However, several types of system evaluation procedures on Orbitrap
instruments may require switching from the nanosource to the ESI source,
interrupting measurements in addition to the time required for the
tests themselves. For this reason system tests are costly to perform
on a daily or more than daily basis. In addition there is a risk that
the mounting and unmounting of system parts to perform these tests
might lead to a deterioration of system performance aside from the
time requirements. Cleaning procedures and the associated bake-out
of the instrument lead to prolonged instrument downtime, so that there
is a requirement to estimate appropriate timing of such maintenance
procedures. We therefore reasoned that it would be desirable to have
a system evaluation test at hand that can be performed without any
need to interrupt the running LC–MS system.</p>
    <p>We hence
suggest that the more time-consuming instrument-specific tests such
as those mentioned above be performed only at defined time points
dedicated to system maintenance and during setup or troubleshooting
of an LC–MS system. In these situations, considerable time
and effort is invested into optimizing system performance. Manual
evaluation of raw files and analysis with tools such as rawMeat (<uri xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="http://vastsci.com/rawmeat/">http://vastsci.com/rawmeat/</uri>), NIST MSQC,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref></sup> QuaMeter,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref></sup> LogViewer,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref></sup> and MaxQuant<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref></sup> can
provide valuable information at this stage. In addition parameters
for methods should be tested in order to evaluate their effect on
system performance. These time-consuming optimization steps are necessary
because monitoring the time course of performance metrics can only
be regarded as an indicator of optimum system performance when the
values of the metrics under optimal conditions have been established
in the first place. After these initial steps, we suggest a routine
analysis of two types of QC samples in short time intervals to monitor
QC metrics such as sensitivity as well as speed and overall performance
of the entire LC–MS system. The QC samples are measured intercalated
within the regular experiments, and analyzed automatically with the
help of SIMPATIQCO so that there is no interruption of system operation.</p>
    <p>The general concept is based on the consideration that relevant
system alterations involving a significant change in system performance
should lead to a change of QC metrics derived from either or both
of the two QC samples. As we want the QC samples to indicate whether
the LC–MS system is in an adequate status for measuring actual
samples, the choice of the two QC samples is such that one QC sample
is designed to evaluate sensitivity (QC 1) whereas the other one is
intended to monitor overall system performance and speed (QC 2). The
choice of a suitable amount of the QC 1 sensitivity sample is important.
One may first perform a dilution series to establish the LOD and then
decide to inject an amount only modestly above this value. When the
injected amount of QC 1 sample is too high, the test would constitute
a less sensitive indicator of impaired system performance. However
a concentration that is too low would also be suboptimal because this
would lead to on/off observations rather than a more robust performance
required for the calculation of meaningful performance statistics
on the QC metrics.</p>
    <p>Specifically the two QC samples that we suggest
are as follows:<list list-type="simple"><list-item><label>1.</label><p>A sensitivity analysis, typically based
on measuring a small amount of a well-defined sample such as, e.g.,
1 fmol of BSA, 2.5 fmol of a mixture of 10 phosphopeptides, and 500
fmol of cytochrome <italic>c</italic> over a short, e.g., a 0.5 h
gradient time (see Supplementary Materials and Methods section of
the <xref rid="notes-2" ref-type="notes">Supporting Information</xref>). We suggest
to measure this “QC 1” sample whenever there have been
alterations to any part of the LC–MS system, after calibration
of the MS (change to ESI source), and in general at least once or
if possible several times per day.</p></list-item><list-item><label>2.</label><p>A performance and speed analysis, usually based on the
injection of a highly complex sample such as 0.1 μg or 1 μg
of HeLa measured over a longer gradient time (for instance 3 h). This
“QC 2” sample is measured at least once per week, whenever
there have been alterations to any component of the LC–MS system,
and before the analysis of biological samples that require high speed
of acquisition and optimal overall performance.</p></list-item></list></p>
    <p>Other types of QC samples such as, e.g., other proteins,
synthetic peptides spiked at different concentrations, <italic>Escherichia
coli</italic>, <italic>Pyrococcus furiosus</italic>, or yeast, are
conceivable and can be configured for automatic analysis with SIMPATIQCO.
A schematic overview of the SIMPATIQCO software suite is shown in
Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>.</p>

      <caption>
        <p>Components and flow of information using
SIMPATIQCO. Two types of QC samples are analyzed on each LC–MS
system: QC 1 contains a simple digested protein mixture (e.g., cytochrome <italic>c</italic>, BSA, and synthetic phosphopeptides) that is measured
1–2×/day for an evaluation of sensitivity and LC metrics
such as peptide retention times. QC 2 is a HeLa digest that is analyzed
1–2×/week to evaluate system speed and overall performance.
After upload of the respective raw files to the SIMPATIQCO server,
QC metrics are calculated and stored in a PostgreSQL database. The
database is linked to a webserver and can be queried to visualize
the time course of QC metrics via a web browser.</p>

    </fig>
    <p>A single SIMPATIQCO server can be used to upload,
analyze, and visualize data from several LC–MS systems (Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> and Figure S-2 in the <xref rid="notes-2" ref-type="notes">Supporting
Information</xref>). The server can be accessed from any web browser
within the local network. The four main menu categories are as follows:
“Raw files” allows access to analyses of individual
uploaded raw files, and manual upload and deletion of raw files. “Time
course” permits visualization of the time course of QC metrics
based on information stored in the database. A virtual logbook can
be accessed under “Log” where the date and a short description
of events such as system maintenance or cleaning of the ion optics
can be entered for each system. “Settings” can be used
to set the URL of the Mascot server used for searching MS/MS spectra
and to configure predefined “Peptide lists” and “Proteins
of interest” as well as “Run-types” and settings
for the calculation of statistics from performance metrics. “Peptide
lists” allow a definition of peptides whose peak elution time,
apex intensity, peak width, and area can be plotted via the “Time
course” menu. “Proteins of interest” define
proteins for which the sequence coverage is shown when clicking on
a raw file in the “Raw files” menu, and for which the
time course of sequence coverage can be plotted in the “Time
course” menu. “Run-types” define settings specific
for a certain instrument and QC sample, such as precursor and fragment
ion tolerance, Mascot “instrument type” (ESI trap, ETD
trap, etc.), the FASTA database, enzyme, and Mascot peptide ion score
cutoff. In addition the “Settings” menu allows defining
the time period for the calculation of statistics on QC metrics (default
setting: inclusion of all runs), and whether the green, yellow, and
red background bands should be calculated based on a certain multiple
(e.g., 1×, 2×, or 3×) of the standard deviation or
the median absolute deviation (MAD).</p>
    <p>After data upload, SIMPATIQCO
derives several QC metrics from the raw files, searches MS/MS spectra
via Mascot, and then stores all extracted data and results in a database
that can be queried remotely by a web browser client. This is advantageous
because it provides researchers and technical personnel a convenient
access to the QC data reflecting the current performance of each LC–MS
system in the laboratory. In addition, SIMPATIQCO allows operators
to enter “system maintenance &amp; service messages”
into a virtual logbook, for instance when the S-lens was cleaned or
when a service engineer performed system maintenance work on the instrument.
The respective messages can be superimposed on the time course plots
so that the effect of system maintenance can be related to changes
in the QC metrics (Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). In this way,
SIMPATIQCO can help identify impaired system performance, monitor
whether system maintenance procedures were successful, and thus help
achieve and maintain close to optimum LC–MS system performance
to ensure high quality data acquisition.</p>

the relationship between the two QC metrics and system maintenance
efforts such as venting and cleaning of the S-lens and exit lens (log

BSA sequence coverage but led to an only transient reduction in average
MS<sup>1</sup> injection times) or venting and cleaning of the transfer

    </fig>
    <p>For each QC metric, SIMPATIQCO learns the range
reflecting adequate or inadequate system performance from the uploaded
data. This requires that the LC–MS system was operated under
adequate or possibly optimum conditions for the majority of QC runs.
Via the SIMPATIQCO “Raw files” menu, “bad”
runs can be deleted manually. However it may be difficult to judge
which data points actually represent outliers. We therefore decided
to implement robust statistics to find the range for each metric that
indicates adequate system performance, calculating median and MAD
(median absolute deviation) values as an alternative to average values
and standard deviation. Contrary to average values and standard deviations
that are sensitive to outliers, median values and MAD provide a more
robust estimation of adequate system performance that is insensitive
to outliers. This strategy therefore renders manual outlier removal
unnecessary. The default setting is that these statistics are calculated
for all LC runs of a certain run type that have been uploaded to the
database. However as soon as a time period that likely reflects “optimum
system performance” has been identified, operators may define
and configure this period in the “Settings” menu as
a fixed reference time for calculation of statistics of QC metrics
such as median, MAD, average values, and standard deviation. In this
way, the above-mentioned statistics reflect the ranges during “optimum
system performance”. For longitudinal monitoring of the time
course of QC metrics, the values of the respective metric are plotted
against a colored background where a green color band indicates optimum
system performance (median ± MAD) whereas deviant system performance
is highlighted by yellow (between 1 and 2 × MAD) or red color
(outside 2 × MAD). These plots of the time course of QC metrics
allow convenient and rapid pinpointing of adequate or likely suboptimal
system performance.</p>
    <p>SIMPATICO automatically calculates and displays
the following QC metrics:<list list-type="simple"><list-item><label>1.</label><p>Metrics for which the time course can

    <p>The above-mentioned metrics are calculated and can be
visualized for both types of QC runs. However, we define peptide lists
only for the “sensitivity” QC 1 sample because the calculation
of retention times is more precise for this sample. Taken together,
these QC metrics provide a quick overview and help in monitoring the
entire LC–MS system, including performance of the LC, electrospray,
and MS.</p>
    <sec id="sec3.1">
      <title>Metrics Monitoring LC</title>
      <p>LC performance can be evaluated
via the peak apex retention times and intensities, peak widths, and
peak areas of peptides on definable “peptide lists”
(Figure S-1 in the <xref rid="notes-2" ref-type="notes">Supporting Information</xref>). These metrics are mandatory to monitor particularly when reproducible
retention time and constant ionization efficiency are required, e.g.,
for label-free quantification.</p>
      <p>There are myriads of reasons
for shifts in retention times such as alterations in solvent solutions,
temperature shifts, dead volume, and leaking connections. In general
malfunctioning of almost every part of the LC may lead to a change
in retention times; for this reason this metric is a valuable measure
of LC performance. Retention time shifts may also indicate that the
LC fails to generate an adequate flow rate, e.g., because of partial
occlusion of the trap column or the analytical column that the system
cannot compensate. In these cases, a change in the pressure curves
on the LC can confirm the cause. The large amount of cytochrome <italic>c</italic> (500 fmol) in the QC 1 sample permits a rapid inspection
of cytochrome <italic>c</italic> peptide retention times with LC software
whenever a UV detector is used. The “peptide list” feature
of SIMPATIQCO allows monitoring of this metric even without a UV detector
directly from mass spectrometry data. Additional usage of a UV detector
may still be helpful, e.g., for the identification of peak broadening
due to dead volume in fluidic connections between the UV cell and
the electrospray emitter. Moreover “peptide lists” permit
monitoring the retention time, e.g., of the phosphopeptides in the
QC 1 sample whose concentration would be too low to be detectable
on the UV trace.</p>
      <p>In addition, peak widths can be plotted for
peptides on a SIMPATIQCO “peptide list”. Again there
are many causes for peak broadening such as the presence of post-column
dead volume or a deterioration of the analytical column. In the absence
of a UV detector, SIMPATIQCO “peptide lists” provide
a possibility to monitor peak widths, which are an excellent indicator
of LC system performance.</p>
      <p>Monitoring peptide peak intensities
may also provide an indirect indication of impaired LC performance
and peak broadening that typically goes along with a lowering of peak
intensities. Alternatively, decreased peak intensities and peak areas
may suggest either an incorrect amount of injected sample or sample
loss on the part of the LC, or a problem on the part of the MS such
as less effective ionization or loss of ions before reaching the detector
or loss of detector sensitivity.</p>

    <sec id="sec3.2">
      <title>Metrics Monitoring Electrospray</title>
      <p>Electrospray quality
and stability can be evaluated indirectly by its impact on MS<sup>1</sup> and MS/MS ion injection times, number of acquired MS<sup>1</sup> and MS/MS scans, and suppressed (or absent) peak intensities
and areas of peptides on SIMPATIQCO “peptide lists”.
All these metrics can be plotted over time to help provide information
including the spray quality and stability. In addition, MS<sup>1</sup> and MS/MS TIC as well as the ratio “(%) of target value”
can be plotted over the retention time for individual raw files. High
ion injection times, low number of MS<sup>1</sup> and MS/MS scans,
a low TIC, and the presence of fluctuations of TIC between MS<sup>1</sup> scans can suggest problems with electrospray, and will often
prompt an exchange of the electrospray emitter. High injection times,
low number of MS<sup>1</sup> and MS/MS scans, and low TIC can also
be a sign of electron multiplier gain calibration being out of calibration.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec3.3">
      <title>Metrics Monitoring MS Sensitivity and Overall Speed and Performance</title>
      <p>For the QC 1 sensitivity sample that includes cytochrome <italic>c</italic>, BSA, and 10 phosphopeptides, plotting the sequence coverage
of BSA is recommended in the first place, as this value reflects overall
LC–MS system sensitivity. The status of a system may be considered
as appropriate for an analysis of, e.g., routine samples (such as
the identification of proteins from immunoprecipitation or tandem
affinity purification experiments) when the BSA sequence coverage
is adequate. QC 1 samples can be measured with disparate types of
fragmentation techniques, e.g., collision-induced dissociation (CID),
electron transfer dissociation (ETD), or higher energy collisional
dissociation (HCD) depending on the methods used in the ensuing regular
samples.</p>
      <p>Time course plots suggest that the average MS<sup>1</sup> ion injection time (calculated over the entire QC 1 run) may also
constitute a sensitive indicator of MS system performance. An increase
of the average MS<sup>1</sup> ion injection time can be reverted by
appropriate actions such as instrument calibration, or cleaning of
the contaminated parts of the ion optics (Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). In a series of several QC 1 runs the average MS<sup>1</sup> ion injection time already increased while the BSA sequence coverage
still remained within the range of stochastic variation, suggesting
that in certain situations the average MS<sup>1</sup> ion injection
time may constitute an even more sensitive indicator of subtle changes
before a drop in sensitivity becomes apparent (Figure S-3 in the <xref rid="notes-2" ref-type="notes">Supporting Information</xref>). We therefore monitor
both BSA sequence coverage and the MS<sup>1</sup> ion injection time
closely to schedule the appropriate maintenance or MS system tests
for an evaluation of possible contamination of the ion path when the
average MS<sup>1</sup> ion injection time starts to rise or when the
BSA sequence coverage drops below normal.</p>
      <p>As QC 1 sensitivity
samples are analyzed once or even more than once per day, the metrics
derived from these samples reflecting LC performance, electrospray,
and MS sensitivity are monitored closely.</p>
      <p>The QC 2 speed and
performance sample, a HeLa digest, is analyzed at least once per week
and in addition before an analysis of complex samples that require
optimum system speed. Similar to QC 1 samples, QC 2 runs can be performed
separately for each type of fragmentation method used for measuring
regular samples on the respective instrument (e.g., CID, ETD, or HCD).
The QC 2 sample is a complex protein digest, providing complementary
information with regard to system acquisition speed and performance
(Figure S-1 A in the <xref rid="notes-2" ref-type="notes">Supporting Information</xref>). The number of peptide-spectrum matches and identified proteins
indicate whether the LC–MS system is in an appropriate condition
for the analysis of complex samples. Hence these numbers constitute
a sensitive indicator of overall LC–MS system performance for
such samples.</p>
      <p>MS<sup>1</sup> and MS/MS ion injection times can
also be plotted over the retention time of a QC 2 raw file to determine
how frequently the ion injection time reached the maximum value, suggesting
that the AGC target value might not have been reached for the respective
scan. In addition SIMPATIQCO calculates “(%) of target value”,
an estimator of the number of ion charges present in each scan divided
by the AGC target value. More information on this metric can be found
in the <xref rid="notes-2" ref-type="notes">Supporting Information</xref>.</p>
      <p>Finally,
the average lock-mass deviation may serve as an indicator when the
next mass calibration should be scheduled.</p>
      <p>QC runs are repeated
when outliers are observed so that impaired system performance should
become apparent as a series of outliers. Whenever the pattern of the
time course of QC metrics suggests suboptimal performance, an investigation
of possible causes is undertaken. SIMPATIQCO also assists with this
task. For instance, one may wish to plot the lock mass<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref></sup> deviation, MS<sup>1</sup> TIC, the number of PSMs identified
per minute, and the <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> of triggered
precursor ions over the course of the QC run (Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>).</p>
      <fig id="fig3" position="float">

          <p>Lock mass deviation from a QC 1 sensitivity run (CID): peculiar
pattern, plateaus indicate that lock mass was not detected (A). TIC

      </fig>
      <p>Although SIMPATIQCO can assist in finding the reason
of suboptimal system performance, in many situations LC-specific and
MS-specific system evaluation tests need to be performed to find out
the actual cause. In severe cases, prolonged MS<sup>1</sup> ion injection
times are observed even when spraying calibration mixture solution
with the ESI source mounted. SIMPATIQCO also offers the possibility
to upload such data, for instance 100 off-line acquired MS<sup>1</sup> scans of a calibration mixture. A special type of QC-sample “run-type”
can be defined for such data and configured so that the data is not
searched with Mascot. When such data sets are uploaded on a regular
basis, SIMPATIQCO allows convenient monitoring of the time course
of average ion injection times of MS<sup>1</sup> scans of a calibration
mixture acquired off-line with the ESI source, which should be below
0.1 ms on Velos Orbitrap instruments (Figure S-4 in the <xref rid="notes-2" ref-type="notes">Supporting Information</xref>).</p>
      <p>Among MS-specific
system evaluation procedures, the so-called “Multipole Flight
Time evaluation” test, now called the “Source Optics
Flight Time evaluation” test, along with the “MP0 Flight
Time evaluation” test, can help provide an indication as to
whether there is a need to clean some element of the source ion optics
(including the S-Lens, Exit Lens, MP00, Lens 0, or MP0). In cases
where cleaning of the source optics does not lead to a sustained improvement
of the results of the QC metrics monitored by SIMPATIQCO, other parts
of the ion optics can be considered as a cause. In this case another
system evaluation procedure called the “Ion Optics Charging
Evaluation” can help pinpoint a contaminated device along the
entire optics path including the Exit Lens, MP00, Lens 0, MP0, Lens1,
MP1, Gate Lens, Front Lens, and Center Lens, by sequential exposure
to a negative ion beam. The Center Lens between the high and low pressure
cells can also be evaluated via the “transfer efficiency evaluation”
or “transfer lens calibration check”. Notably, appropriate
tuning of multipole offsets particularly with regard to MP0 can have
a strong effect on resisting contamination effects. With Tune 2.7
SP1, inadvertent setting of low voltages due to inappropriate tuning
is prevented to ensure robust ion transmission even in case of moderate
contamination.</p>
      <p>The first samples analyzed after starting the
LC–MS system again following troubleshooting and maintenance
procedures should always be further QC samples. At times, more than
one cleaning approach may be required until the source of impaired
system performance can be identified and resolved (Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>), which should then become apparent as long-term
sustained optimal performance, e.g., with regard to BSA sequence coverage
and MS<sup>1</sup> ion injection times and other performance metrics.</p>

    <title>Conclusion</title>
    <p>We developed SIMPATIQCO (<italic>SIMP</italic>le <italic>A</italic>u<italic>T</italic>omat<italic>I</italic>c <italic>Q</italic>uality <italic>CO</italic>ntrol), a software that aids
the successive and routine surveillance of sensitivity, speed, and
other QC performance metrics of LC–MS systems. The software
is designed for use with LTQ Orbitrap, Q-Exactive, LTQ FT, and ion
trap instruments manufactured by Thermo Scientific. SIMPATIQCO incorporates
data extraction, MS/MS spectra search, and storage of results within
a PostgreSQL database coupled to an Apache webserver, as well as calculation
of QC metrics that can be visualized remotely from a web browser client.
Taken together the available QC metrics allow monitoring of each step
of data acquisition. The time course of QC metrics can be plotted
over a background colored in green, yellow, or red reflecting optimal
or impaired system performance as learned from the uploaded data by
calculation of robust statistics (Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> and
Figure S-1 in the <xref rid="notes-2" ref-type="notes">Supporting Information</xref>). This helps operators identify suboptimal LC–MS system performance,
prompting an immediate system workup. SIMPATIQCO also offers further
features such as plots of the number of PSMs per minute, lock mass
deviation, peptide elution times, apex intensities, peak widths, and
areas that aid operators in tracking possible causes (Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> and Figures S-1 and S-4 in the <xref rid="notes-2" ref-type="notes">Supporting Information</xref>). The benefit of monitoring the time
course of QC metrics currently becomes more widely recognized. For
instance the Association of Biomolecular Resource Facilities (ABRF)
PRG 2012 study aims at evaluating within-laboratory instrument reproducibility
(study announcement on the webpage <uri xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="http://www.abrf.org/">http://www.abrf.org/</uri>). SIMPATIQCO may be used by research laboratories and core facilities
alike to achieve this goal. The software package is available free
of charge and can be downloaded from the webpage <uri xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="http://ms.imp.ac.at/">http://ms.imp.ac.at/</uri> together with installation instructions and a manual. We hope that
SIMPATIQCO will help proteomics laboratories achieve and maintain
optimal quality of proteomics data acquisition.</p>
