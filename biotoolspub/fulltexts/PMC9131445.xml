      <p>A simplistic assumption
in setting up a competition assay is that
a low affinity labeled ligand can be more easily displaced from a
target protein than a high affinity ligand, which in turn produces
a more sensitive assay. An often-cited paper correctly rallies against
this assumption and recommends the use of the highest affinity ligand
available for experiments aiming to determine competitive inhibitor
affinities. However, we have noted this advice being applied incorrectly
to competition-based primary screens where the goal is optimum assay
sensitivity, enabling a clear yes/no binding determination for even
low affinity interactions. The published advice only applies to secondary,
confirmatory assays intended for accurate affinity determination of
primary screening hits. We demonstrate that using very high affinity
ligands in competition-based primary screening can lead to reduced
assay sensitivity and, ultimately, the discarding of potentially valuable
active compounds. We build on techniques developed in our PyBindingCurve
software for a mechanistic understanding of complex biological interaction
systems, developing the “CLAffinity tool” for simulating
competition experiments using protein, ligand, and inhibitor concentrations
common to drug screening campaigns. CLAffinity reveals optimum labeled
ligand affinity ranges based on assay parameters, rather than general
rules to optimize assay sensitivity. We provide the open source CLAffinity
software toolset to carry out assay simulations and a video summarizing
key findings to aid in understanding, along with a simple lookup table
allowing identification of optimal dynamic ranges for competition-based
primary screens. The application of our freely available software
and lookup tables will lead to the consistent creation of more performant
competition-based primary screens identifying valuable hit compounds,
particularly for difficult targets.</p>

    <title>Introduction</title>
    <p>Sensitive,
parallelizable, and miniaturized competition experiments
are commonly used in the primary screening phase of early drug discovery
which aims at identification of hit compounds from, usually, medium
to large sized libraries of small molecules.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>−<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref></sup> Exemplarily, a standard setup may begin with a target
protein incubated with a fluorescently labeled ligand of known affinity.
A signal such as fluorescence anisotropy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref></sup> may then be measured and correlated to the abundance of a protein–ligand
complex. Small molecules contained in screening libraries are termed
inhibitors for their potential to inhibit the protein–ligand
interaction by competing to occupy the same shared binding site on
a target protein. To be clear with our used naming conventions, we
refer to “ligand” as the probe molecule from which a
readout is taken, relating to its bound or unbound status (e.g., a
fluorescently labeled small molecule, peptide, or similar), and “inhibitor”
to be a molecule with the potential to compete with and inhibit this
protein–ligand interaction by occupying a shared binding site.
Screening library compounds are added at a common concentration of
10 μM. Higher concentrations around 50 μM may be more
appropriate for fragment screens if solubility permits. These compounds
are added either to the labeled ligand solution before a target protein
is added or to the preformed complex after a certain incubation time
to ensure equilibrium is achieved. With an increase or decrease of
the signal from an instrument transformed into a measurement of the
fraction ligand in complex with the target protein, dissociation of
the protein–ligand complex caused by the inhibitor competing
for the same binding site as the free labeled ligand can be monitored.
Setting up competition experiments in this way uses the labeled ligand
as a probe, through which the behavior of potential inhibitors in
a screening library can be inferred, assuming both molecules bind
exclusively to the same site on the target protein. A naive assumption
in planning these screening assays would be that maximum sensitivity
is achieved with a weakly binding ligand which is easy to compete
with. However, characteristics of the competition system lead to practical
considerations including instrument detection limits and the need
for efficient use of reagents, making this assumption incorrect. The
target protein and labeled ligand complex formation at a 1:1 stoichiometry
is dependent on the concentration of protein present, the fundamental
dissociation constant of the interaction, and the concentration of
the labeled ligand. Increasing protein concentration and keeping a
fixed concentration of the labeled ligand produce a hyperbolic binding
curve with the complex concentration asymptotic to a maximum value.
If we were determined to increase the fraction ligand bound (complexed
ligand versus free ligand) at a given affinity, in order to produce
a larger readout change on the addition of an inhibitor, we may consider
increasing the ligand concentration while keeping the protein concentration
constant. In addition to risking detector saturation or entering a
nonlinear response range for the detector, this approach increases
the amount of the free unbound ligand more than the bound ligand.
Alternatively, increasing the protein concentration while holding
the labeled ligand constant brings with it its own disadvantage; the
abundance of free protein not bound to the ligand from which the signal
is derived as a function of complex formation also increases. Inhibitor
binding to free protein results in no detectable readout change, leading
to a reduction in assay sensitivity. These primary screening assays
assume complete equilibrium of the binding system. While the impact
of incomplete equilibrium on competition experiment readouts is well
documented,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>−<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref></sup> the complex characteristics and interaction between
ligand affinity and competition assay sensitivity are best described
at equilibrium.</p>
    <p>A highly cited drug discovery technology paper
by Huang provides
a breakdown of the above considerations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref></sup> and even goes further to state that “a fluorescent ligand
of highest affinity” should be selected for competition experiments.
Clearly, using high affinity ligands leads to a reduction in the amount
of protein needed to achieve the required fraction ligand bound in
the absence of an inhibitor (see <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.jcim.2c00285/suppl_file/ci2c00285_si_001.pdf">Supporting Information Figure S1</ext-link>). However, it also becomes harder for a competitive
inhibitor to displace it. We have encountered firsthand misinterpretations
of Huang’s advice, which is given in the context of competition
experiments being used to determine inhibitor <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> values, rather than in the context of primary screens. Primary
and secondary screening assays have different objectives, with the
first optimized to give a clear yes/no indication of binding and prioritizing
these compounds for secondary follow-up assays attempting accurate <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> value determination. No primary screening
assay can stand alone and typically sit in a pipeline of orthogonal
assays designed to exploit assay characteristics to minimize cost
and effort. Full understanding of the characteristics and behavior
of this first primary screening step impacts the entire pipeline.
In a perfect assay setup in which even the lowest affinities may be
detected, there are no false negatives. A hit compound can only appear
as a false negative in the context of experimental variability and
noise affected by assay sensitivity.</p>
    <p>To examine the impact of
following Huang’s advice without
further investigation of the parameters of the assay planned for primary
screening, we turned to simulation.</p>
  </sec>
  <sec id="sec2">
    <title>Experimental Methods</title>
    <p>Simulations were programmed and performed in Python<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref></sup> (v3.7.1), making use of our already derived
functions present in the PyBindingCurve<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref></sup> package for simulation, fitting, and analysis of protein–ligand
binding systems at equilibrium. These functions, specifically, direct
analytical solutions to a 1:1:1 competition, were included in our
open source tool CLAffinity, which is publicly available from a GitHub
repository (<uri xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://github.com/stevenshave/competition-label-affinity">https://github.com/stevenshave/competition-label-affinity</uri>) housing open source software for simulation and interrogation of
competition-based primary screening systems or installable from the
Python package index via the pip tool. The code and examples found
in the GitHub source repository can be used to replicate all calculations,
plots, and animations exhibited in this manuscript, as well as the
accompanying <xref rid="notes1" ref-type="notes">Supporting Information</xref> and <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.jcim.2c00285/suppl_file/ci2c00285_si_002.mp4">video</ext-link>.</p>
    <p>To examine if Huang’s assertion
to always use the highest
available affinity ligand for <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> value
determination also applies to primary screening, we set constraints
and used conditions often applied in high-throughput screens.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref></sup> These are as follows: (i) to achieve a detectable
signal, we assume the ligand is present at a concentration of 10 nM
and labeled with a dye excitable at a common wavelength/laser line
(e.g., 543 or 633 nm) with a reasonably strong quantum yield. This
10 nM labeled ligand concentration is typically found in fluorescence-based
techniques and defined by equipment and physical limitations. (ii)
We further assume that a strong “fraction ligand bound”
signal is achieved when 70% of the ligand binds the protein in the
absence of an inhibitor. All observations and conclusions drawn are
valid at different percentages of a target ligand bound which may
be more appropriate depending on the type of instruments, detection
technologies, brightness, and photostability of dyes used in the experiments
of any screening lab. For example, a 70% fraction ligand bound may
be appropriate for fluorescence anisotropy-based techniques, but fluctuation
analysis techniques<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref></sup> working at a single
molecule resolution, like fluorescence cross-correlation spectroscopy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref></sup> (FCCS) and two-dimensional fluorescence intensity distribution analysis,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref></sup> run in anisotropy mode (2D-FIDA-r), and TR-FRET readout systems
may allow working with sub-10% fraction ligand bound assay systems.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref></sup></p>
    <p>For any given ligand <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> value, we may
calculate the required protein concentration to achieve a given fraction
ligand bound (see <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.jcim.2c00285/suppl_file/ci2c00285_si_001.pdf">Supporting Information eq S1</ext-link>). The direct analytical solution for a 1:1:1 competition (protein:ligand:inhibitor)
is taken from our PyBindingCurve software, where rearrangement of
mass balances resulted in a third order polynomial describing the
system. One polynomial root is never physically relevant and can be
discarded. From the remaining two roots, one is correct when the <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> value of the ligand is less than that of the
inhibitor, and the other is correct when it is greater.</p>
    <p>The
Python functions defining the target fraction ligand bound
and 1:1:1 competition make use of the MPMath<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref></sup> (v1.1.0) library for arbitrary precision arithmetic, ensuring numerical
stability and accuracy are retained even when dealing with large magnitudes
of differences in concentrations and <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> values. Additionally, Numpy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref></sup> (v1.19.3)
is used extensively to perform array operations, and Matplotlib<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref></sup> (v3.3.2) is used to generate plot graphics and
animations.</p>

    <title>Results and Discussion</title>
    <p>Pharma companies routinely screen
compound archives against targets
at a standard concentration of 10 μM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref></sup> and a target fraction ligand bound of ∼0.7. Knowing these
values, we simulated the fraction ligand bound (readout) when inhibitors
of varying target protein affinities are introduced. These simulations
are visualized in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref></xref>, with the <italic>x</italic>-axis representing the labeled
ligand <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> value expressed as p<italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> (−log<sub>10</sub>(<italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub>)) and transitioning from low to high affinity (<italic>x</italic>-axis). This produces a characteristic “valley”
response for the fraction ligand bound. At lower affinities with p<italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub>s up to 7 (<italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> &gt;
100 nM), we see evidence for Huang’s argument to always use
the highest affinity ligand available, even here in primary screening.
With increasing labeled ligand affinity, less target protein is required
to achieve a 0.7 fraction ligand bound. The assay becomes more sensitive,
and a larger drop in the signal for a given inhibitor affinity is
detected. However, as ligand affinity is further increased beyond
p<italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub>s of 7 (<italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> &lt; 100 nM), the dynamic range of the assay response is reduced
by difficulty in displacing the labeled ligand. Primary high-throughput
screens typically look to identify low micromolar to medium nanomolar <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> value inhibitors with good assay sensitivity,
the signal used to produce a clear yes/no decision through definition
of an assay threshold value at three standard deviations away from
the mean of negative controls. This highlights compounds for further
confirmatory secondary assays and <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> value
determination. Primary screens should therefore aim to use ligands
which produce the largest response, through drastic reduction of a
fraction ligand bound for a range of inhibitor <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> values.</p>

    <p>For clarity, we emphasize that we are not comparing assay techniques
or technologies for their establishment of traditional 3-sigma threshold
values for hit calling but rather addressing a more generally applicable
choice of labeled ligand affinity to maximize the assay response dynamic
range, increasing the readout separation between negative and positive
controls.</p>
    <p>For the system described in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref></xref>, the largest signal change for a range of
inhibitor <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> values is achieved with ligand
p<italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> of 6.975 (105 nM <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub>).</p>
    <p>To illustrate the impact of choosing a ligand
with an optimal <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> value in a primary
screen, we consider two
situations, first using a ligand with a medium-to-high affinity of
the 100 nM <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> value to the target protein
and another ligand with a very high affinity of the 1 nM <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> value to the target protein. In both experiments, we
hold the concentration of the labeled ligand at 10 nM and use the
standard library compound screening concentration of 10 μM.
The added inhibitor which we attempt to detect and infer binding through
the assay readout has a target protein <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> affinity value of 1 μM. The experiments produce the following
results: (i) Using a labeled ligand with a <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> affinity value of 100 nM for a target protein requires 240
nM protein to achieve a 0.7 fraction ligand in complex in the absence
of an inhibitor. The addition of an inhibitor results in 0.181 fraction
ligand in complex, with a readout reduction of 74.1%. (ii) Using a
labeled ligand with a <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> affinity value
of 1 nM for a target protein requires 9.3 nM protein to achieve a
0.7 fraction ligand in complex in the absence of an inhibitor. The
addition of an inhibitor results in a 0.348 labeled ligand bound,
with a readout reduction of 50.3%. Depending on assay Z-prime–and
the associated assay threshold value, the hit may be missed in the
assay utilizing the high affinity 1 nM ligand. Translation of the
assay to use highly sensitive techniques with a reduced background,
such as confocal fluorescence fluctuation analysis at single molecule
resolution or time-resolved fluorescence energy transfer,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref></sup> may enable assays which can operate with a reduced
target fraction ligand bound in the absence of an inhibitor. With
a lower target fraction ligand bound, the difference in signal reduction
caused by ligands of different target affinities widens. To demonstrate
this, we consider two more experiments, identical to those described
above, but using a target fraction ligand bound in the absence of
an inhibitor of 0.1 instead of 0.7. The medium-to-high affinity 100
nM <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> value ligand and the high affinity
1 nM <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> value ligand would produce responses
of 0.011 and 0.051 fraction ligands bound, respectively, in the presence
of an inhibitor. This is equal to 89.2% and 48.5% of the readout’s
dynamic range for each assay, further increasing the likelihood of

    <p>The maximally
sensitive competition-based primary screening assay
would utilize the low target fraction ligand bound, high inhibitor

around the 100 nM <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> value for commonly
used assay parameters.</p>

the <italic>x</italic>-axis for inhibitor p<italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub>. This allows at-a-glance visualization of signal reduction
for a range of inhibitor affinity values and is arguably more intuitive
for practical assay readout visualization and for understanding expected
responses. Within <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>, we can see that with a weakly binding 100 μM <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> value ligand (top solid line, without markers),
a small signal reduction hardly disrupting a 0.7 fraction ligand bound
is present over all inhibitor <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> values.
Clearly, this is of no use in a competition assay using standard concentrations.
We start to see an increased response when using a ligand with a <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> value of 10 μM to the target (line marked
with +). We detect a significant signal reduction over a range of
inhibitor <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> values from 1 μM (a
p<italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> of 6) and lower. From values of 100
nM <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> (a p<italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> of 7), increased ligand affinity only serves to shift the response
curve to the right, reducing the readout change for low affinity inhibitors.
This 100 nM ligand <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> value limit represents
the characteristic rise encountered at the right-hand side of the
response valley in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref></xref>.</p>

    <p>Using simulation, we have demonstrated the impact that suboptimal
ligand affinities can have in competition-based primary screens, leading
to reduced assay sensitivity and fewer hits. For secondary assays,
such as those used to determine exact inhibitor <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub>s and where Huang’s advice is intended to be applied,
a strong, clear, binary yes/no response is the opposite of what is
required. Here, maximal separation between inhibitors of different
affinities is required. The almost binary response shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref></xref> using a 100 nM <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> value ligand (p<italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> of 7) would make it difficult to distinguish among 1, 10, and 100
nM inhibitor affinities as the fraction ligand bound is reduced to
almost zero in all cases. Huang notes that using a 100 nM <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> value ligand “will limit the high end
of resolvable inhibitor potency to be roughly 100 nM”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref></sup> in competition experiments aiming to determine
inhibitor affinities. Additionally, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref></xref> may be used to intuitively understand Huang’s
advice in the context of secondary assays for <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> determination. Poor separation between inhibitor <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub>s is evident for low affinity ligands. The
higher the ligand affinity, the more differentiable inhibitors of
varying <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub>s are, with a large separation
present between inhibitors on the right-hand upwardly sloping side
of the plot denoting smaller changes in the fraction ligand bound
upon introduction of inhibitors.</p>

    <title>Conclusion</title>
    <p>High
attrition rates in drug discovery have refocused efforts away
from traditionally successful and easily “druggable”
target classes. There is now a desire to “drug the undruggable”
and tackle challenging targets like protein–protein interactions
characterized by very high affinities, increasing performance and
sensitivity requirements for primary screening assays. Application
of simulation techniques outlined in this application note can contribute
to the creation of more performant primary screens and help with detection
of low affinity inhibitors of “undruggable” targets.
Any measures taken to increase sensitivity contribute to expanding
the chemical diversity of hits which may be further translated into
novel leads.</p>
    <p>We believe that application of our CLAffinity tool
presented in
this application note will prevent the inappropriate application of
Huang’s rule which was intended for secondary confirmatory
assays, not primary screening assays. These confirmatory or follow-on
assays are in stark contrast to primary screens, where a clear binary
yes/no may be desired indicating the detection of inhibitors over
a wide range of affinities. We have demonstrated that choosing high
affinity ligands can lead to the rejection of compounds with signals
under unnecessarily high detection limits. This thorough understanding
of competition systems allows tuning or detuning of assays toward
the primary screening phase for high sensitivity or secondary screening
phases involving SAR studies with detailed affinity determinations.
We suggest experimental setup and planning is always based on simulations
including known ligand <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> values along
with detection limitations imposed by the screening technologies.
We stay mindful of other assay pitfalls such as solubility and readout
issues like inner filter effects which are not addressed by our simulation
of perfect assay system behavior and readouts. The open source Python
code used to produce all simulations and plots in this manuscript,
