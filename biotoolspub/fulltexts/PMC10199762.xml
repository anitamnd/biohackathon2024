      <title>Abstract</title>
      <p>The ability to identify B-cell epitopes is an essential step in vaccine design, immunodiagnostic tests and antibody production. Several computational approaches have been proposed to identify, from an antigen protein or peptide sequence, which residues are more likely to be part of an epitope, but have limited performance on relatively homogeneous data sets and lack interpretability, limiting biological insights that could otherwise be obtained. To address these limitations, we have developed epitope1D, an explainable machine learning method capable of accurately identifying linear B-cell epitopes, leveraging two new descriptors: a graph-based signature representation of protein sequences, based on our well-established Cutoff Scanning Matrix algorithm and Organism Ontology information. Our model achieved Areas Under the ROC curve of up to 0.935 on cross-validation and blind tests, demonstrating robust performance. A comprehensive comparison to alternative methods using distinct benchmark data sets was also employed, with our model outperforming state-of-the-art tools. epitope1D represents not only a significant advance in predictive performance, but also allows biologically meaningful features to be combined and used for model interpretation. epitope1D has been made available as a user-friendly web server interface and application programming interface at <ext-link xlink:href="https://biosig.lab.uq.edu.au/epitope1d/" ext-link-type="uri">https://biosig.lab.uq.edu.au/epitope1d/</ext-link>.</p>

    <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
    <p>B-cell epitopes encompass a class of antigenic determinants that are dependent on the amino acid arrangement on the surface of the antigen protein structure. Contiguous stretches of residues along the primary sequence form linear epitopes, whereas non-adjacent residues, though nearby placed due to protein folding, form the discontinuous (or conformational) epitopes. Both forms impose a significant role upon the binding with its counterparts, the Immunoglobulins, that could be either in the form of membrane bound receptors or as antibodies, which are versatile macromolecules capable of recognizing foreign threats [<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p>
    <p>Identifying and selecting the appropriate epitope that could elicit an effective immune reaction in the host, and thus creating a protective memory immunity, is the fundamental basis of vaccine development [<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Being an extremely complex and multifactorial process, the amount of time spent in vaccine development is on average a decade, and it can cost over 2 billion dollars for it to reach the market [<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Consequently, effectively aiding the selection of epitope candidates with computational techniques holds a promising role in this field in terms of substantial decreasing development time and cost.</p>
    <p>Linear B-cell epitopes account for only 10% among the two classes and although <italic toggle="yes">in silico</italic> prediction methods have significantly evolved over the past decades, varying from amino acid propensity scale scores [<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7â10</xref>], to combining physicochemical attributes and more robust machine learning techniques [<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11â15</xref>], their performance is still biased toward specific data sets, leading to limited generalization capabilities. A recently published approach [<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] attempted to address these gaps by systematically cross-testing several previous benchmark data sets on their machine learning model and thus proposing two final models: a generalist and other specifically tailored for viral antigens. However, the general model was trained on data predominantly from HIV epitopes, which could be potentially non-representative, with the virus-specific model still performing modestly, reaching a maximum Matthewâs Correlation Coefficient (MCC) of 0.26 on blind tests.</p>
    <p>To fill these gaps, here we propose an explainable machine learning classifier based on the largest experimentally curated linear epitope data set so far, covering a large span of organisms, presenting robust performance with different validation techniques, in addition to two new feature representation approaches: graph-based signatures of protein sequences labeled with physicochemical properties and organism ontology identification of each input peptide, leveraging the classifier distinction between epitopes and non-epitopes.</p>

    <title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title>
    <p>epitope1D has four general steps, as can be seen in <xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>: (1) Data collection and curation; (2) Feature Engineering: evaluation of currently used features and newly proposed features to represent peptide sequences; (3) Explainable Machine Learning: assessment of several supervised learning algorithms and further comparison among previous work using different data sources and explainability resources and (4) Web server interface: development of an easy-to-use platform for end users.</p>

      <title>Data collection</title>
      <p>Well-established reference data sets were used to train, test and validate supervised learning algorithms, as a classification task. A comprehensive list of benchmark data sets, derived from ABCPred method [<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], BCPred [<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], AAP [<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], LBtope [<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and iBCE-EL [<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], was further employed to impartially evaluate the predictive power of our selected model against the original ones and state-of-the-art tools such as EpitopeVec [<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], BepiPred [<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] and BepiPred-2.0 [<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. A detailed review of them is located in Supplementary Materials available online at <ext-link xlink:href="http://bib.oxfordjournals.org/" ext-link-type="uri">http://bib.oxfordjournals.org/</ext-link>. Subsequently, given that most data sets were outdated (dated from 5 to 16Â years ago), we have curated a newly updated data set derived from IEDB database [<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], which will be used as the final basis for our model. <xref rid="TB1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> summarizes the information of all data used in this work, and further analysis can be read below.</p>

      <title>Curating a new experimental benchmark data set</title>
      <p>We have curated a new set derived from the IEDB database aiming to reflect data availability on experimentally confirmed linear B-cell epitopes and also non-epitopes. Our main motivation arises because most of the previously mentioned data sets were collected more than 10Â years ago, and their negative class sets (non-epitope sequences) were not empirically proven. In addition, epitope sequences derived from the Bcipep database [<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] can impose an obstacle to model generalization, given that around 80% of them refer only to HIV. Therefore, organism information from each sequence in the new data is taken into account to assess whether the taxonomy can aid distinguish epitopes from non-epitopes, in a variety of subspecies.</p>
      <p>The curation process of the new experimental data set comprises the following steps: (1) Download all possible (any host and disease) linear peptides of B-cell epitopes and non-epitopes as of June, 2022; (2) Keep only the epitopes and non-epitopes confirmed in two or more different assays; (3) Consider solely the peptides with length between 6 and 25 amino acids, since 99% of linear epitopes range within these lengths [<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]; (3) Remove sequences that were present in both classes simultaneously; (4) Exclusively retain entries that contain information about the source organism; (5) Perform a systematic sequence redundancy removal step using CD-HIT [<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], at different thresholds (95%, 90%, 80% and 70%) to assess the overall learning efficiency within high to medium similarity. Considering that a single antigen may contain several different epitope stretches that lead to distinct antibody bindings, it is worth accommodating the majority of available epitope sequences belonging to each antigen protein [<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p>
      <p>The final set, with a maximum of 95% similarity, is composed of 154,899 data points, in which 25,902 are epitopes, encompassing 1,192 sub-species that were aggregated into a higher taxonomy parent organism lineage of 20 classes, each belonging to the superkingdom of Virus, Eukaryota or Bacteria. The final set was randomly divided into a training set with 123,919 data points, in which 20,638 are epitopes (ratio 1:6) and correspond to 80% of the data, and the remaining 20% as an independent test set with 30,980 data points with the same epitope/non-epitope proportion.</p>

      <title>Feature engineering</title>
      <p>To better characterize peptide sequences that might compose an epitope, previously used descriptors as well as novel features were evaluated. To reduce model complexity, a forward stepwise greedy feature selection algorithm was applied [<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] to retain only the most representative set. The description of new proposed features is introduced here, while auxiliary features are described in Supplementary Materials available online at <ext-link xlink:href="http://bib.oxfordjournals.org/" ext-link-type="uri">http://bib.oxfordjournals.org/</ext-link>.

        <title>Graph-based signatures</title>
        <p>We have designed a new graph-based feature, tailored for modeling linear epitopes of flexible length, inspired by the Cutoff Scanning Matrix (CSM) algorithm [<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23â26</xref>]. The key idea was to model distance patterns among residues (nodes) at different distance cutoffs (each distance inducing the edges of a graph), which are summarized in two approaches: cumulative and non-cumulative distributions. Sequence graphs were labeled in two ways: (1) the corresponding scales of hydrophilicity prediction [<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], beta turn prediction [<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], surface accessibility [<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] and antigenicity [<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] and (2) the amino acid physicochemical properties, such as Apolar, Aromatic, Polar Neutral, Acid or Basic, as done previously [<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. <xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref> shows the steps comprising the new graph-based feature.</p>

        <title>Organism identification</title>
        <p>The organism source information, extracted from the IEDB database together with each peptide sequence, is expressed by its ontology identifier deriving from two sources: (1) The Ontobee data server [<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] for the NCBI organismal taxonomy and (2) The Ontology of Immune Epitopes, which is an internal web resource from IEDB that was then converted back to the corresponding NCBI taxonomy term for standardization. This information was used aiming to contribute with epitope identification addressing the pain point in the machine learning process that arises from high heterogeneity in organism classes [<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].

      <title>Machine learning methods</title>
      <p>As epitope identification could be described as a binary classification task, various supervised learning algorithms were assessed using the Scikit Learn Python library [<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. These included Support Vector Machine (SVM), Adaptive Boosting, Gradient Boosting, Random Forest (RF), Extreme Gradient Boosting, Extra Trees, K-nearest neighbor, Gaussian Processes and Multi-Layer Perceptron. In addition, an inherently interpretable method named Explainable Boosting Machine (EBM), a type of generalised additive model and considered as a glassbox model, was assessed via the open-source Python module InterpretML [<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. The goal of interpretable machine learning models is to provide a rationale behind prediction that would allow for meaningful biological insights to be derived, also assisting in the possible biases and errors as well as highly predictive features.</p>
      <p>Performance evaluation for each model was done based on MCC, which is a robust statistical measure appropriate for imbalanced data sets [<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Complementary performance metrics were also used including F1-score, Balanced Accuracy and Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC). Performance between internal validation (<italic toggle="yes">k</italic>-fold cross validation) and external validation (blind tests) was contrasted to infer generalization capabilities.</p>

  <sec id="sec11">
    <title>RESULTS</title>
    <p>Two scenarios of evaluation were considered to assess the ability of epitope1D to accurately identify linear epitopes, based on the data set employed and direct comparison with previous methods. The first comprises the use of well-established benchmarks: the BCPred set, assessed under 10-fold cross-validation, followed by external validation with different independent blind-test sets, as previously described (ABCPred-1, ABCPred-2, AAP, LBtope, iBCE-EL-1 and iBCE-EL-2). This scenario impartially compares the performance of our models with recent developments and identifies feature importance and their current limitations.</p>
    <p>The second scenario consists of our newly curated, large-scale data set extracted from the IEDB database which includes organism information. Data sets filtered at different sequence similarity levels were employed: with internal validation evaluated using 10-fold cross-validation, and models assessed externally via blind tests. Furthermore, recently development methods, including BepiPred-3.0 [<xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], EpitopeVEC and EpiDope, also had their performance assessed on the same blind test to determine differences in performance.</p>

      <title>Comparison with alternative methods using the BCPred data set</title>
      <sec id="sec13">
        <title>Feature representation: What makes up a linear epitope?</title>
        <p>The data set extracted from BCPred, composed of 1402 peptide sequences with a balanced class ratio of 1:1, was used to train and test several supervised learning models as a classification task. Their ability to distinguish between epitopes and non-epitopes was assessed and most predictive features identified. Outstanding features identified in this scenario include: (i) the maximum and minimum value of Antigenicity ratios in terms of amino acid triplets (AAT, measuring how overrepresented some amino acids are in the epitope class of this data set); (ii) the Composition pattern (Composition, Transition and Distribution - CTD) of physicochemical and structural properties (hydrophobicity, normalized van der Waals volume, polarity, secondary structure and solvent accessibility) and (iii) the Graph-based signatures using both types of labeling: physicochemical properties (Acidic, Apolar, Polar Neutral, Basic and Aromatic) and Parker hydrophilicity prediction scale.</p>
        <p>Using the interpretable classifier, EBM, to understand feature importance (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S1</xref> of Supplementary Materials available online at <ext-link xlink:href="http://bib.oxfordjournals.org/" ext-link-type="uri">http://bib.oxfordjournals.org/</ext-link>), we observed that the antigenicity ratio features were in the top three most relevant: the maximum value within a peptide sequence (AAT_max), the interaction amid the maximum and the minimum (AAT_max x AAT_min) and the minimum value (AAT_min); followed by its interaction with specific Graph-based and Composition physicochemical descriptors, such as Apolar:Aromatic-8 (pairs of apolar and aromatic amino acids within a sequence distance cutoff of 8) and the amino acid composition in terms of Hydrophobicity (G1: Polar, G2: Neutral, G3: Hydrophobicity).</p>
        <p>Further exploring interpretability, <xref rid="f3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref> depicts the rationale behind the modelâs decision considering only the topmost significant feature, the maximum AAT value, the cumulative sum of the antigenicity ratio scale for all possible AAT within a peptide sequence. In the top chart, the horizontal axis details the feature range values, while the vertical axis shows the class, with the decision mark between the two classes set to 0 (above zero a higher probability of being an epitope and non-epitope otherwise). A clear decision point has been learned when <italic toggle="yes">AAT_max</italic> ranges from 4 to 6 (more precisely, larger than 5), which is also the average value of this feature for this data set. A possible interpretation of this result, in terms of the data set that includes 20-mer peptides only, can be that if at least five combinations of AAT are overrepresented in the sequence, there is a higher chance of it being an epitope. The bottom chart of the figure depicts the feature value distribution.</p>

      <p>In order to externally validate our model and assess its generalization capabilities, different blind-test sets were presented to the epitope1D (EBM) model as detailed in <xref rid="TB3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> and in <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S2</xref> of Supplementary Materials available online at <ext-link xlink:href="http://bib.oxfordjournals.org/" ext-link-type="uri">http://bib.oxfordjournals.org/</ext-link>, where we can also examine the performance achieved by previous methods such as BepiPred, BepiPred-2.0, EpiDope and EpitopeVec. Significant performance differences were observed for the methods when trained and tested using different data sources (i.e. Bcipep and IEDB databases). For instance, with the AAP data set (originally derived from Bcipep) in the first part of <xref rid="TB3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>, epitope1D and EpitopeVec (both trained using data from Bcipep database) achieved higher performances (MCC of 0.815 and 0.770, respectively) compared to the other methods that were trained using data derived from IEDB database (iBCE-EL, BepiPred and EpiDope). Alternatively, when applying the iBCE-EL testing data set (extracted from IEDB), our model and EpitopeVec achieved lower values of MCC, 0.092 and 0.095, compared to the model trained on data from this source (which reached a MCC of 0.454). However, in this scenario, some models trained using the same data source (e.g. BepiPred, BepiPred-2.0 and EpiDope) did not perform well either.</p>

      <p>Regarding the machine learning process, this behavior raises concerns of potential biases in these data sets or lack of representativeness. Both cases lead to a lack of generalization and can occur due to a variety of reasons, some of which we might conjecture: (i) all previous benchmark data sets listed here were adjusted to a highly balanced ratio for epitope and non-epitope classes, which do not represent the biological truth; (ii) Bcipep databases, as originally stated, are predominantly composed of viruses (HIV predominantly), which induces an underrepresentation of other organisms; (iii) Truncation/Extension approaches, adopted by part of the methods to define a fixed peptide length, change the originally validated epitope sequence and may impose a learning bias toward an artificial set; (iv) The use of non-experimentally validated sequences to populate the non-epitope class, strategy adopted by some of the benchmarks, could lead the machine learning model to learn from imprecise or even erroneous data.</p>

        <title>Feature importance and organism-aware predictions</title>
        <p>To address the potentially unrepresentative nature of the data, we curated an experimentally validated, large-scale data set, integrated with high-level taxonomy organism information that incorporates the three main superkingdoms: Virus, accounting for 83% of the data and enclosed in eight classes (Riboviria, Duplodnaviria, Monodnaviria, Varidnaviria, Ribozyviria, Anelloviridae, Naldaviricetes, Adnaviria), followed by 15% of Eukaryota with five classes (Metamonada, Discoba, Sar, Viridiplantae, Opisthokonta); and 2% of Bacteria with seven classes (Terrabacteria group, Proteobacteria, PVC group, Spirochaetes, FCB group, Thermodesulfobacteria, Fusobacteria), totalising 20 binary categories. Organism taxonomy information was included in the set of features previously used (detailed in <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S3</xref> of Supplementary Materials available online at <ext-link xlink:href="http://bib.oxfordjournals.org/" ext-link-type="uri">http://bib.oxfordjournals.org/</ext-link>), composed of four main categories: Graph-based signatures, AAT Antigenicity ratio, Composition features and Organism taxonomy.</p>
        <p>To better understand individual feature contributions to model outcomes, a post-hoc analysis using the SHAP [<xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] was employed using the RF model. The importance order of each descriptor in this scenario can be understood as a ranked summary depicted in <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S2</xref> of Supplementary Materials available online at <ext-link xlink:href="http://bib.oxfordjournals.org/" ext-link-type="uri">http://bib.oxfordjournals.org/</ext-link>. The Antigenicity ratio group, with AAT maximum and minimum values, are very predictive features with higher values strongly correlating with the epitope class. The next most important feature is part of the Composition group, charge.G3, denoting a higher number of negatively charged amino acids in the epitope class. The fourth most important feature was organism taxonomy, particularly the Riboviria, potentially showing what the model learned as a consequence of the class imbalanced data, where 87% of the Riboviria sequences belong to the non-epitopes, thus correlating the epitope class with organisms other than Riboviria. Graph-based signature features also play an important role to the model decision (e.g. Apolar:PolarNeutral-9 feature), denoting pairs of residues (polar and apolar) far apart from each other in sequence, though contributing to the epitope class (particularly for Riboviria sequence, <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S3</xref> available online at <ext-link xlink:href="http://bib.oxfordjournals.org/" ext-link-type="uri">http://bib.oxfordjournals.org/</ext-link>). To complement the SHAP summary visualization, the impurity-based value (Gini importance) is also being presented in <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S3</xref> available online at <ext-link xlink:href="http://bib.oxfordjournals.org/" ext-link-type="uri">http://bib.oxfordjournals.org/</ext-link>, besides each feature description, as well as the performance of each feature category (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S4</xref> of Supplementary Materials available online at <ext-link xlink:href="http://bib.oxfordjournals.org/" ext-link-type="uri">http://bib.oxfordjournals.org/</ext-link>). The Gini importance of all descriptors sums to 1, thus the higher the value the stronger the contribution to the model decision. Although the sorted descending order presents some slight differences compared with the SHAP ranking, we can again perceive that the top 10 features comprise the Antigenicity group, with around 20% and 17% importance to the AAT_max and AAT_min, followed by 11% of the Graph-based named Apolar:PolarNeutral-9, the Composition group and two of the Organisms, the Riboviria with 3.5% and the Opisthokonta with 1.2%.</p>

        <p>To better visualize model performance and Sensitivity/Specificity tradeoff for all the methods on the blind test, ROC curves were created (<xref rid="f4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>), for the data set filtered at different similarity level cutoffs. The epitope1D curve, displayed closer to the top-left axesÂ in red, reached a significantly better ROC-AUC value of 0.935, compared to 0.618 from EpitopeVEC, plotted just below it in yellow, followed by 0.610 from EpiDope in blue and 0.586 from BepiPred-3.0 in green, nearer the dashed diagonal line (for a 95% similarity cutoffâ<xref rid="f4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). Further analysis with different cutoffs of 90%, 80% and 70% (<xref rid="f4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4BâD</xref>, respectively) applied in the independent testing set are likewise depicted, demonstrating that epitope1D consistently and significantly outperforms all alternative methods, with a small decrease in performance, further highlighting its robustness. In addition, we evaluated the iBCE-EL method using the 70% similarity blind-test set, since this method was originally trained and tested using data from IEDB database with a homology threshold of 70%, which resulted in a MCC value of 0.120 and ROC-AUC of 0.630, compared to 0.440 and 0.822 for epitope1D, respectively, emphasizing the considerable gain in performance due to incremental data and proposed new features.</p>
        <p>The architecture of both EpiDope and BepiPred-3.0 models is based on deep learning approaches with language models; the former applies a pre-trained Embeddings from Language Model, ELMo, that is a character-level CNN to encode the amino acid input sequences followed by LSTM layers, while the later employed a similar strategy, but combining Feed Forward with CNN and LSTM and additionally assessing the model with BLOSUM62 and sparse encodings.</p>

    <title>CONCLUSIONS</title>
    <p>Linear B-cell epitope prediction is yet an extremely challenging task in which the sophisticated biological mechanism underlying the binding among AntibodyâAntigen poses challenges to computational and experimental methods. The majority of previous benchmark data sets dated from up to 15Â years ago, also suggesting a potential bias and lack of organism representativeness, leading to weak to poor generalization capabilities.</p>
    <p>epitope1D fills these gaps via an explainable machine learning method, built on the largest non-redundant experimentally validated data set to date, composed of over 150,000 data points, consisting of a diverse set of organisms within Virus, Eukaryota and Bacteria superkingdoms. epitope1D leverages well-established as well as novel features engineered to model epitopes, including a new graph-based signature to train and test taxonomy-aware and accurate predictors.</p>
    <p>A comprehensive comparison of our method with state-of-the-art tools showed robust performance across distinct blind-test sets, with epitope1D significantly outperforming all methods, thus highlighting its generalization capabilities. We believe epitope1D will be an invaluable tool assisting vaccine and immunotherapy development and have made it freely available to the community as an easy-to-use web interface and API at <ext-link xlink:href="https://biosig.lab.uq.edu.au/epitope1d/" ext-link-type="uri">https://biosig.lab.uq.edu.au/epitope1d/</ext-link>.</p>
