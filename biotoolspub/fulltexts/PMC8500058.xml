      <title>Abstract</title>
      <p>The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 that causes coronavirus disease 2019
(COVID-19) disrupted the normal functioning throughout the world since early 2020 and it
continues to do so. Nonetheless, the global pandemic was taken up as a challenge by
researchers across the globe to discover an effective cure, either in the form of a drug
or vaccine. This resulted in an unprecedented surge of experimental and computational data
and publications, which often translated their findings in the form of databases (DBs) and
tools. Over 160 such DBs and more than 80 software tools were developed, which are
uncharacterized, unannotated, deployed at different universal resource locators and are
challenging to reach out through a normal web search. Besides, most of the DBs/tools are
present on preprints and are either underutilized or unrecognized because of their
inability to make it to top Google search hits. Henceforth, there was a need to crawl and
characterize these DBs and create a compendium for easy referencing. The current article
is one such concerted effort in this direction to create a COVID-19 resource compendium
(COVIDium) that would facilitate the researchers to find suitable DBs and tools for their
research studies. COVIDium tries to classify the DBs and tools into 11 broad categories
for quick navigation. It also provides end-users some generic hit terms to filter the DB
entries for quick access to the resources. Additionally, the DB provides Tracker
Dashboard, Neuro Resources, references to COVID-19 datasets and protein–protein
interactions. This compendium will be periodically updated to accommodate new
resources.</p>

    <title>Introduction</title>
    <p>The coronavirus disease 2019 or COVID-19, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has been declared as a global pandemic by the World Health
Organization in early 2020 (<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). The outbreak is
currently going through multiple waves, costing the lives of more than 3.9 million people
across the globe. The egregious pathogen belongs to the
<italic toggle="yes">C</italic><italic toggle="yes">oronaviridae</italic> family that affects both animal species
and humans (<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Researchers have discerned that the
most probable source of the SARS-CoV-2 are bats and its genome is said to have matching
motifs such as the zinc motifs, DNA-binding domains and helix-loop-helix factors (<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>).</p>
    <p>The response of the scientific community to the pandemic is quite overwhelming and can be
gauged by looking at the statistics of published literature (<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). According to the Dimensions database (DB; <ext-link xlink:href="https://reports.dimensions.ai/covid-19/" ext-link-type="uri">https://reports.dimensions.ai/covid-19/</ext-link>), there are currently half a million
publications associated with COVID-19, and it is poised to increase in the future (<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). This can be visually represented in the form of
month-wise proportions of various publication types as charted in <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>. Certainly, the flow of information in the COVID-19 era is
intensifying and is driven by improved sequencing technologies, computational prediction
algorithms and growing funding opportunities (<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). As
we speak, there are multitudes of novel aspects related to COVID-19 and the SARS-CoV-2
itself that are being unfurled (<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). These scientific findings are often communicated to
the research community in the form of DBs and tool sets that can be easily accessed and/or
deployed to test various pressing hypotheses. Since December 2020, many DBs have been
published either in peer-reviewed journals or preprint servers or are shared on social media
platforms such as Twitter for rapid dissemination of COVID-19-related information (<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). These DBs are based on sequences (both nucleic acid
and protein), structural data, epigenetic data, omics-based data (genetics, proteomics,
transcriptomics, etc.), gene expression (microarray/next-generation sequencing),
interactions, networks, disease-linked pathways and epidemiological data. Nonetheless, these
DBs are highly scattered amidst the present corpus and remain underutilized because of their
inability to appear in primary web searches. Efficient data exchange and management are
central for developing holistic data-driven research and analysis of COVID-19 (<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Ergo, it
becomes imperative to accumulate all the COVID-19 DBs and tools and collate them in one
place to make the data management and referencing easy for the researchers. Various
repositories and compendiums have been prepared to disseminate pivotal knowledge about the
rapidly evolving coronavirus (<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). The most popular compendiums include
AccessClinicalData@NIAID which is a cloud-based data platform that helps in exchanging
reports and datasets from National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID)
COVID-19 and clinical trials for the research community. LitCovid (<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>) allows users to access numerous curated published peer-reviewed
literature on COVID-19, whereas Nextstrain COVID-19 genetic epidemiology (<ext-link xlink:href="https://github.com/nextstrain/ncov" ext-link-type="uri">https://github.com/nextstrain/ncov</ext-link>) is an open-source platform providing
SARS-CoV-2 genome data for different analyses. Although informative, these resources are too
descriptive and lack the logistics required by the users to quickly shortlist DBs and tools/
packages (such as programming language, user interface, specialized DBs, etc.). For
instance, although European Virus Bioinformatics Center (EVBC) Virus Bioinformatics Tools
(<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>) cover a generous breadth of COVID-19-related
tools, their resource list is limited and minimal. Similarly, COVID19 Data Portal (<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>) enlists a minimal set of 33 DBs and atlases. The
COVID-19 Resource Compendium (COVIDium) tries to provide an exhaustive list of resources,
specialized DBs and a COVID-centric tool set and let users make informed choices about the
resources most relevant to their query. It derives inspiration from the European Molecular
Biology Laboratory’s European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI) initiative of open data
sharing via the COVID-19 Data Portal that systematically organizes a spectrum of
COVID-19-related datasets (<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>).</p>

    <p>The COVIDium currently enlists, categorizes and annotates 163 COVID-19-related DBs, 84
tools/packages developed for COVID-19 data analysis, 166 country/region-specific Tracker
Dashboards, 5 neuro resources, 38 COVID-19 dataset resources and more than 18 000
protein–protein interactions (PPIs) collected from various interaction DBs enlisted in
COVIDium. The motivation behind creating this compendium is to enable wider data sharing,
exchange and analysis to help curb the ongoing outbreak of SARS-CoV-2. We believe that this
compendium would serve as a unified resource for COVID-19 researchers, medical practitioners
and pharmaceuticals. The DB will be periodically updated to accommodate new resources.</p>

  <sec id="s2">
    <title>Methodology</title>
    <p>The methodology adopted to construct the COVIDium is described in the following
subsections.</p>
    <sec id="s2-s1">
      <title>Database source mining</title>
      <p>A systematic literature review was carried out irrespective of the literature publication
status to curate a list of DBs and tools/packages related to COVID-19 (<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Appropriate search terms were employed along with
necessary AND and OR Boolean operators as and when required. The key terms included
‘COVID19’, ‘COVID-19’, ‘SARS’, ‘SARS-Cov-2’ and ‘Coronavirus’, combined with keywords
‘Database’, ‘Repository’, ‘Dashboard’ and ‘shinyapp’ for mining DBs and keywords ‘tools’
and ‘packages’ for COVID-19-related tools. The combinations used for querying DBs are
precisely described in <xref rid="app0001" ref-type="app">Annexure I</xref>. The DBs that
were consulted for mining the literature were broadly divided into two levels: primary
resources and additional resources. The primary literature DBs that were consulted include
PubMed (<ext-link xlink:href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/" ext-link-type="uri">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/</ext-link>), KDCovid (<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>), LitCovid (<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>), Collabovid (<ext-link xlink:href="https://www.collabovid.org/" ext-link-type="uri">https://www.collabovid.org/</ext-link>) and PubVenn (<ext-link xlink:href="https://pubvenn.appspot.com/" ext-link-type="uri">https://pubvenn.appspot.com/</ext-link>). The additional resources include bioRxiv,
Embase, Google Scholar and Twitter. The abstracts obtained after querying the primary
resources were reviewed manually by a team of three members. PubVenn helped us to improve
the search by expanding the query terms with relevant Medical Subject Headings (MeSH)
terms. The shiny dashboards were collected manually as well as from a recent work (<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>).</p>
      <p>The additional resources were also manually searched for the relevant literature.
However, Twitter was crawled using ‘rtweet’ R package using search terms (#COVID-19 OR
#SARS-CoV-2 OR #sars-cov-2 OR #Coronavirus 2 OR #NCOV OR #2019NCOV OR #COV AND #Database
OR #shiny OR #dashboard) with a limit of 10 000 tweets. Retweets were not considered in
our curation. The strategy of data source mining is charted in <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>, and a schematic of data extraction, processing and curation
has been depicted in <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary
Figure S1</xref>.</p>

    <sec id="s2-s2">
      <title>Database classification</title>
      <p>Based on the kind of data they present, the curated DBs were classified broadly into 11
categories that include Bibliographic DB, Genomic DB, Protein Sequence DB, Protein
Structure DB, Drug DB, Interaction DB, Epidemiological DB, RNA DB, Pathway DB, Hybrid DB
and Others. For instance, a DB hosting information about the variants, genomic sequences
and phylogeny was wrapped in the umbrella term ‘Genomics DB’. Similarly, if the DB
provided information about the PPI or drugs-related data they were categorized into
‘Interaction DB’ or ‘Drug DB’, respectively. DBs hosting a variety of datasets and were
found to have multipurpose were categorized under ‘Hybrid DB’ [e.g. Outbreak.info and
National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) SARS-CoV-2 Resources]. Finally, the
DBs that were hard to be categorized into the aforementioned categories were tagged
‘Others’. The tools and packages were also classified based on similar criteria. The
standard definitions for each category are defined in <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>.</p>

      <title>Annotation</title>
      <p>The annotation enables more refined and sensitive index term searching within the DB. DB
cross-references are followed and high-level textual annotation is added, describing the
current state of biological knowledge about COVID-19. These data come from a variety of
sources, notably from the primary literature. All the information and knowledge described
in the novel scientific literature has been translated into entries in many different
sections of the COVIDium DB, making it possible to make it one station of information on
COVID-19 without having to manually review the literature on it. The annotation of each DB
and tool was carried out by a team of three members and further cross-verified by the
other members. The potential conflicts were resolved using majority voting rules. An
effort has been made to make the communication of users with DBs well defined and
transparent by providing links to the sources of different DBs present in COVIDium. <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> briefly describes the controlled vocabulary

      <title>Interactome</title>
      <p>To make our DB more useful, we tried to build the interactome of SARS-CoV-2 using DBs we
collected in the ‘Interaction DB’ category. The interactions were obtained from Network
Maps Database (<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>), The BioGRID COVID-19

332 high-confidence interactions (<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). Since each
DB uses its own preferred IDs (gene symbols, protein IDs and generic names), we tried to
primarily make the IDs uniform before combining the interaction information. The UniProt
IDs were converted to respective unique gene symbols using mapIds() function of
AnnotationDbipackage of R (<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). The annotations for
protein to gene ID mapping were obtained from org.Hs.eg.db (v3.11.4). However, the gene
symbols for the virus proteins were obtained (<ext-link xlink:href="https://egonw.github.io/SARS-CoV-2-Queries/" ext-link-type="uri">https://egonw.github.io/SARS-CoV-2-Queries/</ext-link>) and manually added. The
interactions were finally merged and an adjacency list was produced to make an undirected

    <title>Web interface</title>
    <p>The COVIDium consists of six panels namely Databases, Tracker Dashboards, Neuro Resources,
Tools/Packages, Datasets and Interactome.</p>
    <sec id="s3-s1">
      <title>Databases panel</title>
      <p>It classifies 163 COVID-19-related DBs and makes it easy for users to quickly filter the
table based on key terms. The key terms are generalized to make it feasible for all groups
of researchers to use DBs. The users can also download the filtered table should it be
required. The entries in the ‘Databases’ column will redirect the user to the associated
DB. For some DBs, the dataset was either genome obtained from Global Initiative on Sharing
Avian Influenza Data (GISAID) that is not publicly sharable (<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, <xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>), available upon request,
or not available and therefore demarcated as ‘NA’.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="s3-s2">
      <title>Tracker Dashboard panel</title>
      <p>It enlists several country-specific trackers that help keep a track of the current
mortality rate, live reporting of cases, etc. These dashboards also enable users to
download updated datasets and perform epidemiological analysis and demarcate the severely
hit regions at a country level. Most of these dashboards enable end user to download
updated data in real time. Currently, this panel holds Country/Region-specific 166 Tracker
Dashboards (<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>).</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="s3-s3">
      <title>Neuro Resources panel</title>
      <p>It is an effort to enlist the DBs that registers information about the neurological
implications of COVID-19. Broadly speaking, this panel is destined to host resources
related to neurological and neuropsychiatric manifestations and complications of COVID-19
infections. This panel is currently populated with five entries and will be updated
regularly as the field grows.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="s3-s4">
      <title>Tools/Packages panel</title>
      <p>It enlists the tools and packages that are specifically developed by researchers across
the globe to analyze the COVID-19-related data or have been used in COVID-19 research. We
refused to include the general-purpose tools in our compendium; however, this does not
rule out their utility for COVID-19-related research.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="s3-s5">
      <title>Dataset panel</title>
      <p>It aims at enlisting the datasets/data archives we filtered from the literature or found
on GitHub that could be used for integrative analysis or other secondary analysis.</p>

    <sec id="s3-s6">
      <title>Interactome panel</title>

    <title>Applications and utilities of the COVIDium</title>
    <p>The COVIDium would work as a single station for all COVID-19 DBs and tools, allowing
researchers to search, filter, navigate and download SARS-CoV-2-related resources. This
compendium currently stores 163 DB resources on COVID-19. Besides sequences, structures,
interactions, disease, drug, epidemiological and bibliographic DBs, it also includes various
machine-learning and artificial-intelligence-based software tools, analysis tools that aid
in exploring the COVID-19 data in myriad ways. Our COVIDium encapsulates the powerful
resources of literature biological and computational analysis tools that aid in
understanding the COVID-19 and its newly identified seven variants of concerns. <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref> showcases various resources and information that
have been accommodated in COVIDium for understanding COVID-19. Category-wise distribution of
DBs in COVIDium representing the most abundant DB category is depicted in <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S2</xref>.</p>

      </caption>
      <graphic xlink:href="baab057f3" position="float"/>
    </fig>
    <p>By default, for each search, the top 10 results are displayed on the main page, which can
be changed to 25, 50 or even 100 results as defined by the user. Users can freely explore
these different DBs and can also retrieve results by using hit terms such as mutations,
tracker, genomes/genomic sequences, network/interactions/pathways, asymptomatic/symptomatic,
evolution and immune signature. Apart from various DBs, we also have cross-referenced a few
benchmark datasets from some reliable and renowned sources, for instance ‘KAGGLE’, ‘European
COVID-19 Data portal’, ‘COVID-19 data portal’, etc.</p>
    <p>Major applications of our COVIDium are being summarized as follows:</p>
    <list list-type="alpha-lower">
      <list-item>
        <p>‘Current and up-to-date information’: The compendium allows users to fetch and retrieve
the most recent set of resources recorded in the compendium, which are periodically
checked, tracked and updated. Also, users can switch over to the literature category
present in the Database panel and be redirected to the relevant Bibliographic Database
in no time to retrieve articles published on different aspects of COVID-19.</p>
      </list-item>
      <list-item>
        <p>‘Hit-term-based search strategy’: For an easy searching experience, COVIDium allows a
hit-term-based searching strategy option for users to save their time and that they can
have specific and precise search results. This is implemented in the form of Local and
Global Search boxes and has been detailed out in the ‘Use Cases’ section. This way,
users can retrieve the best possible hits for their queries.</p>
      </list-item>
      <list-item>
        <p>‘SARS-CoV-2 datasets’: COVIDium points users to some recognized and verified benchmark
datasets and data archives that can be used for different analyses. Since there are
well-organized data archives already present such as COVID19 Data Portal (<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>) and COVID ARC (<ext-link xlink:href="https://covid-arc.loni.usc.edu/" ext-link-type="uri">https://covid-arc.loni.usc.edu/</ext-link>), this panel is restricted to redirecting
users to these well-organized archives.</p>
      </list-item>
      <list-item>
        <p>‘Interactive network interactions and pathways’: Users can easily fetch and retrieve
various network associations, interactions, pathways and specific SARS-CoV-2 interactors
by simply selecting the ‘Interaction DB’ category from the drop-down menu available in
the Database panel of COVIDium. These are combined interactions collated from different
dedicated network and pathway DBs for COVID-19 and can be downloaded in the form of an
adjacency list that can be visualized later in Cytoscape by the users as undirected
graphs. Users can also subset the adjacency list before download for the desired
COVID-19 genes.</p>
      </list-item>
      <list-item>
        <p>‘Tracking COVID-19’: Surveillance, tracking and monitoring of COVID-19 have been a mess
since it originated in 2020. Nevertheless, COVIDium provides epidemiological resources
for our users to track and check the current status of the COVID-19 worldwide in real
time in a country/region-specific manner. Some of these dashboards also provide raw data
that can be downloaded to reuse to make predictive epidemiological models in a
region-specific manner.</p>
      </list-item>
      <list-item>
        <p>‘Fetching COVIDium data’: We provide an option ‘Download’ where interested users can
download raw data or be redirected to the download page shall there be multiple files
from COVIDium. The complete processed data tables (DTs) and networks can be downloaded
from the GitHub repository.</p>
      </list-item>
    </list>
    <sec id="s4-s1">
      <title>Use cases</title>
      <p>Here we provide cases illustrating how COVIDium can quickly let you narrow down your
search results.</p>
      <sec id="s4-s1-s1">
        <title>Searching by keywords</title>
        <p>Since COVIDium’s data are rendered in the form of DTs, users can use Local Search
(Column Based Filtering) to filter DBs, tools and dashboards of interest, or use the
Global Search option in the top right corner of each table to subset the entire table.
For example, one can use Local Search to search the ‘Database’ DTs for the term ‘Drug’,
which will subset the table based on the occurrence of the ‘Drug’ keyword while limiting
the search to that column only (See <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>).
Partial matching using Global Search is also an alternative, as demonstrated in <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>, where we employ ‘Pr’ to subset the DTs. This
will show all the records (rows) having a word containing ‘Pr’ such as ‘Protocols’,
‘Protein’ or name of the DB itself such as ‘PROSPERO’. These keyword searches are case
insensitive.</p>

        <title>Searching by regex</title>
        <p>COVIDium searches are further made powerful for advanced users by enabling regex
searches to subset the DTs. The regex might come handy when the user wishes to subset
the entire DT such as ‘Tools/ Packages’ panel table using ‘pattern matching’. For
instance, a user proficient in R might be interested in tools/packages written in R and
therefore can subset the DTs locally using ‘Programming Language’ Local Search box and
regex\bR\b, where ‘\b’ will treat R as a single word instead of a character. This will
ensure that ‘Perl’-based tools do not surface in the results (See <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>).</p>

        <title>Protein–protein interactions</title>
        <p>COVIDium also provides processed PPI data integrated from different resources using a
uniform protein nomenclature. The interactions are rendered in the form of adjacency
list, which can be copied or downloaded into .csv, xlsx or pdf format. The .csv file
then can be loaded to Cytoscape to visualize the network.</p>

      <title>Limitations of COVIDium</title>
      <p>COVIDium is a cross-referencing DB. It structures the existing DBs’ knowledge
methodically and redirects the user to the relevant DB, data archives, tools, workflows,
references, etc. instantly. However, it possesses some limitations too. COVIDium currently
cannot perform Cross-Database queries. Cross-Database queries require collaboration and
permissions to read data from the DB of interest. Since the number of DBs was high and we
had limited resources with no funding, we restricted ourselves to cross-referencing
presently. Besides, not all DBs have application programming interface and some DBs use
GISAID data which cannot be shared publicly and require access requests (<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, <xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>).</p>

    <title>Conclusion</title>
    <p>The COVID-19-related research resulted in an unprecedented surge of experimental data and
computational data, and publications translated their findings in the form of various DBs
and tools. Here, we presented a COVIDium that was developed by crawling DBs, tools and
trackers from various sources. Over 160 such DBs, more than 80 software tools, around 170
country-specific tracker dashboards and over 18 000 PPIs were crawled, characterized,
annotated and stored in COVIDium for easy referencing.</p>
    <p>In summary, COVIDium is a powerful resource that helps in bringing together published and
unpublished DBs, tools, packages, datasets and dashboards to students, clinicians and
researchers, in a curated and well-annotated form. Our compendium is unique as it compiles,
for the first time, an exhaustive list of COVID-19-related resources in one place without
the user requiring to perform a separate literature search for data, DB and tools
identification. Such a resource can help users in quick decision-making and filtering
pertinent resources for hypothesis generation and data analysis. With this resource, we hope
to catalyze the pace of COVID-19 research and prevent ‘Reinvention of The wheel’ by
informing the user about the existing DBs, pre-processed data, analysis pipelines and
workflows, thereby saving them time from redundant efforts. The enlisted DBs in COVIDium
will hopefully drive clinical and scientific implications in a positive direction. The
COVIDium will be periodically updated and maintained by the team members to accommodate
missing or newly developed resources.</p>
