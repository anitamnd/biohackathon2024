    <abstract>
      <p>Cerebrovascular Reactivity (CVR) provides an assessment of the brain’s vascular reserve and has been postulated to be a sensitive marker in cerebrovascular diseases. MRI-based CVR measurement typically employs alterations in arterial carbon dioxide (CO2) level while continuously acquiring Blood-Oxygenation-Level-Dependent (BOLD) images. CO2-inhalation and resting-state methods are two commonly used approaches for CVR MRI. However, processing of CVR MRI data often requires special expertise and may become an obstacle in broad utilization of this promising technique. The aim of this work was to develop CVR-MRICloud, a cloud-based CVR processing pipeline, to enable automated processing of CVR MRI data. The CVR-MRICloud consists of several major steps including extraction of end-tidal CO2 (EtCO2) curve from raw CO2 recording, alignment of EtCO2 curve with BOLD time course, computation of CVR value on a whole-brain, regional, and voxel-wise basis. The pipeline also includes standard BOLD image processing steps such as motion correction, registration between functional and anatomic images, and transformation of the CVR images to canonical space. This paper describes these algorithms and demonstrates the performance of the CVR-MRICloud in lifespan healthy subjects and patients with clinical conditions such as stroke, brain tumor, and Moyamoya disease. CVR-MRICloud has potential to be used as a data processing tool for a variety of basic science and clinical applications.</p>

    <title>Introduction</title>
    <p>Cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR) is an important index of the brain’s vascular health. It measures the ability of cerebral blood vessels to dilate or constrict in response to vasoactive stimuli, which provides complementary information to steady-state vascular parameters, such as cerebral blood flow (CBF) and cerebral blood volume (CBV). In recent years, the measurement of CVR has been increasingly reported in a range of applications, such as arterial stenosis [<xref rid="pone.0274220.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0274220.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], stroke [<xref rid="pone.0274220.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0274220.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], small vessel disease [<xref rid="pone.0274220.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0274220.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], brain tumors [<xref rid="pone.0274220.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0274220.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], traumatic brain injury [<xref rid="pone.0274220.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0274220.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], substance abuse [<xref rid="pone.0274220.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], normal aging [<xref rid="pone.0274220.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0274220.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] and dementia [<xref rid="pone.0274220.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0274220.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. More recently, CVR as a candidate biomarker of vascular diseases has also been applied in multi-center settings, such as in the MarkVCID study [<xref rid="pone.0274220.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] and the INVESTIGATE-SVDs study [<xref rid="pone.0274220.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p>
    <p>Two of the most commonly used methods for MRI-based CVR mapping are CO2-inhalation CVR (CO2-CVR) and resting-state CVR (RS-CVR) [<xref rid="pone.0274220.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. In CO2-CVR, the subject inhales a mild hypercapnic gas mixture (e.g., 5% CO2, 21% O2, and 74% N2) as an explicit stimulus, while Blood-Oxygenation-Level-Dependent (BOLD) MRI images are continuously acquired [<xref rid="pone.0274220.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Since CO2 is a potent vasodilator, the BOLD signal is expected to increase with CO2 inhalation and, by quantifying the extent of BOLD signal change, a measure of CVR can be obtained. RS-CVR is an emerging CVR method that exploits spontaneous fluctuations in breathing rate and depth, which alters arterial CO2, and determines the corresponding BOLD signal change in the resting-state BOLD time series [<xref rid="pone.0274220.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0274220.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. While CO2-CVR has the advantage of a well-defined stimulus paradigm and more robust signal, RS-CVR possesses the benefit of not requiring additional apparatus related to CO2 inhalation inside the MRI scanner. Both CVR methods have unique values in different applications.</p>
    <p>To date, CVR data processing is considered a niche skill and most studies of CVR have used in-house scripts or software [<xref rid="pone.0274220.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], creating challenges for reproducible and repeatable research and for researchers and clinicians with less skills in software programming. Therefore, a processing pipeline that is automatic and provides a wide spectrum of quantitative image and regional outputs is highly valuable and can potentially facilitate broader applications of this promising technique. Cloud-based computation represents a new model of neuroimage processing [<xref rid="pone.0274220.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Compared to the traditional model of downloadable software package and local computer processing, the cloud-based platform utilizes software, computational, and storage resources on the remote computer for data processing and therefore mitigates the requirements on the user computer [<xref rid="pone.0274220.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The user inputs are typically provided by uploading raw images to the cloud server as well as entering key acquisition parameters on a web interface. Similarly, the user can access the outputs of the processing by downloading text, table, or image files from the cloud website. Previous work has developed several cloud-based tools for the processing of T1 segmentation, diffusion, and arterial spin labeling (ASL) MRI, demonstrating the feasibility and applicability of cloud computing in the context of medical image processing.</p>
    <p>In this work, we developed a cloud-based, publicly accessible tool for the processing of CO2-inhalation and resting-state CVR MRI data, referred to as CVR-MRICloud. Here we describe the framework of the pipeline, processing algorithms, and its outcomes, and demonstrate the performance of the tool on representative data of brain aging and cerebrovascular diseases.</p>

      <p>An implementation of this pipeline can be found at <ext-link xlink:href="https://braingps.mricloud.org/cvr.v5" ext-link-type="uri">https://braingps.mricloud.org/cvr.v5</ext-link>, with the computer architecture illustrated in <xref rid="pone.0274220.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>. A front-end web server is responsible for providing functionalities to allow interactions with a user, such as file upload, version selection, and entry of image acquisition parameters. The required image file format is ANALYZE (.hdr and.img) which does not contain protected health information (PHI) and thus, is compatible with Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) regulations. The input data are processed by a separate computational server, which then transfers outcome parameters to the front-end server for the user to download. The users can only access the outcome parameters from the data they had uploaded.

The blue, high-frequency curve represents the raw CO2 recording. This recording is typically obtained by placing a small sampling tubing near the mouth or nose of the subject during the experiment, while a CO2 monitor located outside the MRI room samples the air with a pump and analyzes for CO2 content. The sampling frequency is dependent on the specific CO2 monitor used in the experiments, but it generally ranges from 10 to 200 Hz. Each cycle in the curve represents one breathing cycle, with CO2 content of the inhaled air corresponding to the troughs and that of exhaled air corresponding to the peaks. The period of curve is dependent on the breathing rate and typically ranges from 3 to 8 seconds.</p>

        <p>The red curve in <xref rid="pone.0274220.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A</xref> is referred to as end-tidal CO2 (EtCO2) time course. It reflects the amount of CO2 in the lung, which approximates the CO2 content in the arterial blood. EtCO2 is typically obtained from the raw CO2 recording by extracting peaks, i.e. CO2 in the exhaled air, on the curve.</p>
        <p><xref rid="pone.0274220.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3B</xref> shows a flowchart of methods to extract EtCO2 from the CO2 recording. We first smoothed (using 100ms-moving window) and resampled the CO2 recording into a pre-set frequency of 10Hz. Given that typical breathing frequency is &lt;0.3Hz, this sampling rate is expected to be sufficient for the computation of CO2 peaks in the breathing cycle. An additional benefit of the resampling is that the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the CO2 time course is improved.</p>
        <p>Next, two separate algorithms were used to identify the peaks in the CO2 time course. We found that each algorithm has advantages in detecting peaks under certain signal patterns, thus by using both algorithms and selecting the higher value between the two outcomes the robustness of the EtCO2 computation pipeline can be enhanced. Algorithm I, referred to as the Scale-Space algorithm [<xref rid="pone.0274220.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], uses a single criterion: <italic toggle="yes">v</italic>(<italic toggle="yes">n</italic>) = <italic toggle="yes">max</italic>[<italic toggle="yes">v</italic>(<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> − 1) <italic toggle="yes">v</italic>(<italic toggle="yes">n</italic>) <italic toggle="yes">v</italic>(<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> + 1)], to detect all local maxima in the CO2 time course. Then, the time course was smoothed and the local maximum detection algorithm was repeated. If a particular local maximum was still identified after smoothing, its “peak likelihood score” was increased. This process is repeated 30 times and a time course of “peak likelihood score” was obtained. A threshold was applied on the “peak likelihood score” time course to obtain a binary vector of CO2 peaks. The corresponding EtCO2 values at these peaks are also obtained.</p>
        <p>Algorithm II, referred to as the Smooth-Cross algorithm, first applies a moving-average filter with window size of 10s. The window size of 10s was chosen as a trade-off between the degree of smoothing and the sensitivity during the room air-CO2 transition periods. The intersection points between the moving-averaged and the original traces then allow the dividing of the CO2 trace into breath-by-breath segments. The peak CO2 value within each segment can then be identified and the corresponding time was labeled to form a binary vector, similar to the outcome of Algorithm I.</p>
        <p>Next, the peak CO2 vector obtained by each algorithm was subject to a five-point median filtering so that any peaks as a result of partial breath were removed. Since the intervals of breathing cycle are variable and can be different across individuals, we then interpolated the outputs into a time series of 1Hz. These steps were performed on the outcomes of Algorithms I and II separately.</p>
        <p>Finally, the higher value from Algorithms I and II at each point in the interpolated time series was selected to form the EtCO2 curve (<xref rid="pone.0274220.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3B</xref>), as the EtCO2 curve represent the top envelope of the CO2 trace.</p>

        <title>Temporal alignment between BOLD and EtCO2 time courses</title>
        <p>Before the EtCO2 curve obtained in the previous step can be used for the estimation of CVR, it must be first aligned with the BOLD time course. This is needed because the EtCO2 signal is measured from the lung and the BOLD signal is measured from the brain, and thus a signal shift between them is expected based on physiology. This processing step therefore aims to temporally align the EtCO2 to BOLD time-course. Preprocessing of the BOLD data used SPM12 and included motion correction and spatial smoothing (with 8mm FWHM Gaussian kernel). A whole-brain mask was also obtained by segmenting the mean BOLD image and adding together the gray matter, white matter and CSF masks, which was then applied to the BOLD image series to calculate a whole-brain-averaged BOLD time course.</p>
        <p>The alignment of EtCO2 and whole-brain BOLD time courses used the following General Linear Model:

The double bar accent indicates a zero-meaned signal. <italic toggle="yes">s</italic> is the time shift of the EtCO2 time course and is detailed below.</p>
        <p>In order to find an appropriate time shift to align these two signals, a two-step process is performed, as illustrated in <xref rid="pone.0274220.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4</xref>. First, the GLM analysis described in Eq [<xref rid="pone.0274220.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] was repeated multiple times, after a step-wise shift (<italic toggle="yes">s</italic>) of the EtCO2 time course relative to BOLD for all possible values (i.e., from 0 to EtCO2 time course duration–BOLD time course duration). The step size was set to be 1 second, in accordance with the sampling rate of the EtCO2 data. After each shift, the EtCO2 time course was resampled (linear interpolation) to the BOLD intervals (i.e. TR), the regression was performed, and the residual error from the fitting was recorded. The shift with the minimal residual error was identified and used as a preliminary “optimal shift value” (<xref rid="pone.0274220.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A</xref>). As a second step, a smaller EtCO2 shift step of 100 ms is used and the searching range is set to be +/-5 seconds. The GLM analysis was repeated at each of these finer shift values. The residuals are then fitted to a second-degree polynomial, and the lowest point on the polynomial is used as the final optimal time shift (<xref rid="pone.0274220.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4B</xref>), similar to the work by Donahue et al. [<xref rid="pone.0274220.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. This two-step procedure is expected to yield more reliable optimal shift value than using the first step alone. EtCO2 time course shifted by this optimal value was then used as the regressor in computation of CVR (see below).</p>

        <p>Whole-brain CVR is obtained by a GLM between whole-brain averaged BOLD signal and global-shifted EtCO2, using Eq [<xref rid="pone.0274220.e001" ref-type="disp-formula">1</xref>] above.

Here the average of the bottom 25% EtCO2 time points is considered the baseline EtCO2 value, instead of the minimum, to mitigate the influence of unusual breathing pattern in the experiment (for example, a single deep breath at any time during the experiment can result in very low EtCO2 value).</p>
        <p>Regional CVR is also calculated. A T1-segmentation MRICloud was used to parcellate the brain into different numbers of segments, ranging from 52 to 289 depending on the level of parcellation [<xref rid="pone.0274220.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Once the ROI corresponding to each segment is obtained, the BOLD signal was spatially averaged. The resulting time course was aligned to EtCO2 as described above and subject to GLM analysis in Eq [<xref rid="pone.0274220.e001" ref-type="disp-formula">1</xref>]. Regional CVR was then calculated with Eq [<xref rid="pone.0274220.e001" ref-type="disp-formula">1</xref>]. Note that the EtCO2 curve was aligned to each specific ROI to account for regional variations in the hemodynamic response time, e.g. white matter may have a delayed BOLD response compared to the gray matter [<xref rid="pone.0274220.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>].</p>
        <p>Voxel-wise CVR map was computed using two different methods. One method used the globally-shifted EtCO2 and performed a GLM with voxel-by-voxel BOLD time course. The other method used a voxel-wise-shifted EtCO2 for the GLM analysis [<xref rid="pone.0274220.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. In the voxel-wise-shifted analysis, the global-shifted EtCO2 is used as a starting point and it is then further shifted within a range of -5 to 30s to identify the best shift for each voxel. This search range is relatively narrow to avoid local minimum due to noise and was decided based on previous reports of inter-voxel variations in CO2 response [<xref rid="pone.0274220.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Note that the voxel-wise-shift analysis also yields a “temporal shift map”, which may also contain physiologically useful information similar to bolus arrival time (BAT) map in dynamic-susceptibility-contrast (DSC) and arterial-spin-labeling (ASL) MRI. It should be pointed out that both global and voxel-wise shift approaches have their advantages and disadvantages [<xref rid="pone.0274220.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The global-shifted EtCO2 is the more robust as it is based on the whole-brain averaged BOLD time course and the SNR of the BOLD data is expected to be excellent. On the other hand, voxel-wise-shifted EtCO2 considers regional/inter-voxel heterogeneity; but the signal can be noisy and thus optimal shift obtained may have poor reliability [<xref rid="pone.0274220.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p>
        <p>Additionally, voxel-wise CVR and temporal shift maps were transformed into the individual’s MPRAGE space and the Montreal Neurologic Institute (MNI) standard space. Aside from the absolute value CVR maps, relative CVR maps were also obtained by dividing each voxel by the map’s average value.</p>
        <p>To provide an index of the overall quality of the CVR data, partial correlation coefficient (CC) between the whole-brain BOLD time course and the global-shifted EtCO2 after factoring out the linear drift, as described in Eq [<xref rid="pone.0274220.e001" ref-type="disp-formula">1</xref>], was computed.</p>

      <p>A flowchart of the RS-CVR data is illustrated in <xref rid="pone.0274220.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref>. Preprocessing of the BOLD data was identical to that described in the CO2-CVR pipeline. However, RS-CVR data did not have associated CO2 recording, thus EtCO2 was not used in the data processing. Instead, the EtCO2 term in Eq [<xref rid="pone.0274220.e001" ref-type="disp-formula">1</xref>] was replaced with a surrogate derived from the whole-brain BOLD time course. Specifically, the whole-brain BOLD time course was linearly detrended and a low-pass filter with a cutoff frequency of 0.1164Hz is applied. The temporal filtering frequency of [0, 0.1164 Hz] has been found to yield the highest spatial correlation between RS-CVR maps and CO2-CVR maps [<xref rid="pone.0274220.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].

      <p>CVR-MRICloud was tested using data collected in several different studies reported previously [<xref rid="pone.0274220.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0274220.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0274220.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. For CO2-CVR pipeline testing, 203 datasets from a lifespan cohort (age 50.9±19.8 years, 79 males, 124 females) was used. The CO2-inhalation paradigm used interleaved blocks of 60s room-air breathing and 60s of hypercapnic gas (5% CO2, 21% O2, and 74% N2), for a scan time of 7min. The BOLD MRI sequence used a TR of 2000 ms, a TE of 25 ms, and a voxel size of 3.44×3.44×3.5 mm<sup>3</sup>, with a duration of 5min performed on a Philips MRI system. In addition, the CVR-MRICloud pipeline was applied to data from a brain tumor patient (58 years old, male) and a patient with Moyamoya disease (55 years old, female). For RS-CVR pipeline testing, resting-state BOLD data from the above-mentioned lifespan cohort, repeated scans from a healthy young subject (28 years old, male), and a patient at 24 weeks after stroke (56 years old, male) were used. These studies have been approved by the institutional review board (IRB) of Johns Hopkins University and University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center. Informed written consent was obtained for each participant.</p>

      <p><xref rid="pone.0274220.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6</xref> illustrates the processing results of EtCO2 in two representative subjects. In the first subject (<xref rid="pone.0274220.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6A</xref>), the breathing rhythm of the participant was consistent throughout the experiment. Thus, both algorithms used performed reliably. In the second subject (<xref rid="pone.0274220.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6B</xref>), on the other hand, the individual’s breathing rate was more variable. Thus both algorithms generated some incorrect peaks (red arrows). The median-filter processing was able to mitigate the errors to some extent (green arrows), but certain degree of under-estimation in the CO2 peak is still present. The use of the higher value between the two algorithms can further reduce the occurrences of under-estimation. Upon visual inspection of all processed CO2 data described in this study (N = 203), we found that the pipeline was successful in finding the CO2 trace’s upper envelope, i.e. EtCO2, in all subjects.</p>

    <title>Discussion</title>
    <p>In this work we developed CVR-MRICloud, a web-based data processing pipeline for CVR experiments employing either hypercapnic gas inhalation or resting-state MRI. The pipeline encompasses all major steps of CVR processing including CO2 recording analysis, BOLD image pre-processing, temporal alignment between CO2 and BOLD time courses, and computation of whole-brain, regional, and voxel-wise CVR results. These algorithms are fully automated, thus are ideally suited for cloud-based computing. The processing procedure also considers timing differences between different brain regions and tissue types (i.e. gray versus white matter), and provides an estimation of the time shift map, which is thought to be related to bolus arrival time of the brain vasculature and may be physiologically meaningful.</p>
    <p>To our knowledge, CVR-MRICloud is the only web-based, fully automated CVR processing tool to date. Many methods of CVR processing, including those from the authors’ group [<xref rid="pone.0274220.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], contain certain steps of manual processing, e.g. identification of EtCO2 time course from the raw CO2 recording, and often require custom scripts. Other methods such as those in Functional Software Library (FSL) suites [<xref rid="pone.0274220.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0274220.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0274220.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] requires the installation of software packages on specific operating systems, e.g. Linux. CVR-MRICloud provides an operating-system independent processing platform and can work with any electronic device that has a web-browser application. Minimal experience is required in order to use this tool. An inter-rater evaluation performed by 4 raters with no previous CVR experience revealed that the ICC of CVR values was &gt;0.9959, suggesting that CVR-MRICloud is user-friendly and the results are not user-dependent [<xref rid="pone.0274220.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. The RS-CVR pipeline has also been utilized by researchers with no previous experience with CVR and yielded multiple publications [<xref rid="pone.0274220.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0274220.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. CVR-MRICloud also presents minimal requirements on the device’s CPU, memory, and storage capacity, as all computations are performed on the remote computer provided by the developer. For the CO2-CVR datasets obtained in the lifespan study with the imaging matrix of 64x64x43 and 211 dynamics, the processing time is about 16min for one dataset. The results of the lifespan study revealed age-related CVR decrease, consistent with previous report [<xref rid="pone.0274220.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p>
    <p>CVR-MRICloud aimed to incorporate the latest advances in CVR processing. The extraction of the EtCO2 time course used two state-of-the-art algorithms, the Scale-Space algorithm [<xref rid="pone.0274220.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] and the Smooth-Cross algorithm, which can account for various artifacts in the CO2 recording such as those due to partial breath and irregular breath. The alignment of the BOLD and EtCO2 time courses used a two-step processing and employed the polynomial fitting method similar to that used by Donahue et al. [<xref rid="pone.0274220.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], which is potentially more robust to noise than the simple minimum-searching method. The model to compute CVR value is based on linear regression between CO2 (as input) and BOLD signal (as output), but also considered linear drift of the MRI time course that is common in fMRI and CVR data. Motion vectors were not included as covariates in CO2-CVR processing because, in our experience, they can show similar time course as the EtCO2 curve (see <xref rid="pone.0274220.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig</xref> for examples) and if included in the GLM analysis, may lead to underestimation of CVR. The CVR-MRICloud pipeline also takes into account previous observations that different regions in the brain, in particular between gray and white matter regions, show a relative temporal shift in their time courses. This temporal shift is well-known from other MRI techniques such as arterial spin labeling (about 2 seconds of non-invasively labeled blood) and dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC) MRI (about 5 seconds of Gadolinium bolus), but appear to be exacerbated in CO2-CVR MRI (1–2 minutes of hypercapnic bolus) [<xref rid="pone.0274220.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Therefore, the present pipeline also conducted analysis using voxel-wise temporal shift, such that each voxel not only gives a CVR value but also yields a temporal delay index. Some literatures have suggested that the delay index is also of potential diagnostic value in clinical conditions [<xref rid="pone.0274220.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0274220.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].</p>
    <p>Resting-state based CVR is a new method for CVR estimation. This method has the obvious advantage that it does not require the CO2-inhalation apparatus. According to the processing pipeline used in the present work, which is based on the work of Liu et al. [<xref rid="pone.0274220.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0274220.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], it does not even require the CO2 recording. Therefore, the RS-CVR method is substantially easier to implement in research and even routine clinical settings. In fact, one can also conduct retrospective processing on the resting-state fMRI data previously collected, including those available in large multi-site studies, such as ADNI [<xref rid="pone.0274220.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], ABCD [<xref rid="pone.0274220.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], HCP [<xref rid="pone.0274220.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], and UK Biobank [<xref rid="pone.0274220.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. The present processing pipeline uses filtered whole-brain BOLD time course as a surrogate of the actual CO2 recording in the regression model. One reason for this approach is that CO2 recording is not available in many resting-state fMRI studies and the requirement of a CO2 monitor and the associated sampling tubing adds to the complexity of the procedure. Another reason is that resting-state CO2 recording measured at the mouth may not accurately reflect the CO2 time course in the brain, due to the relatively small amplitude of CO2 fluctuations during rest in combination with the expected dispersion effect along its path through lung, pulmonary vein, heart, and feeding arteries [<xref rid="pone.0274220.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0274220.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Of course, the drawback of not having a CO2 recording is that the estimated CVR is a relative measure, but does not provide an absolute value, e.g. %ΔBOLD signal per mmHg CO2. Thus the RS-CVR method is ideally suited for applications where the pathology is more focal or one can find a (relatively) healthy region, such as a contralateral normal hemisphere, as an internal reference standard. If absolute CVR value is desired in the resting-state method, one can record EtCO2 during the data acquisition. This can mitigate potential issues related to the use of internal reference model. The RS-CVR pipeline has been utilized to identify regional CVR abnormalities in human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients [<xref rid="pone.0274220.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] and glaucoma patients [<xref rid="pone.0274220.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>].</p>
    <p>Patient confidentiality, data protection, and security of data transfer are typical challenges associated with cloud-computing of medical imaging analysis. These issues have been extensively discussed in the original report of the MRICloud platform [<xref rid="pone.0274220.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Briefly, the uploaded imaging data are in ANALYZE format, which includes a raw image matrix and a header file that contains only the matrix dimension information. To ensure the security of the processing pipeline, SSH is used as the core in data transfer and signaling commands on the computational server. However, researchers should consider whether they need to include cloud processing in their consent process and ensure compliance with local data protection regulations before uploading data.</p>
    <p>A few limitations of this work should be acknowledged. The CVR-MRICloud, similar to cloud-processing of other MRI modalities, lacks the flexibility of allowing user inputs or graphical user interface. This is by the design of the cloud platform in which the submitted data are not processed in real-time. Instead, the data are placed in a queue and will be processed sequentially by the computation server. Thus, it is not practical to have the user wait in front of the terminal to provide inputs. There are other CVR processing methods available for users with technical expertise, such as “SeeVR” which allows the users to further tune and optimize the regressors used in the GLM analysis [<xref rid="pone.0274220.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Future version of the CVR-MRICloud will allow the uploading of user-defined ROIs and user-selection of the FWHM Gaussian kernel for spatial smoothing. As an additional limitation related to the CO2 processing algorithm, we observed in 4 cases an unanticipated phenomenon dubbed ‘CO2 Switching’. Usually, the EtCO2 corresponds to the peaks of the CO2 trace representing the CO2 content in the exhaled air. However, when a subject’s lung CO2 content responds too slowly to the hypercapnic gas challenge, the exhaled air temporarily has a CO2 content that is lower than the inhaled air, resulting the trough of the CO2 trace representing the EtCO2. As a result, the automatic CO2 processing algorithm incorrectly labels the subject’s inhaled CO2 partial pressure as their EtCO2 curve. In these cases, manual correction is needed. Two examples of “CO2 Switching” are shown in <xref rid="pone.0274220.g013" ref-type="fig">Fig 13</xref>. We found that “CO2 Switching” is rare and only occurs when the subject has an unusually low baseline EtCO2 level (e.g. &lt;25 mmHg). There is no known algorithm to detect the “CO2 switching” automatically. Therefore, users are encouraged to examine the CO2 traces for potential “CO2 switching” when unusually low baseline EtCO2 level is observed.</p>

    <p>In this work, we presented a cloud-based pipeline for the processing of CO2-inhalation and resting-state CVR data, referred to as CVR-MRICloud. This tool is fully automated, operating-system independent, and has minimal requirements on the user’s computer.

    <p>Reviewer #1: In this manuscript Liu et al report their development and publication of a cloud-based tool for processing of CVR MRI data. The authors outline their rationale of expanding availability of CVR processing, both for a hypercapnic based and resting-state MRI paradigms, the implemented methodology and provide some validation in a healthy lifespan cohort of 203 datasets, three patient datasets and a healthy young subject. Liu et al report example outputs from the processing, results of the alignment and quantitative metrics amongst others. I am grateful to the editor and authors for the opportunity to comment on this interesting and useful work.</p>
    <p>Major</p>
    <p>I agree with the authors that there is considerable scope for broadening availability of CVR for clinical studies. However, there may be a risk of such a resource becoming a ‘black box’ for some prospective users, potentially leading to false inferences, and/or missing key details e.g. the reported ‘CO2 Switching’ phenomena. Further the authors make no mention of any evaluations of the software/user friendliness of the software by individuals with no experience of CVR which from the introduction appear to be the target audience.</p>
    <p>The authors describe the benefits of cloud computing, which are significant, but not the challenges. Notably patient confidentiality, data protection and secure transfer/deletion are key. I believe that these should be considered in the Discussion, further detail on the technical setup and upload/download procedures of the server may also be appropriate for the Methods e.g. are uploads deleted after a set time? Do they only exist as long as a console is open?, How are results downloaded?, Who has access to/how secure is uploaded data? etc?</p>
    <p>The authors present the toolbox as a way of measuring CO2- and RS-CVR – however no comparison between the two is given despite data being available in the same population. As a validation of the toolbox this would seem a useful validation i.e. to show that both approaches show similar associations, and I would encourage the authors to add such an analysis, along with more detailed discussion of the results in the Discussion.</p>
    <p>Minor</p>
    <p>The data availability statement is contradicted by the description of where data is to be found which indicates data will only be released case-by-case upon request after funding agency approval. Clearly there can be valid funding or ethics/consent restrictions which may limit how much data can be shared. However, if there is an exceptional reason it is not currently presented which should be corrected before publication.</p>
    <p>Line 56 – The authors reference the Mild Stroke Study 3 (Clancy et al), however as a single centre study it does not seem to fit with their phrasing. The authors perhaps meant to refer to Investigate-SVDs 10.1016/j.cccb.2021.100020 which was multi-site and led by the same group?</p>
    <p>Lines 68-69 – The authors draw an analogy between task/resting state fMRI and CO2-CVR/RS-CVR, however no citation is provided, I would suggest the authors either remove this sentence or add relevant references.</p>
    <p>Lines 70-71 – The authors state most CVR studies have used in-house processing methods but do not supply a relevant reference, one such example would be 10.3389/fphys.2021.643468. The authors may also want to note that despite many CVR studies depending on in-house code few authors have published their code, creating challenges for reproducible and repeatable research.</p>
    <p>Line 138 and 147 – What was the reason for choosing a window size of 10? And combining the results based on the higher of Algorithm I and II?</p>
    <p>Line 169 – Delays of 0 to EtCO2 time course duration are allowed, and in line 175 a narrower search range of +/- 5 s is used. Are the authors confident this can handle the full range as pathology? Longer/altered delays have been reported in patient e.g. WMH in SVD patients etc.</p>
    <p>Line 227 –Given the temporal filtering frequency in ref. 33 seem to come from healthy patients or moyamoya how transferable is the range used e.g. for stroke or MS?</p>
    <p>Line 288-9 – Commenting on consistency of values with previous work may be better suited to the discussion than results.</p>
    <p>Line 302-3 – Comments on reliability and reproducibility seem to be based on a single healthy subject, evaluations in other groups with larger sample size would be useful to determine how consistent this pattern is.</p>
    <p>Line 337-9 – If no published data is available then it may be valuable to other groups to include some in the supplementary information to support this point.</p>
    <p>Lines 207-211, Line 363 – Add reference. In general there were several areas with unsupported statements which may benefit from further additions, not least as it makes it more accessible for a wider readership.</p>
    <p>Line 367 – internal reference models have significant limitations cf SUV models for PET, the drawbacks should be considered in my opinion. As although superficially the maps may look similar the lack of directly comparable values is a significant impediment.</p>
    <p>Line 383 – Is there any error protection against the CO2 switching phenomena i.e. does MRICloud label it/throw an error?</p>
    <p>Figure 9 – It would be useful to have the spread of the CVR as points instead of only the mean and CI.</p>
    <p>Reviewer #2: In this work, the authors developed and describe a cloud-based cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR) processing pipeline. The authors comprehensively describe all of the processing steps, including extraction of end-tidal CO2 curves and its alignment with BOLD data, the calculation of a variety of CVR metrics from CO2-challenge and resting-state CVR data and a quality control metric. The authors also evaluate the performance of the processing pipeline from a population comprising a variety of ages, appropriate distribution of sex and MRI data from a wide range of imaging parameters. The manuscript is very clearly written and the work is valuable as it has the potential to broaden the uptake of the CVR technique by removing the data processing skill entry barrier, facilitates reproducible research and meticulously describes the logic behind each choice of processing step. Some minor questions and comments are listed below:</p>
    <p>1) As the BOLD signal comprises a mixture of a variety of different hemodynamic and metabolic parameters, could the choice of MR imaging parameters affect the alignment of BOLD data to EtCO2, or the quality of CO2 and resting-state CVR maps (e.g. short TR, high flip angle increasing the sensitivity to in-flow effect)?</p>
    <p>2) Could the authors clarify whether patient health information is automatically removed from image metadata upon upload to the cloud server or if the user is responsible for removing patient health information?</p>
    <p>3) Could the authors describe what MRI image file formats are compatible with CVR-MRICloud?</p>
    <p>4) If available, could the authors include a citation to the Smooth-Cross algorithm used for peak detection (algorithm 2, page 7, line 137) for the interested reader?</p>
    <p>5) On page 18, line 370 the authors state that the CVR-MRICloud lacks the flexibility of allowing user inputs. Could the authors clarify whether this extends to the ability of the user to upload brain masks and the ability to modify the FWHM of the spatial-smoothing Gaussian kernel?</p>
    <p>6) Do the authors plan to update the software, such as addition or modification of processing steps, as the CVR-mapping technique further develops? If so, will older versions still be available to users to ensure continuity of in-progress studies?</p>

    <p>Response to Reviewer 1:</p>
    <p>1. “I agree with the authors that there is considerable scope for broadening availability of CVR for clinical studies. However, there may be a risk of such a resource becoming a ‘black box’ for some prospective users, potentially leading to false inferences, and/or missing key details e.g. the reported ‘CO2 Switching’ phenomena. Further the authors make no mention of any evaluations of the software/user friendliness of the software by individuals with no experience of CVR which from the introduction appear to be the target audience.”</p>
    <p>Thank you for this point. In this report, we have provided all details related to the CVR-MRICloud pipeline. The purpose of this report is exactly to de-mystify this tool and to make it not a “black box”. To the best of our knowledge, we have explained all known factors that could lead to false inferences. </p>
    <p>Regarding the use of the software by individuals with no experience of CVR, we would like to clarify that a substantial number of novice users have actually used our tool with no problems. We have added the following paragraph in the Discussion regarding the user-friendliness of the CVR-MRICloud:</p>
    <p>“Minimal experience is required in order to use this tool. An inter-rater evaluation performed by 4 raters with no previous CVR experience revealed that the ICC of CVR values was &gt;0.9959, suggesting that CVR-MRICloud is user-friendly and the results are not user-dependent [37]. The RS-CVR pipeline has also been utilized by researchers with no previous experience with CVR and yielded multiple publications [39-41].”</p>
    <p>2. “The authors describe the benefits of cloud computing, which are significant, but not the challenges. Notably patient confidentiality, data protection and secure transfer/deletion are key. I believe that these should be considered in the Discussion, further detail on the technical setup and upload/download procedures of the server may also be appropriate for the Methods e.g. are uploads deleted after a set time? Do they only exist as long as a console is open?, How are results downloaded?, Who has access to/how secure is uploaded data? etc?”</p>
    <p>Thank you. Indeed, patient confidentiality and data protection are important issues associated with human data processing over cloud. These issues have been addressed in the original report of the MRICloud platform (Mori et al, Computing in Science &amp; Engineering. 2016;18(5):21-35). Note that the CVR-MRICloud is a new addition to the MRICloud toolbox and uses the same front-end framework as the other MRICloud tools in terms of data uploading/downloading. Briefly, the uploaded image file format is ANALYZE (.hdr and .img). This file format does not contain protected health information (PHI), thus it is compatible with Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) regulations. We have added this information in the revised manuscript:</p>
    <p>“The required image file format is ANALYZE (.hdr and .img) which does not contain protected health information (PHI) and thus, is compatible with Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) regulations.”</p>
    <p>Each submission of data to the server will create a job. The users can only access the results of the jobs their submitted. After downloading users can select to delete the data/result from the server. If the user do not delete the data/results, the data/result of the jobs will be automatically deleted from the server after 60 days. We have added the following sentences in the revised manuscript:</p>
    <p>“The users can only access the outcome parameters from the data they had uploaded. The data and outcome parameters will be automatically deleted after 60 days from the upload if the users choose not to delete them manually.”</p>
    <p>We have also added the following paragraph in Discussion:</p>
    <p>“Patient confidentiality, data protection, and security of data transfer are typical challenges associated with cloud-computing of medical imaging analysis. These issues have been extensively discussed in the original report of the MRICloud platform [29]. Briefly, the uploaded imaging data are in ANALYZE format, which includes a raw image matrix and a header file that contains only the matrix dimension information. To ensure the security of the processing pipeline, SSH is used as the core in data transfer and signaling commands on the computational server.”</p>
    <p>3. “The data availability statement is contradicted by the description of where data is to be found which indicates data will only be released case-by-case upon request after funding agency approval.

    <p>We have uploaded the anonymized data set necessary to replicate our study findings to a public repository. If this manuscript is accepted, the data will be available for downloading at <ext-link xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.wh70rxwqw" ext-link-type="uri">https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.wh70rxwqw</ext-link>.</p>
    <p>4. “Line 56 – The authors reference the Mild Stroke Study 3 (Clancy et al), however as a single centre study it does not seem to fit with their phrasing. The authors perhaps meant to refer to Investigate-SVDs 10.1016/j.cccb.2021.100020 which was multi-site and led by the same group?”</p>
    <p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. We have updated this sentence and reference accordingly:</p>
    <p>“CVR as a candidate biomarker of vascular diseases has also been applied in multi-center settings, such as in the MarkVCID study [23] and the INVESTIGATE-SVDs study [24].”</p>
    <p>5. “Lines 68-69 – The authors draw an analogy between task/resting state fMRI and CO2-CVR/RS-CVR, however no citation is provided, I would suggest the authors either remove this sentence or add relevant references.”</p>
    <p>Per the reviewer’s suggestion, we have removed this analogy.</p>
    <p>6. “Lines 70-71 – The authors state most CVR studies have used in-house processing methods but do not supply a relevant reference, one such example would be 10.3389/fphys.2021.643468. The authors may also want to note that despite many CVR studies depending on in-house code few authors have published their code, creating challenges for reproducible and repeatable research.”</p>
    <p>We thank the reviewer for this point. We have added the reference and revised this sentence as below:</p>
    <p>“CVR data processing is considered a niche skill and most studies of CVR have used in-house scripts or software [28], creating challenges for reproducible and repeatable research and for researchers and clinicians with less skills in software programming.”</p>
    <p>7. “Line 138 and 147 – What was the reason for choosing a window size of 10? And combining the results based on the higher of Algorithm I and II?”</p>
    <p>If the smoothing window is too small, it may not separate fluctuations during the breathing out period from separate breaths, whereas if the smoothing window is too large, it cannot detect the breathing peaks effectively during the transition periods between room air and CO2 inhalation. A window size of 10s (i.e., 2-3 breathing cycles in majority of subjects) is a good balance between the two issues. The final EtCO2 curve is obtained by selecting the higher value from Algorithms I and II at each point in the interpolated time series. As shown in Figure 6, the wrong values identified in each algorithm are always lower than the real values, because EtCO2 indicates the upper envelope of the CO2 trace. We have added the following sentences in the revised manuscript:</p>
    <p>“The window size of 10s was chosen as a trade-off between the degree of smoothing and the sensitivity during the room air-CO2 transition periods.”</p>
    <p>“Finally, the higher value from Algorithms I and II at each point in the interpolated time series was selected to form the EtCO2 curve (Fig. 3B), as the EtCO2 curve represent the top envelope of the CO2 trace.”</p>
    <p>8. “Line 169 – Delays of 0 to EtCO2 time course duration are allowed, and in line 175 a narrower search range of +/- 5 s is used. Are the authors confident this can handle the full range as pathology? Longer/altered delays have been reported in patient e.g. WMH in SVD patients etc.”</p>
    <p>We clarify that the EtCO2 delay was found in two steps. In the first step, we search through a broad range covering all possible shift values (0 to entire EtCO2 time course duration) with a courser step size of 1 second (see Figure 4a for example), and this can identify any physiological and pathological delay roughly. In the second step, based on the delay determined from the step 1, we search a narrow window (+/-5s) around the Step1-determined delay a with a finer step size of 100ms to achieve higher precision of the delay obtained (see Figure 4b for example). Therefore, we can effectively find the longer delays in pathological conditions. We have added the following sentence in the revised manuscript:</p>
    <p>“This two-step procedure is expected to yield more reliable optimal shift value than using the first step alone.”</p>
    <p>9. “Line 227 –Given the temporal filtering frequency in ref. 33 seem to come from healthy patients or moyamoya how transferable is the range used e.g. for stroke or MS?”</p>
    <p>The temporal filtering frequency was determined from healthy subjects across the life span to be more generalized. In Ref.34 (i.e., Ref. 33 in the original submission) we have validated in a clinical cohort of Moyamoya patients. Moyamoya disease is a large artery stenosis in which the CVR abnormality varies in a large range. Therefore, we think the temporal filtering frequency determined in Ref. 34 can be transferable to most clinical applications. Our example image shown in Figure 12 demonstrated the application in stroke.</p>
    <p>10. “Line 288-9 – Commenting on consistency of values with previous work may be better suited to the discussion than results.”</p>
    <p>Per reviewer’s suggestion, we have moved this sentence to the Discussion section.</p>
    <p>11. “Line 302-3 – Comments on reliability and reproducibility seem to be based on a single healthy subject, evaluations in other groups with larger sample size would be useful to determine how consistent this pattern is.”</p>
    <p>The reliability and reproducibility of the resting-state CVR mapping technique has been reported with larger sample size in our previous studies (Refs 26 and 34). In this work, we are focusing on the processing tool, and therefore, we think an example of 7 repeated scans from the same subject is enough to demonstrate the reliability and reproducibility of our rs-CVR pipeline in CVR-MRICloud.</p>
    <p>12. “Line 337-9 – If no published data is available then it may be valuable to other groups to include some in the supplementary information to support this point.”</p>
    <p>Per reviewer’s suggestion, we have added the Supplemental Figure S1 to show the examples of subjects in whom the EtCO2 and motion vector (in foot-head direction) showed significant reverse-correlation:</p>
    <p>“Supplemental Figure S1: EtCO2 curves and motion curves from two healthy subjects with high R2 values. The motion curve was in foot-head (FH) direction obtained using spm_realign.m function.”</p>
    <p>13. “Lines 207-211, Line 363 – Add reference. In general there were several areas with unsupported statements which may benefit from further additions, not least as it makes it more accessible for a wider readership.”</p>
    <p>We have added references accordingly.</p>
    <p>14. “Line 367 – internal reference models have significant limitations of SUV models for PET, the drawbacks should be considered in my opinion. As although superficially the maps may look similar the lack of directly comparable values is a significant impediment.”</p>
    <p>We agree. We have added the following sentences to discuss this issue and proposed potential solutions:</p>
    <p>“If absolute CVR value is desired in the resting-state method, one can record EtCO2 during the data acquisition. This can mitigate potential issues related to the use of internal reference model.”</p>
    <p>15. “Line 383 – Is there any error protection against the CO2 switching phenomena i.e. does MRICloud label it/throw an error?”</p>
    <p>There is no known algorithm to detect the CO2 switching phenomena automatically. Therefore, we have reported this limitation and specified that the users should examine their CO2 recording and identify the cases where CO2 switching phenomena (as shown in Figure 13) is presented. We also noted that this CO2 switching phenomena is a rare situation. It happens only occasionally in subjects with baseline EtCO2 lower than 25 mmHg, whereas in majority of the subjects the baseline EtCO2 is between 35-45 mmHg. We have added the following sentences in the revised manuscript:</p>
    <p>“We found that “CO2 Switching” is rare and only occurs when the subject has an unusually low baseline EtCO2 level (e.g. &lt;25 mmHg). There is no known algorithm to detect the “CO2 switching” automatically. Therefore, users are encouraged to examine the CO2 traces for potential “CO2 switching” when unusually low baseline EtCO2 level is observed.”</p>
    <p>16. “Figure 9 – It would be useful to have the spread of the CVR as points instead of only the mean and CI.”</p>
    <p>We agree. We have added to the plot the subject-level CVR values to Figure 9.</p>
    <p> </p>
    <p>Response to Reviewer 2:</p>
    <p>1. “As the BOLD signal comprises a mixture of a variety of different hemodynamic and metabolic parameters, could the choice of MR imaging parameters affect the alignment of BOLD data to EtCO2, or the quality of CO2 and resting-state CVR maps (e.g. short TR, high flip angle increasing the sensitivity to in-flow effect)?”</p>
    <p>Indeed, the underpinning of the CVR obtained may be dependent on the BOLD parameter used. For example, it could vary between oxygenation-weighted and flow-weighted, as the reviewer alluded to. In terms of their impact on the alignment, we feel that it will not be major. This is because the signal change due to CO2 response is a relatively slow response compared to brain activation induced BOLD signal change (where the neural activation takes less than 50 ms to occur). Thus, within the measurement error, the oxygenation-weighted and flow-weighted signal will have a very similar signal time-course. </p>
    <p>The optimal imaging parameter should be chosen to balance between SNR and purity of signal contrast, although this topic is beyond the scope of this paper.</p>
    <p>2. “Could the authors clarify whether patient health information is automatically removed from image metadata upon upload to the cloud server or if the user is responsible for removing patient health information?”</p>
    <p>We have clarified in the revised manuscript that, the required image file format of MRICloud is ANALYZE (.hdr and .img). This is because this file format does not contain protected health information (PHI), thus it is compatible with Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) regulations. We provide a DICOM to Analyze conversion tool on the MRICloud website which the users and download and use on their own computer. The users can also use their own software to generate the ANALYZE images of their data. We have added this information in the revised manuscript (please also see our response to R1.2):</p>
    <p>“The required image file format is ANALYZE (.hdr and .img) which does not contain protected health information (PHI) and thus, is compatible with Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) regulations.”</p>
    <p>3. “Could the authors describe what MRI image file formats are compatible with CVR-MRICloud?”</p>
    <p>The required file format is ANALYZE. Please see our response to R1.2 and R2.2.</p>
    <p>4. “If available, could the authors include a citation to the Smooth-Cross algorithm used for peak detection (algorithm 2, page 7, line 137) for the interested reader?”</p>
    <p>The smooth-cross algorithm was developed by us during the course of this project. Thus there is no prior reference.</p>
    <p>5. “On page 18, line 370 the authors state that the CVR-MRICloud lacks the flexibility of allowing user inputs. Could the authors clarify whether this extends to the ability of the user to upload brain masks and the ability to modify the FWHM of the spatial-smoothing Gaussian kernel?”</p>
    <p>Thank you for this point. The “lack of flexibility” we mentioned was referring to the notion that the cloud tool is not ideal for “interactive” processing. For the pre-selected options such as uploading a brain mask or choosing FWHM, it is actually feasible. However, in the current implementation, we have not included these options. This is because we were trying to limit the number of user inputs to obtain a trade-off between tool flexibility and simplicity to users, especially novice users. We were concerned that, if the user types in a wrong input value by mistake, it will cause issues in the processing of the datasets. But we agree with the reviewer that allowing the user to upload brain masks and modify the smoothing kernel could be beneficial. So in the future we will update our implementation (as a separate version of the tool) to allow the user to upload user-defined brain masks and specify the data space from which the masks are defined, as well as select different FWHM of the smoothing kernel. We have added the following sentences in the revised manuscript:</p>
    <p>“Future version of the CVR-MRICloud will allow the uploading of user-defined ROIs and user-selection of the FWHM Gaussian kernel for spatial smoothing.”</p>
    <p>6. “Do the authors plan to update the software, such as addition or modification of processing steps, as the CVR-mapping technique further develops? If so, will older versions still be available to users to ensure continuity of in-progress studies?”</p>
    <p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. We are updating the software with modifications and technical development. We are doing this in a version-controlled manner. We have added the following paragraph in the revised manuscript to clarify this:</p>
    <p>“The deployment of CVR-MRICloud is conducted in a version‐controlled manner. When a new version is released, it will have a specific version number and all older versions are still available on the CVR‐MRICloud website.”</p>

    <p>Reviewer #1: I am grateful to the authors for their response which has addressed all the main substantive points.</p>
    <p>The one caveat I would raise is in relation to point 2. While the authors have clearly considered the issues for their own legislative domain other regions have different standards, I think in particular of the General Data Protection Regulations (GPDR) standards which apply in most European countries. While previously data transfer to the USA was possible under the Privacy Shield this is unfortunately no longer the case: <ext-link xlink:href="https://gdpr-info.eu/issues/third-countries" ext-link-type="uri">https://gdpr-info.eu/issues/third-countries</ext-link>. My (limited) understanding is at a minimum transfer of even anonymised data to a web server in the USA for processing would ideally be included in the participant consent form and ethics, and many institutions would have their own processes to approve transfer, which may include considering who else could hypothetically access the data e.g. server admins, law enforcement etc and on what basis.</p>
    <p>Clearly any detailed discussion of these points is beyond the scope of this paper, and it would be impossible to account for local rules in all jurisdictions. However, the authors may wish to note somewhere that researchers should consider whether they need to include cloud processing in the USA in their consent process and ensure compliance with local data protection regulations before uploading data.</p>
    <p>I congratulate the authors again on a valuable piece of work which I am sure will be extremely useful to the community going forward.</p>
    <p>Reviewer #2: All questions and comments from the original review have been answered very well. Happy to recommend the manuscript for publication in its current form.</p>
