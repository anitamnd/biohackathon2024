    <abstract>
      <p>3D-printing is a powerful manufacturing tool that can create precise microscale architectures across macroscale geometries. Within biomedical research, 3D-printing of various materials has been used to fabricate rigid scaffolds for cell and tissue engineering constructs with precise microarchitecture to direct cell behavior and macroscale geometry provides patient specificity. While 3D-printing hardware has become low-cost due to modeling and rapid prototyping applications, there is no common paradigm or platform for the controlled design and manufacture of 3D-printed constructs for tissue engineering. Specifically, controlling the tissue engineering features of pore size, porosity, and pore arrangement is difficult using currently available software. We have developed a MATLAB approach termed <bold>scafSLICR</bold> to design and manufacture tissue-engineered scaffolds with precise microarchitecture and with simple options to enable spatially patterned pore properties. Using scafSLICR, we designed, manufactured, and characterized porous scaffolds in acrylonitrile butadiene styrene with a variety of pore sizes, porosities, and gradients. We found that transitions between different porous regions maintained an open, connected porous network without compromising mechanical integrity. Further, we demonstrated the usefulness of scafSLICR in patterning different porous designs throughout large anatomic shapes and in preparing craniofacial tissue engineering bone scaffolds. Finally, scafSLICR is distributed as open-source MATLAB scripts and as a stand-alone graphical interface.</p>

    <title>Introduction</title>
    <p>3D-printing technologies have become widely available with a large number of commercially available low-cost hardware systems and printable materials used to fabricate scaffolds for tissue regeneration [<xref rid="pone.0225007.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0225007.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0225007.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0225007.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0225007.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0225007.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Thus far, much of the work using fused deposition modeling (FDM) to produce constructs for tissue engineering has focused on developing suitable biomaterials with a variety of mechanical and biological properties [<xref rid="pone.0225007.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Scaffolds for tissue engineering necessarily contain highly-defined porous networks. The interplay between scaffold mechanics and porous volumes for uniform cell seeding, promoting <italic>de novo</italic> tissue growth, and the diffusion of nutrients throughout presents a challenge in determining the optimal microarchitectural design for a scaffold. While there have been design approaches for selective laser sintering 3D-printing using unit cell libraries [<xref rid="pone.0225007.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], topology optimization [<xref rid="pone.0225007.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0225007.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], and mathematical design [<xref rid="pone.0225007.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], the structures are not reasonably transformed to the fiber deposition paradigm of FDM [<xref rid="pone.0225007.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p>
    <p>An ongoing tissue engineering design goal is to create spatially controlled, heterogeneous patterns of pores throughout anatomic shapes to mimic differences in mechanical requirements throughout the tissue. In prior studies, this has most commonly been achieved by modifying the fiber-fiber spacing between <italic>z</italic>-levels, which results in different pore sizes at different heights in the print. For example, Sobral <italic>et al</italic>. designed a gradient of pore sizes by systemically increasing or decreasing fiber-fiber spacing in each print layer [<xref rid="pone.0225007.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Additionally, Woodfield <italic>et al</italic>. 3D-printed cartilage constructs with a gradient of pore sizes in the <italic>z</italic>-direction [<xref rid="pone.0225007.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. These fiber-spacing approaches are constant across an xy-plane and limit designs to changes in spacing in the <italic>z</italic>-direction. While such an approach is applicable in small-scale prints, it does not easily transfer to human-scale complex anatomic shapes. Di Luca <italic>et al</italic>. demonstrated fiber-fiber spacing across the <italic>xy</italic>-plane, resulting in a step gradient across the plane [<xref rid="pone.0225007.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0225007.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Therefore, the fiber-fiber spacing could be controlled in <italic>xy</italic> and <italic>z</italic> directions simultaneously, enabling designs with different pore sizes across 3D-space. Thus far, this approach has only been shown on a small scale, cuboid scaffold with a three-pattern linear gradient. Implementation of such gradients in the <italic>xy</italic> plane across a variety of large, more complex geometries remains an unmet challenge for bone tissue engineering.</p>
    <p>Additionally, specific control over pore architecture is desirable. Fiber height is often mismatched from desired pore sizes, and cross-hatching fiber patterns on alternating print layers result in pore diameters that are determined by the versatile fiber-fiber spacing in the <italic>z</italic>-direction but limited by fiber height in the <italic>xy</italic>-direction. Varying the fiber height can change the height of the pores in the <italic>xy</italic>-plane, but this approach must be implemented across the entire print plane which prevents in-plane patterning. Further, fiber height is limited by the range of nozzle hardware. However, repeating the same print pattern without changing the fiber location could result in stacked, taller fibers and therefore pores, as shown by Moroni <italic>et</italic>. <italic>al</italic>. [<xref rid="pone.0225007.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] and Xu <italic>et</italic>. <italic>al</italic>. [<xref rid="pone.0225007.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Struts designed from congruent, stacked fibers could be used to make pore microarchitectures isotropic and vary pore size in all three spatial dimensions.</p>
    <p>The process of transforming a 3D-design into the <italic>xy</italic>-layers of hot element paths is termed <italic>slicing</italic>. The slicing process determines the fiber laydown pattern, and the resulting geometric and mechanical properties of the print [<xref rid="pone.0225007.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Traditional slicing software systems create a solid wall or shell around the exterior surface of the shape with a single, infilling, truss pattern applied to the interior bulk of the shape. These resulting designs are not useful for tissue engineering constructs as they do not contain interconnected pore networks. Research groups have been limited by the set of functionalities in broadly-used software (such as Slic3r [<xref rid="pone.0225007.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] or Cura [<xref rid="pone.0225007.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]) or in the proprietary software delivered with the bioprinter–which has restricted the availability of useful tissue engineering designs.</p>
    <p>To overcome the limitations of the available slicing software, several groups have prepared custom porous designs through ‘brute force’ design: i.e. they manually design each pore and strut in CAD programs and then pass the CAD file to a traditional slicing program, which best approximates fiber placement across the design [<xref rid="pone.0225007.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0225007.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. This design process is labor and computationally intensive and disconnects the design process from the design space of the 3D-printer, which can cause infidelities in the final product. Alternatively, custom slicing software can enable the creation of gradients or custom porous structures. For example, Kang <italic>et</italic>. <italic>al</italic>. developed an integrated tissue-organ printer and custom software integrated into the system to design and manufacture of constructs. However, their published source code is unique to their hardware and does not appear to allow for the design of gradients [<xref rid="pone.0225007.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Trachtenberg <italic>et al</italic>. developed a Python and Pronterface system to generate GCODE that can vary the fiber-fiber spacing on different print levels on a custom-built 3D-printer [<xref rid="pone.0225007.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. However, these programs are specialized to each design and manufacturing system and are not easily replicable or adaptable.</p>
    <p>Therefore, currently available slicing programs do not allow precise control over porous patterns and microarchitectural features needed for tissue engineering scaffolds. Here, we present an approach to designing 3D-printed scaffolds with patterns of porous and mechanical properties. The goals of this approach are to (i) develop a software which can design and implement patterns of pore properties throughout 3D space which contain isotropic, fully connected pores relevant to tissue engineering, (ii) validate the printability and mechanical integrity of such designs, and (iii) provide this software as a tool that researchers can use when 3D-printing tissue engineering scaffolds. Additionally, we demonstrate that the resulting approach allows the independent patterning of pore size and porosity across a variety of anatomic shapes relevant to craniofacial bone regeneration.</p>

      <title>3D-printing on Lulzbot</title>
      <p>The methods in this paper were developed for use on a Lulzbot Taz 5 3D-Printer (Aleph Objects, Loveland, CO), which is representative of the many low-cost desktop 3D-printers that are broadly in use. The printer uses gears to drive a solid polymer filament through a melt chamber and narrow extruder nozzle. The nozzle is moved in the <italic>x</italic> and <italic>y</italic> directions as it deposits material in a single <italic>z</italic> level before proceeding in a layer-by-layer fashion until the build is complete. The cooling and solidification rate of the extruded polymer is critical for determining print quality, and it is controlled by adjusting air fans and the heat of the print surface. This paper uses the following terms to describe the 3D-printed part:</p>
      <list list-type="bullet">
        <list-item>
          <p><bold>Fiber</bold>–the structure of extruded material from the extruder head along a toolpath on a single print layer. Fibers are assumed to be rectangular with the width of the extruder nozzle and the height of the print layer.</p>
        </list-item>
        <list-item>
          <p><bold>Strut</bold>–the solid material resulting from a set of adjacent fibers, often composed of multiple fibers in width and height.</p>
        </list-item>
        <list-item>
          <p><bold>Pore</bold>–the channel-like void spacing between struts, in horizontal and vertical directions. Pores have square projections with equal width and height when viewed from the top or side of the scaffold.</p>
        </list-item>
      </list>
      <p>Most importantly, the Lulzbot uses the Marlin operating system to process the standard RepRap flavor of GCODE instructions to control the robotic behavior of the system. The machine responds to commands to deposit a fiber of the material (<italic>extruder diameter</italic>) at a given temperature (<italic>extruder temperature</italic>), at a given rate (<italic>extrusion rate</italic>), and move in x-y space (<italic>tool paths</italic>, <italic>extruder movement speed</italic>). Additionally, the print surface can be heated to prevent warping (<italic>bed temperature</italic>) and the print can be cooled by turning the fan on at various print heights (<italic>fan speed</italic>, <italic>fan start height</italic>).</p>
      <p>Scaffolds in this paper were printed using acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) plastic filament (IC3D, Columbus, OH) with the following printer settings. A 0.5mm diameter extruder was used with the extruder temperature set to 240°C and the bed temperature set to 110°C. The layer height was set to 0.2mm and fans were turned on to 50% speed after the first layer was deposited. The feed rate was set to 1200 mm/min and a 1% over-extrusion factor was applied throughout the entire scaffold. scafSLICR could work with a range of materials in an FDM printer, optimized with printing parameters.</p>

      <title>Scaffold design with MATLAB Script</title>
      <p>The code was written to enable the feature-driven design of tissue engineering scaffolds. The key features of porosity and pore size are used to create a 3D-template, which is then applied to the desired areas of the scaffold shape (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0225007.g001">Fig 1</xref>). Pores are designed as isotropic square pores. Porosity is tuned by both the pore width and the strut width (design porosity, <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pone.0225007.e001">Eq 1</xref>). The strut width can be increased by placing multiple fibers directly adjacent to each other (fiber-fiber spacing = 0 mm) and pore width is controlled by the strut-strut distance. By repeating the same strut pattern on consecutive layers, the strut height can be increased to equal the pore width and result in square pores. The porosity of the repeating unit is calculated in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pone.0225007.e001">Eq 1</xref>: a repeating unit has the width of a strut + pore, the length of a strut + pore, and the height of pore, while the void volume is given by pore width*pore width*pore height.</p>

          <p>User inputs a labeled 3D shaped and the pore properties for each label (green boxes). The program then generates a support structure between the shape and the print bed (blue/red shape) and tool path templates for each pore pattern (blue boxes). The slicing process convolves these tool path templates with each x-y level of the shape according to the label (gray box). The result of this convolution is then translated into a set of GCODE instructions or into a predicted porous model of the shape (yellow boxes). These outputs can be manufactured on a 3D-printer or used for <italic>in silico</italic> modeling (orange boxes).</p>

      </fig>
      <p>The inputs to the code are 3D-shape, pore sizes, and porosities. The possible combinations of pore sizes and associated porosities are dependent on the thickness of the struts and are available as design options. The shape can be easily adapted from CT scans, STL files, or other 3D-data. The pore size and porosity can be inferred from the initial biologic data (e.g. CT density), mathematically defined in a variety of gradients, or any desired pattern that can be applied to a 3D-matrix.</p>
      <p>The scafSLICR function generates templates of toolpaths in both <italic>x</italic> and <italic>y</italic> directions based on these parameters and convolves them with the shape matrix. Additionally, it generates support material between the input shape and the print bed surface. The function includes the options to improve print quality by pausing, back-tracking, or retracting material at the end of each fiber to prevent dragging strands across pore spaces.</p>
      <p>The program outputs include common GCODE instructions that are conserved across many common FDM (tested on the RepRap Marlin system [<xref rid="pone.0225007.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]) printers and 3D rendering of expected design (as STL and volumetric data). For ease-of-use, the function was incorporated into a graphical user interface [<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0225007.s001">S1 Appendix</xref>]. It uses 3D-plotting [<xref rid="pone.0225007.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] and STL import [<xref rid="pone.0225007.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] scripts from the Mathworks repository.</p>

      <title>Scaffold manufacturing</title>
      <p>Scaffolds were manufactured to assess the print quality of different porous patterns (homogenous scaffolds), the transition between different patterns (hybrid scaffolds), and gradients of patterns in three dimensions (gradient scaffolds). Homogenous and hybrid scaffolds were 20 × 20 × 10 mm and gradient scaffolds were 30 × 30 × 30 mm. The exact porous features of all scaffold groups are listed in <xref rid="pone.0225007.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. 3D-Design models were generated by scafSLICR by assuming fibers to be perfectly rectangular (nozzle width x print layer height). The design was assembled into a volumetric 3D-matrix which could be examined directly in MATLAB using matrix property analyses, MATLAB 3D-plotting functions, or exported as an STL to be viewed and analyzed in a range of software programs.</p>

      <p>Scaffolds were imaged on a stereoscope (Zeiss Z8). Images were taken of top and side views at 2X magnification. Pore size and strut width were measured separately for top and side views. Pore size was analyzed using the DiameterJ plug-in for FIJI [<xref rid="pone.0225007.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0225007.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] by measuring the area of each pore of the binarized image. The size of the pore was then reported as the square root of the pore area. All of the pores were measured in each scaffold and each scaffold design was printed in triplicate. Strut widths were measured by hand in FIJI using the original stereoscope image. Between 59 and 69 struts were measured over three scaffolds per group. For pore size and strut width, the ratio of the measured value to the predicted value reported +/- standard deviation.</p>

      <p>Scaffolds were tested to assess the base mechanical properties of homogenous and hybrid scaffolds. Scaffolds measuring 20 × 20 × 10 mm were loaded into an MTS Criterion Model 43 (Eden Prairie, MN) with a 5 kN load cell and subjected to unconfined uniaxial compression. The scaffolds were compressed perpendicular to the print axis at a rate of 1.27 mm/min. The compressive modulus was determined from the linear region of the stress-strain curve (n = 3).</p>

      <title>Analysis of porous boundaries</title>
      <p>In order to assess the connectivity of pores between regions of different porous microarchitectures, the area of the interface was analyzed in the digital model in MATLAB. The interface was isolated digitally at a 200μm thickness, and the area of each connecting pore was measured. The porous area fraction of the boundary surface was found by summing the individual pore areas and dividing by the area of the interface boundary between regions.</p>

      <p>Large portions of the craniofacial skeleton were selected to serve as anatomic test shapes. STLs or DICOMs of the shapes were exported from MIMICs (Materialise, Plymouth, MI) and imported into scafSCLICR. The shapes were divided into regions arranged linearly along the length of the shape (zygoma), or according to shape thickness (orbital bones), or according to depth (hemimandible). Different porous patterns appropriate for tissue engineering were selected from the design space and applied to the different regions of the anatomic shapes.</p>

    <p>scafSLICR was used on a standard desktop computer to generate the designs in this study [<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0225007.s002">S2 Appendix</xref>, Examples 1–9]. The largest shape (orbital bone) took six minutes to slice and generate the GCODE file, which is similar to the computing time when using Slic3r. Smaller volume shapes required proportionally less time to slice. 3D-printing time similarly scaled with volume, with large shapes requiring on the order of 10 hours and smaller shapes on the order of 20 min. Designed scaffolds were manufactured using the output GCODE without complications. Isotropic, regular, cubic pores were visible from top-down and side-on views of the scaffold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0225007.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). The support material was automatically generated for anatomic shapes and removed from prints with minor artifacts.</p>

      <p>Based on the diameter of the printer nozzle in use, the strut width can be modulated by depositing adjacent fibers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0225007.g002">Fig 2A</xref>), thus a variety of strut widths may be achieved that are integer multiples of the printer nozzle diameter. This allows the decoupling of pore diameter and overall porosity. By modulating the strut width, a multitude of porosities may be achieved for a given pore diameter (and <italic>vice versa</italic>) as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0225007.g002">Fig 2B</xref>. Pore diameters ranging from 0.2 mm to 1.0 mm were successfully printed using the 0.5 mm nozzle on the Lulzbot Taz5 printer. Within this range of pore diameter, many different porosities may be achieved by varying the strut width. For example, for a pore diameter of 500 μm, eight different porosities may be achieved between 11% and 50% by increasing the strut width from 0.5 mm to 4 mm.</p>
      <p>The maximum porosity is determined by the pore size and printer nozzle diameter. The maximum porosity for pore diameters ranging from 0.2 mm to 1.0 mm is summarized in <xref rid="pone.0225007.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. For a 0.5 mm nozzle diameter, porosities may be achieved between 29% and 67%, and the porosity may be further increased to 74% by using a printer nozzle with a diameter of 0.35 mm.</p>

These designs were printed and used to validate that the predicted designs from scafSLICR could be successfully manufactured with a high degree of fidelity. Printed scaffolds are shown with their respective design previews in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0225007.g003">Fig 3A</xref>. Manufactured scaffolds matched predicted designs to a high degree in both the top and side views. There was slight over-deposition of material, with pore sizes consistently below the predicted value irrespective of the actual pore diameter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0225007.g003">Fig 3B and 3C</xref>). Pore diameter ranged from 76% to 93% of the expected value while the strut width varied from 3.5% under deposition to 13% over deposition.</p>

      <p>The measured gravimetric porosity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0225007.g003">Fig 3D</xref>) is strongly correlated to the specified porosity of input design. The deviation of measured porosity from input porosity is due to the dimensions of the printed scaffold not being exact multiples of the characteristic distances of the individual microarchitectures (pore width in <italic>z</italic>, pore width + strut width in <italic>x</italic> and <italic>y</italic>).</p>
      <p>Homogenous scaffolds were compressed to find the effective compressive modulus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0225007.g003">Fig 3E</xref>). Primarily, the effective compressive modulus decreased with increased porosity. Increasing the porosity from a solid cube to 28% porosity with 200 μm pores resulted in a 44% decrease in compressive modulus. Further increasing the porosity to 62% with 800 μm pores resulted in an 84% decrease in compressive modulus relative to the solid cube. Despite the clear inverse relationship between porosity and compressive modulus, the three designs with near 25% porosity had different compressive moduli, demonstrating that the mechanics also vary with the specific microarchitecture (pore size and strut size). Increasing pore size also resulted in decreased modulus with scaffolds containing 200, 500, and 800 μm pores with near 28% porosity having a compressive modulus of 503, 486, 328 MPa, respectively.</p>

      <p>The porous interconnectivity between different microarchitectures in hybrid scaffolds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0225007.g004">Fig 4A</xref>) was analyzed in predicted designs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0225007.g004">Fig 4C</xref>). Because the nature of the interface depends on the position, extent, and curvature of the interface surface, pattern-to-pattern interconnectivity could not be assessed experimentally and was instead measured using <italic>in silico</italic> designs of the presented examples. All interface designs included connected pores. A portion of the connected pores was often reduced in individual area, but together represent a large area fraction of connected porous space (10–30% of boundary area) per interface. Hybrid scaffolds were also tested for mechanics in compression normal to the plane of transition between microarchitectures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0225007.g004">Fig 4B and 4D</xref>). The modulus of the hybrid scaffold was compared to the modulus of the more porous (softer) design and less porous (stiffer) design. In all cases, the hybrid scaffolds had moduli between those of the two constitutive homogenous designs. This result indicates that the transition between microarchitectures did not weaken the mechanics of the scaffold.</p>

      <p>The hemi-mandible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0225007.g006">Fig 6B</xref>) was graded into shells based on depth from the surface of the shape. A more porous pattern was applied to the outer shell, versus a more solid pattern along the inner core. This shell design could allow for cell ingrowth into the scaffold along the surface with some added stability from the inner core. There is satisfactory porous connection between the outer two shells, however, the inner core was nearly solid and did not have many pores for connectivity.</p>
      <p>3D-printing thin structures is difficult, more so when the structure is manufactured with a porous pattern. The orbital bone shape (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0225007.g006">Fig 6C</xref>) has characteristically thin bones across the orbital floor. To print these faithfully, the shape was divided into regions based on the average thickness, which allowed the thin regions to be assigned a less porous, more stable pattern. Thicker, more stable regions were assigned more porous patterns. The arrangement of the patterns resulted in curved and interwoven boundaries throughout the shape. These boundaries maintained 10% and 20% area pore-connectivity for the three most porous patterns while the less porous designs had much lower connectivity (1.4% and 4.1% area fraction) concurrent with their decreased porosity and pore size.</p>
      <p>These large, curved shapes show step/staircase artifacts (particularly in the zygoma example) because there are multiple print levels for a single level of input voxels (input voxel edge = 0.600 mm, slicing voxel edge = 0.100 mm, printing layer height = 0.200 mm). This staircase artifact could be resolved by smoothing the surface of the slicing design 3D-matrix.</p>

    <title>Discussion</title>
    <p>This work develops and implements an approach for the design and manufacture of 3D-printed scaffolds for tissue engineering applications. scafSLICR provides the ability to easily leverage the available design and manufacturing space available in additive manufacturing. In particular, the broad subset of porous microarchitectures can be dependably mixed together in patterns with mechanical integrity and porous interconnectivity.</p>
    <p>The cubic cross-hatch pore pattern used in scafSLICR has been used broadly throughout 3D-printing applications to create tissue-engineered scaffolds. We provide complexity to this structure by changing both fiber-fiber spacing and the width and height of struts <italic>via</italic> adjacent and stacked fibers. scafSLICR operates across the design space of the hardware (nozzle diameter) to create porous micropatterns according to desired features (pore size, porosity). This design approach permits multiple porosities with the same pore size and multiple pore sizes with the same porosity. The availability of this breadth in the design space is important because porosity is most directly attuned with print mechanics and pore size with biologic function. Thus, by decoupling the pore size and overall porosity, we have increased the versatility of the application to control the porous microarchitecture.</p>
    <p>Different strut patterns beyond the classic cross-hatched rectangular patterns are possible. By off-setting the print direction to different angles or curves, the base pattern can be drastically alternated by <italic>z</italic>-layer and <italic>xy</italic>-location to create more complex patterns. Changing the base design from regular cubic cross-hatched struts to another with different offset angles or arching fibers would increase the design space further, and perhaps influence mechanics and porosity in beneficial ways. For example, Moroni <italic>et al</italic>. manufactured scaffolds with 0-45-90 degree patterns of strut offset in order to closely match scaffold mechanics to the cartilage microenvironment [<xref rid="pone.0225007.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Additionally, Szojka <italic>et al</italic>. 3D-printed scaffolds with alternating layers of parallel fibers with layers of radial ring fiber pattern [<xref rid="pone.0225007.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Such changes could be implemented into scafSLICR by changing the template creation sub-routine. Unit cell libraries [<xref rid="pone.0225007.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0225007.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] of pore and strut shapes for 3D-printed tissue-engineered scaffolds are common for AM techniques such as SLS and powder binding, but the complex strut architecture is infeasible in fused deposition manufacturing methods.</p>
    <p>The design limits of the microarchitectures of this study are well suited to bone tissue engineering. There are well-established constraints for bone tissue engineering scaffolds with regards to porosity, pore size, and mechanics. Porosity should be greater than 50% to provide space for tissue growth and regeneration [<xref rid="pone.0225007.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0225007.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Pores should range between 100μm and 1mm [<xref rid="pone.0225007.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0225007.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0225007.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Mechanical moduli needed to mimic bone vary from 14 MPa of trabecular bone to 2 GPa of cortical bone [<xref rid="pone.0225007.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0225007.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0225007.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0225007.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>].</p>
    <p>Scaling the manufacture of unique porous architectures to large shapes has been a challenge using FDM, limiting the applications of FDM-based 3D-printing of anatomically shaped scaffolds. Many studies establish their techniques at scales less than 2 cm in regular cubes and cylinders, which facilitates insights into material properties and enables a greater understanding of the cell-material interactions. In this study, we consider challenges associated with scale-up of 3D-printed scaffolds, such as load-bearing bones, which need to be addressed to facilitate long-term clinical applications. The complex geometric nature (curves, gaps, peaks, and small walls and divots) of anatomic shapes challenges the 3D-printing processes developed for cubes and cylinders. Moreover, when developing a slicing system for tissue engineering scaffolds, it is essential that the system can readily adapt to a variety of complex anatomic shapes. scafSLICR easily scaled to large prints, with regional heterogeneity that did not compromise porous or mechanical interconnectivity.</p>
    <p>One of the major weaknesses of this study is the choice of material. While it is bioinert, ABS was used because of manufacturing simplicity, speed, and cost. The mechanical assessments were used to validate that porosity influenced mechanics and they were not intended to demonstrate appropriateness for bone scaffold implantation. Towards that end, our research group has used scafSLICR to design and manufacture scaffolds in polycaprolactone and bioactive variations thereof (data not shown). While the examples demonstrate the applicability of 3D-printing for bone tissue engineering, many other tissue engineering applications require porous scaffolds with known pore structures and mechanics [<xref rid="pone.0225007.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Additionally, food 3D-printing primarily uses extrusion-based printing methods, and scafSLICR could be adapted to these printing systems, enabling different porous and mechanical regions in the food structure [<xref rid="pone.0225007.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0225007.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Drug 3D-printing has become popular [<xref rid="pone.0225007.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>], but the application scales are too small for scafSLICR to be useful.</p>
    <p>The outputs of scafSLICR enable design validation <italic>in silico</italic> before proceeding to manufacture or implantation. The manufactured scaffolds in this study precisely matched the porous designs. These digital porous models of the scaffolds could be used to assess properties such as mechanics, diffusion, or degradation. Such properties are difficult to directly measure, particularly in complex anatomic shapes [<xref rid="pone.0225007.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0225007.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. The ability to validate such critical attributes are within desired ranges before manufacturing or implantation provides a low-cost means to assure implant functionality [<xref rid="pone.0225007.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Despite the validation of the print quality and print accuracy, scafSLICR is not validated at the level needed for medical software. It would need additional dimensional and resolution tests to demonstrate reliability with many complex shapes, design transitions, and materials. Importantly, the software validation can be compromised by the resolution and calibration of the specific 3D-printer and its ability to properly execute the GCODE. At a base-level, scafSLICR operates on a volumetric 3D-matrix. This matrix approach can be memory intensive (design matrix variables sometimes reach 5GB) but allows for the inclusion of more spatial specific information across the 3D-shape [<xref rid="pone.0225007.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. This volumetric matrix could include additional functional information (explicitly and implicitly [<xref rid="pone.0225007.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>])—for example, fixation attachments, or bone-implant interfaces—to improve computer-aided implant design and slicing process. Additionally, the 3D-matrix has a direct correlation to the DICOM format used to obtain patient-specific anatomic shapes and allows for minimal manipulation of that data along the design and manufacturing process. In contrast, many slicing software systems operate on the common STL format, which only includes information on the surface topography and therefore slice based on 2D contours of the design. Breaking away from the STL format to more of a computer aided design format echoing many of the thoughts from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.fabbaloo.com/blog/2019/2/25/at-last-the-end-of-stl-is-in-sight">https://www.fabbaloo.com/blog/2019/2/25/at-last-the-end-of-stl-is-in-sight</ext-link>.</p>

    <title>Conclusion</title>
    <p>This work developed an approach to designing and manufacturing 3D-printing scaffolds for tissue engineering, with direct control over scaffold features. It was successfully implemented in MATLAB (or the open-source OCTAVE) and is available at Mathworks Repository as a modifiable source code and as a user-friendly graphical user interface. Scaffolds manufactured with the approach were validated with sliced designs. Complex designs of graded pore patterns were demonstrated in regular cubes and complex anatomic shapes at scale. scafSLICR provides both an approach to designing tissue engineering scaffolds with controlled, heterogeneous complexity and scale as well as a readily available tool for tissue engineers to use in designing and manufacturing scaffolds across a variety of 3D-printing systems.</p>

    <p>Reviewer #1: This research is very useful and practical. The reviewer thanks the authors for developing this free and open source software. It is a great contribution to scaffold design. However, the manuscript may need further improvement.</p>
    <p>In the title, “Fused Deposition Modelling 3D Printing” is wordy, suggest removing FDM, just use 3D Printing.</p>
    <p>The literature search on scaffold design needs a lot of improvement. Please look at Section 2 of the most recent review for the landscape of scaffold design for tissue engineering:</p>
    <p>• Yang Y, Wang G, Liang H, et al., 2019, Additive manufacturing of bone scaffolds. Int J Bioprint, 5(1): 148</p>
    <p>Also, when reviewing slicing methods for FDM, the following relevant works are missing:</p>
    <p>• Adams, D. and Turner, C.J., 2018. An implicit slicing method for additive manufacturing processes. Virtual and Physical Prototyping, 13(1), pp.2-7.</p>
    <p>• Tamburrino, F., Graziosi, S. and Bordegoni, M., 2019. The influence of slicing parameters on the multi-material adhesion mechanisms of FDM printed parts: an exploratory study. Virtual and Physical Prototyping, pp.1-17.</p>
    <p>Equation 1, why is the right side of the equation not to the power of 3? What is the basis for using equation 1 to calculate porosity? FMD is able to print filament-based open-porous structures (layers of filament lines are stacked at different angles) as well as unit cell/strut-based open-porous structures (grid patterns of filaments are stacked with vertical struts), see works below.</p>
    <p>• Cheah, C.M., Chua, C.K., Leong, K.F., Cheong, C.H. and Naing, M.W., 2004. Automatic algorithm for generating complex polyhedral scaffold structures for tissue engineering. Tissue engineering, 10(3-4), pp.595-610.</p>

    <p>Could the authors provide information on the time aspect of their algorithm and printing process?</p>
    <p>The authors’ work may benefit not only tissue engineering but also related fields such as food printing and drug printing (see below recent reviews). The authors should highlight this potential in the discussion.</p>
    <p>• Voon, S.L., An, J., Wong, G., Zhang, Y. and Chua, C.K., 2019. 3D food printing: a categorised review of inks and their development. Virtual and Physical Prototyping, 14(3), pp.203-218.</p>

    <p>Reviewer #2: The paper presents and interesting method in a clear and professional way. The literature is fairly reviewed. There are some minor comments that should be addressed, as detailed below.</p>
    <p>The section “Scaffold Design with MATLAB Script” should be clarified. The terms fibre and strut should be explicitly defined in the methods section, before the terms are used. It should be discussed at some point that the pores are actually long rectangular channel. The “square” nature of pores is simply their visual appearance when viewed top-down. It should be explained that equation 1 is the designed porosity (not measured porosity) because it seems that it is not used to calculate the experimental porosity (the DiameterJ plug-in is used). In my opinion, the porosity measured by measuring the square pore size is not directly comparable to the mass porosity (due to the pores actually being long channels). However, it seems that equation 1 is directly comparable to equation 2. Can the authors confirm whether the porosity values measured by mass or by optical microscopy are theoretically comparable? Many tissue engineering scaffold publications consider the area of pores based on measurements of the square-pore-area, so it is not necessarily a problem for this paper to do so. But it would be useful to highlight to the interested reader the limitation of measuring porosity based on top-down views (and also side views in the case of this publications).</p>
    <p>Explain how the 3D models of the designs were generated in MATLAB. E.g. were the fibres assumed to be rectangular? How was the 3D model exported and analysed?</p>
    <p>Fig 4C is not clear. The visual quality is very poor in the version supplied to me, but even without that issue, it is not clear. Is Fig 4A a top view or side view? What are the grey lines in Fig 4C? How did you analyse the models to generate the data for Fig 4C? The following sentence sounds like it is not telling the whole story: “Because the nature of the interface depends on the position, extent, and curvature of the interface surface, pattern-to-pattern interconnectivity could not be assessed experimentally and was instead measured using in silico designs of the presented examples.” … (isn’t the interface a straight surface, with a known position, extending through the model? And it seems from Fig 5A/B that a region near the interface could be analysed experimentally.) Please clarify.</p>
    <p>Scale bars in Fig 6 should have their length indicated. Scale bars should also be included in other figures.</p>
    <p>The statement “Many studies establish their techniques at scales less than 2 cm in regular cubes and cylinders, which poorly reflects the challenges tissue engineering seeks to address” is misleading. There are many applications for tissue engineering at the scale of &lt;2cm. Furthermore, many of the key challenges related to tissue engineering are due to lack of fundamental understanding. Small structures are much more suitable for the development of fundamental understanding (especially when there are many inter-related and as-yet poorly understood factors). If all tissue engineering research had been completed using only large anatomical geometries, progress would be orders of magnitude slower due to the difficulty in manufacturing and characterisation. The present study is a good example – simple structures are used to generate almost all of the data (Figs 2-5) and the more complex structures (Fig 6) have very little quantitative characterisation. The authors should give a fair appraisal of the strengths of their study (longer term clinical application, etc.) and the strengths of research using simpler structures (research and shorter term clinical trials, etc.).</p>
    <p>With regards to the limitation of studying ABS, it is good that the authors refer to use of the software for polycaprolactone. It may be the case that nothing preventing the software from being used for any material. If so, it should be stated explicitly that the software was not developed specifically for ABS and the method could, in principle, be used for any material (with appropriate calibration/optimisation of the setup parameters).</p>
    <p>Some typographic/formatting errors:</p>
    <p>• Page 12: “Federate” in the sentence “The federate was set to 1200 mm/min and a 1% over-extrusion factor was applied throughout the entire scaffold”.</p>
    <p>• Page 13: The website link “<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.mathworks.com">www.mathworks.com</ext-link>/example” should be updated.</p>
    <p>• There is no clear difference between heading style for section heading and subsection headings. This must be corrected during final formatting of the published article.</p>
    <p>• Page 18: use 3 sig fig for all of the moduli (503, 486, 327.5). Having a 4 sig fig for one but not others is strange.</p>

    <p>The authors would like to thank the reviewers for their insightful review of the manuscript and for their helpful comments. We have revised the manuscript based on these suggestions. These changes are highlighted in red font in the revised manuscript. </p>
    <p>Reviewer #1: </p>
    <p>This research is very useful and practical. The reviewer thanks the authors for developing this free and open source software. It is a great contribution to scaffold design. However, the manuscript may need further improvement.</p>
    <p>1. In the title, “Fused Deposition Modelling 3D Printing” is wordy, suggest removing FDM, just use 3D Printing.</p>
    <p>We have simplified the title as suggested to only refer to 3D-printing. </p>
    <p>New Title: “scafSLICR: a MATLAB-based Slicing Algorithm to Enable 3D-Printing of Tissue Engineering Scaffolds with Heterogeneous Porous Microarchitecture”</p>
    <p>2. The literature search on scaffold design needs a lot of improvement. Please look at Section 2 of the most recent review for the landscape of scaffold design for tissue engineering:</p>
    <p>• Yang Y, Wang G, Liang H, et al., 2019, Additive manufacturing of bone scaffolds. Int J Bioprint, 5(1): 148</p>
    <p>We have expanded the literature search to include the manuscript cited by the reviewer and additional designs relevant to fused-deposition manufacturing in novel ways. However, we specifically focused on FDM in the Introduction and many unit cell design approaches described in the review are not easily translated to FDM systems due to resolution limitations. We included the following text:</p>
    <p>“While there have been design approaches for selective laser sintering 3D-printing using unit cell libraries (1), topology optimization (2,3), and mathematical design (4), the structures are not reasonably transformed to the fiber deposition paradigm of FDM (5).” </p>
    <p>3. Also, when reviewing slicing methods for FDM, the following relevant works are missing:</p>
    <p>• Adams, D. and Turner, C.J., 2018. An implicit slicing method for additive manufacturing processes. Virtual and Physical Prototyping, 13(1), pp.2-7.</p>
    <p>• Tamburrino, F., Graziosi, S. and Bordegoni, M., 2019. The influence of slicing parameters on the multi-material adhesion mechanisms of FDM printed parts: an exploratory study. Virtual and Physical Prototyping, pp.1-17.</p>
    <p>We thank the reviewer for bringing these works to our attention. We have included them in the text as follows: </p>
    <p>“This volumetric matrix could include additional functional information (explicitly and implicitly (6))—for example, fixation attachments, or bone-implant interfaces—to improve computer-aided implant design and slicing process.</p>
    <p>The slicing process determines the fiber laydown pattern, and the resulting geometric and mechanical properties of the print (7).” </p>
    <p>4. Equation 1, why is the right side of the equation not to the power of 3? What is the basis for using equation 1 to calculate porosity? </p>
    <p>We clarify that we report on isotropic pore structures based on the repeating unit of any of the scaffolds. For example, in the figure below, the unit volume of the repeating unit is given by:</p>
    <p>Unit volume = Length * width * height</p>
    <p> = (Strut width + Pore width)*(strut width + Pore width) * Pore height</p>
    <p>The porous void of the unit volume:</p>
    <p> = Pore width * Pore width * Pore height</p>
    <p>The porosity = (Pore width * Pore width * Pore height)/((Strut width + Pore width)*(Strut width + Pore width) * Pore height)</p>
    <p> = (Pore width)2/(Strut width + Pore width)2</p>
    <p>To better explain this, we have included the following text:</p>
    <p>“The porosity of the repeating unit is calculated in equation 1: a repeating unit has the width of a strut + pore, the length of a strut + pore, and the height of pore, while the void volume is given by pore width*pore width*pore height.” </p>
    <p>5. FDM is able to print filament-based open-porous structures (layers of filament lines are stacked at different angles) as well as unit cell/strut-based open-porous structures (grid patterns of filaments are stacked with vertical struts), see works below.</p>

    <p>We thank the reviewer for bringing these publications to our attention. We have cited them in our discussion of open-porous structures based on fiber angle and have indicated the difficulty of using unit cell libraries in FDM. </p>
    <p>“Unit cell libraries(1,8) for 3D-printed tissue-engineered scaffolds are common for AM techniques such as SLS and powder binding, but the complex strut architecture is infeasible in fused deposition manufacturing methods.” </p>
    <p>6. Could the authors provide information on the time aspect of their algorithm and printing process?</p>
    <p>We indicate in the results section that the largest shape required 6 minutes of computational time to prepare gcode. All smaller shapes required proportionally less time as the algorithm workload varies directly with the volume of the shape. Printing time similarly depended on the volume of the object and ranged from 15 min for 1cm cubes to ~10 hours for the large anatomic objects. We have included the following text to indicate that the algorithm and print time scales with the volume of the object. </p>
    <p>“Smaller volume shapes required proportionally less time to slice. 3D-printing time similarly scaled with volume, with large shapes requiring on the order of 10 hours and smaller shapes on the order of 20 min.” </p>
    <p>7. The authors’ work may benefit not only tissue engineering but also related fields such as food printing and drug printing (see below recent reviews). The authors should highlight this potential in the discussion.</p>

    <p>We appreciate the reviewer's consideration of food and drug printing along with the potential applications of this work to those fields. We have included the following text in the discussion:</p>
    <p>“Food 3D-printing primarily uses extrusion-based printing methods, and scafSLICR could be adapted to these printing systems, enabling different porous and mechanical regions in the food structure (9,10). Drug 3D-printing has become popular (11), but the application scales are too small for scafSLICR to be useful.” </p>
    <p> </p>
    <p>Reviewer #2: </p>
    <p>The paper presents and interesting method in a clear and professional way. The literature is fairly reviewed. There are some minor comments that should be addressed, as detailed below.</p>
    <p>1. The section “Scaffold Design with MATLAB Script” should be clarified. The terms fibre and strut should be explicitly defined in the methods section, before the terms are used. It should be discussed at some point that the pores are actually long rectangular channel. The “square” nature of pores is simply their visual appearance when viewed top-down. </p>
    <p>We have defined each of these terms the first time they are used in the manuscript.</p>
    <p>“Fiber – Structure of extruded of material from the extruder head along a toolpath on a single print layer. Fibers are assumed to be rectangular with the width of the extruder nozzle and the height of the print layer. </p>
    <p>Strut – Solid material of many adjacent fibers, often composed of multiple fibers in width and height. </p>
    <p>Pore and Channel – Void spacing between struts, in horizontal and vertical directions. Square projections with equal width and height when viewed from the top or side of the scaffold.” </p>
    <p>2. It should be explained that equation 1 is the designed porosity (not measured porosity) because it seems that it is not used to calculate the experimental porosity (the DiameterJ plug-in is used). In my opinion, the porosity measured by measuring the square pore size is not directly comparable to the mass porosity (due to the pores actually being long channels). However, it seems that equation 1 is directly comparable to equation 2. Can the authors confirm whether the porosity values measured by mass or by optical microscopy are theoretically comparable? Many tissue engineering scaffold publications consider the area of pores based on measurements of the square-pore-area, so it is not necessarily a problem for this paper to do so. But it would be useful to highlight to the interested reader the limitation of measuring porosity based on top-down views (and also side views in the case of this publications).</p>
    <p>We have clarified that the measured porosity in this study was done using mass measurements. We include the following statement:</p>
    <p>“The porosity of printed porous scaffolds was determined by mass measurements compared to solid prints of the same dimensions (Equation 2), and they were compared to the porosity of the computer design by computing the void fraction the 3D-MATLAB matrix.”</p>
    <p>3. Explain how the 3D models of the designs were generated in MATLAB. E.g. were the fibres assumed to be rectangular? How was the 3D model exported and analyzed?</p>
    <p>We have provided clarity in the methods section by adding the following text: </p>
    <p>“3D-Design models were generated in MATLAB by assuming fibers to be perfectly rectangular (nozzle width x print layer height). The design was assembled into a volumetric 3D-matrix which could be examined directly in MATLAB using matrix property analysis, MATLAB 3D-plotting functions, or exported as an STL to be viewed and analyzed in a range of software programs.” </p>
    <p>4. Fig 4C is not clear. The visual quality is very poor in the version supplied to me, but even without that issue, it is not clear. Is Fig 4A a top view or side view? What are the grey lines in Fig 4C? How did you analyse the models to generate the data for Fig 4C? </p>
    <p>We thank the reviewer for this useful critique. We have edited the figure to increase clarity: (1) We have added labels to indicate the view angles. (2) We describe the gray lines as mean and quartile marks in the caption. We clarify in the text (Methods / Analysis of Porous Boundaries) that we digitally isolated the interface and measured the pore areas in that thin section of the model: </p>
    <p>“In order to assess the connectivity of pores between regions of different porous microarchitectures, the area of the interface was analyzed in the digital model in MATLAB. The interface was isolated digitally at a 200µm thickness, and the area of each connecting pore was measured. The porous area fraction of the boundary surface was found by summing the individual pore areas and dividing by the area of the interface boundary between regions.” </p>
    <p>The following sentence sounds like it is not telling the whole story: “Because the nature of the interface depends on the position, extent, and curvature of the interface surface, pattern-to-pattern interconnectivity could not be assessed experimentally and was instead measured using in silico designs of the presented examples.” … (isn’t the interface a straight surface, with a known position, extending through the model?) </p>
    <p>We could not get uniform cuts using any of the available saws and grinding tools to isolate the plane of the transition for experimental analysis. </p>
    <p>5. And it seems from Fig 5A/B that a region near the interface could be analysed experimentally. Please clarify.</p>
    <p>While the reviewer is correct in theory, we were unable to experimentally isolate uniform regions in those scaffolds near the interface using cutting, grinding, or cracking methods. </p>
    <p>6. Scale bars in Fig 6 should have their length indicated. Scale bars should also be included in other figures.</p>
    <p>We have included scale bars in all of the relevant figures.</p>
    <p>7. The statement “Many studies establish their techniques at scales less than 2 cm in regular cubes and cylinders, which poorly reflects the challenges tissue engineering seeks to address” is misleading. There are many applications for tissue engineering at the scale of &lt;2cm. Furthermore, many of the key challenges related to tissue engineering are due to lack of fundamental understanding. Small structures are much more suitable for the development of fundamental understanding (especially when there are many inter-related and as-yet poorly understood factors). If all tissue engineering research had been completed using only large anatomical geometries, progress would be orders of magnitude slower due to the difficulty in manufacturing and characterization. The present study is a good example – simple structures are used to generate almost all of the data (Figs 2-5) and the more complex structures (Fig 6) have very little quantitative characterization. The authors should give a fair appraisal of the strengths of their study (longer term clinical application, etc.) and the strengths of research using simpler structures (research and shorter-term clinical trials, etc.).</p>
    <p>We thank the reviewer for this critique. We have re-written the statement to clearly indicate the relative strengths of small vs large scale 3D-printed tissue engineering scaffolds: </p>
    <p>“Many studies establish their techniques at scales less than 2 cm in regular cubes and cylinders, which facilitates insights into material properties and enables a greater understanding of the cell-material interactions. In this study, we consider challenges associated with scale-up of 3D-printed scaffolds, such as load-bearing bones, which need to be addressed to facilitate long-term clinical applications.” </p>
    <p>8. With regards to the limitation of studying ABS, it is good that the authors refer to use of the software for polycaprolactone. It may be the case that nothing preventing the software from being used for any material. If so, it should be stated explicitly that the software was not developed specifically for ABS and the method could, in principle, be used for any material (with appropriate calibration/optimization of the setup parameters).</p>
    <p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. We have indicated this versatility in the methods section with the following text: </p>
    <p>“scafSLICR could work with a range of materials in an FDM printer, optimized with printing parameters.” </p>
    <p>9. Some typographic/formatting errors:</p>
    <p>• Page 12: “Federate” in the sentence “The federate was set to 1200 mm/min and a 1% over-extrusion factor was applied throughout the entire scaffold”.</p>
    <p>• Page 13: The website link “<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.mathworks.com">www.mathworks.com</ext-link>/example” should be updated.</p>
    <p>• There is no clear difference between heading style for section heading and subsection headings. This must be corrected during final formatting of the published article.</p>
    <p>• Page 18: use 3 sig fig for all of the moduli (503, 486, 327.5). Having a 4 sig fig for one but not others is strange.</p>
    <p>We thank the reviewers for their time carefully reading the manuscript and have made the suggested edits. </p>
