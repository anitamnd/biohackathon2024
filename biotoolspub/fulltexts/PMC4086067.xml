    <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
    <p>With recent technological advances in liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry
                (LC-MS) instrumentation, quantitation strategies and computational methods for MS
                data analysis, it has become possible to identify (to infer) and quantify thousands
                of proteins in a single shotgun proteomics experiment (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Semi-quantitative MS-based proteomics relies on
                label-free approaches or on metabolic/chemical labeling of proteins—whereby
                at least one of the samples is enriched in stable heavy isotopes. In particular, the
                stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) is a widely-used
                technique to interrogate the complex and dynamic nature of proteomes (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). In a typical SILAC proteome experiment, tens of
                thousands of peptides and thousands of (non-redundant) proteins are reliably
                identified and quantified from raw MS data, e.g. using the popular MaxQuant software
                    (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>) integrated with the Andromeda search
                engine (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). </p>
    <p>Further analyses of processed MS data, namely of those on peptide and protein (group)
                identifications and quantitations, are often facilitated by stand-alone,
                platform-specific spreadsheet tools including Microsoft Excel or dedicated Perseus
                    software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.perseus-framework.org">http://www.perseus-framework.org</ext-link>). Although these tools are useful,
                they are not suitable for data management and integration, nor are scalable with
                increasing amounts of input data as compared to a database management or an
                information retrieval system (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Common tasks
                such as summarizing or filtering peptide and protein lists for known contaminants
                and decoys (i.e. false positives inferred from the database search) involve manual
                steps that tend to be cumbersome and error-prone, and as such, impede accurate
                analysis and interpretation of results (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>).
                Moreover, searching a long spreadsheet or large text file is computationally
                inefficient without a supporting index (sequential search). Complex queries that
                require joint data from separate peptide and protein (group) lists are not possible
                because the spreadsheet tools were not designed to model the relationships between
                different entities such as peptides, proteins and groups—as typically found
                in shotgun proteomics experiments (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>).
                Although production-grade relational database management systems (RDBMS) such as the
                open-source MySQL, PostgreSQL or the commercial Oracle database enable efficient
                data management through the use of the structured query language (SQL), these
                require expertise to install and to configure a database server.</p>
    <p>Several centralized repositories for MS-based proteomics have been developed in the
                past years, e.g. the Global Proteome Machine Database (GPMDB) (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>), PeptideAtlas (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>) and PRIDE (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>), with the
                primary goal of providing a collection of peptide and/or protein identifications
                from multiple experiments. To our knowledge, MaxQB (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>), ProteinCenter (Thermo Scientific) and QARIP (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>) are the only available data management and/or
                web-based analysis platforms which can handle high-resolution semi-quantitative
                (SILAC) MS data processed by the MaxQuant software. However, MaxQB and ProteinCenter
                are closed-source solutions that cannot be freely used, deployed or modified by
                other proteomics laboratories, and QARIP is a web tool specifically developed for
                the analysis of regulated intramembrane proteolysis. The above issues motivated us
                to seek a light-weight, cross-platform and open-source solution that equips a
                proteomics researcher with a dedicated tool for data management, integration and
                analysis of peptide and protein lists obtained from the MaxQuant software.</p>
    <p>We developed a descriptive web server, the Proteomics Identifications and
                Quantitations Data Management and Integration Service (PIQMIe) that aids in reliable
                management, analysis and visualization of semi-quantitative MS-based proteomics
                experiments. Importantly, PIQMIe does not aim at providing users with a complete
                proteomics workflow nor with a centralized proteomics repository but rather it
                focuses on the integration of peptide and (non-redundant) protein identifications
                and quantitations, as obtained from semi-quantitative MS data processed by the
                MaxQuant software, with additional biological information on the proteins from the
                UniProtKB database (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Moreover, PIQMIe
                makes the results of the experiments more accessible through the web in the form of
                a light-weight and cross-platform SQLite database for user-driven queries and
                dedicated (off-line) statistical analyses on the locally stored database(s), e.g.
                using the R programming language (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>).
                Furthermore, users are presented with a concise summary of their proteomics
                experiments (including replicates) in numerical and graphical forms. In addition,
                they are provided with a searchable protein grid and interactive visualization tools
                to facilitate rapid assessment of the experiments and identification of proteins of
                interest for the follow-up targeted assays. Finally, the web server not only
                provides data access through a web interface but also supports programmatic access
                through the RESTful JSON-based web service (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>).</p>

      <title>Proteomics workflow</title>
      <p>The principle of using the PIQMIe service in a semi-quantitative proteomics
                    workflow is illustrated in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">1</xref>. PIQMIe
                    takes the results of the MS data processed by MaxQuant and makes them available
                    on the web, as well as enables data access through different clients. In
                    particular, the use of an SQL interface enables efficient retrieval of the data
                    stored in the (local) SQLite database for dedicated data analyses using
                    libraries implemented in domain-specific or general-purpose programming
                    languages (e.g. DanteR (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>) or Python
                    Data Analysis Library, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pandas.pydata.org">http://pandas.pydata.org</ext-link>).</p>

          <p>Computational proteomics workflow including the PIQMIe service. Before
                            using the service, the semi-quantitative MS data are analyzed by the
                            MaxQuant software. The resulting files, i.e. the peptide
                            (‘evidence.txt’) and protein lists
                            (‘proteinGroups.txt’) are uploaded together with the
                            used FASTA sequence library to the server through the submission web
                            page. PIQMIe then populates an SQLite database called the Integrated
                            Proteomics database (IPdb), and makes the linked data accessible
                            through (i) a local SQL interface, (ii) remote RESTful web
                            service or (iii) a web browser.</p>
        </caption>
        <graphic xlink:href="gku478fig1"/>
      </fig>
      <p>During data submission, a user must provide a short description of the data set
                    and select the MaxQuant result files including the FASTA sequence library of
                    interest through the web form. PIQMIe then performs a preliminary client-side
                    verification of the input files before the files are uploaded to the virtual
                    server. Upon successful verification, the status of the submitted job is
                    indicated with a progress bar and accompanied messages. The data processing
                    might be unwillingly interrupted by an error raised at the server side, e.g. due
                    to the use of a file with an unsupported or incorrect format. Once the
                    processing of the job is successfully completed, the user receives a link with a
                    unique job ID that enables private access to the result pages including the
                    database file. The users’ data will be kept confidential and deleted
                    from the web server after one week from the uploading date.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec2-2">
      <title>Web server implementation and deployment</title>
      <p>The PIQMIe server was developed using free and open-source components, in
                    particular the CherryPy Python web application framework (version 3.2.2) bundled
                    with the WSGI thread-pooled web server. The web server dynamically serves HTML5
                    web pages and data files in the JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)
                    data-interchange format (text) and SQLite database file format (binary). Several
                    scripts were written in Perl to parse the MaxQuant result files, i.e. the
                    peptide list (‘vidence.txt’) and protein list
                    (‘proteinGroups.txt’) for qualitative and quantitative data, as
                    well as to extract additional biological information from the UniProtKB
                    database, such as the primary sequences, species names, function annotations,
                    protein evidence and gene symbols contained in a FASTA protein sequence library.
                    Once the user's files are uploaded to the server and parsed, the resulting data
                    files are imported into database tables populated <italic>a priori</italic> in
                    SQLite (version 3.7.9), which is a self-contained, server-less and
                    zero-configuration SQL database engine. Specifically, the database schema
                    consists of several ‘core’ tables wherein peptide and protein
                    (group) identifications and quantitations from multiple experiments (e.g. based
                    on duplex or triplex SILAC) are readily stored and integrated with additional
                    biological information on the protein entries including post-translational
                    modifications. In addition, the schema includes several pre-defined queries on
                    the tables (views) to ease, e.g. the filtering of contaminants and decoys, the
                    preparation of peptide- and protein-level summaries or input data for the
                    front-end visualization.</p>
      <p>In order to provide a web application that scales dynamically with increasing
                    user demands, we deployed the PIQMIe server, as a virtual machine (VM) installed
                    with the Ubuntu Linux 12.04 LTS (64-bit) operating system, on the HPC Cloud
                    computing infrastructure (using a customized version of the OpenNebula platform)

      <title>Sample data set</title>
      <p>The practical use of the PIQMIe service is exemplified using a recently published
                    SILAC-based proteomics study on bone formation and mineralization (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). The raw MS data were made available by
                    the authors and re-analyzed using a newer version of the MaxQuant/Andromeda
                    software (version 1.3.0.5) with the same parameter settings, except the use of a
                    more recent human FASTA sequence library from the UniProtKB (release 2013_11)
                    instead of the discontinued IPI database (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). In this study, the responses to activin A, a transforming
                    growth factor-β superfamily member, on human mesenchymal stem cells
                    (hMSC) derived osteoblast differentiation and mineralization were investigated
                    using semi-quantitative MS-based proteomics with duplex SILAC metabolic
                    labeling. Specifically, it involved a reciprocal labeling strategy in which both
                    the activin A treated and control samples were cultured on light and heavy
                    isotope-enriched culture media to obtain more reliable quantitative data
                    compared to a single-experiment approach. The analysis focused on the protein
                    composition and changes in the extracellular compartments, namely the
                    extracellular matrix (ECM) and matrix vesicles (MVs) (Supplementary Table
                    S1).</p>

        <title>Summarizing and reporting experiments</title>
        <p>The PIQMIe service processed the sample data in about a minute upon data
                        upload and presented a concise summary of the SILAC experiments in numerical
                        and graphical forms (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">2</xref> and
                        Supplementary Tables S2–S7). The pooled analysis of the ECM and MV
                        proteomes resulted in the identification (inference) of 4693 proteins from
                        the UniProtKB database, of which about half belong to the high-quality,
                        manually curated UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot section (2238 entries). As this
                        proteomics study is targeted rather than unbiased, the total number of
                        proteins identified from the MS data is relatively low (about 5%) given the
                        known human proteome, i.e. all human proteins verified experimentally and
                        predicted <italic>in silico</italic> according to the UniProtKB database (88
                        473 proteins including splice isoforms, release 2013_11) (Supplementary
                        Table S2). The identified proteins were clustered into 889 (non-redundant)
                        protein groups, excluding those detected as contaminants and decoys (111 in
                        total), by the MaxQuant software. More than half of the groups were
                        associated with SILAC ratios (Heavy/Light) based on at least two peptide
                        quantitation events in the ECM replicates, i.e. 572 groups (64%) versus 452
                        (51%). In terms of protein quantitations, the MV proteome was more limited
                        than that of the ECM because fewer peptides were identified (up to 8-fold)
                        from the low abundant MVs, i.e. 107 and 68 protein groups quantitated in the
                        forward and reverse SILAC MV experiment, respectively. However, the total
                        number of (unique) peptide contaminants was greater in the MV than in ECM
                        experiments (Supplementary Tables S3 and S4). Proteins regulated by activin
                        A signaling were identified per SILAC experiment by applying two types of
                        cutoffs: (i) on the normalized protein ratios as fold-change (FC ≥
                        1.5) and (ii) on the intensity-based significance B (P value &lt; 0.05)

                        method (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). In total, 55/6 and 36/3
                        protein groups were found regulated in the forward and reverse SILAC ECM/MV

        <p>The PIQMIe web interface provides tools for searching and visualizing the
                        results obtained from one or more proteomics experiments (or replicates).
                        Specifically, one can use the searchable protein grid and the interactive 2D
                        scatterplot with cut-off sliders, e.g. to detect proteins which are
                        consistently up- or down-regulated in reciprocal SILAC experiments. (Figure
                            <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">3A</xref> and B). Using this approach on
                        the sample data set, we obtained a smaller set of regulated protein groups
                        (FC ≥ 1.5; P value &lt; 0.05), with 14 found in the ECM but
                        none in the MV, compared to the single-experiment approach described above.
                        We repeated this procedure by applying a less stringent filter on this data
                        set, i.e. without the P value threshold as used in the original publication,
                        which yielded 50 and 7 regulated protein groups in the ECM and the MV
                        experiments, respectively (Supplementary Tables S6 and S7). Among the most
                        regulated proteins in the ECM were those associated with glucose metabolism
                        such as the UTP-glucose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase (UGP2) and
                        phosphoglucomutase-1 (PGM1). In the MV experiments, we found proteins
                        involved in calcium flux in the MVs, of which annexin A4 was among the most
                        down-regulated proteins by activin A signaling.</p>

                                quadrants: the 1st and 3rd quadrants contain proteins that are

                                respectively. For example, the UGP2 is consistently up-regulated in

                                to the automatically annotated (unreviewed) UniProtKB/TrEMBL section
                                (in gray). In addition, users can choose which experiments to view
                                in the map. Note: All protein groups, accessions and peptides
                                reported in the web interface are provided with hyperlinks to the

        <p>In shotgun proteomics experiments, it is common to obtain inferred protein
                        groups rather than unambiguously identified proteins (singletons) because
                        the peptide-centric approach results in one or more matching proteins
                        (including their splice isoforms or paralogs) per peptide. Therefore, a
                        representative or leading protein of each group is commonly selected as the
                        best-scoring one with the maximum number of peptides identified but all
                        other potential protein identifications are also kept. Depending on the
                        FASTA sequence library against which the MS data were searched, the choice
                        of the leading protein is crucial. For example, if the library originates
                        from a database that contains annotations of distinct quality (e.g. the
                        UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot <italic>versus</italic> UniProtKB/TrEMBL), reporting a
                        poorly annotated protein (mainly from UniProtKB/TrEMBL) might complicate the
                        interpretation of results. In the searchable protein grid, each protein
                        group is reported with the highest protein evidence and a non-redundant set
                        of function annotations (excluding duplicate or uninformative annotations
                        such as ‘uncharacterized protein’ and ‘unknown
                        protein’) based on all protein accessions rather than a single
                        representative in that group, so that the most relevant information is
                        presented to the users. In addition, the protein grid links each group with
                        an integrated map that enables interactive visualization of peptides
                        including their matching parent proteins as identified in the experiment(s)
                        (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">3C</xref>).</p>

    <title>CONCLUSIONS AND PERSPECTIVES</title>
    <p>In this article we presented PIQMIe, a cloud-based web application for reliable and
                scalable data management, analysis and visualization of semi-quantitative MS data
                processed by the popular MaxQuant software. PIQMIe provides users with a reporting
                tool that aids in the assessment of semi-quantitative shotgun proteomics experiments
                based on data properties summarized in numerical and graphical forms. We adapted a
                novel approach in managing and sharing the processed MS data using a light-weight
                RDBMS that does not require installation and configuration of a database server. In
                particular, PIQMIe transforms the user's input files into a single cross-platform
                database file contained with integrated peptide- and protein-level qualitative and
                quantitative data, and makes the resulting database available on the web for
                user-driven queries. This approach enables more efficient data access (using SQL)
                and analyses compared to the use of a plain text file or a spreadsheet. The web
                server also supports programmatic access through RESTful web service. Future work
                includes the implementation of proteomics data standards developed by the Proteomics
                Standards Initiative, in particular the mzIdentML and mzQuantML formats (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>).</p>
