    <abstract>
      <p>Diverse algorithms can integrate transcriptomics with genome-scale metabolic models (GEMs) to build context-specific metabolic models. These algorithms require identification of a list of high confidence (core) reactions from transcriptomics, but parameters related to identification of core reactions, such as thresholding of expression profiles, can significantly change model content. Importantly, current thresholding approaches are burdened with setting singular arbitrary thresholds for all genes; thus, resulting in removal of enzymes needed in small amounts and even many housekeeping genes. Here, we describe StanDep, a novel heuristic method for using transcriptomics to identify core reactions prior to building context-specific metabolic models. StanDep clusters gene expression data based on their expression pattern across different contexts and determines thresholds for each cluster using data-dependent statistics, specifically standard deviation and mean. To demonstrate the use of StanDep, we built hundreds of models for the NCI-60 cancer cell lines. These models successfully increased the inclusion of housekeeping reactions, which are often lost in models built using standard thresholding approaches. Further, StanDep also provided a transcriptomic explanation for inclusion of lowly expressed reactions that were otherwise only supported by model extraction methods. Our study also provides novel insights into how cells may deal with context-specific and ubiquitous functions. StanDep, as a MATLAB toolbox, is available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/LewisLabUCSD/StanDep">https://github.com/LewisLabUCSD/StanDep</ext-link></p>

      <p>Integration of transcriptomics data with genome-scale metabolic models is appealing but challenging due to the number of parametric decisions required to be made to by the user. This is further exacerbated by models failing to capture functionalities which are important for cellular maintenance. In this study, we propose a thresholding method for functionally qualifying a metabolic reaction to be active. We used our method to extract models of NCI-60 cancer cell lines, human tissues, and C. elegans cell types. We show that our thresholding method improves the coverage of functions required for cellular maintenance. We also validated and compared models built with our approach against those with existing approaches using CRISPR-Cas9 essentiality screens. Overall, our study provides novel insights into how cells may deal with context-specific and ubiquitous functions.</p>

    <title>Introduction</title>
    <p>Integration of omics data with genome-scale metabolic models (GEMs) has facilitated insights into diverse questions, spanning from the elucidation of disease mechanisms [<xref rid="pcbi.1007764.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1007764.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] to the identification of drug targets [<xref rid="pcbi.1007764.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>–<xref rid="pcbi.1007764.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Furthermore, a recent rise in comprehensively quantified omics data for many tissues and cell types [<xref rid="pcbi.1007764.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>–<xref rid="pcbi.1007764.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] presents an opportunity to study context-specific behavior (i.e., tissue, cell type, environmental conditions, or other variations to which cells are exposed) [<xref rid="pcbi.1007764.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>–<xref rid="pcbi.1007764.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Such studies depend on the omics-integrated models to include context-relevant genes and reactions. Unfortunately, due to over simplified assumptions of which genes are expressed or not, current omics-integration methods may fail to include important genes, leading to less-predictive models [<xref rid="pcbi.1007764.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Here we present an improved method to identify context-relevant genes robustly, leading towards models that better describe context-specific metabolism.</p>
    <p>The integration of omics data and GEMs is complicated by the complexity of cellular metabolism and enzyme regulation. Metabolic phenotypes are driven by not only gene expression alone but also other orthogonal processes, including enzyme assembly, post-translational modifications, localization, and substrate concentration. In other words, gene expression data provide considerable, but partial, insight into metabolic activity. To address this, data integration efforts often infer a ‘core’ set of active reactions from gene expression data. This ‘core reaction set’ is then used to produce a context-specific model via various model-extraction algorithms [<xref rid="pcbi.1007764.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>–<xref rid="pcbi.1007764.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], which take into account network topology, model objective function or additional data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007764.g001">Fig 1</xref>, grey). Inference of the ‘core reaction set’ typically involves defining a gene expression level as a threshold parameter–genes expressed above the defined threshold are interpreted to be active and part of the ‘core’. This threshold parameter has a large influence on the data integration process and its resulting model, according to recent systematic benchmarking studies [<xref rid="pcbi.1007764.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1007764.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p>

        <title>Basic methodology of extracting context-specific metabolic models (CSMMs) using StanDep and model extraction methods (MEMs).</title>
        <p>In grey panel, metabolic gene expression data is converted to enzyme expression (i.e. combined expression of enzyme-coding genes for each reaction) data which are subjected to thresholds using a given approach (for e.g. global, localT1, localT2, or StanDep) and tailored for a given MEM to extract and evaluate CSMMs. In purple extension, StanDep is applied to enzyme expression data by clustering enzyme expression values (Step 1) followed by subjecting each cluster to thresholds calculated by Eqs (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1007764.e001">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1007764.e004">4</xref>) (Step 2). This is then followed by tailoring the output of StanDep to integrate with different MEMs (Step 3). We note that enzyme-specific variability refers to the variability of combined expression of enzyme-coding genes for each reaction. In yellow extension, the extracted CSMMs (Step 4) are then evaluated using housekeeping genes/reactions and gene essentiality screens.</p>

    <p>Despite this importance, thresholds have often been poorly defined, and it is not fully understood how these thresholds should be set. Most often a single threshold value is used to evaluate all genes, disregarding complex and pathway-specific regulations over metabolism. Furthermore, such thresholds are often left to be defined by the user with little guidance or standardization, leading to varying and arbitrary model parameterization. Lastly, such single, catch-all thresholds often fail to identify lowly expressed but biologically important genes, including ‘housekeeping’ genes which are constitutively expressed for tissue maintenance functions [<xref rid="pcbi.1007764.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. A limited number of such housekeeping reactions can be ‘rescued’ by the model-extracting methods. A method that uses differential expression analysis to identify the core reaction set [<xref rid="pcbi.1007764.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] will eliminate the arbitrariness involved in selection of thresholds; but may fail to capture such housekeeping reactions as it removes such features from the data. Specifically, housekeeping reactions involved in the central carbon metabolism or tied to the biomass objective function are particularly favored to be ‘rescued’ by these algorithms. Despite this, a sizeable portion of housekeeping genes are seldom included into the resulting model, preventing context-specific models from describing important cellular functions [<xref rid="pcbi.1007764.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Such challenges could be addressed by a thresholding method that better captures the complex relationship between gene expression and metabolism.</p>
    <p>Here we propose a novel thresholding approach called StanDep, which clusters gene expression data based on their expression pattern across conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007764.g001">Fig 1</xref>, purple). This enables genes that are expressed similarly to be interpreted together by common thresholds. In other words, StanDep better accounts for regulatory complexity via a group of heuristically derived thresholds rather than a single one-size-fits-all threshold. Using this finer-grained thresholding approach, StanDep captures more housekeeping genes into context-specific models compared to other thresholding methods for a wide variety of model-extraction algorithms. We further validated this method by predicting essential genes in cancer cells [<xref rid="pcbi.1007764.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>–<xref rid="pcbi.1007764.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], and analyzing 32 human tissue models and 27 <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> cell type models. Thus, StanDep provides a novel approach to obtain more complete context-specific models of metabolism from transcriptomics data.</p>

      <p>Established data integration methods have struggled to consistently capture housekeeping features [<xref rid="pcbi.1007764.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], likely because the method rely on only one or few thresholds to interpret thousands of metabolic genes. We hypothesized that interpreting similarly expressed genes together would improve the thresholding process. Accordingly, we developed a novel thresholding method that involves two steps: (1) cluster distribution of individual gene expression, considering multimeric relationships, (2) calculate and apply thresholds for each cluster of similarly expressed genes to identify a core reaction set (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec009">Methods</xref> for additional detail). These steps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007764.g001">Fig 1</xref>, purple) work in tandem with a variety of model-extracting methods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007764.g001">Fig 1</xref>, yellow), and fit compatibly into the existing general workflow for constructing context-specific metabolic models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007764.g001">Fig 1</xref>, grey).</p>
      <p>An important parameter in evaluating hierarchical clustering is the number of clusters (N). Here, the number of clusters were selected in two steps. First, we calculated the Jaccard similarity between core reaction list between any pairs of N and N+1, and then, we chose N after which Jaccard similarity between core reaction lists is over 90% (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1007764.s004">S1 Fig</xref>). As we increase the number of clusters, the weaker clusters break into smaller clusters while stronger clusters will remain. Thus, by increasing to sufficiently large number of clusters, we stabilize the selection of core reaction lists.</p>

    <sec id="sec004">
      <title>StanDep seeds core reaction lists with housekeeping reactions</title>
      <p>Currently, the common approach to identifying core reactions is to define a single ‘global’ threshold on gene expression [<xref rid="pcbi.1007764.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. All genes that are expressed above this global threshold are considered to be metabolically active, and their associated reactions constitute the core reactions. Conversely, genes that are expressed below the threshold are unconditionally interpreted as inactive. Alternatively, a recently proposed thresholding method seeks to define ‘local’ thresholds tailored to each gene, which is derived from the gene’s average expression level across tissues [<xref rid="pcbi.1007764.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1007764.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Exceptionally high or low expression may still be unconditionally interpreted as active or inactive, respectively.</p>
      <p>To compare these thresholding methods to StanDep, we applied the methods to a comprehensive transcriptomic profile of human cancer cell lines [<xref rid="pcbi.1007764.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. From these gene expression data, core reaction sets were calculated using StanDep and the following three different thresholding methods: (1) Global 75<sup>th</sup>: genes expressed above the top 25<sup>th</sup> percentile are considered active, (2) localT2: local thresholds are derived from cross-tissue mean expression; genes expressed above the top 25<sup>th</sup> percentile and below the bottom 25<sup>th</sup> percentile are interpreted unconditionally active and inactive, respectively, and (3) localT1: threshold settings are similar to localT2, but genes are never considered unconditionally inactive, even if they are below the bottom 25<sup>th</sup> percentile.</p>
      <p>Core reactions resulting from these thresholding methods were compared to 929 housekeeping reactions associated with metabolic housekeeping genes [<xref rid="pcbi.1007764.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] in Recon 2.2 [<xref rid="pcbi.1007764.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. We found that StanDep resulted in the core reaction lists with the largest fraction of metabolism-related housekeeping reactions retained (<xref rid="pcbi.1007764.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1007764.s005">S2 Fig</xref>).</p>

      <p>We then analyzed the clustering captured housekeeping reactions, and how such captured reactions differed between StanDep and the other methods. Housekeeping reactions were enriched in 6 clusters; out of which, clusters 1, 2, and 11 had the largest number of housekeeping reactions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1007764.s006">S3 Fig</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007764.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). We found that StanDep selected genes from clusters with moderate expression (10–100 FPKM), such as cluster 1 and low expression (1–10 FPKM), such as clusters 2 and 11 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007764.g002">Fig 2C and 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1007764.s008">S5 Fig</xref>). Indeed, we also found that housekeeping reactions that were captured by StanDep but not by the localT2 approach mostly belonged to clusters 2 and 11 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007764.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). By contrast, the global approach favored reactions in clusters with fewer housekeeping reactions and reactions with higher expression (&gt;100 FPKM) (Clusters 9 and 10; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1007764.s006">S3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1007764.s008">S5</xref> Figs). Altogether, the results suggest that StanDep seeds core reaction lists with housekeeping reactions that are not captured by existing methods.</p>

      <title>StanDep-derived core reaction lists are more self-consistent than localT2</title>
      <p>Using StanDep, we built hundreds of models of the NCI-60 cell lines by varying 4 model uptake/secretion constraint types [<xref rid="pcbi.1007764.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] and 6 model extraction methods (MEMs) [<xref rid="pcbi.1007764.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>–<xref rid="pcbi.1007764.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The resulting models were strongly influenced by MEM used (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1007764.s009">S6A Fig</xref>), but not by constraint type (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1007764.s010">S7A Fig</xref>). As shown in <xref rid="pcbi.1007764.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, the largest number of housekeeping reactions were captured by localT2 and StanDep. Therefore, we compared StanDep models with localT2 models. Further, given that constraint types did not have strong influence over the model content, we decided to compare only the models that that were built using the exometabolomic constraints.</p>
      <p>StanDep-based core reaction lists were larger than those from other thresholding methods (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1007764.s011">S8 Fig</xref>). We wondered if StanDep provided better support for inclusion of reactions by MEMs; thus, making them more self-consistent and independent from the extraction methods. We compared the overlap between models and their respective core reaction lists. Indeed, we found that for most MEMs, except MBA and GIMME, StanDep produced core reaction lists that were more self-consistent (i.e. MEMs add fewer unsupported reactions) than localT2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1007764.s012">S9 Fig</xref>). Thus, models built using StanDep-derived core reactions had fewer unsupported reactions compared to localT2. Further, we found that reactions that were supported by only the extraction methods but not by localT2 belonged to low expression clusters such as clusters 2 and 11 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007764.g003">Fig 3E</xref>). These are the same clusters that were differentially captured by StanDep (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007764.g002">Fig 2C</xref>). Thus, these results indicate that self-consistency of StanDep should be interpreted as its ability to provide transcriptomic support for low expression reactions that were otherwise added by the MEMs.</p>

      <title>StanDep models accurately capture housekeeping functions</title>
      <p>We have shown, so far, that StanDep-derived core reaction lists (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1007764.s005">S2 Fig</xref>) contained significantly more housekeeping reactions than localT2. To see if this is true for the models as well, we compared the coverage of housekeeping genes and housekeeping reactions between StanDep and localT2 models. Overall, we found that StanDep contained more housekeeping reactions than localT2 models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007764.g003">Fig 3A and 3B</xref>). We then wondered if the housekeeping reactions which are differentially present in StanDep models belong to specific pathways.

      <p>Biotin metabolism is part of the metabolism of cofactors and vitamins. We found that the housekeeping reactions belonging to biotin metabolism were differentially present in the StanDep-derived models compared to global or localT2 regardless of extraction method (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1007764.s016">S13 Fig</xref>). There are two genes part of this pathway: HLCS (reaction ID: BTNPL, Gene ID: 3141) and biotinidase (reaction ID: BTND1, Gene ID: 686 (BTD)) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007764.g003">Fig 3C</xref>). Among these BTND1 was identified as the housekeeping reaction. Absence of biotinidase has been identified as an inherited disorder [<xref rid="pcbi.1007764.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] and a lifelong treatment is required. BTND1 is responsible for recycling biotin from biocytin; and low expression has also been identified as a marker for breast cancer [<xref rid="pcbi.1007764.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1007764.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] and thyroid cancer [<xref rid="pcbi.1007764.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Out of 4 breast cancer cell lines, global-derived models were least likely to include BTND1 in breast cancer cell lines, followed by localT2-derived breast cancer cell lines. However, StanDep predicted them in over 90% of the models, regardless of extraction method.</p>
      <p>In mammalian cells, glycosylation performs essential functions such as protein folding, targeting, stabilization, and adhesion [<xref rid="pcbi.1007764.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Further, changes in glycosylation have also been reported to contribute to cancer cell physiology [<xref rid="pcbi.1007764.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1007764.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Phosphatidylinositol phosphate metabolism, part of glycan biosynthesis and metabolism, involves glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchor proteins which form into a complex and serves to anchor proteins to the cell surface. An example of such a complex is H8/H7/M4B transamidase (reactions IDs: H7-TAer, H8TAer, and M4BTAer; Gene IDs: 94005 (PIGS), 51604 (PIGT), 128869 (PIGU), 8733 (GPAA1), and 10026 (PIGK)). PIGT and its gene products have been hypothesized to play a role in growth of breast cancer via paxillin phosphorylation [<xref rid="pcbi.1007764.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Further, overexpression of PIGT protein has also been observed in several other cancer types [<xref rid="pcbi.1007764.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. As with BTND1, reactions associated with PIGT had a higher coverage in StanDep-derived models than localT2- or global-derived models (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1007764.s017">S14 Fig</xref>), except in fastCORE (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1007764.s018">S15 Fig</xref>). Further, for global and localT2-derived models, housekeeping reactions from this pathway were included because of the extraction methods (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1007764.s019">S16 Fig</xref>) rather than the core reaction lists.</p>
      <p>Given this successful application of StanDep in capturing housekeeping genes and reactions in cancer cell lines, we also applied it to transcriptomics data from Human Protein Atlas (HPA) data [<xref rid="pcbi.1007764.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. We found that, across 32 human tissues in HPA, the models of human tissues extracted using StanDep resulted in 92% of housekeeping genes in fastCORE and 88% of housekeeping genes in mCADRE. The models of human tissues have been discussed in Supplementary Text (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1007764.s001">S1 Text</xref>). Thus, StanDep can be easily extrapolated across datasets.</p>

      <title>StanDep-extracted models accurately capture essential genes</title>
      <p>In addition, we analyzed the content of the extracted models and evaluated their capacity to predict gene essentiality, as experimentally measured by CRISPR-Cas9-mediated loss-of-function screens. [<xref rid="pcbi.1007764.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1007764.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1007764.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. In these predictions, StanDep-derived models performed comparably to models from other methods. However, prediction accuracies from StanDep had lower variance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007764.g003">Fig 3D</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1007764.s020">S17 Fig</xref>), suggesting that StanDep-derived models may be more reliable in such predictions.</p>
      <p>Lastly, we compared the list of essential genes in the two sets of fastCORE models, and then analyzed accurate predictions of matches and mismatches among the two thresholding methods. Among accurate matching predictions, we found that 113 genes were accurately predicted in at least one cell line by both models. Among these, 22.12% were ubiquitously essential while 26.54% were cell line-specific (black, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1007764.s021">S18 Fig</xref>). Among 58 genes that were accurately predicted by StanDep-derived models only, 22.41% were essential in at least ten cell lines, while 39.66% were essential in exactly one cell line (blue dotted, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1007764.s021">S18 Fig</xref>). Among these was also 6 subunits of cytochrome C oxidase, an enzyme belonging to oxidative phosphorylation. Recently, oxidative phosphorylation has garnered interest for targeting cancer due to its important role in dissipation of excess electrons [<xref rid="pcbi.1007764.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. While the reaction itself was present in both sets of models, only StanDep-derived models accurately identified them as essential. Interestingly, among 46 genes that were accurately predicted by localT2-derived models only, none were essential in more than seven cell lines while 58.7% were essential in only one cell line (orange dash, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1007764.s021">S18 Fig</xref>). These results suggest that StanDep-derived models contain both ubiquitously essential genes (22.12%) and cell line-specific essential genes (26.54%). Both are important determinant of quality of models.</p>
      <p>We also extended gene essentiality analysis for models of 27 <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> cell types using previously published animal-level RNAi screens [<xref rid="pcbi.1007764.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], transcriptomics data [<xref rid="pcbi.1007764.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and metabolic model [<xref rid="pcbi.1007764.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. However, due to the lack of systemically identified housekeeping genes for <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> or cell type-specific essential genes, we could compare only the genes which ubiquitously essential. Here, too, we found that StanDep models contained information not only about animal-level essential genes but also cell type-specific pathways were enriched in respective tissues; for e.g. peroxisomal fatty acid beta oxidation in neurons, hypodermis and intestine. The details from the models of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> cell types are discussed in the Supplementary Text (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1007764.s001">S1 Text</xref>).

    <title>Discussion</title>
    <p>Several methods exist for building context-specific models by integrating transcriptomic data into genome scale models [<xref rid="pcbi.1007764.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>–<xref rid="pcbi.1007764.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Previous work identified thresholding as the most influential parameter impacting the resulting model content and quality [<xref rid="pcbi.1007764.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1007764.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Despite this, established thresholding methods have struggled to reflect biological complexity. Here, we present StanDep, a novel heuristic approach for determining thresholds. We made hundreds of models using StanDep and evaluated them against models constructed using existing thresholding methods [<xref rid="pcbi.1007764.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].</p>
    <p>Existing thresholding methods assume that all genes have the same expression patterns, regulation, and stabilities. This, however, is not true; in particular, the metabolic products of some genes are needed in lower quantities or the proteins may be more stable, so the necessary mRNA levels may be low; e.g. glycosylation related genes have low transcript abundance [<xref rid="pcbi.1007764.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. A thresholding method dependent on a single arbitrary expression threshold may therefore exclude such genes. One example of such class of genes are lowly expressed housekeeping genes, consistently expressed across all cellular contexts as their gene products are required for cellular maintenance or the production of essential enzyme prosthetic groups. Indeed, classification of housekeeping genes is an important part of this study. In the literature, we found only one study that explicitly provided a list of housekeeping genes [<xref rid="pcbi.1007764.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Recently a novel tool, GeneGini, has been shown to be an effective way of identifying housekeeping genes [<xref rid="pcbi.1007764.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1007764.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Housekeeping genes and reactions identified using this tool (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1007764.s022">S19 Fig</xref>) reproduced the results presented in this study (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1007764.s023">S20</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1007764.s024">S21</xref> Figs).</p>
    <p>We were able to show that StanDep core reaction lists (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1007764.s013">S10 Fig</xref>) and models (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1007764.s014">S11</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1007764.s015">S12</xref> Figs) better captured housekeeping reactions in processes such as glycan and cofactor metabolism. Our study identified cluster 2 and cluster 11 (mean expression less than 10 FPKM, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1007764.s008">S5A Fig</xref>; standard deviation less than 2 FPKM, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1007764.s008">S5B Fig</xref>) as containing enzymes catalyzing over 300 housekeeping reactions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1007764.s006">S3 Fig</xref>). Indeed, the success of StanDep in capturing more housekeeping reactions is primarily attributed to considering: (i) patterns of variability in gene expression, and (ii) standard deviation as a measure of biological variability in the formulation of cluster-specific thresholds. Thus, we showed that gene-specific variability is an important determinant when preprocessing transcriptomics data.</p>
    <p>Apart from the MEMs, there can be two potential reasons for reactions to be included in the extracted model: (i) presence of reactions in core reaction list calculated using a thresholding method, or (ii) demanded by the exometabolomic constraints applied. In cases such as that of biotin metabolism for which exometabolomic constraints were not available, the reactions had to come from the selection by StanDep. Further, as shown for StanDep, increased inclusion of reactions due to core reaction list will result into a method that is more self-consistent. In cases such as that of phosphatidylinositol phosphate metabolism, the inclusion was attributed to the MEMs in localT2 and global models; and to core reaction list in StanDep models (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1007764.s019">S16 Fig</xref>). It serves as an example for reactions which make StanDep core reaction lists more self-consistent. Thus, MEMs are not entirely reliable in recapitulating critical cellular functions [<xref rid="pcbi.1007764.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], highlighting the importance of accurately identifying core reactions during data integration.</p>
    <p>Housekeeping reactions of both these pathways showed high coverage in not only MBA-like methods but also GIMME-like methods [<xref rid="pcbi.1007764.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1007764.s016">S13</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1007764.s018">S15</xref> Figs). Inclusion of such reactions also explains why the Jaccard similarity for StanDep-derived models is higher across extraction methods than localT2- or global-derived models (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1007764.s025">S22 Fig</xref>). Thus, inclusion of such housekeeping reactions is an important criterion that the models of human cells must satisfy as they not only capture the biology of human cells but also provide better agreement regardless of extraction method. Thus, it is an important observation that the StanDep-derived core reaction lists captured &gt;100–200 additional housekeeping reactions per cell line compared to those derived by global or localT2 approaches. Using global thresholding of top 25<sup>th</sup> percentile, the selection was favored from clusters where enzyme expression values (i.e. combined expression of enzyme-coding genes involved in a reaction) were higher (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1007764.s007">S4 Fig</xref>). However, without direct experimental evidence (which would be context dependent) there is no way to determine an exact threshold above which a gene and the associated enzyme can be classified as active. StanDep avoids using a single threshold by calculating and applying cluster-specific thresholds. Of course, our rationale for using cluster-specific thresholds was that some clusters are enriched in housekeeping reactions. Nevertheless, applying cluster-specific thresholds was possible because of diversity of the gene expression profiles across cancer cell lines and human tissues used in this study and availability of datasets with larger samples. However, since StanDep requires larger datasets with higher diversity of gene expression, a global approach may still be an appropriate choice when integrating highly homogenous or small transcriptomics data sets.</p>
    <p>We also benchmarked StanDep using six of the existing MEMs to build models for the NCI-60 cancer cell lines. This showed that StanDep works best with MBA-like extraction methods. Besides using housekeeping genes/reactions and CRISPR-Cas9 gene essentiality screens for validation and comparison with localT2-derived models. In light of StanDep-derived models being at least comparable to localT2-derived models in accuracy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007764.g003">Fig 3D</xref>), we can say that StanDep provided a transcriptomic explanation for why a reaction needs to be included within the model making self-consistency an important quality metric.</p>
    <p>Context-specificity of a model can be shown in two ways: (i) capturing reactions that do occur in a context, and (ii) not capturing reactions that do not occur in a context. In this paper, we have used the former way. However, it is difficult to qualify a reaction to be a false positive reaction for a model. For example the peroxisomal fatty acid beta-oxidation pathway in <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> was enriched in hypodermis, intestine, and rectum. While we were able to find studies showing the role of this pathway in hypodermis and intestine, we did not find any for rectum. This could be because the cell type hasn’t garnered enough interest within the <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> community. Therefore, it is difficult to argue in such models if presence of a reaction is false-positive or novel discovery.</p>
    <p>The level of diversity in gene expression across cancer cell lines and human tissues helped in the identification of housekeeping genes. The models of cancer cell lines and <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> cell types were also able to predict essential genes. Furthermore, we showed that StanDep can capture relevant aspects of cell type-specific metabolism, such as the presence of peroxisomal fatty acid 𝛽-oxidation in neurons, intestine, and hypodermis cell types of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> and cell line-specific essential genes of NCI-60 cancer cell lines. In conclusion, StanDep demonstrates that in addition to considering the expression level of a gene, the use of its variability across tissues and cell types can help to better define context-specific cellular function.</p>

We then converted gene expression values into enzyme expression values using gene mapping. We note that we do not mean “abundance of enzyme”. Here on we use the term “enzyme expression” to describe combined expression of enzyme-coding genes for a reaction. Gene mapping involved extracting gene-protein-reaction (GPR) relationships from the model and calculating enzyme expression. The extraction of GPR was done using the COBRA function, <italic>GPRparser</italic>.<italic>m</italic>. For enzymes that have only one subunit, the value of enzyme expression is same as the value of gene expression. For multimeric enzymes, these relationships share an “AND” relationship; thus, the minimum value amongst genes part of the enzymes were set as the enzyme expression value. The assumption for multimeric enzymes was that gene with lowest expression will govern the amount of functional enzyme expressed. It should be noted that enzyme complex stoichiometry was not considered as it is not fully described for all the enzymes involved in the network reconstructions used here [<xref rid="pcbi.1007764.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. We did not resolve OR relationships representing isoenzymes and allowed all functional enzymes to be represented in the enzyme expression dataset.

These clusters are then responsible for generating their own threshold. The number of clusters were chosen such that any further increase in the cluster results in large similarity (&gt;90%) in core reaction lists. Therefore, by setting the number of clusters sufficiently large, we stabilize the selection of core reactions. For the NCI60 Klijn et al. dataset, we used 26 clusters (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1007764.s037">S34 Fig</xref>); for HPA dataset, we used 19 clusters; and for <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic>, we used 14 clusters for enzyme expression and gene expression data respectively.

        <p>StanDep applies thresholds specific to each cluster of genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007764.g001">Fig 1</xref>). In the StanDep threshold formulation, we included two terms: (i) standard deviation, and (ii) mean term. Fine-tuned expression level of genes is represented as the Standard deviation term; and is dependent on the difference between standard deviation of the cluster and the dataset. Lower standard deviation favors the selection of enzymes in all contexts while higher standard deviation term reflects context-specificity of the enzymes. The mean term, interpretation of second assumption, is dependent on the magnitude of the expression of enzymes in that cluster. In both cases, we used the difference between cluster and overall data to address inconsequential variations that maybe occurring in expression. The standard deviation is always positive but logarithmic mean may be negative and sometime be even quite large. Therefore, we introduced normalization to make the standard deviation term and mean term at par. The threshold for each cluster is given by the following equations:

        <p>In the above set of equations, 𝚯<sub><bold>c</bold></sub> is the processed threshold value for a given cluster <italic>c</italic>; <bold>θ</bold><sub><bold>c</bold></sub> is the raw value of threshold for cluster <italic>c</italic>; <bold>𝜎</bold><sub><bold>c</bold></sub> is the standard deviation of the cluster <italic>c</italic>; <bold>Δ</bold> is the standard deviation of the dataset; <bold>𝜇</bold><sub><bold>c</bold></sub> is the mean of the cluster <italic>c</italic>; and <bold><italic>M</italic></bold> is the mean of the dataset. The equation is derived by penalizing cluster-specific thresholds based on: (i) how low the cluster mean is compared to the mean of the dataset; (ii) how far the standard deviation of the cluster is from the standard deviation of the dataset. The final normalization was done to ensure that the clusters-specific thresholds are between 0 and 100. The 𝚯 is the top percentile value of the cluster-specific data above which an enzyme in that cluster in a given context is qualified active. If the value of 𝚯<sub><bold>c</bold></sub> is 100, we set the threshold value of the cluster as the mean of the data.</p>
        <p>The current published literature on the below thresholding methods does not address how the threshold values should be derived. Therefore, we used some of the most commonly used percentile values in previously published studies [<xref rid="pcbi.1007764.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1007764.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1007764.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1007764.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].</p>

        <p>Exometabolomic data of the NCI60 cell line were obtained from previous work [<xref rid="pcbi.1007764.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] and further processed as previously described [<xref rid="pcbi.1007764.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. After processing, we added 23 new demand reactions, wherein each reaction is secreting a different metabolite. These were added to reflect the experimental observations by Jain et al. The biomass reaction was changed to one that contains precursor molecules from the one that contains DNA, RNA, protein, lipids, carbohydrate, and small molecules. The average composition of these components were determined from literature [<xref rid="pcbi.1007764.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>–<xref rid="pcbi.1007764.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. The stoichiometric coefficients of the metabolites in the biomass equation are presented in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1007764.s002">S1 Table</xref>.

The global lower and upper bounds for all reactions except biomass and ATP demand were set to -1000 and 1000 respectively. The lower bounds of the biomass reaction and ATP demand were constrained to relatively small values of the order of 1e-2 and 1.833 mmol gDW<sup>-1</sup> h<sup>-1</sup> [<xref rid="pcbi.1007764.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>] respectively. The cell line specific constraints on 78 demand and exchange reactions were applied on the modified Recon 2.2, followed by making flux consistent constrained genome-scale models for each of the cell lines. This was done by identifying and removing flux-inconsistent reactions using <italic>fastcc</italic>.<italic>m</italic> in COBRA Toolbox. The flux tolerance was always set to 1e-8.</p>

The order of magnitude of original constraints on these reactions was 1e-3 to 1e-6. The global lower and upper bounds were set to -1000 and 1000 respectively.

We generated 10% interval around threshold for each cluster. We defined high expression set as the list of reactions catalyzed by enzymes which are above 110% of the threshold value, and medium expression set as the list of reactions catalyzed by enzymes which are between 90% and 110% of the threshold value. For instances where a reaction was present in both high and medium expression set, we interpreted it as at least enzyme associated to the reaction being able to express at high levels. Thus, we put these reactions in high expression sets. The biomass reaction was given the highest value.</p>

        <p>We used the ubiquity score to quantify how often an enzyme is expressed in samples of the same context. For isoenzymatic reactions, the reaction ubiquity score was set to the enzyme with maximum ubiquity score. For reactions which do not have an associated gene, the ubiquity score was set to -1. Since, we did not have confidence scores, we assigned a confidence of 0 to all reactions, as suggested in COBRA toolbox tutorial for mCADRE. However, we also tried using our list of core reactions as a binary vector specifying whether a reaction is in the core set and if it did not have any effect of the final model. The biomass reaction was manually assigned a ubiquity score of 1. The confidence score of 1 is associated with transcriptomics evidence and our metric ubiquity score already has this information.</p>

        <title>INIT</title>
        <p>To construct models using INIT [<xref rid="pcbi.1007764.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], we used <italic>INIT</italic>.<italic>m</italic> in the COBRA toolbox. Other inputs needed for the algorithm are reaction weights, varying between -1 and 1. To calculate enzyme weights, we calculated the threshold distance for each enzyme as described previously, without normalizing. Weights for all reactions catalyzed by an enzyme were same as the enzyme weight. Here, we used a different normalizing scheme. We scaled our threshold distances to a maximum threshold distance for any of the enzymes within the data. For isoenzymatic reactions, the weights of each enzyme were added. We set the weights for non-gene associated reactions to 0. The biomass reaction was manually assigned a weight of 1.</p>

        <p>To construct models using GIMME [<xref rid="pcbi.1007764.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], used <italic>GIMME</italic>.<italic>m</italic> in the COBRA toolbox. Other inputs needed for the algorithm are: (i) a reaction expression vector representing gene expression values associated with the reactions; and (ii) a threshold determining whether reaction expression is considered active. We calculated the reaction expression vector in the same way as we calculated enzyme weights for INIT. The thresholds were set to 1. The biomass reaction was given a value of 1.</p>

        <title>NCI60 data</title>
        <p>To test our essentiality predictions of NCI60 models with CRISPR screen data, we downloaded pooled CRISPR knockout screen data from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://DepMap.org">DepMap.org</ext-link> [<xref rid="pcbi.1007764.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1007764.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1007764.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] for 20 NCI-60 cell lines. Essential genes were identified based on the CRISPR score. The CRISPR score was calculated as the ratio of abundance of single guide RNA (sgRNA) of a knock out after and before growth selection. A negative CRISPR score suggests a higher probability that the gene is essential. The accuracy was estimated using the percentage of predicted essential genes that have a negative score [<xref rid="pcbi.1007764.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. We then used 1-tailed Wilcoxan rank sum test to identify if the CRISPR scores for genes predicted to be essential in the metabolic model and CRISPR scores of genes predicted to be non-essential are coming from the same populations.</p>

    <p>Dear Dr Lewis,</p>
    <p>Thank you very much for submitting your manuscript 'StanDep: capturing transcriptomic variability improves context-specific metabolic models' for review by PLOS Computational Biology. Your manuscript has been fully evaluated by the PLOS Computational Biology editorial team and in this case also by independent peer reviewers. The reviewers appreciated the attention to an important problem, but raised some substantial concerns about the manuscript as it currently stands. While your manuscript cannot be accepted in its present form, we are willing to consider a revised version in which the issues raised by the reviewers have been adequately addressed.

    <p>Reviewer #1: Context-specific metabolic networks that integrate omics data with metabolic networks have been widely used to make important biological discoveries from microbes to human. One of the most important decisions in making context-specific models is defining a threshold above which a reaction is considered active. Despite the importance, the decision is often made somewhat arbitrarily and without much guidelines or consensus in the modeling field. The authors presented StanDep, a rigorous method that uses clustering to mitigate the arbitrariness in making this decision, potentially improving the robustness and consistency of context-specific models in the future. The authors did extensive benchmarking to demonstrate the performance of StanDep. StanDep is a new valuable tool for the metabolic network modeling community. However, this novel method and the manuscript itself might benefit from a few modifications suggested below.</p>
    <p>Major:</p>
    <p>StanDep included larger fraction of housekeeping reactions. But does it also included potentially false-positive reactions that should not be in the model?</p>
    <p>Besides increasing the coverage of house-keeping genes/reactions, does StanDep improve models’ ability to simulate tissue-specific metabolic functions (e.g., liver metabolic tasks)?</p>
    <p>In the StanDep-extracted models accurately capture essential genes, the authors seem to suggest that 58 genes that were accurately predicted by StanDep-derived models only are better supported by CRISPR loss of function screens. In addition to the high-level statistic, can specific examples be provided that the lethal genes uniquely captured by StanDep are biologically meaningful?</p>
    <p>Figure 2B-D are not clearly explained. What does the numbering on x-axis mean, how are they ordered, how is the p-value on y-axis calculated? The figure legend mentioned that “(C) Reactions which are captured by only StanDep mainly belong to low but tightly expression clusters.” However, there is no expression level information in Figure 2C.</p>
    <p>Minor:</p>
    <p>MEM was first used on page 5, line 138 in the main text without fully spelling it out as model extraction method. Although it is spelled out in Figure 1 caption, it still helps reading if it is also described in main text as well.</p>
    <p>Self-consistent is not quantitatively defined in page 5, line 139-142. Does higher self-consistency mean that the core reactions defined by StanDep require less non-core reactions to support?</p>
    <p>In figure legends, HK is used as an acronym for housekeeping. To some people, HK is often an acronym for hexokinase, a well-known, classical metabolic reaction, causing potential confusion.</p>
    <p>Reviewer #2: The paper of Joshi et al. deals with an issue arising during the generation of context-specific metabolic networks based on transcriptomics data. There are already several types of algorithms (reviewed and categorized in reference [45]) which can be used for context-specific metabolic networks, and majority of them require setting a threshold value for declaring a reaction active. This threshold is either set to hold for all genes or is gene-specific. The authors propose a heuristic, StanDep, that takes a middle road, whereby the threshold value is determined per groups of genes. The extracted models from different scenarios (i.e. conditions and organisms) are partially tested against lists of housekeeping genes, CRISPR data, and RNAi phenotypic data. Therefore, the main contribution is the way to set the threshold, from which point the study depends on existing constraint-based approaches for context-specific network extractions.</p>
    <p>I find that this a small contribution which also suffers from additional issues, which I detail below:</p>
    <p>1. The author claim that the thresholding method involves: (1) cluster distribution of individual gene expression, considering multimeric and isozyme relationships (line 86). Is there support that the clusters contain protein comlplexes and / or isozymes. To the best of my knowledge, co-expression / transcript similarity can partly explain protein complexes, but only if complex stoichiometry is factored in; in addition, this rarely holds for isozymes. The authors should provide evidence for this claim.</p>
    <p>2. The first step in the threshold selection requires hierarchical clustering based on Euclidean distances between gene expression profiles. While it is obvious that magnitude of gene expression is taken into consideration by following this approach, the reasons for not using other approaches (results shown in Supplementary Figures), are not provided. The results in the Supplementary Figures must be critically discussed in the main text—for instance, why is the comparison done for 26 clusters? Do all similarity measures yield the same number of clusters when following the procedure described in the Methods?</p>
    <p>3. The approach for selecting the number of clusters does not correspond to the steps described in the Methods. Lines 313 and 314 state that “the number of clusters is determined such that all pathway[s] is enriched in at least one cluster”. This is a—major—concern for three reasons: (1) it is difficult to imagine how this condition can be ensured, and if so, that this results in a single number of clusters, (2) the logic for selection of thresholds is then circular, since every pathway will get respective thresholds, thus partly ensuring its inclusion of the context specific model. The bottom line is that the selection of thresholds—is not—based only on the transciptomics data, as claimed, but also includes the model structure (i.e. pathway information), and (3) Jaccard distance of core reactions, mentioned on lines 91-94, is not used for selection of thresholds, but for comparison of the resulting sets of core reactions. The authors must resolve the circular argument, since the results obtained are no surprise and represent artefact of the threshold selection approach, and account for the other noted discrepancies.</p>
    <p>4. The approach for replacing the biomass reactions must be detailed. The reason is that the authors already comment that forcing flux through the biomass reaction “rescues” some core reactions from central carbon metabolism.</p>
    <p>5. Figure S1 cannot be discussed without having access to the size of the models, which are not presented in the present manuscript. Going over the procedure for threshold generation, it seems that the larger number of HK genes may be due to the fact that the extracted models are themselves larger? Another reason why I believe this to be the case is that the comparisons in Fig. 3 A and B are based on fractions, and not the number of reactions!</p>
    <p>6. Line 151 – 152 “Overall, we found that StanDep contained more housekeeping reactions than localT2 models (Fig. 3A&amp;B).” –does not—reflect what is shown in the figure panels! These figure compare fractions, which is not the same as numbers. In addition, a larger fraction of HK reactions was found only for mCADRE, MBA, and GIMME (and only MBA and GIMME with respect to HK genes).</p>
    <p>7. The higher predictability / accuracy of predictions for essential genes, based on inspection of Fig. S17, is not justified. Further, I do not see what the further grouping of predictions (paragraph on lines 192-200) brings to the performance of the proposed heuristic.</p>
    <p>8. The authors talk about “enzyme expression” and “enzyme-specific variability”, which is technically wrong. These can be misinterpreted to mean “abundance of enzyme”, which is not available in transcriptomics data (but only in quantitative proteomics data). This can be corrected by writing “expression of enzyme-coding genes” and “variability of enzyme-coding genes”.</p>
    <p>Minor</p>
    <p>9. LocalT1, LocalT2, and global should be described for completeness in the main methods, rather than in the supplementary materials.</p>
    <p>10. The authors should comment about the reasons for excluding threshold-independent approaches for context-specific network generation.</p>
    <p>Reviewer #3: In this manuscript, the authors developed a heuristic method to support the existing model reduction algorithms to prune the genome-scale models to build context-specific metabolic models. The new method takes into account expression pattern across different contexts and determines thresholds based on the hierarchical clustering compared to an arbitrary threshold used in the current methods. The developed method can be useful to improve the quality of context-specific models built from human genome-scale metabolic models; however, such evaluation was only tested purely based on inclusion of housekeeping reactions and gene essentiality. Furthermore, the results are not presented consistently with too many details leaving to the Supplementary material.</p>
    <p>Major concerns:</p>
    <p>-There are other model reduction methods in the literature that do not use any arbitrary cut off values (e.g., Jensen and Papin, Bioinformatics 2011), so authors need to establish first why to use thresholds after all?</p>
    <p>-It is evident from their analysis that the previous methods were not capable of capturing many reactions belonging to housekeeping genes indicating the poor quality of the generated networks. Even with StanDep, mean fraction of housekeeping reactions included in core reaction lists was 0.80, indicating many more housekeeping reactions are still missing in the final models. Therefore, authors need to check the quality of the generated context-specific models based on some functional evaluations together with gene essentiality.</p>
    <p>-The authors claim development of hundreds of models for the NCI-60 cancer cell lines that increased inclusion of housekeeping genes. It would be helpful for the reader if you exemplify application of one such model and show how StanDep makes a difference in predicting the outcomes compared to a model developed with arbitrary thresholds.</p>
    <p>-The supplementary section contains too many figures, not referred consistently in the main text. Some of those supplementary figures depicting important findings should be in the main text for easy reference to the reader.</p>
    <p>- The authors should condense the Supplementary material by reducing the unnecessary figures that are not adding value to the main text.</p>
    <p>-As mentioned in the Discussion, the method requires availability of large sets of gene expression data to define thresholds. Therefore, the authors should mention what is the minimum amount of data required to use the method. They should also mention other limitations of their proposed method, if any.</p>

    <p>Reviewer's Responses to Questions</p>
    <p>
      <bold>Comments to the Authors:</bold>
    </p>
    <p>
      <bold>Please note here if the review is uploaded as an attachment.</bold>
    </p>
    <p>Reviewer #1: The authors have adequately addressed my previous concerns. One further suggestion is that all supplemental figures should be mentioned somewhere (main text, Method, or supplemental notes), so that readers have better context when navigating them.</p>
    <p>Reviewer #2: Review of the revised version of “StanDep: capturing transcriptomic variability improves context-specific metabolic models”</p>
    <p>I would like to thank the authors for attempting to consider all points I raised on the first version of the manuscript. Nevertheless, I find that the revised version still contains some pressing issues which need further explanations. Meanwhile, I found additional issues with the figures in the main text, which I detail in my comments bellow:</p>
    <p>1. The authors state that they resolved AND GPR rules, but did not consider OR GPR rules. Integration of transcriptomics data with both rules is well established, as the authors state in their response, so I do not see the reason for neglecting the consideration of OR rules. This must be addressed as the decision seems arbitrary.</p>
    <p>2. The presentation of the approach to arrive at the thresholds based on the different clusters is greatly improved. However, what struck my curiosity is that if the respective thresholds \\Theta_c is 100%, then the mean of the data set is used. In how many cases in the analysis did this occur? Again, this sounds like an arbitrary choice!</p>
    <p>3. Another point to arbitrariness is the way histograms are created – the number of bins used will certainly affect the derived distance measures. The authors should detail some well-established rules from data science used to address this point.</p>
    <p>4. I still do not agree with the justification regarding the number of clusters used. This, too, is an arbitrary choice, since the &gt; 90% similarity is an arbitrary choice. (I do accept the argument about the subsequent Jaccard comparison, to justify the usage of a particular distance measure).</p>
    <p>5. The authors should detail the replacing of the biomass reaction, since the methods section should suffice to understand what was done in the present study.</p>
    <p>6. The performance of the approach, other than the inclusion of more housekeeping genes (Table 1 and Fig. 3), does not truly provide further conclusive arguments that they improve context-specific models. The authors write that with respect to essentiality they do not perform worse than the other approaches. Hence, more tests are needed to justify the title and this major claim of the manuscript.</p>
    <p>7. The authors did not cast their net sufficiently wide to find out that there are other threshold-free approaches for integration of transcriptomics data, other than the one cited. For instance, Robaina-Estevez et al. published and used RegrEx in several situations; comparison with this approach is also desired.</p>
    <p>8. The number of supplementary items is staggering. I did attempt to consider all of the tables and figures, but I chose to comment only on the figures of the main text (see next point). The authors may consider removing items which are not truly necessary.</p>
    <p>9. In figure 1, it is desirable to somehow specify that distributions are clustered, rather than gene expression profiles (this may be apparent from the y-axis label, but it could be more explicitly stated). Figure 2 A, x-axis label makes no sense; Figure 2B, x-axis label has issues; Figure 3 C – check the % in the pie charts, some do not correspond to the visuals. Figure 3D is very difficult to follow: what are total predictions? Accurate predictions with respect to what? accuracy in % (figure panels should be self-explanatory and understandable based on the caption provided.)</p>
    <p>10. I find that one example in Fig. 3C is too little a justification for the success of the presented approach.</p>

    <p>Dear Dr. Lewis,</p>
    <p>We are pleased to inform you that your manuscript 'StanDep: capturing transcriptomic variability improves context-specific metabolic models' has been provisionally accepted for publication in PLOS Computational Biology.</p>
    <p>Before your manuscript can be formally accepted you will need to complete some formatting changes, which you will receive in a follow up email. A member of our team will be in touch with a set of requests.</p>
    <p>Please note that your manuscript will not be scheduled for publication until you have made the required changes, so a swift response is appreciated.</p>
    <p>IMPORTANT: The editorial review process is now complete. PLOS will only permit corrections to spelling, formatting or significant scientific errors from this point onwards. Requests for major changes, or any which affect the scientific understanding of your work, will cause delays to the publication date of your manuscript.</p>
    <p>Should you, your institution's press office or the journal office choose to press release your paper, you will automatically be opted out of early publication. We ask that you notify us now if you or your institution is planning to press release the article. All press must be co-ordinated with PLOS.</p>
    <p>Thank you again for supporting Open Access publishing; we are looking forward to publishing your work in PLOS Computational Biology. </p>
    <p>Best regards,</p>
    <p>Anders Wallqvist</p>
