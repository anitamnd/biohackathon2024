      <p>PubServer, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pubserver.burnham.org/">http://pubserver.burnham.org/</ext-link>, is a tool to automatically
collect, filter and analyze publications associated with groups of homologous
proteins. Protein entries in databases such as Entrez Protein database at NCBI
contain information about publications associated with a given protein. The
scope of these publications varies a lot: they include studies focused on
biochemical functions of individual proteins, but also reports from genome
sequencing projects that introduce tens of thousands of proteins. Collecting and
analyzing publications related to sets of homologous proteins help in functional
annotation of novel protein families and in improving annotations of
well-studied protein families or individual genes. However, performing such
collection and analysis manually is a tedious and time-consuming process.
PubServer automatically collects identifiers of homologous proteins using
PSI-Blast, retrieves literature references from corresponding database entries
and filters out publications unlikely to contain useful information about
individual proteins. It also prepares simple vocabulary statistics from titles,
abstracts and MeSH terms to identify the most frequently occurring keywords,
which may help to quickly identify common themes in these publications. The
filtering criteria applied to collected publications are user-adjustable. The
results of the server are presented as an interactive page that allows
re-filtering and different presentations of the output.</p>

    <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
    <p>The rapid expansion of molecular biology databases storing sequences, structures,
results of high-throughput experiments and literature creates a growing need for
establishing links between different types of information (for broad discussion and
insights into this subject, please see recent studies (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>)). In particular,
protein and gene entries deposited in public databases such as Uniprot (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>) or GenBank (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>) contain curated or depositor-supplied, respectively, links to related
publications. Several specialized resources, such as GeneCards (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>), OMIM (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>), MGD (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>), EcoCyc (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>) and many others also collect publications
about individual genes or proteins from specific organisms. Protein family databases
such as Pfam (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>) annotate proteins as members
of families and provide short descriptions for most of them. However, almost
one-third of all Pfam families lack such descriptions and are annotated as
‘domains of unknown function’ (DUFs) (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Researchers interested in finding information about a specific
protein can use all these resources to collect peer-reviewed manuscripts providing
information about their protein or gene of interest. However, the task of manual
collection and review of literature about proteins is a time-consuming process,
involving sequence similarity searches, opening and reading tens or hundreds of
database entries, collecting literature references listed in these entries and
eliminating publications that only describe sequencing projects and other
large-scale studies. When we expand this task to an entire protein family, it
becomes almost prohibitively time-consuming. Moreover, collecting literature from
curated database entries provides excellent results for well-studied proteins and
protein families, but is usually less effective for uncharacterized ones.</p>
    <p>These situations led to the development of methods that use a protein sequence as a
starting point to query literature databases (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11–15</xref>) (see Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">1</xref>). For instance, METIS (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>) and GeneReporter (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>)
retrieve publications listed on annotated UNIPROT or SWISSPROT pages. The quickLit
(<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>) and METIS servers rely on a fast,
but less-sensitive sequence–sequence comparison methods (BlastP and BlastX
(<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>), and BlastP, respectively). The
GeneReporter server uses a more-sensitive PSI-Blast (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>) algorithm. Our tests of DUF families suggested that, while these
services provide a lot of useful information for proteins from some protein
families, in some cases relevant publications can be found only by exhaustive
PSI-Blast searches of the complete NR database followed by the analysis of the
Entrez entries for collected proteins.</p>

    <p>In order to enable such broad searches and to complement existing methods, we
developed PubServer, which automatically gathers and filters literature listed in
protein Entrez pages for a list of homologous proteins identified by a PSI-Blast
search. Performing such tasks automatically relieves researchers from the most
time-consuming elements of a massive literature search. For uncharacterized
proteins, PubServer may help to find a publication that provides some hypothesis
about the proteins' functions, and, for well-studied ones, it may often collect
additional literature that could not be found easily by text-based searches. For
well-characterized proteins, sequence-based literature retrieval complements
traditional keyword-based searches by addressing the problem of multiple synonyms
and nomenclature differences between organisms. However, sequence-based literature
search methods such as PubServer are not function prediction algorithms,
replacements for traditional text-based literature searches or substitutes for
specialized gene annotation resources. Because of its large database and sensitive
homology recognition method, PubServer may be especially useful in finding clues
about functions of uncharacterized protein families for which a remote similarity to
an annotated protein sometimes provides the only hint about their function.</p>
  </sec>
  <sec id="SEC2">
    <title>OVERVIEW OF THE SERVER</title>
    <p>The input to PubServer is a protein sequence entered as text in the entry form on the
first page of the server. In the next step, the server performs a PSI-Blast (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>) search against the NR database, using
parameters that can be modified by the user. The resulting list of homologs
(internally represented by GI numbers) is processed to identify a list of associated
publications (represented by PubMed (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>) ids) using a precalculated
protein-to-publication mapping table. Then, publications referring to large numbers
of proteins are filtered out from the list according to the user-defined cutoff
(i.e. the maximum number of proteins to which a publication may refer to). In the
next step, PubServer collects words used in titles, abstracts and MeSH (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>) terms of the gathered publications and
prepares a summary list of used vocabulary. The resulting vocabulary list may
provide clues about common themes found in collected publications and can also be
used as a starting point for additional filtering. However, it does not reflect the
precise distribution of scientific terms found in the publications (also see point 5
below). It also has to be noted that PubServer can only collect publications listed
as references on Entrez pages of sequences deposited in GeneBank or transferred from
SWISSPROT (for instance, PubServer would not find the review about a protein family,
unless it is listed in the Entrez database entry of at least one protein from this
family).</p>

      <title>Input</title>
      <p>The input for PubServer is an amino-acid sequence of a protein of interest in
fasta format. The server accepts sequences containing up to 5000 residues;
however, it is recommended to split sequences longer than about 500 residues
into domains. The input form and parameters of the server are shown in Figure

      <title>Calculations</title>
      <p>PubServer performs all calculations on a local Linux cluster. A typical job takes
between 3 and 30 min—depending on the sequence length and the number of
homologs found—and consists of the following steps: <list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Collect sequences of proteins homologous to the input protein from
the NR database using PSI-Blast. PSI-Blast parameters such as the
number of iterations, the e-value cutoff and the maximum number of
collected sequences are user-adjustable. PubServer also allows
filtering collected sequences according to their sequence identity
to the query. Two sets of preset parameter values corresponding to
the two typical search scenarios are available by clicking
‘find close similarities’ or ‘exhaustive
search’ buttons (also see section ‘Suggestions for
PubServer use’ below).</p></list-item><list-item><p>Collect publications from the database entries of proteins
found using the PSI-Blast search. All entries corresponding to
different depositions of the same protein are included; thus, a full
REDUNDANT Entrez database is analyzed. For better performance, the
search is done using a mapping table linking all protein entries
(represented as GI numbers) to publications (represented as PubMed
IDs). This table, prepared and regularly updated based on all

any specific information about protein function and should not be
included in the vocabulary list. On the other hand, the bottom
frequency bands contain specialized and potentially informative
words. In our experience, excluding the top 10 bands from the
vocabulary analysis is a good starting point, and it is set as an
initial value on the server. However, it has to be noted that,
besides removing the most common words based on a simple frequency
criterion, the vocabulary list is not processed by merging synonyms,
stemming or matching it to any predefined dictionary. Thus, the
vocabulary list is only an approximation of the distribution of

      <title>Output</title>
      <p>The output of PubServer is composed of two tables displayed on two tabs. The
first tab, called ‘Publications,’ contains a list of collected
publications initially ranked by the maximum sequence identity between the query
sequence and the closest sequence found by PSI-Blast (and linked to the
publications). The table columns include: Best match (protein description), Best
match e-value, Best match seq. id. [%], Title, Authors, Year, Reference, PubMed
ID (and a link to the publication's abstract), MeSH terms, Number of proteins
(to which the publication refers), Number of proteins in PSI-Blast output and
Proteins (list of GI numbers and links to Entrez pages of these proteins) (see
Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). The table allows hiding and
showing of selected columns, sorting and fast filtering by text (i.e. limiting
the display to rows containing specific text or number). Clicking on the
protein's GI number displays a pop-up window with the protein's description (if
available) and parameters of the PSI-Blast alignment between the query sequence
and the protein. The pop-up window also contains the alignment and a full list
of publications listed on the protein's Entrez page.</p>
      <p>The second tab, called ‘PSI-Blast results,’ contains the list of
proteins found by PSI-Blast presented as a table. The columns include GI,
Description (if available), E-value, Sequence identity [%], Alignment length,
Query start, Query end, Hit start, Hit end, PSI-Blast iteration, Number of
publications (listed on the protein's Entrez page) and PubMed IDs (links to
publication pages in PubMed). Clicking on a protein's GI number opens a protein
pop-up window described in the previous paragraph.</p>

    <title>SUGGESTIONS FOR PUBSERVER USE</title>
    <sec id="SEC4-1">
      <title>Input parameters for different applications of PubServer</title>
      <p>The PubServer input form contains adjustable parameters that make it possible to
customize the search for a specific purpose.</p>
      <p>At one extreme of the protein similarity range, finding literature related to
well-studied orthologs of human proteins in other vertebrates would usually
require a single iteration of PSI-Blast with an e-value cutoff of
10<sup>−10</sup> or 10<sup>−20</sup>. Optimal cutoff values
for sequence identity would vary between different proteins, but the suggested
starting value may be 0%. Since the sequence identity threshold can be modified
and quickly reapplied to already-calculated PSI-Blast results, it might be
better to test a few sequence identity cutoff values and examine the resulting
publication list. The list may be additionally filtered using phrases found in
the titles, abstracts and MeSH terms. The suggested initial parameters for this
search scenario can be quickly set by clicking the ‘find close
similarities’ button.</p>
      <p>At the opposite extreme of the protein similarity range, the question of finding
‘any’ information about ‘any’ homolog of an
uncharacterized protein or a member of a protein family of unknown function
sometimes requires exhaustive PSI-Blast searches with five or more iterations
and an e-value cutoff of 10<sup>−3</sup>. The initial value of the
sequence identity threshold should be set at 0%, and, only if a substantial
number of informative publications are found, it may be increased in order to
select literature about the closest homologs of a query. The suggested initial
parameters for this search scenario can be quickly set by clicking the
‘exhaustive search’ button.</p>
      <p>It should be noted that, while PSI-Blast searches rarely produce false positives
when used with conservative e-value cutoffs and we can expect that all
identified proteins are indeed homologous to the query, this set would often
extend beyond the scope of a protein family as formally defined in resources
such as Pfam. The functional information derived from homologous proteins that
formally belong to another (related) protein family may still be informative;
however, in such cases, one cannot say that all collected publications describe
‘members’ of the original protein family of interest.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="SEC4-2">
      <title>Annotating protein families and protein domains</title>
      <p>The term ‘protein family’ used several times in this text may refer
to a group of related ‘full-length’ proteins or to a protein
domain (a group of related ‘regions’ of proteins that, in
individual proteins, may be accompanied by other domains). Obviously, PubServer
searches aimed at proposing a hypothesis about the function of a protein domain
should be seeded with a subsequence representing an instance of this domain.
However, one should still bear in mind that collected publications are usually
associated with full-length proteins, rather than with individual domains. For
example, if the output list contains publications describing DNA-binding
proteins, it does not imply that our domain of interest binds DNA but only that
it is found in some number of proteins that bind DNA. Therefore, proposing a
hypothesis about a domain's function often requires checking alignments, domain
architectures of collected proteins and collected publications. Obviously, if
proteins associated with informative publications do not contain other domains,
then the function of these proteins is a good hypothesis for the domain's
function.</p>

  <sec id="SEC5">
    <title>EXAMPLES OF PubServer APPLICATIONS</title>
    <p>The following examples illustrate how PubServer can be used to quickly collect
publications helpful in proposing hypotheses about functions of uncharacterized
protein families. In two of these examples besides PubServer, we used a separate
remote homology prediction algorithm, FFAS03 (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>) since using more than one independent source of functional
information leads to a more solid hypothesis.</p>
    <sec id="SEC5-1">
      <title>Establishing function and collecting literature for proteins from the DUF659
and DUF4371 families</title>
      <p>Protein families DUF659 and DUF4371 are linked by a marginal homology detected
with the profile–profile alignment algorithm FFAS03. Both families also
show a weak similarity to the catalytic (DNA-binding) domain from hermes DNA
transposase (PDB ID: 2bw3), but they currently do not have a functional
annotation in the Pfam database. PubServer searches seeded with sequences of
members of any of these families reveal several publications describing
individual proteins as transposases. Based on this information, one can
hypothesize that these two protein families most likely consist of DNA-binding
domains of transposases.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="SEC5-2">
      <title>Identification of a functionally annotated member of a protein family of
unknown function, DUF2522</title>
      <p>This protein family contains about 150 proteins from the Bacilli class of
bacteria. It is not currently annotated in the Pfam database, and remote
homology detection methods do not reveal any significant similarity to annotated
protein families or structures. However, a PubServer search seeded with a
representative of this family immediately identified a publication focused
specifically on one family member that was described as a sporulation protein
inhibiting DNA replication (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). It has
to be noted that a direct PSI-Blast search in the NR database identifies at
least 10 proteins with annotations suggesting a link to sporulation (among over
100 ‘hypothetical’ proteins). However, finding out whether any of
these proteins was actually experimentally characterized and whether it was
published requires manual checking. PubServer allowed immediate identification
of the experimentally characterized proteins and the associated
publications.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="SEC5-3">
      <title>Collecting literature about members of a family of unknown function,
DUF3380</title>
      <p>This protein family contains over 200 proteins from bacteria and phages and does
not have a functional annotation in the Pfam database. However, the Pfam page
for this family shows that this domain is often found in combination with a
peptidoglycan-binding domain (although it is also found in one-domain proteins).
Remote homology detection methods such as FFAS03 show that it is marginally
similar to lysozyme, chitinase and other cell wall hydrolases. Many proteins
from this family are actually annotated as peptidoglycan-binding proteins and
bacteriophage-acquired proteins; however, since in different projects,
annotations are often transferred between homologs, it is not clear if any of
these proteins are directly experimentally characterized. A PubServer search
started with three PSI-Blast iterations collected 94 publications, and, after
filtering out publications referring to more than 50 proteins, it produced a
list of seven references. As immediately indicated by vocabulary statistics
collected by PubServer and then confirmed by reviewing these publications,
almost all of them describe members of DUF3380 as cell-wall-peptidoglycan lytic
enzymes. Because remote homology to proteins with similar functions and direct
evidence collected by PubServer point in the same direction, we can, with a
relatively high level of confidence, annotate DUF3380 as a family of cell-wall
lytic enzymes. It is also noteworthy that a direct PubMed search with the
keyword ‘DUF3380’ did not retrieve any of these publications.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="SEC5-4">
      <title>Collecting and filtering literature associated with deposited sequences of
human antibodies</title>
      <p>For very large and diverse proteins families, PubServer provides an additional
way of collecting and filtering literature. For instance, one can collect
literature associated with protein Entrez entries of immunoglobulins and then
retrieve only publications linked to depositions of sequences of human
antibodies. In that case, an initial PSI-Blast search collects thousands of
immunoglobulin sequences associated with hundreds of publications, but filtering
by keywords makes it possible to narrow them down to human antibodies (by
retrieving publications containing both keywords ‘human’ and
‘antibody’). If the original PubServer query was seeded with a
sequence of a specific human antibody of interest, then the output may be also
limited to antibodies sharing a certain level of sequence identity with that
protein.</p>
    </sec>
  </sec>
  <sec id="SEC6">
    <title>SUMMARY</title>
    <p>The volume of biomedical literature stored in public databases is expanding at an
exponential pace, creating new challenges for literature mining (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). Similar rapid growth is observed for
sequence information and other results of high-throughput experiments, creating a
complex challenge of linking information from different specialized databases (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>).
Despite substantial progress in automated text analysis and efforts toward
introducing consistent ontologies for biological terminology (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>), finding all literature related to a given protein or
family of proteins is often a nontrivial task marred by the existence of multiple
synonymous gene names and other differences in terminology. Moreover, standard
literature searches based on keywords cannot be performed for uncharacterized and,
thus, usually unnamed proteins. By searching literature by sequence similarity
rather than by keywords, PubServer provides a useful supplement to traditional
text-based searches.</p>
    <p>Currently, the biggest limitation of PubServer is the fact that it collects only
publications listed in Entrez Protein database entries (i.e. publications linked to
the deposition of the protein or nucleotide sequence). We are planning to expand
PubServer by supplementing currently used protein–publication association
lists retrieved from NCBI protein pages with additional lists prepared based on the
text mining of available biomedical literature.</p>
