    <abstract>
      <p>In the last decade, a large number of clinical trials have been deployed using Cardiac Magnetic Resonance (CMR) to evaluate cardioprotective strategies aiming at reducing the irreversible myocardial damage at the time of reperfusion. In these studies, segmentation and quantification of myocardial infarct lesion are often performed with a commercial software or an in-house closed-source code development thus creating a barrier for reproducible research. This paper introduces CMRSegTools: an open-source application software designed for the segmentation and quantification of myocardial infarct lesion enabling full access to state-of-the-art segmentation methods and parameters, easy integration of new algorithms and standardised results sharing. This post-processing tool has been implemented as a plug-in for the OsiriX/Horos DICOM viewer leveraging its database management functionalities and user interaction features to provide a bespoke tool for the analysis of cardiac MR images on large clinical cohorts. CMRSegTools includes, among others, user-assisted segmentation of the left-ventricle, semi- and automatic lesion segmentation methods, advanced statistical analysis and visualisation based on the American Heart Association 17-segment model. New segmentation methods can be integrated into the plug-in by developing components based on image processing and visualisation libraries such as ITK and VTK in C++ programming language. CMRSegTools allows the creation of training and testing data sets (labeled features such as lesion, microvascular obstruction and remote ROI) for supervised Machine Learning methods, and enables the comparative assessment of lesion segmentation methods via a single and integrated platform. The plug-in has been successfully used by several CMR imaging studies.</p>

    <title>Introduction</title>
    <p>Myocardial infarct size is a crucial parameter serving as a surrogate endpoint in clinical studies of new therapeutic interventions after Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI). Therefore, considerable research engagement has been directed toward the automatic quantification of the infarct size as well as the size of the post-reperfusion no-reflow lesion based on CMR Late Gadolinium Enhanced (LGE) images [<xref rid="pone.0274491.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0274491.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. These studies require reliable post-processing tools for the segmentation and quantification of the myocardial infarct lesion; in general, these tools are reported to be an in-house code development in a numeric computing environment (i.e. MATLAB) or a commercial application software. Not only do these tools restrict reproducibility of the studies but they can also prevent a full understanding of the use of computational methods. Because what is behind the mathematical model (constraints, parameters, etc.) is not clear, it is difficult to provide an objective assessment of lesion segmentation methods. For instance, a recent publication of Wu et al. [<xref rid="pone.0274491.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] presents a general review of cardiac scar segmentation methods (including methods for non-LGE images). This review reports quantitative results across publications. The conclusion states the need of a public benchmarking of the methods as a fairer review of their performances. This is a challenge that requires tools for open collaboration in a growing culture focused on advancing methods by reproducible science [<xref rid="pone.0274491.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0274491.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The neuroimaging research community is a clear example of this research and development methodology [<xref rid="pone.0274491.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0274491.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p>
    <p>In the field of Cardiac MRI, there is a gap between open-source software built within the scientific community and commercial applications. The issue is not the availability of computational methods for image processing in open-source packages <italic toggle="yes">per se</italic>, but the fact that these methods are not assembled in a suitable workflow for processing and carrying out statistical analysis on large clinical cohorts. A suitable workflow requires to select the structure of interest (myocardial segmentation), perform a computational method on the data from this structure, and analyse the output based on the American Heart Association (AHA) 17-segment model [<xref rid="pone.0274491.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] (commonly named bullseye plot). Although it does not seem complex, it has been apparently embraced only by commercial applications which offer a custom-made workflow for myocardial segmentation and statistical analysis based on the AHA model. To provide an example, <xref rid="pone.0274491.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> presents an overview of well-known image processing tools in terms of two requirements for Cardiac MR image analysis: myocardial segmentation and statistical analysis following the standardised AHA 17-segment model. In general, a commercial software is a product designed to be marketed under a utilisation licence. The user must pay for a binary version which must be used as in accordance with the licence directives. There is no access to the source code of the commercial product (closed-source). Freeware software is free of charge but closed-source. In open-source software, the user has access to the source code and the different licences (i.e. BSD, GNU GPL, etc.) provide the rights to copy, modify, redistribute the code, as well as build and release binary versions for commercial purposes [<xref rid="pone.0274491.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Open-source software promotes open collaboration and research communities have been attracted to this innovation methodology [<xref rid="pone.0274491.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Overall, open-source image processing software is not closely linked to the CMR concepts and practice. Therefore, a customised computer-based tool such as the one presented in this paper, could provide on-the-job support to ease analysis task performance on large clinical cohorts.</p>

    <p>Moreover, a new demand has arisen with the advent of computational methods based on Machine Learning (ML). Using ML, the scientific community is now developing new solutions to solve the long-standing problem of a reliable quantification of infarct lesions. These approaches require annotated data sets which are generated and assessed by standard methods (i.e. signal threshold versus reference mean, full-width at half-maximum, etc.) [<xref rid="pone.0274491.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0274491.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0274491.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0274491.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Consequently, there is a clear need for a unified reference of computational methods for lesion segmentation. This could be met with a common assessment platform that could easily be used by clinicians, radiologists and MRI researchers.</p>
    <p>This paper presents CMRSegTools, a novel application software that allows users to benchmark new lesion segmentation methods as compared to state-of the-art methods in the field. CMRSegTools, includes customised tools for user-assisted myocardial segmentation; manual, semi- and automatic lesion segmentation which can be used in the generation of training data sets for Machine Learning (ML) strategies. This computer-based tool can be easily deployed on clinical infrastructures, closing the gap between analysis methods and their direct utilisation in clinical trials, as demonstrated in the studies [<xref rid="pone.0274491.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0274491.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p>

    <title>CMRSegTools plug-in</title>
    <p>CMRSegTools is an application software specifically designed to ease myocardial segmentation, quantification and tissue characterisation on CMR images. CMRSegTools has been implemented as a plug-in for the widely available commercial OsiriX and open-source Horos DICOM viewers [<xref rid="pone.0274491.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0274491.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] in order to take advantage of usability features and advanced visualisation tools (ROI outline tools, colour look-up tables, pixel interpolation algorithms for display, etc.) as well as the effortless deployment on a clinical or research infrastructure. <xref rid="pone.0274491.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref> shows the main components of the plug-in and its integration within the OsiriX/Horos environment.</p>

    <p>The user-friendly Graphical User Interface (GUI) empowers the user to: segment the Left-Ventricle (LV); calculate infarct size, Microvascular Obstruction (MVO) lesion size, Endocardial Surface Length (ESL), and Endocardial Surface Area (ESA) amongst others. The real-time feedback updates the GUI with statistical information (number of pixels, minimum and maximum pixel value, mean value, standard deviation, etc.) of the pixels selected by the segmentation along with an interactive histogram. The image of interest is also dynamically updated (Epicardium and Endocardium contours, LV/RV junction landmark, region segments statistics in the 17-segment model, AHA [<xref rid="pone.0274491.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]) according to the user interaction (<xref rid="pone.0274491.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>). Furthermore, CMRSegTools saves the workspace state, which means that it restores the GUI and image viewer to the state they were in when the plug-in was last used. The source code of the plug-in is available at <ext-link xlink:href="https://github.com/OpenCardiacMRISoftware/CMRSegTools" ext-link-type="uri">https://github.com/OpenCardiacMRISoftware/CMRSegTools</ext-link>.</p>

      <title>Interoperability and extension</title>
      <p>The CMRSegTools plug-in is independent of scanner vendor, sequence type and protocol. The OsiriX/Horos framework [<xref rid="pone.0274491.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0274491.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] eliminates common requirements for data access (access to PACS), database management, transformation from the DICOM standard to final post-processing format, and data provenance; requirements which are critical in the development of clinical trials. In addition, the plug-in includes a functionality to import ROI from cvi42 (Circle Cardiovascular Imaging Inc., Calgary, Canada) file format.</p>
      <p>This application software has been designed with the CMR lexicon in mind. All graphical elements generated by the plug-in (i.e. segmentation contours, set of pixels corresponding to the lesion, etc.) are tagged with keywords for identification within the OsiriX/Horos runtime environment. This enables the interaction with other plug-ins. For example, a specialised plug-in for myocardial segmentation (i.e. ML-based segmentation [<xref rid="pone.0274491.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]) can export the segmentation output with the keywords <italic toggle="yes">“CMRSegTools: Epicardium”</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">“CMRSegTools: Endocardium”</italic> (ROI names can be set by the user in the OsiriX/Horos ROI manager). Therefore, this segmentation can be identified by CMRSegTools. Inversely, another plug-in can start working with the CMRSegTools ROIs (<italic toggle="yes">“CMRSegTools: Epicardium”</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">“CMRSegTools: Endocardium”</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">“CMRSegTools:Remote_stddev”</italic>, etc.) by searching for these keywords in the OsiriX/Horos ROI manager.</p>
      <p>Statistical results include the number of pixels, minimum and maximum pixel values, mean value, and standard deviation, among others of each ROI (lesion, MVO and remote) per segment, slice and for the entire myocardium. This information can be exported to an Excel file or as a delimited text file (comma-separated values) for a more comprehensive examination over different studies or cohorts of interest using application software for statistical analysis (e.g. pandas [<xref rid="pone.0274491.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], R scripts [<xref rid="pone.0274491.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] or any statistical package).</p>
      <p>The main computational methods are written in C++ using the Insight Segmentation and Registration ToolKit (ITK) [<xref rid="pone.0274491.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] and the Visualisation ToolKit (VTK) [<xref rid="pone.0274491.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], which grant extensibility and interoperability in terms of new functionalities required, that is new image processing methods.</p>

      <title>Myocardial segmentation</title>
      <p>The initialisation of the endocardial and epicardial contours is performed in 2 mouse clicks, and then automatically adjusted to the myocardium using the Boundary Enhanced Automated Surface (BEAS) algorithm [<xref rid="pone.0274491.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0274491.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>].</p>
      <p>BEAS was originally developed for automatic segmentation of 3D cine-loop echocardiographic images to provide an efficient, fast and accurate solution for quantification of the main left ventricular volumetric indices used in clinical routine. In addition, the method was adapted for 3D+time CMR data sets (acquired by a cine steady state free precession sequence, SSFP) and benchmarked against the data sets available from the MICCAI 2009 Cardiac MR Left Ventricle Segmentation Challenge [<xref rid="pone.0274491.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. The benchmark demonstrated the technique to be robust, efficient and fast in terms of accuracy and computational load, which makes the BEAS algorithm suitable for a clinical practice [<xref rid="pone.0274491.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>].</p>
      <p>The contours automatically determined by BEAS can be interactively corrected using OsiriX/Horos ROI edition functionalities such as the repulsor tool. Endocardial and epicardial contours can also be manually outlined. Moreover, the contours can be delineated on the basal, mid-cavity and apical slices and automatically propagated to the intermediate slices.</p>
      <p>In order to remove pixels from the segmented myocardium close to the endocardial and epicardial contours, and avoid contamination from partial volume effect between myocardial tissue and blood (in the cavity) or air (at the myocardium to lung interface), an inner (epicardial) and outer (endocardial) offset in millimetres can be optionally set as a parameter of the segmentation method. These parameters can be configured by the user in the plug-in preferences.</p>

      <title>Lesion segmentation</title>
      <p>Methods for measuring infarct size can be divided into visual assessment, manual planimetry, and voxel-based approaches. Visual assessment scores hyperenhancement on a 5-point grading scale on the AHA 17-segment model [<xref rid="pone.0274491.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Manual planimetry involves a manual definition of the hyperenhanced regions of interest (ROI) across contiguous short-axis slices in order to calculate the lesion size [<xref rid="pone.0274491.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0274491.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Both methods are inherently operator dependent, which makes them time consuming as they rely on a manual process. Consequently, they are unsuitable for clinical routine or the analysis of large cohorts. Voxel-based thresholding techniques start with a comparative measurement of hyperenhanced regions with a remote healthy region set as a reference (Signal Threshold versus Reference Mean, STRM) [<xref rid="pone.0274491.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Threshold calculation can be based on a statistical measure such as the Full-Width at Half-Maximum (FWHM) [<xref rid="pone.0274491.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0274491.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] or on histogram information as in the case of the Gaussian mixture model (GMM) approaches [<xref rid="pone.0274491.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Depending on whether the methods require an initialisation parameter to calculate the threshold or not they are classified as semi-automatic or fully automatic. These methods are more time efficient and suitable for large scale processing.</p>

      <p>Only Hsu and HMRF-EM methods provide a segmentation of the MVO (or no-reflow) regions. The MVO region can be selected (or edited) manually after segmentation of the infarct by using a pixel selection tool (brush) or region growing functionality. If there is a MVO region, this new class of tissue is automatically added to the infarct size, with corresponding pixels being automatically displayed in yellow (default color on the GUI for highlighting the MVO region). Similarly, if MVO pixels are categorised as false positive and highlighted in yellow by Hsu or HMRF-EM methods, they can be manually removed. MVO size and statistics (number of pixels, minimum and maximum pixel value, mean value, standard deviation, etc.) are calculated (<xref rid="pone.0274491.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>).</p>

    <p>A series of synthetic images emulating myocardial infarct lesions were generated with arbitrary size, transmural extent, percent Signal Enhancement (%SE) and CNR. In order to test the influence of the noise level on the results, several synthetic levels of noise were computed to reproduce what was previously measured in vivo using various CMR sequences in patients [<xref rid="pone.0274491.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. To achieve a realistic model of the cavity, myocardium, infarct size and shape, and signal intensity in each compartment, the numeric images were built using multi-slice 3D data sets acquired on patients.

      <p>Although the BEAS algorithm was originally developed for segmentation of echocardiographic images, the method has shown very good performance on images with homogeneous myocardium wall (well-defined ring structure) such as cardiac cine MRI based on balanced SSFP contrast. As this method is based on active contours principle [<xref rid="pone.0274491.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0274491.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>], the segmentation is affected by the heterogeneity of the myocardium wall with multiple tissue classes (lesion, MVO and remote healthy pixels). These tissue classes have an impact on the energy function that penalises the deviation to the initial model (LV template presented in <xref rid="pone.0274491.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4a and 4d</xref>), which means that the user may have to manually correct the LV segmentation contours.</p>

Absolute relative error is plotted on logarithmic scale to highlight the results of 2-SD, 3-SD and 5-SD for <italic toggle="yes">CNR</italic> &gt; 5. Overall, the accuracy improves as the CNR increases. The segmentation by STRM (n-SD) methods is strongly determined by the remote region and CNR. Lower CNR (<italic toggle="yes">CNR</italic> &lt; 6) leads to an under-estimation (less pixels categorised as MI) by 2-SD, 3-SD,5-SD and FWHM Region methods, and to an over-estimation (more pixels categorised as MI) by FWHM Max, GMM, Hsu and HMRF-EM methods. This is due to the incorrect categorisation of the infarct edges or some noisy pixels. On a real image coil sensitivity variation, cardiac motion and partial-volume effects may generate this kind of intermediate SI pixels that may be included within the n-SD constraint or statistical model. However, at lower CNR scenarios, a lower cut-off provides a more accurate infarct segmentation with an error less than 3.8%. Lower CNR impacts the performance of the GMM method reaching about 60% of mean relative error. The best performance corresponds to STRM with 5-SD, FWHM, Hsu and HMRF-EM providing a very low margin of error starting at <italic toggle="yes">CNR</italic> &gt; 3.</p>

    <title>Discussion</title>
    <p>Although a considerable research has been conducted to develop and assess computational methods for the quantification of lesion size in CMR, to date and to the best of our knowledge, there has been no initiative to provide a unified reference for lesion segmentation methods within a common assessment platform. The baseline of existing publications reporting infarct lesion sizing is usually an offline analysis based on in-house (closed-source) implementations of conventional or, less often, innovative segmentation algorithms. Following this approach it is difficult to make an objective evaluation of existing methods. The assessment would only be performed when a medical device vendor releases the methods in a commercial software product. In this scenario, the benchmarking of computational methods implemented by research groups and commercial solutions is biased by the vendor constraints for the algorithms. Since manufacturers are under regulatory restrictions, the integration of the latest hardware and software on their platforms typically requires long production time, often resulting in regrettable delays in early testing of new, advanced and potentially valuable algorithms. CMRSegTools is therefore a contribution to enable reproducible research by assembling the most used methods for infarct segmentation in a suitable workflow executed in a single and widely available environment: Osirix/Horos DICOM viewers. This platform was chosen because it provides an Application Programming Interface (API) that grants access to the data management, user interaction and visualisation functionalities. It was also chosen because it has an open-source licence. However, OsiriX/Horos is a macOS-only software, which limits its deployment on platforms based on a different operating system.</p>
    <p>One of the contributions to the infarct segmentation workflow is the implementation of a semi-automatic method for the LV segmentation based on active contours [<xref rid="pone.0274491.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0274491.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. The BEAS algorithm utilises a LV template provided by the user in order to automatically fit the template to the epicardium and endocardium boundaries. Although the outcome of the BEAS segmentation may be affected by the different tissue classes in the myocardial wall, this functionality enhances automation capabilities for clinical routine or the analysis of large cohorts as demonstrated in [<xref rid="pone.0274491.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. A reliable segmentation of the myocardium is important as the edge of the endocardium may constitute up to 50% of the infarct perimeter; this means that a wrong determination of the endocardial infarct border is a large source of variability in final infarct size measurements. At present, there are no automated algorithms that can reliably distinguish the bright LV cavity from the bright endocardial border of the infarct. This challenge is being addressed by new segmentation methods (including non-LGE images) based on ML [<xref rid="pone.0274491.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0274491.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0274491.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0274491.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>].</p>
    <p>To validate the correspondence between the mathematical model (<xref rid="pone.0274491.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Appendix</xref>) and the code implementation, the correctness of the computational methods has been verified with synthetic data. This also allowed the benchmarking of infarct segmentation methods (<xref rid="pone.0274491.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6</xref>) on synthetic data. The main lesson emerging from the analysis is that STRM (n-SD) methods with <italic toggle="yes">n</italic> &lt; 5 and GMM are easily influenced by CNR. At lower CNR conditions the outcomes from these methods are unreliable, making them unsuitable for real clinical conditions. When <italic toggle="yes">CNR</italic> &gt; 5, 2-SD and 3-SD are insensible to CNR. The HMRF-EM has shown a good performance in most of the different scenarios (<italic toggle="yes">CNR</italic> &gt; 3). A comparison between expert and automated segmentation methods is presented in Figs <xref rid="pone.0274491.g007" ref-type="fig">7</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0274491.g008" ref-type="fig">8</xref> as an example of the output of the current version. CMRSegTools has been tested and used successfully in several studies [<xref rid="pone.0274491.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0274491.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p>
    <p>An extended assessment or benchmarking of infarct segmentation methods is beyond the scope of this paper. The goal is to provide a computer-based tool which includes well-known lesion segmentation methods (<xref rid="pone.0274491.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Appendix</xref>) in order to empower research scientists to reproduce results and assess comparatively new methods. In this direction, CMRSegTools source code has been released under the CeCILL licence (a French free software license compatible with GPL) that grants users the right to copy, modify, and distribute new versions of the plug-in.</p>
    <p>Machine learning approaches for SI classification would require reference data that can be applied to a learning process [<xref rid="pone.0274491.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. With CMRSegTools, it is possible to generate labeled features (infarct, MVO and remote ROIs) extracted from the data and the expected quantification based on reference segmentation methods. These specific features are the main input of supervised learning approaches. As shown in Figs <xref rid="pone.0274491.g007" ref-type="fig">7</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0274491.g008" ref-type="fig">8</xref>, outcomes from ML methods can be easily compared to manual, semi- or full-automated state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, errors performed by ML methods may be labeled as well in order to improve the accuracy, specially in strategies involving active learning.</p>
    <p>The analysis scenario presented in this paper (methods benchmarking and expert vs computational methods assessment) can be replicated by research scientists working in CMR on their own data or by downloading the testing data used for this work from the Human Heart Project [<xref rid="pone.0274491.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. This is particularly interesting as it allows reproducible research in this field.</p>

    <title>Conclusions</title>
    <p>CMRSegTools is an application software for the comparative assessment of infarct segmentation methods applied to CMR images via a single and integrated platform (widely available Osirix and Horos DICOM viewers). This helps to improve the reproducibility of post-processing methods in clinical studies. This application software works on native DICOM images; the OsiriX/Horos functionalities enable direct connection to PACS making the plug-in independent of scanner vendor, imaging sequence and protocol. Interoperability functionalities allow importing data from external software such as ROI created in other application software (e.g. cvi42). New segmentation methods can be easily integrated into the plug-in by developing components based on well-known image processing and visualisation libraries such as ITK and VTK in C++ programming language. By using CMRSegTools, it is possible to create training and testing data sets that can be used in Machine Learning approaches. In addition, statistical measurements can be exported for further examination in specialised data analysis tools.</p>

    <p>Reviewer #1: The paper presents an open-source software for segmentation of CMR-LGE images.</p>
    <p>Quantitative LGE analysis is not strictly required by current CMR guidelines in the clinical setting (J Schulz-Menger JCMR 2020 10.1186/s12968-020-00610-6), but it is needed in clinical and translational research. A large number of LGE segmentation algorithms was proposed (Wu Front. Physiol 2021 | 10.3389/fphys.2021.709230), few of them established in the clinical practice.</p>
    <p>About available software, several certified, commercial tools for CMR-LGE analysis are available at high cost from several companies. Some groups developed software for internal use but in my knowledge the only available free tools is the Segment software from Medvisio (<ext-link xlink:href="https://medviso.com/cmr/" ext-link-type="uri">https://medviso.com/cmr/</ext-link>) running by a free available Matlab VM on about all SO platforms. Segment is free usable if proper referencing is assured (<ext-link xlink:href="https://medviso.com/how-to-refer/" ext-link-type="uri">https://medviso.com/how-to-refer/</ext-link>) but source code is not available, so the software cannot be adapted to user needs.</p>
    <p>Hence, the introduction of on open-source software is important and may represent an important improvement in the field. I tried the demo version in Horos and it seems to work well. Basic video tutorials are provided, maybe a manual would be also useful.</p>
    <p>Collaboration terms required for the use in scientific publication of the software (likely the only possible use as the software is of course not certified) are proper referencing as usually requested in the field and mandatory co-authorship of developers. The last request is not usual in open-source software sharing as co-authorship is usually applied id a specific developing work is done for a particular project. I guess that the GNU/CeCILL license doesn’t allow the developer to add further limitations with respect to the license itself. Is also not clear how this “co-authorship license” should apply if thanks to the open-source approach the software will be improved or modified by other developers external to the starting team. The “co-authorship license” constraint, if maintained, should be declared in the paper as well as it represents a significant limitation.</p>
    <p>Validation of the software is mostly anecdotic as single cases as presented without quantitative assessment. Is strongly advisable to perform a comparison with a validated software or manual analysis by an expert user on a reference data set including a reasonable number of cases, as MICCAI challenges or similar.</p>
    <p>Table 1 compares general-use software (that of course does not match R1/R2 requirements) with CMR specific ones that of course match both as required by SCMR guidelines. Research/Commercial Segment software should be inserted in the table together with other commercial software as Pie CAAS (<ext-link xlink:href="https://www.piemedicalimaging.com/product/mr-solutions/tissue-characterisation" ext-link-type="uri">https://www.piemedicalimaging.com/product/mr-solutions/tissue-characterisation</ext-link>). The compatibility with different OS should be indicated, as one limitation of the proposed software is the requirement of MacOS system.</p>
    <p>Reviewer #2: This study presents a open-source software for myocardial infarction segmentation in CMR images. There are some concerns:</p>
    <p>- It is better to brief introduce the licenses shown in Table 1 for clarifying the difference in different software.</p>
    <p>- Is there any comparison of BEAS with other myocardial contour segmentation ? If not, please explain the reason.</p>
    <p>- It is better to cite more studies in cardiac and myocardial infarction segmentation. 1) Direct delineation of myocardial infarction without contrast agents using a joint motion feature learning architecture, Medical Image Analysis; 2) Multi-level semantic adaptation for few-shot segmentation on cardiac image sequences, Medical Image Analysis.</p>
    <p>- Please briefly discuss the limitation of this software</p>
    <p>- A lot of grammatical errors.</p>
    <p>- Please present a figure to show the modules and their connections in this software.</p>

    <p>Reviewer #1</p>
    <p>1. The paper presents an open-source software for segmentation of</p>
    <p>CMR-LGE images. Quantitative LGE analysis is not strictly required by</p>
    <p>current CMR guidelines in the clinical setting (J Schulz-Menger JCMR</p>
    <p>2020 10.1186/s12968-020-00610-6), but it is needed in clinical and</p>
    <p>translational research. A large number of LGE segmentation algorithms</p>
    <p>was proposed (Wu Front. Physiol 2021 | 10.3389/fphys.2021.709230), few</p>
    <p>of them established in the clinical practice.</p>
    <p> We thank the reviewer for the observation and references. We have</p>
    <p> included the latter reference in our bibliographical revision and</p>
    <p> discussion.</p>
    <p> The following paragraph has been added to the Introduction:</p>
    <p> For instance, a recent publication of Wu et al. [5] presents a general</p>
    <p> review of cardiac scar segmentation methods (including methods for</p>
    <p> non-LGE images). This review reports quantitative results across</p>
    <p> publications. The conclusion states the need of a public benchmarking</p>
    <p> of the methods as a fairer review of their performances. This is a</p>
    <p> challenge that requires tools for open collaboration in a growing</p>
    <p> culture focused on advancing methods by reproducible science [6,</p>
    <p> 7]. The neuroimaging research community is a clear example of this</p>
    <p> research and development methodology [8, 9].</p>
    <p> The following sentence has been also added to the Introduction:</p>
    <p> These approaches require annotated data sets which are generated and</p>
    <p> assessed by standard methods (i.e. signal threshold versus reference</p>
    <p> mean, full-width at half-maximum, etc.) [4, 5, 19, 20]</p>
    <p> The following reference has been added:</p>
    <p> 5. Wu, Yinzhe, Zeyu Tang, Binghuan Li, David Firmin, and Guang</p>
    <p> Yang. “Recent Advances in Fibrosis and Scar Segmentation From Cardiac</p>
    <p> MRI: A State-of-the-Art Review and Future Perspectives.” Frontiers in</p>
    <p> Physiology 12 (2021).</p>
    <p>2. About available software, several certified, commercial tools for</p>
    <p>CMR-LGE analysis are available at high cost from several</p>
    <p>companies. Some groups developed software for internal use but in my</p>
    <p>knowledge the only available free tools is the Segment software from</p>

    <p>VM on about all SO platforms. Segment is free usable if proper</p>
    <p>referencing is assured (<ext-link xlink:href="https://medviso.com/how-to-refer/" ext-link-type="uri">https://medviso.com/how-to-refer/</ext-link>) but source</p>
    <p>code is not available, so the software cannot be adapted to user</p>
    <p>needs.</p>
    <p>Hence, the introduction of on open-source software is important and</p>
    <p>may represent an important improvement in the field. I tried the demo</p>
    <p>version in Horos and it seems to work well. Basic video tutorials are</p>
    <p>provided, maybe a manual would be also useful.</p>

    <p>the software (likely the only possible use as the software is of</p>
    <p>course not certified) are proper referencing as usually requested in</p>
    <p>the field and mandatory co-authorship of developers. The last request</p>
    <p>is not usual in open-source software sharing as co-authorship is</p>
    <p>usually applied id a specific developing work is done for a particular</p>
    <p>project. I guess that the GNU/CeCILL license doesn’t allow the</p>
    <p>developer to add further limitations with respect to the license</p>
    <p>itself. Is also not clear how this “co-authorship license” should</p>
    <p>apply if thanks to the open-source approach the software will be</p>
    <p>improved or modified by other developers external to the starting</p>
    <p>team. The “co-authorship license” constraint, if maintained, should be</p>
    <p>declared in the paper as well as it represents a significant</p>
    <p>limitation.</p>
    <p> We thank the reviewer for testing our application software and</p>
    <p> pointing out the potential limitations of the use of CMRSegTools under</p>
    <p> the current “co-authorship licence”.</p>
    <p> Before releasing CMRSegTools as an open-source software, we provided a</p>
    <p> binary version of the plug-in as well as scientific expertise in</p>
    <p> applied computing in Cardiac MRI and software customisation to the</p>
    <p> particular needs of the users. This makes us active collaborators in</p>
    <p> the research projects using the application software. In this context,</p>
    <p> the co-authorship agreement has been working among research teams</p>
    <p> using CMRSegTools.</p>
    <p> Now our interest is to join efforts through an open</p>
    <p> collaboration. Releasing the source code of CMRSegTools together with</p>
    <p> this publication is our first step. The GNU/CeCILL is the French free</p>
    <p> software license, compatible with the GNU GPL, the license grants</p>
    <p> access to the source code and the rights to copy, modify and</p>
    <p> redistribute the code.</p>
    <p> We have also included Segment CMR (<ext-link xlink:href="https://medviso.com/cmr" ext-link-type="uri">https://medviso.com/cmr</ext-link>) and Cass</p>
    <p> MR Solutions (<ext-link xlink:href="https://www.piemedicalimaging.com/product/mr-solutions" ext-link-type="uri">https://www.piemedicalimaging.com/product/mr-solutions</ext-link>)</p>
    <p> in our software comparison.</p>
    <p> The sentence below has been added to the Discussion section:</p>
    <p> In this direction, CMRSegTools source code has been released under</p>
    <p> CeCILL licence (French free software license compatible with GPL) that</p>
    <p> grants users the right to copy, modify, and distribute new versions of</p>
    <p> the plug-in.</p>
    <p>3. Validation of the software is mostly anecdotic as single cases as</p>
    <p>presented without quantitative assessment. Is strongly advisable to</p>
    <p>perform a comparison with a validated software or manual analysis by</p>
    <p>an expert user on a reference data set including a reasonable number</p>
    <p>of cases, as MICCAI challenges or similar.</p>
    <p> We thank the reviewer for this observation. The software has already</p>
    <p> been tested before this open-source release. All implemented methods</p>
    <p> have been evaluated in the publications cited in appendix S1.</p>
    <p> The following paragraph has been added to the CMRSegTools plug-in</p>
    <p> section:</p>
    <p> BEAS was originally developed for automatic segmentation of 3D</p>
    <p> cine-loop echocardiographic images to provide an efficient, fast and</p>
    <p> accurate solution for quantification of the main left ventricular</p>
    <p> volumetric indices used in clinical routine. In addition, the method</p>
    <p> was adapted for 3D+time CMR data sets (acquired by a cine steady state</p>
    <p> free precession sequence, SSFP) and benchmarked against the data sets</p>
    <p> available from the MICCAI 2009 Cardiac MR Left Ventricle Segmentation</p>
    <p> Challenge [33]. The benchmark demonstrated the technique to be robust,</p>
    <p> efficient and fast in terms of accuracy and computational load, which</p>
    <p> makes the BEAS algorithm suitable for a clinical practice [32].</p>
    <p> And in the Discussion section:</p>
    <p> To validate the correspondence between the mathematical model (S1</p>
    <p> appendix) and the code implementation, the correctness of the</p>
    <p> computational methods has been verified with synthetic data.</p>
    <p> An extended assessment or benchmarking of infarct segmentation methods</p>
    <p> is beyond the scope of this paper. The goal is to provide a</p>
    <p> computer-based tool which includes well-known lesion segmentation</p>
    <p> methods (S1 appendix) in order to empower research scientists to</p>
    <p> reproduce results and assess comparatively new methods. In this</p>
    <p> direction, CMRSegTools source code has been released under CeCILL</p>
    <p> licence (French free software license compatible with GPL) that grants</p>
    <p> users the right to copy, modify, and distribute new versions of the</p>
    <p> plug-in.</p>
    <p>4. Table 1 compares general-use software (that of course does not</p>
    <p>match R1/R2 requirements) with CMR specific ones that of course match</p>
    <p>both as required by SCMR guidelines. Research/Commercial Segment</p>
    <p>software should be inserted in the table together with other</p>
    <p>commercial software as Pie CAAS</p>
    <p>(<ext-link xlink:href="https://www.piemedicalimaging.com/product/mr-solutions/tissue-characterisation" ext-link-type="uri">https://www.piemedicalimaging.com/product/mr-solutions/tissue-characterisation</ext-link>). </p>
    <p>The compatibility with different OS should be indicated, as one limitation</p>
    <p>of the proposed software is the requirement of MacOS system.</p>
    <p> We thank the reviewer for this recommendation. We have included</p>
    <p> Segment CMR and CAAS MR Solutions to the software comparison. In</p>
    <p> addition, we have included a column “Target Platform” in Table 1. We</p>
    <p> have added comments on the limitation to deploy CMRSegTools on a</p>
    <p> different operative system.</p>
    <p> The Table 1 has been completed.</p>
    <p> And a paragraph added to the Discussion section:</p>
    <p> CMRSegTools is therefore a contribution to enable reproducible</p>
    <p> research by assembling the most used methods for infarct segmentation</p>
    <p> in a suitable workflow executed in a single and widely available</p>
    <p> environment: Osirix/Horos DICOM viewers. This platform was chosen</p>
    <p> because it provides an Application Programming Interface (API) that</p>
    <p> grants access to the data management, user interaction and</p>
    <p> visualisation functionalities. It was also chosen because it has an</p>
    <p> open-source licence. However, OsiriX/Horos is a macOS-only software,</p>
    <p> which limits its deployment on platforms based on a different</p>
    <p> operative system.</p>
    <p>Reviewer #2</p>
    <p>This study presents a open-source software for myocardial infarction</p>
    <p>segmentation in CMR images. There are some concerns:</p>
    <p>1. It is better to brief introduce the licenses shown in Table 1 for</p>
    <p>clarifying the difference in different software.</p>
    <p> We thank the reviewer for this recommendation. We have added a brief</p>
    <p> overview of licences in the Introduction:</p>
    <p> In general, commercial software is a product designed to be marketed</p>
    <p> under a utilisation licence. The user must pay for a binary version</p>
    <p> which must be used as described by the licence. There is no access to</p>
    <p> the source code of the commercial product (closed-source). Freeware</p>
    <p> software, is free of charge but closed-source. In open-source</p>
    <p> software, the user has access to the source code and the different</p>
    <p> licences (i.e. BSD, GNU GPL, etc.) provide the rights to copy, modify,</p>
    <p> redistribute the code, as well as build and release binary versions</p>
    <p> with commercial purposes. [11]. Open-source software promotes open</p>
    <p> collaboration and research communities have been attracted to this</p>
    <p> innovation methodology [12].</p>
    <p> The following sentence has been added to the Discussion section:</p>
    <p> In this direction, CMRSegTools source code has been released under the</p>
    <p> CeCILL licence (French free software license compatible with GPL) that</p>
    <p> grants users the right to copy, modify, and distribute new versions of</p>
    <p> the plug-in.</p>
    <p>2. Is there any comparison of BEAS with other myocardial contour</p>
    <p>segmentation ? If not, please explain the reason.</p>
    <p> We thank the reviewer for this important remark.</p>
    <p> In CMRSegTools plug-in section, the paragraph below has been added:</p>
    <p> BEAS was originally developed for automatic segmentation of 3D</p>
    <p> cine-loop echocardiographic images to provide an efficient, fast and</p>
    <p> accurate solution for quantification of the main left ventricular</p>
    <p> volumetric indices used in clinical routine. In addition, the method</p>
    <p> was adapted for 3D+time CMR data sets (acquired by a cine steady state</p>
    <p> free precession sequence, SSFP) and benchmarked against the data sets</p>
    <p> available from the MICCAI 2009 Cardiac MR Left Ventricle Segmentation</p>
    <p> Challenge [33]. The benchmark demonstrated the technique to be robust,</p>
    <p> efficient and fast in terms of accuracy and computational load, which</p>
    <p> makes the BEAS algorithm suitable for a clinical practice [32].</p>
    <p>3. It is better to cite more studies in cardiac and myocardial</p>
    <p>infarction segmentation. 1) Direct delineation of myocardial</p>
    <p>infarction without contrast agents using a joint motion feature</p>
    <p>learning architecture, Medical Image Analysis; 2) Multi-level semantic</p>
    <p>adaptation for few-shot segmentation on cardiac image sequences,</p>
    <p>Medical Image Analysis.</p>
    <p> We thank the reviewer for the observation and references. We have</p>
    <p> included Xu C., et al. 2018 and Guo S. et al., 2021 in our</p>
    <p> bibliographical revision and discussion.</p>
    <p> In the Discussion section we added,</p>
    <p> At present, there are no automated algorithms that can reliably</p>
    <p> distinguish the bright LV cavity from the bright endocardial border of</p>
    <p> the infarct. This challenge is being addressed by new segmentation</p>
    <p> methods (including non-LGE images) based on ML [5,20, 47, 48].</p>
    <p> In the References, we added</p>
    <p> 47. Xu C, Xu L, Gao Z, Zhao S, Zhang H, Zhang Y, et al. Direct</p>
    <p> delineation of myocardial infarction without contrast agents using a</p>
    <p> joint motion feature learning architecture. Medical image</p>

    <p>4. Please briefly discuss the limitation of this software</p>
    <p> In the Discussion section, the following comment has been added:</p>
    <p> CMRSegTools is therefore a contribution to enable reproducible</p>
    <p> research by assembling the most used methods for infarct segmentation</p>
    <p> in a suitable workflow executed in a single and widely available</p>
    <p> environment: Osirix/Horos DICOM viewers. This platform was chosen</p>
    <p> because it provides an Application Programming Interface (API) that</p>
    <p> grants access to the data management, user interaction and</p>
    <p> visualisation functionalities. It was also chosen because it has an</p>
    <p> open-source licence. However, OsiriX/Horos is a macOS-only software,</p>
    <p> which limits its deployment on platforms based on a different</p>
    <p> operative system.</p>
    <p>5. A lot of grammatical errors.</p>
    <p> We have thoroughly reviewed and improved the grammar of the article.</p>
    <p>6. Please present a figure to show the modules and their connections</p>
    <p>in this software.</p>
    <p> We thank the reviewer for this recommendation. We added the diagram</p>
    <p> below presenting the main components and package dependencies in the</p>
    <p> CMRSegTools plug-in section:</p>
    <p> Figure 1 shows the main components of the plug-in and its integration</p>
    <p> within the OsiriX/Horos environment.</p>
