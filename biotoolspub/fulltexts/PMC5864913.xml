    <abstract id="Abs1">
      <p id="Par1">In eukaryotes, different combinations of exons lead to multiple transcripts with various functions in protein level, in a process called alternative splicing (AS). Unfolding the complexity of functional genomics through genome-wide profiling of AS and determining the altered ultimate products provide new insights for better understanding of many biological processes, disease progress as well as drug development programs to target harmful splicing variants. The current available tools of alternative splicing work with raw data and include heavy computation. In particular, there is a shortcoming in tools to discover AS events directly from transcripts. Here, we developed a Windows-based user-friendly tool for identifying AS events from transcripts without the need to any advanced computer skill or database download. Meanwhile, due to online working mode, our application employs the updated SpliceGraphs without the need to any resource updating. First, SpliceGraph forms based on the frequency of active splice sites in pre-mRNA. Then, the presented approach compares query transcript exons to SpliceGraph exons. The tool provides the possibility of statistical analysis of AS events as well as AS visualization compared to SpliceGraph. The developed application works for transcript sets in human and model organisms.</p>

    <title>Introduction</title>
    <p id="Par2">Transcripts are products of pre-mRNA splicing processes. Novel transcripts discover each day<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup> and add to public databases. Development of high throughput transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) has provided a new opportunity to thoroughly investigate the expression differences between genes as well as within the transcripts of a gene<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Compared to microarrays, RNA-seq technology allows higher accuracy in discovery of splice junctions and sequences<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. AS event and its types are important in composition of protein domains, drug designing and drug resistance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>.</p>
    <p id="Par3">In the splicing process, introns are removed from pre-mRNA, and exons fit together with various arrangements. Consequently, each gene develops distinct transcripts to produce distinct proteins. Depending on the AS pattern, properties of cell construction, functions or destination may be affected. It has been revealed that many diseases are associated with the change of particular AS pattern in transcripts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>, such as spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup> and Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>.</p>
    <p id="Par4">Various types of AS events are known and are divided into 5 groups (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The first one is exon skipping (ES) where an exon is removed together with its introns on both sides of the transcript. The second and third types of alternative splicing are related to both the 3′ and 5′ ends of exons(A5′ss &amp; A3′ss). These types of AS events occur when there are more than one splice site at one end of an exon. If an exon has both of these splicing sites, the alternative 5 and 3 splicing sites will be formed (A5′ &amp; 3′ss). The fourth type is introns retaining (RI) where introns remain in transcript. This is the rarest known type in both vertebrates and invertebrates (less than 5 percent of AS events). There is another type of splicing type related to the latter type which includes a partial retention of an intron. We call it sub_RI type. The last group of AS events takes place when first or last exon or both of them are alternates of first or last putative exons and make alternate promoters and alternate terminators splicing types<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Different types of Alternative splicing (AS) events. (<bold>a</bold>) Exon skipping splice type happens when an exon is removed with its intron-flanking sides. (<bold>b</bold> and <bold>c</bold>) Alternative 5′ splice site and alternative 3′ splice site selections are the splicing types of exons with more than one splice site at one end of an exon. If both ends of an exon are alternate splice sites, the alternate 5′ and 3′ splice site selection occurs. (<bold>d</bold> and <bold>e</bold>) Alternative promoters and alternative terminators are in transcripts with more than one initiator or terminator exon. (<bold>f</bold>) Retained intron splicing type occurs when an intron remains in final transcript. (<bold>g</bold>) Sub-RI splicing is partial intron retention.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="41598_2018_23245_Fig1_HTML" id="d29e351"/></fig></p>
    <p id="Par5">Transcripts are the important output of many high throughput transcriptome analysis tools which are widely used in RNA-seq data analysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. However, many of the AS finding tools do not have the sufficiency of finding AS events straightly from specified transcripts.</p>
    <p id="Par6">There is an increased attention to develop tools to extract and analyze AS events. A majority of these tools implement AS analysis using transcripts reconstruction. In some tools, performing alignment with a reference genome for model organisms is the basis of analysis. For instance, SpliceSeq works based on known splice junctions and detects AS events using inclusion of exons and splice junctions in transcripts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Another tool, Cufflinks/Cuffdiff gets a prerequisite data in GTF format as reference for comparison<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup> and works based on alignment approach. The second category of AS discovery tools reconstructs transcripts without any reference. Trinity methodology for <italic>de novo</italic> full-length transcriptome reconstruction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup> and ASGS which knows alternative splicing junction though the approach of SpliceGraph forming<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup> are within this category. A more complete list has been offered in supplementary materials (Supplemental files, S1). In addition, most of these applications and web tools need a high level of computer skills and also a prerequisite data for their data processing tasks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. To work with current tools, it is a necessity for the researchers to be familiar with data formats and software environments.</p>
    <p id="Par7">There is a need for new tools with the capability of directly AS occurrence analysis in a set of transcripts. In order to fill the mentioned gap, our application was designed to discover AS events from known transcripts at a high speed and in a simple and user friendly environment. The developed application in this study solves the above mentioned problems and has considerable advantages. The software does not need any computer skill. Furthermore, the need to data updating was eliminated by using the updated information placed in the Ensembl database to form SpliceGraphs. The basic pathway of the application includes, taking transcript IDs as input, building a SpliceGraph based on all of the exon coordinates of the related gene, and producing AS events as output.</p>

      <title>Application Architecture and Data Acquisition</title>
      <p id="Par8">The application has been coded in Microsoft Visual Studio utilizing C#. NET and comprises two main parts: the SpliceGraph builder and AS events finding. Due to the open source software and the relational database system of the Ensembl database<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>, we used Ensembl database to obtain the required data for building SpliceGraph and extracting AS events of known transcripts. The protein-coding type of transcripts was applied as the resource transcripts for software. These basic processes are depicted in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Fellow chart of the employed strategy in this study for extracting the Alternative Splicing events of transcript IDs through building a SpliceGraph. In the first phase, query transcript exons and all known exons of protein-coding transcripts of the related gene is downloaded using XML web service format of Ensembl. In the next phase, exons which do not follow the SpliceGraph construction rules is eliminated and consequently, SpliceGraph is built by remained exons coordinates, and in the last phase, query transcript exons are compared with SpliceGraph exons to extract alternative splicing types.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="41598_2018_23245_Fig2_HTML" id="d29e418"/></fig></p>

        <title>SpliceGraph building</title>
        <p id="Par9">Building SpliceGraphs is the basic part of many splicing detector tools<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. To ease the difficulty of case by case analyzing of each splice variant and also to investigate the relationship between different transcripts, the approach of graph representation of splicing variants was employed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. Graphs include putative exons to use for comparing and extracting AS. Various tools use different methods to build SpliceGraphs. SpliceGrapher<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup> as a Python-based scripting tool constructs the SpliceGraph by summarizing short reads aligned to a reference genome. SplAdder<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup> integrates annotation information and RNA-Seq data to generate an augmented splicing graph, and SpliceSeq<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup> summarizes known transcript variations and knowledge about gene structure into a directed acyclic graph. Requiring a prerequisite data as a reference data is a noticeable clue in all of these mentioned tools. However, our approach has been established on the frequency of active splice sites in pre-mRNA which is provided by the SpliceDetector application directly from Ensembl database due to online mode of software. In the first step, exons with the highest frequency of their splice sites were selected as putative exons. Then, the lengths of exons were considered as the selection factor and longer exons were selected as putative exons when we had an equal frequency of splice sites. In the third step, we selected multiple exons as putative exons when an exon was equivalent to several smaller exons. Figure <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> shows the rules applied in this project for building SpliceGraphs.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Classification of exons into putative and alternative types. In the first phase, exons A, C, G, and E are selected as a putative exons based on the highest frequency of their splice sites. In the second phase, we focused on exon length. This means that we selected putative exons by their nucleotide numbers when we had an equal frequency of splice sites. Thus, exon B was selected as putative exon. In the next phase, if an exon was equivalent to several smaller exons, we selected multiple exons as putative exons. Therefore, exons H and I were selected as putative exons.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="41598_2018_23245_Fig3_HTML" id="d29e465"/></fig></p>

In order to study the effect of treatment on AS events alteration before and after the treatment, we added a statistical analysis of AS events of transcripts to our software. We considered unique mapped transcript reads as effective read count for AS events to avoid read mapping errors and prevent false positive outcomes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. In a comparison between an experimental group and a control group, the number of AS events of each transcript before treatment can be calculated by AS events number of that transcript multiply by its unique reads count in control sample (before treatment);</p>

The Chi-square goodness-of-fit test is used for nominal variables and calculates the probability of getting a result like observed data under the null hypothesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. Therefore, we applied the Chi-Square goodness of fit test to compare AS events abundance before and after the treatment. Treatments may alter the amount of AS events in each transcript and differentially expressed transcripts usually exhibits a significant alteration in the number of AS events before and after the treatment due to their significant different expression. The presented comparison approach examines the overall changes in the amounts of AS events.

Then a Chi-square goodness of fit test evaluates the significance of the difference in total number of ES events on the whole experiment level before and after the treatment.

The application works in two forms of single and multiple forms (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>) and accepts the query transcript IDs in Microsoft office excel, GTF, and GFF3 formats. A graph which represents the query transcript exons as well as the constructed SpliceGraph, illustrates the alternative splicing regions and offers an understanding of splice sites and alternative splicing events.The online working mode of the application results in low application size. Furthermore, due to the downloaded references from Ensembl site, SpliceGraph are updated in each use.

NET Framework 4.5 (or higher) and the only given data is transcript IDs of interest. In addition, this tool works online (connected to the Internet), so, SpliceGraph building process relies on updated data of Ensembl database and there is no need for the users to get involved. This application is not specific to a particular organism and works with all model organisms on Ensembl database.</p>
      <p id="Par39">In order to examine the results of SpliceDetector application, we downloaded the result obtained from an experiment made by Obstetrics and Gynecology department of University of Alabama at Birmingham in 2014 where ovarian cancerous tissue was treated with the herbal drug paclitaxel (PTX) derived from a plant called <italic>Taxusbrevifolia</italic> (Pacific yew)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>.

In order to get differential expression details, the proportions-based (Baggerley’s) test was applied on results. We filtered result data based on p-value less than 0.01 and a fold change more than 2.5 in treated samples against controls (Supplemental files, S5). Two of the differentially expressed genes which we found were <italic>TMEM123</italic> (Transmembrane Protein 123) and <italic>DHRS4L2</italic> (Dehydrogenase/Reductase 4 Like 2). The ENST00000361236 transcript of the <italic>TMEM123</italic> gene has been downregulated and the ENST00000335125 transcript of the <italic>DHRS4L2</italic> gene has been upregulated due to the treatment. These alterations are originated from changes in AS events patterns occurring in transcripts formation. Therefore, we can extract each transcript splicing type and compare them.

    <title>Discussion</title>
    <p id="Par45">Alternative splicing of pre-mRNA, as the main cause of the functional diversity in proteins, could also lead to some genetic diseases. Furthermore, AS pattern alteration in samples under treatment has been detected. For instance, exon skipping events are observed after 6TG (6-Thioguanine) treatment throughout the dystrophin transcript<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. Especially, investigating these alterations in genes with a differential expression which usually appear as transcripts alternation can help to determine the treatments effect on the activity of cells. Sudemycin E which causes a rapid alteration in AS events and consequently changes the overall gene expression and arrests the G2 phase of the cell cycle<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup> is an example of this influence. Regarding the impact of AS events in disease occurrence, efforts to clarify AS events consequences in cellular activity are helpful.</p>
    <p id="Par46">Due to the lack of tools that accept transcript IDs as input for the SpliceGraph building, we decided to compare the criteria for the SpliceGraph formation in some tools regardless of the type and format of the input data. The major part of alternative splicing visualization tools is performing alignment with the reference genome as initial step and then determining the putative exons, based on the criteria of exons expression level, the splice junctions support, genomic coordinate similarity, etc. Regarding the mentioned items, we selected the following tools which are structurally compatible with our application. SpliceGrapher that constructs the SpliceGraph relying on existing gene model annotations. It takes RNA-Seq data as input, and visualizes SpliceGraphs, splice junctions, and read depth. It identifies the splice junction sequence features by spliced-alignment filtering. Vials<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup> is a useful tool that enables researchers to identify abundance of reads associated with exons, recognize splice junctions, and predict isoforms frequency patterns in experimental groups. The tool illustrates the transcripts splicing by the weighted, directed, acyclic graphs modeled using exons genomic coordinates and the splice junctions support (weights). The third selected tool for comparison is SpliceSeq, that is the most similar SpliceGraph design method to our applied method in SpliceDetector application. This software, by summarizing known transcripts in the Ensembl database, constructs a SpliceGraph and then stores them. In the next step, the RNA-seq sample reads are aligned with the pre-deposited reference genome, and genes splice events are extracted using the constructed SpliceGraphs. Our software utilizes transcripts overlapping, a similar method to the SpliceSeq software, and calculates the frequency of splice junctions. However, similar to the three mentioned tools, our application builds SpliceGraphs. In addition to the splice sites support, we used features such as the length of exons and prioritized multiple exons over a continuous exon (including all mentioned multiple exons) with the identical start and end coordinates to improve the SpliceGraph structure, get a better definition of differences between transcripts variants, and recognize all possible exons. Use of this software is as simple as Vials tool which works with the gene names, but we have provided the possibility to enter a set of transcripts in a using process, and we believe it as an advantage for our software. Also, our tool represents a clear view of the alternative splicing events of the query transcript regarding the SpliceGraph and determines the exonic and genomic regions of the events.</p>
    <p id="Par47">We presented the possibility of the investigation of AS patterns in both single and multiple forms: single form for specific transcript investigations and multiple form for cases of having a set of transcripts. Also, an image that represents the query transcript as well as the SpliceGraph constructed from known transcripts of the corresponded gene, gives a clear view of the alternative splicing region and illustrates how the AS events are happened. In addition, in the cases that the Unique transcript reads count of transcripts are input along with transcript IDs, the application provides the possibility to perform a Chi-square Goodness of Fit statistical test to determine significance of alteration rates between Experimental Group and Control Group. The possibility of result exporting in text and Microsoft excel format is considered for results. Methods of application are shown in the practical guide. Data for testing is supplied in the supplemental files (S6–9).</p>

    <title>Conclusion</title>
    <p id="Par48">We developed a practical SpliceGraph-based application for detecting alternative splicing events from transcripts in all model organisms. We eliminated the complicated steps for downloading reference data and using strict command lines arguments in our software to ease extracting AS events straight from transcripts rather than RNA-seq data. Using this software, researchers are able to investigate AS events as the significant factor of alteration in proteins functions through the updated SpliceGraph in each use. The SpliceDetector software is compatible with Windows and needs .NET Framework 4.5.
