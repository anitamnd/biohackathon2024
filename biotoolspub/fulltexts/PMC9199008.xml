    <title>Introduction</title>
    <p>CAS,
a division of the American Chemical Society, has collected,
curated, and analyzed the world’s published science as part
of its vision to improve people’s lives through the transforming
power of chemistry since 1907.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref></sup> Scientists, manufacturers,
regulators, and data scientists around the world rely on CAS for accurate
information on chemical substances. CAS Common Chemistry, an open
resource based on a subset of chemical substance content from CAS
REGISTRY, was first launched in 2009 by CAS to strengthen the accuracy
of publicly available scientific information.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref></sup></p>
    <p>CAS Common Chemistry was established to provide a reliable
source
of chemical identifiers and associated information to the general
public as part of the mission of the ACS. It enables millions of visitors
to obtain reliable scientific information on nearly 500,000 substances
through search or application programming interface (API) functionality.
Users leverage this information in a variety of ways, including in
teaching and learning, to promote safe practices, and to support research.
Additionally, Wikipedia has leveraged the resource since its inception
in 2009 to provide accurate CAS Registry Numbers for the most ubiquitous
chemical substances.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref></sup> For each included
substance, a substance detail page provides key attributes as well
as a citation to support referencing in academic studies. For examples
of search results, see substance detail pages for caffeine, aspirin,
and benzene, as well as <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref></xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>.</p>

    <title>Updates to the CAS Common Chemistry Dataset</title>
    <p>The 2021 release has several key enhancements to strengthen the
CAS Common Chemistry dataset, including an expanded number of substances,
enhanced associated chemical information, validated CAS Registry Numbers,
and additional chemical representations.</p>
    <sec id="sec2.1">
      <title>Expanded Dataset Sourced
from CAS REGISTRY</title>
      <p>CAS Common
Chemistry contains substances and related data from CAS REGISTRY,
the largest scientist-curated chemical substance database in the world,
crossing 250 million chemical substances in April 2021 and growing
daily.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref></sup> In response to requests from the scientific
community, the number of substances openly released in CAS Common
Chemistry was recently expanded to nearly 500,000 substances. This
is a dramatic increase from the 8000 substances initially available.
The collection represents substances and related data for chemicals
of concern, consumer product ingredients, commonly regulated chemicals,
and chemicals frequently used in undergraduate chemistry curricula.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec2.2">
      <title>Enhanced Associated Chemical Information</title>
      <p>Each substance
in the resource includes its chemical name, chemical structure image,
molecular formula, and molecular weight. The resource is further enhanced
by chemical synonyms, which may include systematic chemical names,
common names, and trade names for each chemical substance. Basic substance
properties—boiling point, melting point, and density—are
also included where available. This is demonstrated in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref></xref>a,b.</p>
      <fig id="fig3" position="float">
        <label>Figure 3</label>
        <caption>

detail page for cholesterol, with elements
as follows: (a) Basic information for the substance that includes
chemical name, CAS RN, molecular formula, molecular mass, and structure
image. (b) Basic property information that includes boiling point,
melting point and density, where available. (c) Other names and identifiers,
including InChI, InChIKey, SMILES, canonical SMILES, and synonyms.
(d) Deleted or replaced CAS RNs that include any CAS RNs that referred
to this substance in the past, but are no longer active. (e) Link
to CAS SciFinder<sup>n</sup> that directly links the user to find
more information about the substance. (f) Pre-formatted citation that
can be copied and pasted directly to cite this webpage. (g) Download
button that downloads the molfile format for this chemical structure.</p>

        <graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="ci2c00268_0004" id="gr3" position="float"/>
      </fig>
      <p>For users of CAS SciFinder<sup>n</sup>, a quick
link is also included
to launch the product and quickly discover more information about
the substance, including additional properties, spectral data, literature
references, regulatory details, commercial suppliers, and chemical
reactions in which it is a participant (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref></xref>e).</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec2.3">
      <title>Validated CAS Registry Numbers</title>
      <p>Each
substance is identified
by its CAS Registry Number or CAS RN (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref></xref>a). This unique identifier, which is assigned
by CAS as part of the curation of CAS REGISTRY, is the most common
way to identify chemical substances on consumer products, regulatory
lists, chemical catalogs, and more. It offers scientists and non-scientists
alike a way to disambiguate the complexity of chemical identity quickly
and easily. CAS RNs are included in many freely accessible chemistry
websites that aggregate data from various sources; however, these
CAS RNs are typically not obtained directly from CAS and as such are
not validated and can have significant data quality issues.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>−<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref></sup> Because CAS is the authoritative source of CAS RNs, the CAS RNs
included in CAS Common Chemistry are validated, accurate, and trustworthy.</p>
      <p>Occasionally, two CAS-registered substances can be determined to
be chemically equivalent – for example, if one of the substances
was initially known only by a trade name without a full chemical structure.
Any additional CAS RNs to identical substances are also included in
CAS Common Chemistry to aid users in resolving these identifiers to
their accurate, current counterparts (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref></xref>d).</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec2.4">
      <title>Additional Chemical Structure Representations</title>
      <p>Chemical
structure representations enhance the ability to cross-reference substances
between resources. The original CAS Common Chemistry resource did
not include any computer-readable representations of the chemical
structure—only structure images. CAS Common Chemistry now includes
several structural representations, including the International Union
of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) International Chemical Identifier,
or InChI, a nonproprietary string representation of the chemical structure,
as well as the associated InChIKey, a fixed-length hash string that
is intended to enhance the text-based searchability of the InChI chemical
structure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref></sup> Simplified Molecular-Input Line-Entry
System or SMILES strings, another string representation of the structure,
are also included.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref></sup> Molfile format is
available for download.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref></sup> See <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref></xref>c,g for examples.</p>
    </sec>
  </sec>
  <sec id="sec2.5">
    <title>Updates to Application and Integration Features</title>
    <p>Additional
steps were taken in the 2021 update to ensure that the
data can be effectively utilized in common use cases. Several new
considerations ensure that CAS Common Chemistry is more broadly applicable
to the community, including enhanced searchability, API integration,
and reusable licensing.</p>
    <sec id="sec2.6">
      <title>Enhanced Searchability</title>
      <p>This content
is searchable by
chemical name, InChI, InChIKey, SMILES, and CAS RN. InChI, InChIKey,
and SMILES are new features of the site that provide significantly
improved search capability. Exact searches are supported. Limited
wildcard searching is also supported, using “*” at the
end of a search string. To search by InChI and InChIKey, the query
must begin with a formatting string, “InChI=” or “InChIKey=.”</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec2.7">
      <title>API Integration</title>
      <p>Newly added API capabilities support
digital workflows and cheminformatics initiatives by allowing programmatic
access to the data. The API allows access via three endpoints:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>“Search” accepts CAS
RN, SMILES, InChI,
InChIKey, or chemical name as input. It returns a list of matching
substances, including each substance’s chemical name, CAS RN,
and structure image.</p></list-item><list-item><p>“Detail”
allows the retrieval of all available
information for a known chemical substance. It accepts CAS RN or substance
Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) as input and returns all CAS Common
Chemistry record information, including identifiers, synonyms, structures,
deleted or replaced CAS RNs, and experimental property data.</p></list-item><list-item><p>“Export” takes CAS substance
URI (found
in the detail response) as input. It returns the molfile for the substance
in question.</p></list-item></list></p>

    <title>Role of Community Collaboration</title>
    <p>Since its launch in
2009, CAS Common Chemistry has evolved into
a valuable source of reliable chemical information accessed by millions.
The collaboration of stakeholders in the chemistry community has provided
the input necessary to create and enhance this resource.</p>
    <p>The
first collaboration occurred in December 2007, when one of
the authors (AJW) initiated a project to curate chemical structures
on Wikipedia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref></sup> In consultation with Wikipedia
user “Walkerma” (author MW on this paper), this author
engaged with a team of other chemists on the platform to collaboratively
curate the data. Part of the activity included an effort to clean
up CAS RNs on Wikipedia pages that were not associated with the substance
they represent in CAS REGISTRY.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref></sup> CAS was
enlisted to support this project and agreed to formally collaborate
in the effort in 2008. This collaboration ultimately resulted in the
development and launch of CAS Common Chemistry in May 2009.</p>
    <p>As the popularity of chemical information on the internet grew
dramatically in the 2010s, community members noted that an additional
collaboration with CAS was increasingly needed to further enhance
the accuracy and usability of open chemical information.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref></sup> In 2019, interested parties in the chemistry
community proposed to CAS to expand and enhance CAS Common Chemistry.
This proposal propelled CAS to move forward with the group’s
idea. Throughout 2020, the group met regularly to develop requirements,
select substances, prototype, and test the new CAS Common Chemistry,
which was ultimately launched in March 2021 (see <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref></xref>).</p>

    <title>Impact on Other Data Sources</title>
    <p>One of the most significant challenges in cheminformatics is the
accurate identification and matching of chemical substances. Many
structure representations are available, and each has its limitations.
Furthermore, converting between these structure formats is an imperfect
science and often results in additional inaccuracies because of the
limitations of source structure formats or conversion algorithms.
Some chemical structure representations offer the ability to encode
identical structures in different ways, further amplifying complexity.
Identifiers that do not encode structural characteristics as part
of their format, such as the CAS RN, provide an alternative that eliminates
the complexity of matching chemical structures. While this can be
advantageous, it also creates challenges in ensuring that CAS RNs
from nonauthority sources are accurate to the underlying substances
that they represent.</p>
    <p>To overcome limitations in chemical data
exchange, many resources
have developed their own curation policies for the validation and
acceptance of chemical information. These curation policies typically
leverage an internal standard for chemical structure representation
and then implement a consistent approach for the acceptance of information
that may be attempting to represent the same chemical entity. For
example, the CompTox Chemicals dashboard developed by the Center for
Computational Toxicology at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
(EPA) has developed a process that combines automated matching approaches
with manual curation to resolve chemical complexity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref></sup> The resource further scores each one of its entries based on data
reliability to communicate the potential for inaccuracy in its information.</p>
    <p>The PubChem resource was able to extensively leverage the CAS Common
Chemistry contents to identify, validate, correct, and highlight CAS
RN identifiers within the limitations and constraints of structure
representation noted above.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref></sup> This included
adding CAS Common Chemistry as a data source (<uri xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/source/24603">https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/source/24603</uri>) with an appropriately permissive data license and the creation
of a cross-link to the CAS Common Chemistry website for CAS RN identifiers
available therein. As a trusted, authoritative source within PubChem,
the CAS Common Chemistry data source helps to indicate validated CAS
RN. Structural representations from CAS Common Chemistry, notwithstanding
the issues of data exchange, are further utilized by PubChem to help
automated data checking and consistency approaches, helping to enable
appropriate structural representations for a given CAS RN.</p>
    <p>The
latest release of CAS Common Chemistry has also supported updates
and corrections to CAS RNs in Wikidata and Wikipedia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref></sup> InChIKeys were calculated from CAS SMILES using Bacting
0.0.31<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref></sup> with the Chemistry Development
Kit 2.7.1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref></sup> and were matched with content
in Wikidata. The CAS RNs were then compared. References to CAS Common
Chemistry were added for CAS RNs that matched. Mismatches have been
shared with the Wikidata and Wikipedia communities so that they can
manually review and correct the misleading entries using CAS Common
Chemistry as a reference. Because Wikidata also curates identifiers
from other data sources, validated CAS RNs in Wikidata may also be
used to cross-reference with other resources. Scripts are provided
in the <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.jcim.2c00268/suppl_file/ci2c00268_si_002.zip">Supporting Information</ext-link>.</p>
    <p>A
long-standing challenge in such curation approaches has been
accurate matching to CAS RNs, which do not directly encode chemical
information. With its inclusion of several chemical structure representations
for each CAS RN, offered under reusable license terms, the 2021 release
of CAS Common Chemistry enables and supports the accuracy of open
sources of scientific information, including Wikipedia, Wikidata,
PubChem, and the CompTox Chemicals dashboard. Considering that the
CAS Common Chemistry data set of about 500,000 substances that are
among the most important and common chemicals to chemists, it is a
sizable, new, and important authoritative data set for the community.</p>
  </sec>
  <sec id="sec5">
    <title>Future
Work</title>
    <p>Several additional features that would enhance CAS Common
Chemistry
have been identified through the development process. These include
a more flexible chemical search—the current search mechanism
for chemical structure representations supports exact searching only—in
addition to the ability to facet or filter search results. Supporting
additional fields in search, such as searching of property values,
would aid in the application of CAS Common Chemistry in teaching and
learning. Additionally, the inclusion of links to regulatory resources
or tags that indicate membership in regulatory lists would enhance
the usability of CAS Common Chemistry for environmental health and
laboratory safety.</p>
    <p>One known challenge in leveraging CAS Common
Chemistry as an interchange
between information sources stems from the proprietary chemical structure
encoding format used to create the underlying authoritative representations
of chemical information. As such, chemical structure representations
provided on the website have the potential to be flawed because of
differences in the features supported by each structure format and
because of the potential for inaccuracies in the conversion process.
Identifying aspects of chemistry that are different between data representations,
finding ways to address these limitations and ensuring that conversion
algorithms make best use of all available features within each representation
format is an area for continued future work both by CAS and by the
chemistry community (such as through the enhancement and standardization
of chemical representation approaches, including IUPAC InChI and IUPAC
SMILES+ efforts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref></sup>). In addition to its internal
work on these initiatives, CAS participates actively in community
efforts to tackle these challenges, including the InChITrust and the
Pistoia Alliance.</p>

  <sec id="sec6">
    <title>Conclusions</title>
    <p>The release of the CAS
Common Chemistry collection of nearly 500,000
chemical substances is a very significant contribution of curated
data to the community and, because of its open data licensing, is
available for reuse by third parties. Access to high-quality data
from CAS REGISTRY fosters learning and promotes safety.</p>
    <p>As the
need for reliable chemical information continues to grow,
CAS Common Chemistry will continue to be a valuable resource to promote
the dissemination of accurate scientific information. Collaboration
with the community will ensure that CAS Common Chemistry continues
to meet the evolving needs of the global community.</p>
