      <p>ChIP-Seq is widely used to characterize genome-wide binding patterns of transcription
factors and other chromatin-associated proteins. Although comparison of ChIP-Seq data
sets is critical for understanding cell type-dependent and cell state-specific
binding, and thus the study of cell-specific gene regulation, few quantitative
approaches have been developed. Here, we present a simple and effective method,
MAnorm, for quantitative comparison of ChIP-Seq data sets describing transcription
factor binding sites and epigenetic modifications. The quantitative binding
differences inferred by MAnorm showed strong correlation with both the changes in
expression of target genes and the binding of cell type-specific regulators.</p>

    <title>Background</title>
    <p>Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by massively parallel DNA sequencing (ChIP-Seq)
has become the preferred method to determine genome-wide binding patterns of
transcription factors and other chromatin-associated proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. With the rapid accumulation of ChIP-Seq data, comparison of
multiple ChIP-Seq data sets is increasingly becoming critical for addressing important
biological questions. For example, comparison of biological replicates is commonly used
to find robust binding sites, and the identification of sites that are differentially
bound by chromatin-associated proteins in different cellular contexts is important for
elucidating underlying mechanisms of cell type-specific regulation. Although ChIP-Seq
data generally exhibit high signal-to-background noise (S/N) ratios compared to
ChIP-on-chip datasets, there are still significant challenges in data analysis due to
variation in sample preparation and errors introduced in sequencing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>].</p>
    <p>Several methods have been proposed for finding ChIP-enriched regions in a ChIP-Seq
sample compared to a suitable negative control (for example, mock or non-specific
immunoprecipitation). These involve fitting a model derived from negative control and/or
sample low read intensity (background) regions, and then applying this model to identify
ChIP-enriched regions (peaks) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. However, few methods have been
proposed for comparison of ChIP-Seq samples. The simplest approach classifies the peaks
from each sample as either common or unique, based on whether or not the peak overlaps
with peaks in other samples [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Although this method can identify general relationships
between peak sets from different samples, the results are highly dependent on the cutoff
used in peak calling, which is difficult to select in a completely objective manner.
Moreover, common peaks may show differential binding between the samples being compared,
while other peaks may be identified as unique to one sample simply because they fall
below an arbitrary cutoff in the other sample. Differences in background levels further
confound analysis. Consequently, quantitative comparison of ChIP-Seq samples, while
important for extracting maximal biological information, is fraught with numerous
challenges.</p>
    <p>An intuitive and widely used approach of quantitative comparison relies on rescaling
data on the basis of the total number of sequence reads. However, this method is
inadequate and may introduce errors when the S/N ratio varies between samples. Recently,
statistical tools have been developed to discover regions that exhibit significant
differences between two ChIP-Seq data sets. For example, <italic>Xu et al.
</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] proposed a hidden Markov
model-based method to detect broad chromatin domains associated with distinct levels of
histone modifications between two cell types. Other peak calling programs identify
differential binding regions between two ChIP-Seq data sets by using one data set as
sample and the other as control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Since these methods also rely on the
total number of reads (or background region reads) to re-scale the data, they fail to
circumvent problems associated with different S/N ratios. In an alternative approach,
Taslim <italic>et al. </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] proposed a nonlinear
method that uses locally weighted regression (LOWESS) for ChIP-Seq data normalization.
The underlying assumption of this method is that the genome-wide distribution of read
densities has equal mean value and variance across samples [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. A potential problem with this approach is that global
symmetry will be introduced after normalization, an assumption that may not be valid
when comparing biological samples with different numbers of binding sites. In addition,
this method normalizes samples based on the absolute difference of read counts instead
of log<sub>2 </sub>ratio commonly used in traditional MA plot methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], and thus the differences deduced by this method
cannot be used directly for quantitative comparison with other observations of
biological significance, such as fold changes in gene expression.</p>
    <p>Here, we describe a simple and effective model, termed MAnorm, to quantitatively compare
ChIP-Seq data sets. To circumvent the issue of differences in S/N ratio between samples,
we focused on ChIP-enriched regions (peaks), and introduced a novel idea, that ChIP-Seq
common peaks could serve as a reference to build the rescaling model for normalization.
This approach is based on the empirical assumption that if a chromatin-associated
protein has a substantial number of peaks shared in two conditions, the binding at these
common regions will tend to be determined by similar mechanisms, and thus should exhibit
similar global binding intensities across samples. This idea is further supported by
motif analysis that we present. MAnorm exhibits good performance when applied to
ChIP-Seq data for both epigenetic modifications and transcription factor binding site
identification. Importantly, quantitative differences inferred by MAnorm are strongly
correlated with differential expression of target genes and the binding of cell
type-specific regulators. Comparisons to prior methods using genome-wide signals for
normalization reveal that MAnorm is free of bias and better reflects authentic
biological changes. Therefore, MAnorm should serve as a powerful tool in probing
mechanisms of gene regulation.</p>

      <p>Data normalization is an important step in sequencing data analysis. However,
normalization of ChIP-Seq data is a difficult task due to the differential S/N ratio
across samples (see Discussion). These differences cannot simply be addressed using
traditional microarray data normalization methods, such as quantile normalization
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] and MA plot followed by LOWESS
regression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Here we borrow the idea of
the MA plot and propose a novel method for quantitative comparison of ChIP-Seq data
sets based on two empirical assumptions. First, we assume the true intensities of
most common peaks are the same between two ChIP-Seq samples. This assumption is valid
when the binding regions represented by the common peaks show a much higher level of
co-localization between samples than that expected at random, and thus binding at the
common peaks should be determined by similar mechanisms and exhibit similar global
binding intensity between samples. Second, the observed differences in sequence read
density in common peaks are presumed to reflect the scaling relationship of ChIP-Seq
signals between two samples, which can thus be applied to all peaks. Based on these
hypotheses, the log<sub>2 </sub>ratio of read density between two samples
(<italic>M</italic>) was plotted against the average log<sub>2 </sub>read density
(<italic>A</italic>) for all peaks, and robust linear regression was applied to fit the
global dependence between the <italic>M-A </italic>values of common peaks. Finally, the
derived linear model was used as a reference for normalization and extrapolated to
all peaks. The normalized <italic>M </italic>value was then used as a quantitative measure of
differential binding in each peak region between two samples, with peak regions
associated with larger absolute <italic>M </italic>values exhibiting greater differences in
binding. The workflow of the method, MAnorm, is shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>. The MAnorm package is available for download in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>.</p>

      <title>Comparison of cell line-dependent epigenetic modifications using MAnorm</title>
      <p>Differential epigenetic modifications are closely associated with many developmental
and disease processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. As such,
quantitative comparison of ChIP-Seq signals across multiple cell types may help
elucidate underlying epigenetic mechanisms of disease and tissue-specific regulation.
We applied MAnorm to analyze the differences between H1 human embryonic stem (ES)
cells and two disease-related cell lines, K562 and HeLaS3, for two histone
modifications positively associated with gene expression, H3K4me3 and H3K27ac. For
each chromatin mark, peaks identified in each cell line showed substantial overlap
with those from the other two cell lines, with the overlap ranging from 16- to
24-fold greater than the overlap observed by random permutations (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2a</xref>; Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> in Additional
file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>). Before normalization, the MA plots exhibited an
overall global dependence of <italic>M </italic>value on <italic>A</italic>, which was closely fitted
by a linear model derived by robust regression (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2b</xref>;
Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>). A similar global dependence was evident in comparisons of biological
replicates (Supplementary Figure 7 in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>;
discussed below), indicating the dependence of <italic>M </italic>on <italic>A </italic>does not
reflect biological changes but is due mainly to systemic bias and noise. After
application of MAnorm to remove this dependence from the set of common peaks, the
distribution of common peaks became highly symmetric with respect to the new <italic>A
</italic>axis. Furthermore, the two sets of unique peaks became more symmetric in all
comparisons (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2c</xref>; Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>). These observations
suggest that the ChIP-Seq signals in all peaks follow a similar scaling relationship
and that the extrapolation of the linear model from common peaks to all peaks is
valid. The significance of differential binding in each peak region was determined
using a <italic>P</italic>-value calculated based on a Bayesian model developed by Audic and
Claverie [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2d</xref>; Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> in Additional file

      </fig>
      <p>Next, we investigated the relationship between the <italic>M </italic>value (= <italic>log<sub>2
</sub></italic>(Read density in cell type 1/Read density in cell type 2)) and the
change in expression of peak targets between cell types. In general, target genes
associated with positive <italic>M </italic>values - that is, peaks with higher H3K4me3 and
H3K27ac read intensity in cell type 1 - were enriched in genes more highly expressed
in cell type 1. Conversely, target genes associated with negative <italic>M </italic>values
were enriched in genes more highly expressed in cell type 2 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>; Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>). These findings are consistent with the activating role of
these two histone modifications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].
Notably, the enrichment score of genes more highly expressed in cell type 1 showed
strong positive correlation with the <italic>M </italic>values, while the enrichment score of
genes more highly expressed in cell type 2 correlated negatively with <italic>M</italic>,
suggesting that the <italic>M </italic>statistics determined by MAnorm serve as an indicator
of cell type-specificity for the epigenetic marks in peak regions (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>; Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> in Additional file
<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>). Furthermore, the target genes associated with an
absolute <italic>M </italic>value &gt; 1 were significantly enriched in genes highly expressed
in the corresponding cell type among all our comparisons, implying that the absolute
<italic>M </italic>value of 1 is a suitable cutoff for defining cell type-specifically
marked genes. It should be noted that many common target genes were associated with
<italic>M </italic>values far from 0, and were still highly enriched for cell
type-specifically expressed genes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3a</xref>; Supplementary
Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3a</xref> in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>),
indicating that the differential epigenetic marks at these genes are also functional.
On the other hand, those unique target genes with <italic>M </italic>values near zero
displayed much weaker enrichment of cell type-specifically expressed genes (Figure
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3b, c</xref>; Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3b, c</xref> in
Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>), indicating that they are not uniquely
marked in one cell type. MAnorm also exhibited good performance when applied to
ChIP-seq datasets composed of broad, diffuse peaks, such as histone modifications
like H3K36me3 (Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> in Additional file
<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref> and Supplementary Text in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>). In conclusion, MAnorm quantitatively describes authentic
binding differences of chromatin-associated proteins, and thus represents an
improvement over arbitrary definitions of common and unique targets based on peak
overlap between samples.</p>

      <title>Identification of cell type-specific regulators directly associated with
differential binding</title>
      <p>A conventional strategy to identify cell type-specific regulators associated with
changes in epigenetic marks relies on the identification of transcription factor
binding sites that are highly enriched in unique peak regions. This method often
yields multiple candidates, and thus complicates the identification of key regulators
associated with the differences in epigenetic marks in each cell type. One advantage
of the continuous <italic>M </italic>value determined by MAnorm is that it can be used to
identify potential regulators driving cell type-specific epigenetic modifications. To
do so, we searched for motifs that show the highest correlation with <italic>M
</italic>values for all peaks. For example, we compared H1 ES and K562 cell lines for
differences in H3K27ac, a histone mark that serves as an indicator of both active
promoters and cell type-specific enhancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. We found that OCT4 (POU5F1) and SOX2 binding
motifs were closely clustered with the <italic>M </italic>value (= log<sub>2 </sub>(H3K27ac
read density in H1 ES cells/H3K27ac read density in K562 cells) of H3K27ac peaks
(Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4a</xref>), suggesting the corresponding factors are closely
related to the activation of ES cell-specific genes and <italic>cis</italic>-elements. In
contrast, -<italic>M </italic>value (= log<sub>2 </sub>(H3K27ac read density in K562
cells/H3K27ac read density in H1 ES cells) formed a compact module with the binding
motifs for transcription factors GATA1 and SCL (TAL1) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4b</xref>), suggesting their roles as regulators favoring H3K27ac modification in
K562 cells. These findings are consistent with the established roles of OCT4-SOX2 in
ES cell self-renewal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] and GATA-SCL in hematopoiesis and leukemogenesis
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. On the other hand, several motifs,
including MYC and ETS motifs (for example, ELK1, ELK4, GABPA), were highly enriched
in both peak sets, but showed no association with the differential binding of H3K27ac
(specifically, <italic>M </italic>value); this indicates they are involved in H3K27ac
modification in a non-cell type-specific manner. This finding in turn supports the
working assumption of our model that binding at most common peaks is determined by
similar mechanisms. Furthermore, upon comparison of the H3K27ac marks in H1 ES or
K562 cells with those in HeLaS3 cells, these same transcription factor motifs were
tightly associated with the H1 ES or K562-specific enrichment of H3K27ac marks at the
corresponding target regions (Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> in
Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>), indicating the clustering results are
robust. Thus, MAnorm serves as a powerful tool to uncover transcription factor motifs
and factors critical for cell-specific gene regulation.</p>

      <title>Differences in c-Myc binding between HeLaS3 and K562 cells</title>
      <p>The oncogene Myc (c-Myc) is an important transcriptional regulator in both ES cells
and cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Mechanisms underlying its cell type-specific binding are
largely unknown. We applied MAnorm to quantify differential binding of c-Myc in
HeLaS3 and K562 cells and explored its relationship with other factors. Using a
<italic>P</italic>-value cutoff of 1E-6, 18,924 peaks were detected in the c-Myc ChIP-Seq
data set of HeLaS3 cells, and 13,140 peaks were detected in K562 cells; approximately
6,000 peaks were common to both cell lines (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5a</xref>). MAnorm
largely removed the global dependence of M on A (Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6a, b</xref> in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>). A significant
fraction of c-Myc peaks were associated with <italic>M </italic>values far from zero,
suggesting that c-Myc has a large number of differential binding loci between HeLaS3
cells and K562 cells. To search for cell line-specific co-factors that might
contribute to such differential binding, we performed hierarchical clustering between
the <italic>M </italic>statistics inferred by MAnorm and the motif scores in the c-Myc
binding peaks. The c-Myc motif was highly enriched in both sets of c-Myc peaks (data
not shown), but did not show significant correlation with <italic>M </italic>statistics in
either clustering map (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5b, c</xref>), indicating that the c-Myc
motif is not responsible for the cell line-differential binding seen for c-Myc. Of
note, the <italic>M </italic>statistic (= log<sub>2 </sub>(c-Myc read density in K562/c-Myc
read density in HeLaS3)) clustered with the motifs of two other factors, GATA1 and
SCL (TAL1) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5b</xref>), and the -<italic>M </italic>statistic (=
log<sub>2 </sub>(c-Myc read density in HeLaS3/c-Myc read density in K562)
clustered with the motifs of AP1 and TEAD1 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5c</xref>).
Strikingly, these clustering patterns were highly similar to those obtained from the
comparison of the H3K27ac mark between these two cell types (Supplementary Figure
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5b</xref> in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>),
suggesting an underlying correlation between the cell type-specific binding of c-Myc
and the H3K27ac mark. To test whether this was the case, we mapped c-Myc binding
sites to gene promoters, and found that for the 9,013 genes targeted by both c-Myc
and H3K27ac, the Pearson correlation coefficient between the <italic>M </italic>statistics of
c-Myc and H3K27ac was 0.73 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5d</xref>), lending further support
to our clustering result.</p>

      <title>Application to the integration of ChIP-Seq replicates</title>
      <p>Integrating ChIP-Seq data from multiple biological replicates, which in some cases
are generated by different laboratories and/or using different platforms, may be
employed to reduce the false positive rate in identified binding sites. A simple
approach is to define a stringent set of peaks composed only of the common peaks
shared by two or more replicates. However, this method is highly sensitive to peak
cutoff and may exclude peaks that have similar ChIP intensities between replicates.
Moreover, some common peaks that show dramatic differences in read density are
retained. Therefore, to make full use of the information in biological replicates, a
quantitative comparison of peak intensity is particularly useful. We have applied
MAnorm to compare two replicates of H1 ES cell H3K27ac ChIP-Seq data. After
application of MAnorm (Supplementary Figure 7a, b in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>), many of the unique peaks were associated with <italic>M </italic>values
close to zero, indicating that these peaks exhibit good reproducibility between
replicates. On the other hand, there remained a small fraction of common peaks with
<italic>M </italic>values far from zero, representing strong signal differences between
replicates. Next, we showed that the <italic>M </italic>value between replicates is a good
indicator of H3K27ac target gene expression. We grouped H3K27ac target genes by the
absolute value of <italic>M </italic>statistics and calculated the expression distribution of
each gene group. Given that H3K27ac marks are positively associated with gene
expression, we anticipated that more highly expressed genes will have stronger
H3K27ac marks, and therefore be more reliable. In fact, we observed that genes having
higher expression tend to be the targets of H3K27ac peaks with lower absolute <italic>M
</italic>values, that is, peaks showing smaller difference between replicates, for both
common peaks and unique peaks (Supplementary Figure 7c-e in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>). Furthermore, by overlapping the above set of ENCODE peaks
with H3K27ac peaks for H1 ES cells generated in a different laboratory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], we found that a much lower proportion of the
peaks with |<italic>M</italic>| &gt; 1 were covered by the new peak set than those with
|<italic>M</italic>| &lt; 1 (Supplementary Figure 7f in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>). This suggests that |<italic>M</italic>| = 1 can also be used as an empirical
cutoff to filter unreliable peaks. Thus, MAnorm can be used both to check whether two
replicates are concordant, and also to obtain high confidence peak lists by filtering
out inconsistent peaks. Compared with arbitrary removal of unique peaks, MAnorm
allows for better use of replicate peak data. The MAnorm package (Additional file
<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>) provides the opportunity to list concordant and
non-concordant peaks between two samples based on user-specified cutoffs, with the
concordant peak list corresponding to high-confidence peaks.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec>
      <title>Comparison with other methods</title>
      <p>We compared the performance of MAnorm with three widely used normalization methods
that use genome-wide signals as reference, namely, normalization by total reads,
quantile normalization, which assumes the genome-wide distribution of read densities
to be the same across samples, and normalization using a genome-wide MA plot followed
by LOWESS regression. We used all four methods to compare H3K27ac ChIP-Seq data
between H1 ES and K562 cells. The MA plot normalized by MAnorm (Supplementary Figure
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2a</xref> in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>) was
relatively symmetric, while corresponding plots obtained by the other three
normalization methods remained highly asymmetric. Of note, the common peaks showed a
clear global bias towards stronger binding in K562 cells for total read normalization
and quantile normalization (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6a, b</xref>) and toward H1 ES
cells for genome-wide MA plot normalization (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6c</xref>). To
examine which method better reflects a true biological signal, we compared <italic>M
</italic>values normalized by all four methods with the expression change of target
genes. If a specific type of histone modification is closely related to gene
regulation, the direction of histone modification change should be consistent with
that of the change in expression of the target genes. By visual inspection, we found
this was true for the <italic>M </italic>values normalized by MAnorm (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6g</xref>). In contrast, <italic>M </italic>values normalized by the other three methods
were inconsistent with the log2-expression ratios of target genes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6d-f</xref>). Specifically, most of the genes with no change in H3K27ac
levels (<italic>M </italic>= 0) had higher (total read and quantile normalization) or lower
(genome-wide MA plot normalization) expression in H1 ES cells compared to K562 cells;
while the majority of the genes expressed at similar levels in these two cell types
were associated with negative (total read and quantile normalization) or positive
(genome-wide MA plot normalization) <italic>M </italic>values, that is, they had higher
(total read and quantile normalization) or lower (genome-wide MA plot normalization)
levels of H3K27ac in K562 cells.</p>
      <p>To quantitatively measure the bias of the <italic>M </italic>values given by the above
normalization methods, we first collected non-differentially expressed genes
(fold-change &lt; 1.5) between H1 ES cells and K562 cells. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6h</xref>, these genes are indeed not differentially expressed
(t-statistics = -0.76 and <italic>P</italic>-value = 0.45 by Students' <italic>t</italic>-test in
comparison to an expression ratio of 1 (<italic>M </italic>= 0)), indicating they are
suitable for our comparison. Since H3K27ac marks are closely associated with
transcriptional activation, it is reasonable to assume that these non-differentially
expressed genes should exhibit similar global H3K27ac levels. This is true only for
H3K27ac levels determined by MAnorm, where the <italic>M </italic>values for H3K27ac of the
non-differentially expressed target genes were not significantly different from a
ratio of 1 (<italic>M </italic>= 0; t-statistic = -0.55 and <italic>P</italic>-value = 0.58 by
<italic>t</italic>-test; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6h</xref>, red curve). In contrast, <italic>M
</italic>values for H3K27ac obtained by the other three normalization methods exhibited
large deviations from <italic>M </italic>= 0 (t-statistic ranging from 24 to 140 and
<italic>P</italic>-value &lt; 1e-100; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6h</xref>). Thus, MAnorm
exhibits superior performance in identifying authentic biological changes.</p>
      <p>We also compared the performance of MAnorm in detecting differential binding regions
in ChIP-Seq data sets with that of two currently used statistical methods, ChIPdiff
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] and MACS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. For this analysis, one data set was used as sample and the
other was used as control in order to detect regions with significantly elevated
ChIP-Seq signals in the first data set [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. We
applied all three methods to compare ChIP-Seq data for H3K27ac marks between H1 ES
cells and K562 cells (Supplementary Table 1 in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">4</xref>). ChIPdiff and MACS identified four to six times more target regions
associated with significantly increased ChIP-Seq signals for K562 cells compared with
those found for H1 ES cells, whereas MAnorm yielded a similar number of cell
type-biased peaks in each cell line. To compare the enrichment of cell
type-specifically expressed genes in the sets of target genes of the differential
binding regions discovered by the three methods, we selected the same number of
target genes associated with top differential binding regions identified by each
method. The target genes of top differential binding regions identified by MAnorm
contained similar numbers of H1 ES cell highly expressed genes but a greater number
of K562 cell highly expressed genes compared to those identified by ChIPdiff and MACS
(Supplementary Table 1 in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">4</xref>), suggesting
MAnorm performs better in detecting differentially binding regions than the other two
methods. Importantly, the fold changes of differential binding given by ChIPdiff and
MACS were based on the total number of reads, which may not be appropriate, as
discussed above. Additionally, MAnorm showed even better enrichment of cell
type-specifically expressed genes in differential binding region targets than the
method developed by Taslim <italic>et al. </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] when applied to ChIP-Seq data presented in their study
(Supplementary Table 2 in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">4</xref>).</p>
    </sec>
  </sec>
  <sec sec-type="discussion">
    <title>Discussion</title>
    <p>Normalization methods are typically based on the assumption that certain properties are
invariant across samples. For example, quantile normalization in gene expression
microarrays renders the distribution of expression levels of all genes constant between
samples [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Alternatively, normalization may
be based on housekeeping genes, whose expression is presumed to remain constant across
samples. The situation is quite different in ChIP-Seq studies, since the binding of most
chromatin-associated proteins is highly dynamic and cell type-dependent. Thus, it is
arbitrary to assume that the genome-wide distribution of ChIP-seq signals remains
constant between samples. It is also challenging to identify reliable control genomic
regions bound by a chromatin-associated protein in a non-cell type-specific manner that
can serve as an internal reference for normalization. Yet another difficulty underlying
ChIP-Seq studies is background noise, which is often difficult to distinguish from
authentic ChIP signals. Furthermore, the S/N ratio often varies across samples. These
same issues apply to DNase-Seq data sets, as discussed elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. In many peak-calling models, the distribution of
background signal is used to normalize sample and control data, which is reasonable when
control data are composed mainly of background signal, and the purpose is to identify
sequence read-enriched regions within a sample that shows significant differences
compared to the background. However, this approach is inappropriate for sample-to-sample
comparisons, especially when the S/N difference is large across samples. For example,
samples relatively free of 'noise' will yield a larger number of statistically
significant peaks compared to samples with a higher level of background sequence reads,
but these additional peaks may not be true cell line-specific or condition-specific
peaks. In MAnorm, we focused only on regions identified as significant peaks, and thus
minimized the impact of S/N differences between samples. Accordingly, the output of
MAnorm focuses on peak regions most likely to be of biological relevance.</p>
    <p>MAnorm shows improved performance when compared with other methods currently used to
detect differential binding regions between ChIP-Seq data sets. More importantly, MAnorm
provides a quantitative measurement of binding differences, which reflects authentic
biological differences. This feature is an asset for downstream analysis, including
expression assays and transcription co-factor identification studies. Although the
definition of ChIP-Seq peaks is highly dependent on the cutoff used in peak calling,
MAnorm is robust to cutoff selection (Supplementary Figure 8 in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref> and Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>). Furthermore,
the normalized read densities of each peak in both ChIP-Seq samples can be calculated
from the (<italic>M, A</italic>) values normalized by MAnorm, and then used to evaluate whether
the cutoffs used to define peaks are comparable between the ChIP-Seq samples being
compared (Supplementary Figure 8 in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref> and
Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>).</p>
    <p>MAnorm relies on two working assumptions. First, MAnorm is designed for quantitative
comparison of ChIP-Seq data sets that have a substantial number of peak regions in
common. Second, MAnorm postulates that there are no global changes in the true ChIP
signals at these common peaks. We believe these underlying hypotheses are widely
applicable and do not significantly restrict the use of MAnorm, as exemplified by our
application of MAnorm to elucidate hormone-regulated, cell state-specific transcription
factor binding in mouse liver <italic>in vivo </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. For ChIP-seq samples for which there is not a significant
overlap in peak sets, the binding of chromatin-associated proteins could be uncorrelated
or even anti-correlated at a genome-wide scale and MAnorm would not be applicable.
However, in that case a quantitative comparison would likely not be that useful. In
addition, in cases where the binding patterns for a chromatin-bound factor change widely
across the genome, such as following knock down of a core subunit of a
chromatin-associated protein complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], more
specific analysis would be required to quantitatively determine the global changes.</p>
    <p>The pairwise approach to comparison of ChIP-Seq samples proposed here can be extended to
multiple sample comparison, as was successfully demonstrated in the case of two-channel
microarray data analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Furthermore, it
is well known that transcription factors and epigenetic modifications act together to
modulate gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Most recently,
statistical models have been developed to study such combinatorial patterns in a
genome-wide fashion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>].
However, how changes in epigenetic marks and transcriptional factors correlate with each
other across cell lines is still largely unexplored. In this study, we used MAnorm to
successfully detect an underlying correlation between cell-type dependent binding of
c-Myc and the H3K27ac mark in two disease-related cell types. Thus, it will be
interesting to integrate quantitative changes of other epigenetic marks and
transcriptional factors for further elucidation of the complex mechanisms underlying
cell type-specific regulation.</p>

    <title>Conclusions</title>
    <p>MAnorm exhibited excellent performance in quantitative comparison of ChIP-Seq data sets
for both epigenetic modifications and transcription factors; the quantitative binding
differences inferred by MAnorm were highly correlated with both the changes in
expression of target genes and also the binding of cell type-specific regulators. With
the accumulation of ChIP-seq data sets, MAnorm should serve as a powerful tool for
obtaining a more comprehensive understanding of cell type-specific and cell
state-specific regulation during organism development and disease onset.</p>

files that describe the coordinates of all predefined peaks and aligned sequence reads
of two ChIP-Seq samples are used as input. Second, MAnorm calculates the number of reads
in a window of the same length centered at the summit of each peak. Here the window size
should be comparable to the median length of ChIP-enriched regions; we recommend 2,000
bp window size for histone modifications and 1,000 bp for transcription factor binding
sites. The (<italic>M, A</italic>) value of each peak is then defined as:</p>

    <p>Here, <italic>R<sub>1 </sub></italic>is the read density at this peak region in ChIP-Seq sample
1 and <italic>R<sub>2 </sub></italic>is the corresponding read density in sample 2. To avoid
log<sub>2</sub>0, we added a value of 1 to the real number of reads for all peaks.
Thus, the value of <italic>M </italic>describes the log<sub>2 </sub>fold change of the read
density at a peak region between two samples, while <italic>A </italic>represents the average
signal intensity in terms of log<sub>2</sub>-transformed read density. To build the
normalization model, each peak of the two samples being compared was further classified
as a common or a unique peak, depending on whether or not it overlapped (by at least one
nucleotide, as implemented in our analysis in this study) with any peak in the other
sample. The downloadable MATLAB MAnorm package (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>) also provides a parameter for users to select common peaks based on a
cutoff of peak summit-to-summit distance. By default, this value is set to 500 bp for
histone modifications and 250 bp for transcription factors. In addition, when a peak
overlaps with multiple peaks in the other sample, MAnorm selects the peak with the
smallest summit-to-summit distance to avoid potential bias in building the normalization
model. Next, robust regression was applied to the <italic>M</italic>-<italic>A </italic>values of common
peaks using iterative re-weighted least squares with a bi-square weighting function
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>] and a linear model was derived to fit
the global dependence between the <italic>M-A </italic>values of these peaks:</p>

    <p>in which x and y specify the normalized read count at this peak in sample 1 and sample
2, respectively. Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref> provides further details on
<italic>P</italic>-value calculations. When the read densities at most peak regions are high,
most peaks associated with absolute <italic>M </italic>values &gt; 1 are associated with
significant <italic>P</italic>-values. Then, the <italic>M </italic>value can be used to rank peaks and
select differential binding regions, as was done in analyzing ENCODE ChIP-Seq data
(Supplementary Table 1 in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">4</xref>). When read
densities at most peak regions are relatively low, some of the peaks associated with
absolute <italic>M </italic>values &gt; 1 may still fail to obtain significant <italic>P</italic>-values.
In such a case, we suggest ranking peaks by <italic>P</italic>-values and defining differential
binding regions using combined cutoffs of both <italic>M </italic>value and <italic>P</italic>-value, as
we did when analyzing the ChIP-seq data from Taslim <italic>et. al. </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] (Supplementary Table 2 in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">4</xref>).</p>
    <p>The output of MAnorm includes the normalized (<italic>M, A</italic>) value and the corresponding
<italic>P</italic>-value of each peak. To illustrate the normalization process, the (<italic>M,
A</italic>) values of all peaks before and after normalization are plotted together with
the linear model derived from common peaks. The MAnorm package will also generate three
bed files presenting the genome coordinates for the non-differential binding region and
two differential binding regions based on user-specified cutoffs, together with two wig
files (corresponding to the two peak lists under comparison) that can be uploaded to a
genome browser for visualization of the <italic>M </italic>value for each peak (Supplementary
Figure 9). MATLAB and R versions of the MAnorm package are available for downloading in

      <title>Application of MAnorm to ENCODE ChIP-Seq data</title>
      <p>The performance of MAnorm was tested using ENCODE ChIP-Seq data describing histone
modifications (H3K4me3 and H3K27ac) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>] and
transcription factor binding (c-Myc and Pol II) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>] across three human cell lines: H1 ES cells, HeLaS3 cells, and
K562 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Since these data were
generated and processed by different laboratories associated with the ENCODE project,
the data sets were reanalyzed and the ChIP-Seq peaks in each sample were redefined
using MACS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] using a <italic>P</italic>-value cutoff
of 1e-10 for histone modifications and a <italic>P</italic>-value cutoff of 1e-6 for
transcription factor binding. The peaks of histone modifications were further
filtered by the false discovery rate (FDR) values modeled by MACS. The target genes
of each group of peaks were defined as those RefSeq genes that have a given peak(s)
in the promoter region, defined as the region from 8 kb upstream to 2 kb downstream
of the transcription start site.</p>
      <p>Gene expression data for all three cell types were collected from the Gene Expression
Omnibus (GEO) database using accession numbers [GEO:GSE26312] (for H1 ES cells)
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>], [GEO:GSE2735] (for HeLaS3 cells)
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>] and [GEO:GSE12056] (for K562
cells) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>], and the raw data were
reprocessed by dChip [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. The differentially
expressed genes were subsequently identified by Significance Analysis of Microarrays
(SAM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>] using a combined cutoff of fold
change &gt; 2 and FDR &lt; 0.01. In total, 3,465 genes more highly expressed in H1 ES
cells and 2,224 genes more highly expressed in K562 cells were identified from the H1
ES to K562 comparison; 5,815 genes more highly expressed in H1 ES cells and 1,649
genes more highly expressed in HeLaS3 cells were identified from the H1 ES cell to
HeLaS3 cell comparison; and 3,555 genes more highly expressed in HeLaS3 cells and
5,916 genes more highly expressed in K562 cells were identified from the HeLaS3 cell
to K562 cell comparison. To study the relationship between binding differences in
peak regions and the expression change of the corresponding target genes, we used the
<italic>M </italic>values of peaks to divide the targeted genes into different groups
separated by integer <italic>M </italic>values from -4 to 4, and then calculated the
enrichment score of the overlap between each gene group and those differentially
expressed genes. To avoid extreme enrichment scores, groups composed of &lt; 50 genes
were merged with the larger of the adjacent two gene groups.</p>

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>] applied to a 1,000 bp window
centered at the peak summit. For each motif <italic>F</italic>, the raw motif matching score

      <title>Comparing the performance of MAnorm and other methods</title>
      <p>For total read normalization, we divided the read intensity of each peak region by
the total number of mapped sequence reads. For quantile normalization, we first
divided the whole genome into non-overlapping bins of the same size as the window
used in MAnorm (2,000 bp for H3K27ac), and then calculated the read count in each
bin. Finally, the distribution of bin read counts was normalized to be the same by
matching all quantiles between samples. For normalization by genome-wide MA plots, we
first divided the whole genome into non-overlapping bins of the same size as the
window used in MAnorm (2,000 bp for H3K27ac), and then calculated the <italic>M-A
</italic>value of each bin. The dependence between <italic>M</italic>-<italic>A </italic>value was then
removed by subtracting <italic>M </italic>values with local linear model fitted by LOWESS
regression from the genome-wide <italic>M</italic>-<italic>A </italic>values.</p>
      <p>To compare the performance of MAnorm with the model developed by Taslim <italic>et al.
</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], we used MACS to identify
peaks from the same Pol II ChIP-Seq datasets used by [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], and then applied MAnorm to compare Pol II binding
profiles between estradiol (E2)-stimulated MCF7 cells and unstimulated MCF7 cells.
The gene expression data of unstimulated and E2-stimulated MCF7 cells was obtained
from the GEO database, accession number [GEO:GSE11352] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. We identified 59 genes showing higher expression in
unstimulated MCF7 cells and 130 genes showing higher expression in E2-stimulated (12
h) MCF7 cells using SAM with fold change &gt; 2 and FDR &lt; 0.1. Finally, the
performance of MAnorm was evaluated by comparing the difference of Pol II binding
determined by both models with the differential expression of target genes.</p>
