    <title>Introduction</title>
    <p id="Par2">Next generation sequencing technologies have accelerated the discovery of single nucleotide variants (SNVs) in the human genome, stimulating the development of predictors for classifying which of these variants are likely functional in disease, and which neutral. Predictors have been developed for variants in both the coding and non-coding regions of the human genome. For example, in Shihab <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>, we developed such a predictor based on pathogenic disease-driver germline variants from the Human Gene Mutation Database (HGMD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>), and assumed neutral variants from the 1,000 Genomes Project Consortium (1000G<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>). Multiple types of data may be informative, so we used an integrative binary classifier that weighted component data-types according to their relative informativeness<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. A variety of similar predictors have been proposed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>.</p>
    <p id="Par3">In this paper we focus on prediction for somatic point mutations in both coding and non-coding regions of the human cancer genome. The development of such predictors will be important for interpreting cancer sequence databases currently being compiled, such as the Cancer Genome Atlas<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>, the International Cancer Genome Consortium<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup> and national programmes such as the Genomics England (100,000 genomes) Project<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Mirroring previous methods<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>, we use an integrative classifier and a wide variety of data sources. Using leave-one-chromosome-out cross-validation (LOCO-CV), the proposed method, which we call <italic>CScape</italic>, outperforms rival methods, achieving balanced accuracy of 72.3% in coding regions and 62.9% in non-coding regions. Tested on independent data sets, <italic>CScape</italic> can achieve up to 91% balanced accuracy in coding regions and 70% in non-coding regions. Most methods in this domain attempt to rank mutations to identify the most likely oncogenic examples. One drawback of this approach is that clinical practitioners may find it difficult to interpret scores without provision of specific thresholds for discriminating between benign and oncogenic mutations. Hence in this study we establish two thresholds for each model (a default threshold and a high-confidence threshold) by associating a confidence measure to each predicted label. If we restrict prediction to highest confidence instances only (<italic>cautious classification</italic>) then balanced accuracy in LOCO-CV rises to 91.7% for coding regions and 76.1% for non-coding regions, with predictions confined to 17.7% (coding) and 14.8% (non-coding) of nucleotide positions across the genome, respectively. These high confidence positive (oncogenic) predictions are typically clustered by genomic location, hence we further introduce a statistical method to find significant contiguous sets of such positive predictions. This latter approach highlights a number of genes as potentially oncogenic via somatic point mutation.</p>

  <sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results">
    <title>Results</title>
    <p id="Par4">We assembled two distinct datasets: our pathogenic (positive) dataset was constructed using somatic point mutations from the COSMIC database<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup> (version 75, November 2015) and our control (negative) dataset was constructed using SNVs from the 1,000 Genomes Project<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. This control dataset contains many variants which are unannotated and therefore could be true positives. Similarly, we may expect true negatives among the positively labeled COSMIC datapoints, such as passenger mutations co-located with driver mutations. Among the COSMIC database annotations is the recurrence level, or the number of times a mutation has been observed in different cases. To increase the likelihood that positive examples are drivers, not passengers, we use pathogenic examples with a COSMIC recurrence count as high as possible. However, the number of training examples decreases rapidly as we increase the recurrence threshold (Supplementary Figure <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>). In addition, an exceedingly high threshold may introduce bias, for example, by restricting the training set to only a subset of relevant genes. Hence for each model we choose as our threshold the highest recurrence level that shows little evidence of bias and provides sufficient training examples to create an accurate classifier (Supplementary Figure <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref>). Using this approach we thus select recurrence thresholds of <italic>r</italic> = 5 for coding regions, and <italic>r</italic> = 3 for non-coding regions.</p>
    <p id="Par5">Bias may also be introduced if negative examples are located in different genomic regions from positive examples. For example, if positives appear predominantly near transcription start sites while negatives are distributed more broadly<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. To ensure the locations of putative non-driver mutations approximate those of driver mutations, we select only those putative non-drivers found within a window <italic>w</italic> of a putative driver mutation. For coding examples we use <italic>w</italic> = 10,000, and for non-coding examples we use <italic>w</italic> = 1,000 (Supplementary Figure <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S3</xref>). Hence our final training set, outlined in Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>, consists of 46,420 coding examples and 131,714 non-coding examples.</p>
    <sec id="Sec3">
      <title>Feature Groups</title>
      <p id="Par6">All of our data are based on the GRCh37/hg19 version of the human genome and detailed further in the Supplementary. Following our previous work<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>, we annotated our datasets using more than 30 <italic>feature groups</italic> that could be predictive of pathogenicity (a detailed description of these feature groups can be found in the Supplementary):<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par7"><italic>Genomic</italic>: genomic features included GC content, sequence spectra<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>, repeat regions and measures of region uniqueness.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par8"><italic>Evolutionary</italic>: as in previous work, evolutionary features included a comprehensive set of conservation-based measures provided by tools such as Phastcons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>, PhyloP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup> and FATHMM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par9"><italic>Consequences (coding only)</italic>: using the Variant Effect Predictor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup> we used binary vectors to represent allele consequences and the affected amino acids within all transcripts associated with a mutation.</p></list-item></list>
</p>
      <p id="Par10">In addition to these feature groups, we developed new features specifically to boost performance for our non-coding predictor, though similar features proved effective in both coding and non-coding regions (see Supplementary Methods for a complete description). Briefly, these new features fall into two categories: <italic>sequence</italic> features designed to capture disruption that occurs in a sequence as a consequence of a mutation, and <italic>genomic context</italic> features that encapsulate genomic features within a mutation’s neighborhood, such as known splice sites or start/stop codons. Recent studies have identified regulatory elements, such as transcription factor binding sites (TFBS), as potential targets of oncogenic mutations in non-coding regions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. Consequently at least one method, FunSeq2, already incorporates motif-specific analysis to score mutations in non-coding regions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. The COSMIC database also provides a set of <italic>mutational signatures</italic> that are specific to oncogenic mutations. These are associated with various distinct forms of mutation, such as DNA replication errors, defective DNA repair, enzymatic DNA modification, and exposure to mutagens<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. However, this signature set is relatively new and hence may represent only a subset of potential oncogenic driver signals. Further, the metrics used to develop these signatures are based in part on the COSMIC database and potentially could introduce bias into our models.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="Sec4">
      <title>CScape models</title>
      <p id="Par11">We evaluated all models using LOCO-CV, omitting mitochondrial and allosomal (X and Y) chromosomes from testing as these tended to yield few examples, and we wanted to focus on performance within autosomal chromosomes. For each fold we leave out one test chromosome while the remaining 21 chromosomes are used to train the model, using the same model parameters for all folds. Except where noted, we trained models using randomly selected, balanced sets of 1,000 positive and 1,000 negative examples. This relatively small subset of examples yields accuracy nearly as high as with complete training sets but takes less time to train, and allows us to estimate the variability of the test results. For testing we used all available examples for the left-out chromosome, resulting in unbalanced test sets for coding but nearly balanced test sets for non-coding (Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>). For this reason we report balanced accuracy for all tests.</p>
      <p id="Par12">We integrated data from the feature groups outlined above and used them to train two distinct classifiers: <italic>CS-coding</italic> for coding regions, and <italic>CS-noncoding</italic> for noncoding regions. The simplest kernel method for integrating different data sources is to combine features from all sources into a single kernel. This allows a model to learn how features from one source may interact with features from other sources. Given at least 30 possible data sources, the number of possible combinations of feature groups makes exhaustive testing impractical. Instead, we use an approach similar to previous work in which we found that greedy sequential learning could be an effective means to identify an optimal combination of groups<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. To identify the data sources to include in each model, we first build a model based on two top-ranked data sources combined into a single kernel and record its balanced test accuracy in LOCO-CV. We build subsequent models by adding data sources in descending order of their individual balanced accuracy in LOCO-CV. We select as our final combination those data sources associated with a peak or a plateau in LOCO-CV balanced accuracy (Supplementary Figure <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S6</xref>). We evaluate all combinations with and without data normalisation, where we standardise features by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation. For these models we observed no difference in performance between the raw feature values and standardised data. The final <italic>CS-noncoding</italic> model includes just five feature groups: <italic>46-way conservation</italic>, <italic>100-way conservation</italic>, <italic>Spectrum</italic>, <italic>Genomic context</italic> and <italic>Mappability</italic> (Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S4</xref>, Supplementary Figure <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S6</xref>). For <italic>CS-coding</italic> the best model also included five feature groups, but a slightly different set: <italic>VEP</italic> (including amino acid substitutions), <italic>46-way conservation</italic>, <italic>100-way conservation</italic>, <italic>Genomic context</italic> and <italic>Spectrum</italic>.</p>
      <p id="Par13">In previous studies we found that integration at the kernel level, using multiple kernel learning (MKL)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup> and sequential learning strategies, tended to outperform integration at the data level<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. We thus applied our sequential learning pipeline<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup> to examples in both coding and non-coding regions: we ranked feature groups by balanced validation accuracy and added them incrementally to aggregate kernels. For non-coding examples, the best MKL aggregates achieved just over 58% balanced accuracy (Supplementary Figure <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S7</xref>, left). For coding examples, the best achieved over 65% balanced accuracy (Supplementary Figure <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S7</xref>, right). However, in both cases, data-level integration yielded greater balanced accuracy than kernel-level integration.</p>
      <p id="Par14">Both of our models output probability scores on [0, 1]: scores below 0.5 are predicted as negative and scores above 0.5, positive (see Methods). These scores (herein called <italic>p-scores</italic>) lead to a natural interpretation, such as identifying <italic>p</italic>-scores above 0.95 as high-confidence predictions. The two models exhibit markedly different <italic>p</italic>-score distributions across the genome (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, left): <italic>CS-coding</italic> yields <italic>p</italic>-scores in a bi-modal distribution with peaks at 0.18 and 0.91, demonstrating that a substantial portion of its predictions will be highly confident. By contrast, the <italic>CS-noncoding</italic> model makes few confident predictions, with a majority of <italic>p</italic>-scores clustered close to 0.6. When we examine the relative distributions of positive and negative examples from the LOCO test sets, the differences between the coding and non-coding models becomes clearer. <italic>CS-coding p</italic>-score distributions are markedly different between positive and negative examples, exhibiting some separation between the classes (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, middle). By contrast, <italic>CS-noncoding p</italic>-score distributions are highly similar (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, right). We have identified feature groups that enable the non-coding model to discriminate between classes with greater balanced accuracy than previous methods (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>), but achieving clear separation remains challenging. We note that a small proportion of non-coding predictions carry high confidence. Multiplied by the large number of non-coding positions in the human genome, this translates into a large population of high-confidence predictions in non-coding regions.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Distributions of CScape p-scores reveal distinct differences in the behaviours of the <italic>CS-coding</italic> and <italic>CS-noncoding</italic> models. <bold>Left:</bold>

Performance at the default threshold is good relative to alternative methods, though overall balanced accuracy (62% for non-coding mutations and 73% for coding mutations) leaves room for improvement, also reflected in the corresponding Matthews correlation coefficients (MCC) of 0.25 and 0.46, respectively. Cautious classification (see below) improves these measurements substantially, raising balanced accuracy by 14 percentage points for the non-coding model and by 19 percentage points for the coding model, and doubling (non-coding) or nearly doubling (coding) the MCC.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Statistics for <italic>CS-noncoding</italic> and <italic>CS-coding</italic> applied to LOCO-CV test data provide estimates of how the models are likely to perform on new examples.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Classifier</th><th>TP</th><th>FP</th><th>TN</th><th>FN</th><th>Sens.</th><th>Spec.</th><th>Bal.

We compare these refined sets of predictions to other models in the Supplementary.

With the data used in cross-validation, 15.62% of test examples (5,038 out of 32,253) had a high enough confidence for prediction.

We evaluate these methods on a population of randomly-selected test sets and compute the average balanced accuracy, area under ROC curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) and positive predictive value (PPV, see Supplementary for definitions). Testing on randomly selected sets allows us to estimate the variation in performance for each method and to compare methods in a disciplined manner. As a control to establish baseline statistics, we use the <italic>CScape</italic> scores for each test set and shuffle the labels. To evaluate the other methods, we apply different thresholds to select positive or negative predictions (see <italic>Score thresholds</italic> in the Supplementary for full details).</p>

We first note that any mutation may impact multiple transcripts, hence the same mutation may have multiple annotations in the VEP database. For our coding classifier, we find the majority of the 627 mis-classified ClinVar examples are annotated as missense mutations for at least one transcript (Supplementary Figure <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S8</xref>). while the majority of correctly classified examples are annotated as synonymous. In our other test sets, there appear to be no strong trends though we do find a slightly higher proportion of correct predictions amongst mis-sense mutations. The non-coding classifier shows little sign of classifying one kind of example better than another (Supplementary Figure <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S9</xref>).

Overall, results were mixed, with CADD and DANN improving marginally in all regions, while FATHMM-MKL generally performed worse. We also identified region-specific thresholds using either coding or non-coding training sets, and found significant improvements for both CADD and DANN. Hence it may be possible to apply non-cancer-specific methods to cancer variants, provided one can establish appropriate thresholds.

We provide files listing these regions of interest, in both coding and non-coding regions, at the CScape website.</p>

    <title>Discussion</title>
    <p id="Par34">A stated top balanced test accuracy of 91.7% in coding regions has been made possible through use of a broad set of data sources, with subsequent use of cautious classification to define a more accurate predictor, but with more limited applicability (this accuracy can only be achieved at 17.7% of nucleotide positions). Without cautious classification, <italic>CScape</italic> yields competitive accuracy in both coding and non-coding regions, but its performance in non-coding regions excels in our tests when compared with other methods. We note that both models, <italic>CS-coding</italic> and <italic>CS-noncoding</italic>, benefit from similar but distinct feature groups. In particular, <italic>CS-noncoding</italic> benefits from the <italic>Mappability</italic> group that measures the uniqueness of a region, possibly allowing the model to learn the relative oncogenic susceptibility of repeat regions or paralogous sequences. Predictably, <italic>CS-coding</italic> benefits largely from predicted amino acid substitutions and sequence conservation measures. The positive predictive values (PPV) and numbers of true positives predicted (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>) suggest that accurate prediction of positives is achievable, and that the balanced test accuracy is not overwhelmingly achieved through accurate prediction on neutral variants. Currently the paucity of validated oncogenic variants in non-coding regions is a limiting factor in creating accurate predictors for those regions; as more of these examples are confirmed, subsequent models should improve. In addition, it should be possible to improve on these results across the entire cancer genome, via identification of further sources of data relevant to predicting disease-driver status, the use of adaptive recurrences thresholds <italic>r</italic> in different regions of the coding and non-coding parts of the genome, and the development of cancer-type specific predictors e.g. for breast cancer or prostate cancer (in previous work<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup> we have established this leads to improved balanced test accuracy). Similarly, we have shown that some competing methods may benefit from using cancer-specific thresholds, given an appropriate data set for evaluating their accuracy at different thresholds. However, it is doubtful that users will be willing to engage in extensive post-processing, and the resulting predictions are unlikely to yield balanced accuracy significantly better than <italic>CScape’s</italic>.</p>
    <p id="Par35">One of our goals in this study was to exploit the diverse databases emerging from the ENCODE resource. Many of these databases are sparse: some of these feature groups have values for only a tiny proportion of locations across the genome. In this study we explored two data integration methods that work well with whole feature groups: data-level integration, in which we merge groups into a single kernel, and kernel-level integration in which we treat each group as a separate kernel and use MKL to combine them. However the sparsity of many feature groups currently limits their utility in these paradigms. This sparsity could be due to the constraints of the underlying assays, such as expression data obtained for specific conditions, or due to data that are inherently sparse, such as transcription factor binding sites. Regardless of the cause, more sophisticated data integration methods will likely be required to exploit them fully.</p>
    <p id="Par36">As this paper was in preparation, evidence emerged demonstrating that a substantial number of the examples in mutation databases are probably spurious, reflecting damaged DNA rather than mutations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. We mitigate this issue to some extent by using recurrence counts or validation status to filter positive examples, but negative examples could be more severely impacted. Hence we should view the statistics reported here with some scepticism, as the models we have examined have been trained and tested on putative oncogenic driver mutations and, possibly, a mixture of benign mutations and damaged DNA. Only once spurious examples have been largely eliminated from mutation databases will we know whether the added noise renders the discrimination problem more or less difficult than reported here.</p>

      <p id="Par37">All experiments were written in Python (v2.7.6) using classification models from <italic>PyML</italic>

<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup> (v.0.17). We use LOCO-CV to evaluate a variety of different classification models, to establish the best overall model, using balanced accuracy as our criterion. In each CV fold, we select a training set at random from 21 chromosomes, hence performance will change from one run to the next. For this reason, we ran cross validation 30 times for each model, and use the average balanced accuracy to compare models. Many classifiers have parameters that require tuning, such as a regularisation parameter. To find the best parameter for each model, we selected a range of values (<italic>C</italic> = 10<sup>−4</sup> to 10<sup>4</sup>, in the case of SVM) and ran LOCO-CV 10 times for each value, selecting the parameter that yielded the best average balanced validation accuracy for the model (see Supplementary text and Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S5</xref> for more details). We found that Gradient Boosting<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup> yielded the strongest performance overall, though several models yielded balanced accuracy nearly as high (Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S5</xref>). In particular, support-vector machines with Gaussian kernels were competitive, facilitating experiments with multiple kernel learning (MKL).</p>

A common approach for binary classification is to apply a threshold of 0, and predict values below the threshold as negative and those above as positive. An alternative method is to map output scores to a probability distribution on [0, 1] and use a threshold of 0.5. In this work we use Platt scaling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup> to associate a confidence measure with each predicted class label, which we interpret as the probability that a particular SNV is a cancer driver. By establishing a suitable confidence threshold we can also restrict prediction to a subset of higher balanced-accuracy predictions (<italic>cautious classification</italic>). This leads to an alternative, high-confidence threshold for our models that yields improved balanced test accuracy, but at the expense of prediction on a subset of nucleotide positions.</p>

      <title>Regions of interest</title>
      <p id="Par39">The resultant positive (oncogenic) predictions are frequently clustered by genomic location. Thus mutations in regions that are highly conserved across species are typically more deleterious than mutations in regions exhibiting high inter-species variability: the motivation for using sequence-conversation features for the classifier. This fact alone should give rise to significant clustering of positive predictions in highly conserved regions. To isolate regions of clustered positive predictions, which we call <italic>Regions of Interest</italic> (<italic>RoI</italic>s), we determined the distribution of confidence values and labeled a region as a <italic>RoI</italic> if the contiguous set of positive confidence values located in this region had a very low expectation of being observed, relative to the overall distribution. Full details on the methods used to identify these regions are given in the Supplementary Methods.</p>
