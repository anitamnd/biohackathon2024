      <p id="Par1">The northern tree shrew (<italic>Tupaia belangeri</italic>) possesses high potential as an animal model of human diseases and biology, given its genetic similarity to primates. Although genetic information on the tree shrew has already been published, some of the entire coding sequences (CDSs) of tree shrew genes remained incomplete, and the reliability of these CDSs remained difficult to determine. To improve the determination of tree shrew CDSs, we performed sequencing of the whole-genome, mRNA, and total RNA and integrated the resulting data. Additionally, we established criteria for the selection of reliable CDSs and annotated these sequences by comparison to the human transcriptome, resulting in the identification of complete CDSs for 12,612 tree shrew genes and yielding a more accurate tree shrew genome database (TupaiaBase: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://tupaiabase.org">http://tupaiabase.org</ext-link>). Transcriptome profiles in hepatitis B virus infected tree shrew livers were analyzed for validation. Gene ontology analysis showed enriched transcriptional regulation at 1 day post-infection, namely in the “type I interferon signaling pathway”. Moreover, a negative regulator of type I interferon, <italic>SOCS3</italic>, was induced. This work, which provides a tree shrew CDS database based on genomic DNA and RNA sequencing, is expected to serve as a powerful tool for further development of the tree shrew model.</p>

    <title>Introduction</title>
    <p id="Par2">The northern tree shrew (<italic>Tupaia belangeri</italic>), which belongs to the family Tupaiidae, has a body weight ranging between 100–150 g, and is similar in appearance to squirrels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. The natural habitat of <italic>Tupaia</italic> spp. consists of the tropical rainforest in South East Asia where the animals feed on fruits, insects, and small vertebrates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. One of the appealing features of the tree shrew is its genetic closeness to human<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Thus, tree shrews are widely used as experimental animals in various research fields<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Recently, generation of a transgenic tree shrew has been reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. The importance of tree shrew as an alternative animal model is growing.</p>
    <p id="Par3">Tree shrews have been employed in viral infection studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>, especially for hepatitis B virus (HBV)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup> and hepatitis C virus (HCV)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>, viruses for which the only other natural non-human infection model is chimpanzee. HBV, a member of the family <italic>Hepadnaviridae</italic>, causes acute and chronic hepatitis, and is a major worldwide public health concern<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Chronic HBV infection is strongly associated with an increased risk of cirrhosis, which in turn can lead to hepatocellular carcinoma<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Worldwide, 2 billion people have been reported to be infected with HBV, and more than 350 million have been reported to be chronically infected<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Urgent measures are required, but the development of drugs and vaccines has been hampered by the lack of an efficient animal model for infection by this virus. Since HBV causes human-like symptomology (including hepatitis and persistent infection) in tree shrews<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>, tree shrew could be a powerful animal model for HBV infection.</p>
    <p id="Par4">Genomic information is essential for various studies such as gene expression analysis and immunological analysis. Recently, an analysis of the tree shrew genome was reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>, and associated genomic information has been published in Ensembl (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://asia.ensembl.org">http://asia.ensembl.org</ext-link>) and the Tree shrew Database (TreeshrewDB: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.treeshrewdb.org">http://www.treeshrewdb.org</ext-link>). However, some of the entire coding sequences (CDSs) of tree shrew genes still remained incomplete. Additionally, even when CDSs have been identified, it can be difficult to determine how reliable those CDSs are. In the present study, we performed whole-genome sequencing, mRNA sequencing, and total RNA sequencing, and used the resulting data to select reliable complete tree shrew CDSs by utilizing defined criteria. Based on the obtained data, we have developed an enhanced tree shrew genome database (TupaiaBase: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://tupaiabase.org">http://tupaiabase.org</ext-link>). In addition, we have validated this database using HBV-infected tree shrew liver specimens at an early stage of infection.</p>

      <title>Genome sequencing</title>
      <p id="Par5">In our initial work, we determined the whole-genome sequence of the tree shrew using next-generation sequencing. Starting from a tree shrew DNA sample, we constructed a series of libraries with different insert sizes (170 bp–20 Kb) (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Altogether, 14 libraries were generated, yielding a total of approximately 335 Gb of sequencing data. Assembly employed a subset of the data representing 240 Gb of high-quality sequence. The final N50 contig and total contig sizes were 33 Kb and 2.7 Gb, respectively (Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). The N50 scaffold and total scaffold sizes were 1.1 Mb and 2.7 Gb, respectively. As a next step, these sequencing data were annotated by homology-based gene prediction and <italic>de novo</italic> gene prediction, and a comprehensive gene set was constructed using GLEAN<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. Based on GLEAN gene models, the tree shrew genome was predicted to contain a total of 19,320 protein-coding genes (Table <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>).<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Statistics of whole-genome sequencing data.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Pair-end libraries</th><th>Insert size</th><th>Read length (bp)</th><th>Total Data (Gb)</th><th>Sequence depth (fold)*</th><th>Physical depth (fold)*</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td rowspan="7">Illumina Reads</td><td>170 bp</td><td>100</td><td>60.96</td><td>19.82</td><td>16.84</td></tr><tr><td>500 bp</td><td>100</td><td>72.67</td><td>23.63</td><td>59.06</td></tr><tr><td>800 bp</td><td>100</td><td>51.25</td><td>16.66</td><td>66.65</td></tr><tr><td>2 Kb</td><td>57</td><td>56.64</td><td>18.41</td><td>322.49</td></tr><tr><td>5 Kb</td><td>49</td><td>35.94</td><td>11.68</td><td>596.03</td></tr><tr><td>10 Kb</td><td>49</td><td>41.24</td><td>13.41</td><td>1368</td></tr><tr><td>20 Kb</td><td>49</td><td>16.38</td><td>5.33</td><td>1087</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td/><td/><td>335.08</td><td>108.93</td><td>3516.07</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p><sup>*</sup>The genome size is assumed to be 3.08 Gb.</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><table-wrap id="Tab2"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Statistics of the assembled sequence length of whole-genome sequencing.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th rowspan="2"/><th colspan="2">Contig</th><th colspan="2">Scaffold</th></tr><tr><th>Size (bp)</th><th>Number</th><th>Size (bp)</th><th>Number</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>N50</td><td>33,380</td><td>24,001</td><td>1,149,110</td><td>679</td></tr><tr><td>Longest</td><td>267,380</td><td>—</td><td>13,631,494</td><td>—</td></tr><tr><td>Total Size</td><td>2,709,670,168</td><td>—</td><td>2,746,321,810</td><td>—</td></tr><tr><td>Total number (&gt;=100 bp)</td><td>—</td><td>585,492</td><td>—</td><td>447,618</td></tr><tr><td>Total number (&gt;=2 kb)</td><td>—</td><td>121,063</td><td>—</td><td>7,608</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><table-wrap id="Tab3"><label>Table 3</label><caption><p>General statistics of predicted protein-coding genes of whole-genome sequencing.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Gene set</th><th>Number</th><th>Average gene length (bp)</th><th>Average CDS length (bp)</th><th>Average exon per gene</th><th>Average exon length (bp)</th><th>Average intron length (bp)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>GLEAN</td><td>19,320</td><td>24,193</td><td>1,419</td><td>7.68</td><td>184.85</td><td>3,411</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p>

      <title>Identification of CDSs by genome and RNA sequence analysis</title>
      <p id="Par6">To enhance the quality of gene annotation, HBV-infected tree shrews were used for RNA sequence (seq) analysis. Since an immune response should be induced under normal conditions, the use of HBV-infected tree shrew liver and spleen samples for RNA sequencing was expected to permit the identification of genes associated with an immune response to viral infection. In addition, different set of genes are expected to be expressed in each phase of infection. Therefore, RNA sequencing was performed on RNA samples obtained from HBV-infected tree shrew tissue samples at the acute phase of infection (at 1, 3, and 21 days post-infection (dpi)) and at the chronic phase of infection (at 8 months post-infection). In mRNA-seq analysis, over 200 million reads per group were sequenced, with over 90% of the bases of all samples exceeding Q30 (Table <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>). Across all samples, 77 to 84% of the reads were mapped to the tree shrew genome. In total RNA-seq analysis, 88 to 126 million reads per sample were sequenced, with approximately 95% of the bases of all samples exceeding Q30. The percentages of total mapping reads of all samples were 86 to 91% (Table <xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table">5</xref>).<table-wrap id="Tab4"><label>Table 4</label><caption><p>mRNA-seq overview.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Sample</th><th>Total reads</th><th>% of &gt;= Q30 bases</th><th>Trimmed reads</th><th>Total mapped reads</th><th>% of total mapped reads</th><th>Unmapped reads</th><th>% of unmapped reads</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Uninfected tree shrew liver (#1)</td><td>51.46</td><td>91.12</td><td>49.70</td><td>40.02</td><td>80.53</td><td>9.68</td><td>19.47</td></tr><tr><td>Uninfected tree shrew liver (#2)</td><td>52.91</td><td>90.82</td><td>50.98</td><td>45.73</td><td>82.96</td><td>9.39</td><td>17.04</td></tr><tr><td>Uninfected tree shrew liver (#3)</td><td>57.20</td><td>90.99</td><td>55.12</td><td>40.86</td><td>80.15</td><td>10.12</td><td>19.85</td></tr><tr><td>Uninfected tree shrew liver (#4)</td><td>53.87</td><td>90.86</td><td>51.85</td><td>42.14</td><td>81.26</td><td>9.72</td><td>18.74</td></tr><tr><td>HBV-C 1 dpi tree shrew liver (#1)</td><td>94.47</td><td>90.76</td><td>91.16</td><td>76.55</td><td>83.97</td><td>14.61</td><td>16.03</td></tr><tr><td>HBV-C 1 dpi tree shrew liver (#2)</td><td>111.28</td><td>90.31</td><td>107.00</td><td>87.40</td><td>81.68</td><td>19.60</td><td>18.32</td></tr><tr><td>HBV-C 3 dpi tree shrew liver (#1)</td><td>93.80</td><td>90.60</td><td>90.49</td><td>72.73</td><td>80.37</td><td>17.76</td><td>19.63</td></tr><tr><td>HBV-C 3 dpi tree shrew liver (#2)</td><td>129.30</td><td>90.44</td><td>124.43</td><td>99.89</td><td>80.27</td><td>24.54</td><td>19.73</td></tr><tr><td>HBV-A 21 dpi tree shrew liver (#1)</td><td>200.98</td><td>90.15</td><td>191.47</td><td>149.06</td><td>77.85</td><td>42.41</td><td>22.15</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>Read values represent millions of reads.</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><table-wrap id="Tab5"><label>Table 5</label><caption><p>Total RNA-seq overview.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Sample</th><th>Total reads</th><th>% of &gt;= Q30 bases</th><th>Trimmed reads</th><th>Total mapped reads</th><th>% of total mapped reads</th><th>Unmapped reads</th><th>% of unmapped reads</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Uninfected tree shrew liver (#1)</td><td>117.38</td><td>94.87</td><td>115.39</td><td>100.37</td><td>86.99</td><td>15.02</td><td>13.01</td></tr><tr><td>Uninfected tree shrew liver (#2)</td><td>125.70</td><td>95.04</td><td>123.59</td><td>108.03</td><td>87.40</td><td>15.57</td><td>12.60</td></tr><tr><td>Uninfected tree shrew liver (#3)</td><td>92.43</td><td>94.74</td><td>90.28</td><td>82.01</td><td>90.84</td><td>8.27</td><td>9.16</td></tr><tr><td>Uninfected tree shrew liver (#4)</td><td>99.86</td><td>95.39</td><td>98.30</td><td>87.11</td><td>88.62</td><td>11.19</td><td>11.38</td></tr><tr><td>HBV-C 1 dpi tree shrew liver (#1)</td><td>106.45</td><td>95.33</td><td>104.75</td><td>92.07</td><td>87.90</td><td>12.68</td><td>12.10</td></tr><tr><td>HBV-C 1 dpi tree shrew liver (#2)</td><td>97.06</td><td>95.31</td><td>95.45</td><td>84.01</td><td>88.01</td><td>11.44</td><td>11.99</td></tr><tr><td>HBV-C 3 dpi tree shrew liver (#1)</td><td>99.51</td><td>95.51</td><td>97.87</td><td>85.30</td><td>87.15</td><td>12.57</td><td>12.85</td></tr><tr><td>HBV-C 3 dpi tree shrew liver (#2)</td><td>100.26</td><td>95.61</td><td>98.72</td><td>85.53</td><td>86.64</td><td>13.18</td><td>13.36</td></tr><tr><td>HBV-A 21 dpi tree shrew liver (#1)</td><td>94.93</td><td>95.57</td><td>93.48</td><td>80.42</td><td>86.02</td><td>13.07</td><td>13.98</td></tr><tr><td>Uninfected tree shrew spleen (mix; #1, #2, and #4)</td><td>91.34</td><td>95.43</td><td>89.69</td><td>79.00</td><td>88.09</td><td>10.69</td><td>11.91</td></tr><tr><td>HBV-C 1 and 3 dpi tree shrew spleen (mix; 1 dpi [#1, #2], 3 dpi [#2])</td><td>88.74</td><td>95.55</td><td>87.09</td><td>78.24</td><td>89.83</td><td>8.85</td><td>10.17</td></tr><tr><td>HBV-A 8 mpi tree shrew spleen (mix; #1, #2, and #3)</td><td>93.64</td><td>95.56</td><td>91.72</td><td>82.19</td><td>89.62</td><td>9.52</td><td>10.38</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>Read values represent millions of reads.</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></p>

Among 426 genes categorized (in the human protein atlas: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.proteinatlas.org">https://www.proteinatlas.org</ext-link>) as having “elevated expression in liver”, 366 genes were annotated in 1,766 transcripts from 117,687 transcripts not subjected to selection, and 274 genes (64.3%) with 290 transcripts from 12,612 selected transcripts were identified by our CDS selection criteria.</p>

The genes expressed in human liver were analyzed using the livers of chimeric mice harboring humanized livers. The expression levels of tree shrew transcripts (290 in total) that met the criteria correlated well with the expression levels of transcripts of the homologous human genes (274 genes) (R = 0.5597) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>).

      <title>Expression analysis of HBV-infected tree shrew</title>
      <p id="Par12">It is difficult to identify accurately when HBV patients become initially infected; therefore, host response at the initial stage of HBV infection remains poorly documented. Hence, to have more insight in this regard, we analyzed the transcriptome profile of the identified genes in the early stage of HBV infection in tree shrew. We infected tree shrews by intravenous injection with HBV genotype C and sacrificed animals at 1 or 3 dpi (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>). At 1 dpi, HBV viral loads were 1.0 × 10<sup>2</sup> to 2.2 × 10<sup>2</sup> copies/ml in serum samples, and 5.7 × 10<sup>0</sup> to 1.1 × 10<sup>1</sup> copies/μg liver DNA (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b,c</xref>). At 3 dpi, HBV viral loads were 4.2 × 10<sup>1</sup> to 1.8 × 10<sup>2</sup> copies/ml in serum samples, and 1.4 × 10<sup>0</sup> to 3.2 × 10<sup>0</sup> copies/μg liver DNA. No viral DNA was detected from the livers of two tree shrews at 1 dpi, and from one tree shrew at 3 dpi. HBV infections caused nominal but non-significant elevation of serum ALT levels in some tree shrews (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4d</xref>). Interestingly, abnormal architecture of liver-cell cords was observed at 3 dpi, and lymphocytic infiltration also was observed by histochemical analysis (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4e</xref>).<fig id="Fig4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>HBV infection in tree shrew.

      <p id="Par13">Transcriptome analysis showed that the number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) at 1 and 3 dpi were 35 and 28, respectively. To characterize the DEGs, we performed GO term analysis of the DEGs at each time point (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). The GO term characteristics of DEGs at 1 and 3 dpi were distinct. At 1 dpi, the GO terms of DEGs were primarily immune response-related (e.g., “Type I interferon signaling pathway” and “Regulation of inflammatory response”) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a</xref>). At 3 dpi, the GO terms of DEGs were mainly related to “Cholesterol biosynthetic process” and “Glycogen biosynthetic process” (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5b</xref>). These results implied that the primary immune response of tree shrew to HBV infection was attenuated rapidly (within 3 days).<fig id="Fig5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p>GO term analysis of differentially expressed genes in HBV-infected tree shrew at 1 dpi (<bold>a</bold>) and 3 dpi (<bold>b</bold>).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="41598_2019_48867_Fig5_HTML" id="d29e1881"/></fig></p>

    <title>Discussion</title>
    <p id="Par16">Recently, tree shrew has been widely used for various biological studies, including investigations of viral infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>, depression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>, the visual system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>, and so on. However, research tools (e.g., antibody, PCR system) are limited for the establishment of tree shrew as an experimental animal model. Although these tools are based on genomic information, some of the entire CDSs of genes still had not been completed. Even in cases for which the CDS had been determined, it remained difficult to determine how reliable that CDS was. In the present study, we combined whole-genome analysis with RNA sequencing data, and selected 12,612 genes for which the CDS seemed to be accurate. We then published these tree shrew genomic data as part of a publicly available tree shrew database.</p>
    <p id="Par17">Based on whole-genome analysis alone, it is difficult to predict the entire CDSs of a genome. Comparing the predicted sequences based on whole-genome analysis with actual cDNA sequences revealed that approximately half of the cloned sequences did not match the predicted sequences. This observation reflects, in part, how difficult it is to determine the sequences of long genes and those of genes that contain short exons. To improve the accuracy of predicted CDSs, we combined whole-genome analysis and RNA sequencing data. RNA sequencing reads were mapped to the tree shrew genome, enabling identification of the CDSs of individual genes. About 80% of the cDNA sequences predicted on the basis of the combination of whole-genome sequencing and RNA sequencing were identical to actual cloned gene sequences; the remaining 20% of the predicted cDNA sequences were not recovered as actual cDNA sequences, presumably reflecting the low level of expression of these genes under the conditions of our experiment. Since gene expression levels may differ in various organs and under other conditions, experiments to sequence the RNAs collected from other organs and under other conditions will be needed.</p>
    <p id="Par18">In the present study, we focused on tree shrew genes sharing high homology with orthologous human genes, and determined the CDSs of 12,612 genes. To validate the protein-coding genes identified in our analysis, we analyzed the expression of transcripts annotated as liver-specific genes. Expression of selected transcripts (i.e., those that met the stated criteria) in tree shrew liver showed better correlation with that of homologous human genes in humanized liver (R = 0.5597) than with that of excluded transcripts (i.e., those that did not meet these criteria) (R = 0.2923). These data suggested that CDSs selected by our criteria are more reliable than unselected CDSs. Of course, our selection is far from being perfect, given that we focused on the tree shrew genes sharing high sequence similarity with the corresponding human genes. We are currently performing an optimization of the criteria for transcript selection, with the expectation that this analysis will permit identification of tree shrew-specific genes.</p>
    <p id="Par19">In the present study, we constructed a tree shrew genome database (TupaiaBase: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://tupaiabase.org">http://tupaiabase.org</ext-link>). The first feature of our database is the quality of data. Complete BUSCOs of this study is 89.1%; thus, our database is thought to be based on high-quality data. The second feature of our database is that the database uses JBrowse for the visualization of genome annotations. JBrowse has been used extensively in other databases, including Mouse Genome Informatics (MGI; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.informatics.jax.org/">http://www.informatics.jax.org</ext-link>), Rat Genome Database (RGD; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://rgd.mcw.edu">https://rgd.mcw.edu</ext-link>), and FlyBase (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://flybase.org">https://flybase.org</ext-link>), and is known to be fast and easy to use. The third feature of our database is the availability of the CDSs. Cloned sequences and selected genes in this study are displayed, permitting the user to readily identify reliable CDSs. Though a tree shrew database (TreeshrewDB) is already available, these features of our tree shrew genome database (TupaiaBase) are expected to help facilitate advances in research in this organism. The utility of our database should extend the potential of tree shrew as an animal model in various research fields.</p>
    <p id="Par20">In practice, it is difficult to identify when HBV patients become initially infected, and thus the collection of samples from humans at the initial stage of HBV infection has not been possible. This shortcoming has precluded the determination of the host response in the early stages of HBV infection in humans. Tree shrew infected with HBV exhibits hepatitis that resembles human cases, and therefore is expected to serve as a useful tool for clarifying the host response to HBV infection. Indeed, by using the tree shrew model, we were able to perform a preliminary analysis of the dynamics of transcript accumulation in the initial phase of HBV infection. Kouwaki <italic>et al</italic>. also have shown that early-stage HBV infection induces hepatic interferon gamma expression in tree shrew<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. These results indicate that the tree shrew HBV infection model will be of great value in clarifying the early <italic>in vivo</italic> response to HBV infection in animals with intact immune systems.</p>
    <p id="Par21">The present study revealed that the expression of tree shrew genes related to the type I interferon signaling pathway is downregulated at 1 dpi. Our study also showed that genes encoding key factors (e.g., <italic>IFNB</italic>) known to be involved in the type I interferon response were not induced in the earliest stage of HBV infection of tree shrew. However, upregulation of <italic>SOCS3</italic> at 1 dpi was observed in our study, an observation consistent with a recent report that <italic>SOCS3</italic> is induced by HBx protein in human cell culture, thereby suppressing the type I interferon response<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. Although the upregulation of <italic>SOCS3</italic> expression has been detected in the liver of chronically HBV-infected patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>, the role and kinetics of <italic>SOCS3</italic> expression during the initial phase of HBV infection <italic>in vivo</italic> remains unknown. Our study suggests that upregulation of <italic>SOCS3</italic> may facilitate the initial propagation of HBV <italic>in vivo</italic>. Further studies using the tree shrew model are expected to elucidate the role of <italic>SOCS3</italic> in HBV infection and to reveal other key factors involved in the initial phases of HBV infection.</p>
    <p id="Par22">In conclusion, we have constructed a database that identifies tree shrew CDSs based on a combination of genome and RNA sequencing. To improve this database, we are planning to perform long-read sequencing to enhance recovery of the complete genome with the correct order; we will continue to incorporate the new sequencing data as part of this database. Since tree shrew is increasingly being used in various research fields, this database is expected to serve as a powerful tool for further development of the tree shrew model and thus for enhancement of associated research.</p>

      <title>Genome sequencing</title>
      <p id="Par26">A male four-year-old tree shrew was used for whole-genome sequencing. The whole-genome sequencing of tree shrew was performed by BGI (Shenzhen, China). Using a tree shrew DNA sample, libraries of different insert sizes (170 bp, 500 bp, 800 bp, 2 Kb, 5 Kb, 10 Kb, and 20 Kb) were constructed by standard Illumina library preparation protocols. The tree shrew genome was assembled from massive reads using software in the SOAPdenovo (Short Oligonucleotide Assembly Program; version 1.05)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup> package by the following steps. First, sequencing errors on raw reads were corrected based on K-mer frequencies using KmerFreq and Corrector. Then, contigs and scaffolds were built using the SOAPdenovo assembler. Finally, gaps were closed using GapCloser. To predict genes in the tree shrew genome, homology-based gene prediction and <italic>de novo</italic> gene prediction were performed. For the homology-based gene prediction, human (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>), gorilla (<italic>Gorilla gorilla</italic>), rhesus macaque (<italic>Macaca mulatta</italic>), lemur (<italic>Microcebus murinus</italic>), and gibbon (<italic>Nomascus leucogenys</italic>) proteins were mapped onto the tree shrew genome to define the putative genes. For <italic>de novo</italic> gene prediction, two <italic>de novo</italic> prediction programs (GENSCAN<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup> and Augustus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup> (version 2.5.5)) were used.

Animals were sacrificed at 1 dpi (n = 4), 3 dpi (n = 3), 21 dpi (n = 1), and 8 months post-infection (mpi) (n = 3). Animals at 1 and 3 dpi were used for RNA sequencing and transcriptome analysis.

Total RNA was purified using the AGPC and RNeasy kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). For mRNA sequencing, the mRNA in each total RNA sample was converted into a cDNA library using the TruSeq Standard mRNA prep kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA, United States). For total RNA sequencing, each RNA sample was converted into a cDNA library using the TruSeq Standard Total RNA prep kit (Illumina). These libraries then were sequenced using a HiSeq2000 sequencer (Ilumina). All reads were mapped to the tree shrew genome using TopHat (version 2.0.10)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup> with an option that enabled the identification of micro-exons (–microexon-search).

      <title>Identification of gene CDSs</title>
      <p id="Par33">To select only high-quality transcript data and determine the CDS of each gene, we used the following criteria for selection. (i) Both a start codon and a stop codon were present in the transcript sequence. (ii) The lengths of the presumed gene product and the corresponding orthologous human gene product differed by less than 10%. (iii) The length of the overlap between the presumed tree shrew gene sequence and the corresponding orthologous human gene sequence (as aligned by BLASTX with an option that set the maximum expectation value to 10<sup>−5</sup>) constituted a length of more than 50% of the presumed gene sequence.
