      <title>Abstract</title>
      <p>EpiSurf is a Web application for selecting viral populations of interest and then
analyzing how their amino acid changes are distributed along epitopes. Viral sequences are
searched within ViruSurf, which stores curated metadata and amino acid changes imported
from the most widely used deposition sources for viral databases (GenBank, COVID-19
Genomics UK (COG-UK) and Global initiative on sharing all influenza data (GISAID)).
Epitopes are searched within the open source Immune Epitope Database or directly proposed
by users by indicating their start and stop positions in the context of a given viral
protein. Amino acid changes of selected populations are joined with epitopes of interest;
a result table summarizes, for each epitope, statistics about the overlapping amino acid
changes and about the sequences carrying such alterations. The results may also be
inspected by the VirusViz Web application; epitope regions are highlighted within the
given viral protein, and changes can be comparatively inspected. For sequences mutated
within the epitope, we also offer a complete view of the distribution of amino acid
changes, optionally grouped by the location, collection date or lineage. Thanks to these
functionalities, EpiSurf supports the user-friendly testing of epitope conservancy within
selected populations of interest, which can be of utmost relevance for designing vaccines,
drugs or serological assays. EpiSurf is available at two endpoints.</p>

    <title>Introduction</title>
    <p>With the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic outbreak, unprecedented efforts have
been dedicated to the sampling and sequencing of the severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), with the objective of capturing and then studying SARS-CoV-2
variations and their effects. Leveraging on our previous experience on human
genomics-targeted computational systems (<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>), we have
directed our interest towards the integration, curation, search and analysis of viral
sequences, yielding several contributions: a conceptual model for describing viral sequences
with their metadata and variants (<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>), an integrated
search system for viral sequences (<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>), a data
visualization application (<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>) and a knowledge base for
studying variant effects (<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Capitalizing on the
above experiences and resources, we developed and hereby present a Web-based search
application for studying epitopes in the context of viral sequences that have been so far
deposited worldwide.</p>
    <p>Epitopes are strings of amino acid residues from a pathogen’s protein that can be
recognized by antibodies or B/T cell receptors, thus activating an immune response from the
host; in particular, epitopes available for the Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 are used in the
design of COVID-19 vaccines. For epitope-based vaccine design, it is important to study
their conservation; conversely, observing epitope variability has applications in disease
monitoring, diagnostic settings and drug design. We adopt the most basic conservancy measure
for an epitope (i.e. a region on a protein), based on the number of changed amino acid
residues with respect to the reference sequence of the virus species in the same position
range. ‘Conserved’ epitopes have a zero distance from the reference, whereas ‘modified’
epitopes exhibit at least one amino acid change.</p>
    <p>To date, the most relevant resource for epitopes employed by the research community is the
Immune Epitope Database (IEDB) (<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). It encompasses
immune epitope data of a large number of species, including antibody, T cell and major
histocompatibility complex (MHC) binding contexts associated with several diseases. EpiSurf
imports all epitopes available from IEDB; in addition, EpiSurf supports user-defined
epitopes, intended as position ranges on specific virus proteins.</p>
    <p>EpiSurf supports the search of viral sequences deposited on public platforms—released day
by day on GenBank, COG-UK and GISAID and then integrated within the ViruSurf platform;
relevant sequences can be extracted, thanks to a rich set of metadata information, including
the sampling location, collection and deposition date, sequence’s lineages and strains, and
submission laboratory. On top of this, EpiSurf provides several methods to intersect
selected sequences and selected epitopes, thereby integrating information about amino acid
changes and epitopes extracted from the largest and most popular data collections in the
world using their metadata. Lastly, the integration with the VirusViz tool allows
informative visualization of sequence variation in the specific epitopes’ locations.
Building up on our previously developed resources, EpiSurf offers a novel, fully
independent, integrated environment for evaluating conservancy of epitopes against
arbitrarily extracted viral populations, reflecting the spreading of viruses in time and
space and their genetic evolution.</p>
  </sec>
  <sec id="s2">
    <title>Comparison with existing systems</title>
    <p>Several tools for epitope prediction have been studied in the past (<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). The most used and well-known resource in this field is the suite of
IEDB (<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>), comprising a set of T Cell and B Cell
Epitope Prediction tools (see <ext-link xlink:href="http://tools.iedb.org/main/" ext-link-type="uri">http://tools.iedb.org/main/</ext-link>).</p>
    <p>For the specific case of SARS-CoV-2 (and closely related viruses), we report the following.
COVIEdb (<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>) targets pancoronavirus vaccine
development, by describing a database of potential B/T cell epitopes for SARS-CoV-2,
SARS-CoV, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV and RaTG13-CoV; database entries are
predicted by using tools hosted by IEDB, exploiting the similarity of other viruses [as
proposed by Grifoni <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> (<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>)].
Similar databases are provided in CoronaVIR (<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>), a
database of coronavirus virulent glycoproteins (DBCOVP) (<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>) and CoronaVR (<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). COVID miner (<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>) and COVID profiler (<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>) provide companion vaccine design tools, with a focus on prediction (the latter
also providing light integration with IEDB data).</p>
    <p>EpiSurf is not intended for epitope prediction. Instead, it may be labeled as a tool for
conservancy and population coverage analysis. IEDB curates a collection of tools (<ext-link xlink:href="http://tools.iedb.org/main/analysis-tools/" ext-link-type="uri">http://tools.iedb.org/main/analysis-tools/</ext-link>), used for a variety of detailed
analyses. Among these, EpiSurf is similar in spirit to the Epitope Conservancy Analysis
(ECA) tool (<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>); however, there the user must provide
the amino acid sequences of (i) all the epitopes to be tested and (ii) all the virus
sequences whose changes should be tracked, whereas EpiSurf offers a seamless integration
with all public sequences and variants currently available from GenBank, COG-UK and
GISAID.</p>
    <p>COVIDep (<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>) is an integrative effort more similar
in the approach to EpiSurf, as it joins IEDB epitopes with regularly updated GISAID
sequences. The proposed ‘Population coverage analysis’ is an interesting view providing
quantifications of ‘conservation’ and ‘population coverage’ for each epitope. However, the
provided epitopes are those that were predicted and experimentally derived (based on
SARS-CoV data) at the time of publication (May 2020) by the authors of the work. This
important exercise resulted into a total of 284 T cell epitopes and 58 B cell linear
epitopes. On the contrary, EpiSurf keeps its list of epitopes updated, now reaching 3690 T
cell epitopes, 1006 MHC Ligand epitopes and 1421 B cell epitopes—see <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. Comparatively, EpiSurf offers a scalable approach to epitope
conservancy analysis that is very useful as we expect that new sequences and epitopes will
be deposited for a long time. Moreover, the COVIDep resource provides much less freedom of
choosing metadata for sequences and epitopes, no possibility of fixing specific amino acid
changes, and no ways of analyzing in detail the sequences that mutate on the epitope.
EpiSurf, on the contrary, does offer all sequence metadata in its result table and
complements it with a table for understanding the breakdown of statistics over the different
metadata of the population (for both EpiSurf and EpiSurf-GISAID) as well as VirusViz
visualization functionalities (for EpiSurf).</p>
    <p>The Virus Pathogen Database and Analysis Resource (ViPR) (<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>) is another important tool that connects (both predicted and experimentally
derived) epitopes and proteins of sequences deposited in the GenBank, whereas no link to
GISAID is provided. EpiSurf is novel in that it offers several aggregations and simple
statistics on both GenBank and GISAID data.</p>
    <p>The COG-UK Mutation Explorer (COG-UK-ME) (<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>)
recently released an interface dedicated to only UK data and its variation (also in the
context of T cell epitopes reported by experimental studies).</p>
    <p><xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> summarizes the relevant aspects of the tools
that allow population conservancy and coverage analysis. Recently, they focused on
SARS-CoV-2 and human hosts; however, ViPR and IEDB ECA pre-existed, offering support to many
kinds of viruses. Only ViPR offers the possibility to select sub-populations of sequences at
the user’s preference. COG-UK-ME focuses on T cell epitopes. Sources for epitopes are
various: IEDB ECA only allows user input strings, whereas ViPR and EpiSurf enrich them with
the IEDB corpus of epitopes. COVIDep, ViPR and COG-UK-ME currently offer curated lists,
respectively, predicted from SARS-CoV, predicted with NetCTL (<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>) and manually extracted from experimental studies.</p>

    <p>For data visualization, EpiSurf provides a connection to VirusViz (<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>) (<ext-link xlink:href="http://gmql.eu/virusviz/" ext-link-type="uri">http://gmql.eu/virusviz/</ext-link>), a Web application for visualizing and exploring the
fully open source nucleotide and amino acid changes that are made available through search
services or autonomously provided as input from users. When VirusViz is opened starting from
an EpiSurf search, the tool visualizes a bar plot where the <italic toggle="yes">x</italic>-axis
represents the amino acid positions of a protein, bars’ heights represent the number of
sequences in the selected populations that feature a change in the bar’s position and
epitope position ranges are represented as blue vertical regions (see <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref> in Example 3).</p>

the sequences deposited to GenBank (<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>) and COG-UK
(<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). A dual database (<ext-link xlink:href="http://gmql.eu/virusurf_gisaid/" ext-link-type="uri">http://gmql.eu/virusurf_gisaid/</ext-link>)
stores relevant metadata and variation information of GISAID sequences (<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>).</p>

        <graphic xlink:href="baab059f1" position="float"/>
      </fig>
      <p>For both databases, the schemas are centered on the SEQUENCE, described by biological
metadata (VIRUS and HOSTSAMPLE), technological metadata (EXPERIMENTTYPE) and
organizational metadata (SEQUENCINGPROJECT). The ‘analytical perspective’ provides the
ANNOTATION, AMINOACIDVARIANT, NUCLEOTIDEVARIANT and VARIANTIMPACT tables.</p>
      <p>EpiSurf and EpiSurf-GISAID feature two novel databases, whose complete schema
descriptions are available at <ext-link xlink:href="https://github.com/DEIB-GECO/EpiSurf/wiki/Database-and-sources" ext-link-type="uri">https://github.com/DEIB-GECO/EpiSurf/wiki/Database-and-sources</ext-link>, pointing to
SchemaSpy (<ext-link xlink:href="http://schemaspy.org/" ext-link-type="uri">http://schemaspy.org/</ext-link>) documents. In the
following, we only detail the additions that were not present in (<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>):</p>
      <list list-type="order">
        <list-item>
          <p>The HOSTSPECIES table, a connector between the HOSTSAMPLE and the EPITOPE tables,
representing the identification of the animal species both involved in the extraction
of biological material to be sequenced and in the epitope design.</p>
        </list-item>
        <list-item>
          <p>The EPITOPE table, describing the epitopes extracted from IEDB, connected both to
HOSTSPECIES and to the VIRUS table. The core information is contained within the
‘epitope sequence’<italic toggle="yes">—</italic>the amino acid sequence of the epitope, starting
at position ‘epi_annotation_start’ and finishing at position ‘epi_annotation_stop’ of
the reference sequence of a given protein, referred as ‘protein_name’; the ‘is_linear’
attribute defines continuous (true) or discontinuous (false) epitopes, composed of
amino acid residues that may be located in different protein regions—brought together
by protein folding. We also report information on the experiments performed to
retrieve the epitope. Each epitope record in EpiSurf may correspond to multiple
records from IEDB (each assigned to one single experiment, i.e. assay). Therefore, the
following four fields can take multiple values:</p>
          <list list-type="bullet">
            <list-item>
              <p>‘assay’ indicates the target of the experiment [allowing values (‘T cell’, ‘B
cell’, ‘MHC ligand’)];</p>
            </list-item>
            <list-item>
              <p>‘assay_type’ indicates the outcome—considering possibly multiple experiments (we
have ‘positive’, ‘negative’ and ‘both’, when positive and negative outcomes were
included);</p>
            </list-item>
            <list-item>
              <p>‘hla_restriction’ (also referred to as ‘mhc allele’) indicates the list of the
class (e.g. ‘HLA Class I’) or lists of alleles (e.g. ‘HLA-B*35:01, HLA-B*15:01’)
to which the epitope is restricted—this is relevant only for T cell and MHC ligand
assays;</p>
            </list-item>
            <list-item>
              <p>‘mhc_class’ indicates the general classes of alleles provided in the previous
field (possible values are ‘I’, ‘II’ or ‘I,II’ if both Class I and II alleles are
considered).</p>
            </list-item>
          </list>
        </list-item>
        <list-item>
          <p>Finally, we add the ‘response_frequency_pos’: on IEDB this measure is defined as the
number of positively responded subjects (<italic toggle="yes">R</italic>) divided by the total
number of those tested (<italic toggle="yes">N</italic>), summed up by mapped epitopes; however, to
compensate for epitopes that are identified by a low number of assays, we employ a
corrected formula [proposed in (<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>)] resulting
as (<italic toggle="yes">R</italic>−√<italic toggle="yes">R</italic>)/<italic toggle="yes">N</italic>, where the importance
of corrections decreases as the number of assays increases.</p>
        </list-item>
        <list-item>
          <p>The EPITOPEFRAGMENT table, which contains the segments (identified by the
‘epi_fragment_id’) of nonlinear epitopes (each of which is contained within one
comprehensive epitope). In the case of linear epitopes, we store a unique fragment in
this table. The ‘epi_fragment_sequence’ contains the amino acid sequence of the single
fragment starting at ‘epi_frag_annotation_start’ and finishing at
‘epi_frag_annotation_stop’.</p>

        <title>Content imported from ViruSurf</title>
        <p>EpiSurf database is fueled by the same automatic import pipeline that frequently
extracts and processes sequences, metadata and variant information for populating the
ViruSurf database (<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Specifically, we extract
sequences and their metadata from COG-UK and GenBank, whereas we compute amino acid
changes according to the following steps: (i) for each virus species, selection of a
reference sequence and a set of annotations; (ii) for each sequence, computation of the
optimal global alignment to the reference by means of the Needleman–Wunsch (NW)
algorithm (<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>); (iii) identification of the
sub-sequences corresponding to the reference annotations; (iv) translation of coding
regions into their equivalent amino acid sequences; (v) alignment of translated amino
acid sequences to the corresponding reference amino acid sequences (also using NW) and
(vi) inference of amino acid changes. Thanks to a Data Connectivity Agreement with
GISAID, we have access to frequently updated information downloaded from the
EpiCoV<sup>TM</sup> database including, for each sequence, selected metadata and all
amino acid changes.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="s3-s2-s2">
        <title>Content imported from IEDB</title>
        <p>We regularly download and process experimental epitope sequences and their metadata.
The process is controlled by an automated pipeline that retrieves the DB exports of the
B cell, T cell, and MHC ligand in the form of CSV files from the IEDB Database Export
site (<ext-link xlink:href="https://www.iedb.org/database_export_v3.php" ext-link-type="uri">https://www.iedb.org/database_export_v3.php</ext-link>) at the section ‘CSV Metric
Export’. After extraction, each file is parsed as regular tabular data, which allows for
the easy selection of the relevant characteristics. Indeed, the attributes available in
our database are copied ‘as is’ from the origin, with the exception of attributes
regarding assays. As mentioned in the discussion of the EPITOPE table, the four
attributes ‘assay’, ‘assay_type’, ‘hla_restriction’ and
‘mhc_class’<italic toggle="yes">—</italic>concerning a single assay on IEDB—are concatenated in a
single epitope in EpiSurf. Similarly, the ‘response_frequency_pos’ is calculated as an
aggregation over all the positive assays that derived the epitope.</p>
        <p>The pipeline associates three foreign keys to each imported epitope: the ‘virus_id’,
the ‘protein_name’ and the ‘host_id’. The first two attributes are derived by directly
mapping the virus name and the UniProtID, respectively, to the ‘id’ of the organism in
the VIRUS table and to the product in the ANNOTATION table. The third attribute links an
epitope to a host in the table HOSTSPECIES. To make sure that this foreign key can be
set, before the import stage, we automatically update the hosts’ table by collecting
from the NCBI Taxonomy database the ‘name’ and ‘id’ of the species that are not already
available in ViruSurf. Finally, we generate one row inside the EPITOPEFRAGMENT table for
every epitope sequence, be it linear or non-linear, and link them through the key
‘epitope_id’ to the EPITOPE table. In this way, it is easy to access all epitope
sequences by a regular join of the two tables and selecting the
‘epi_fragment_sequence’.</p>

        <title>Quantitative description</title>
        <p><xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> provides a description of the current
EpiSurf content; for each virus we report the rank, the NCBI Taxonomy identifier/name
and the number of sequences included from each source. In the last four columns, we
provide the number of epitopes retrieved from IEDB for the indicated species. The total
number is broken down into three categories: T cell, B cell and MHC ligand epitopes. The
most substantial contribution in the database is provided by SARS-CoV-2 data; however,
the system works seamlessly also for SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, Ebola and dengue species. In
the future, additional viruses may be added with small changes in the configuration of
pipelines and no changes in the data representation and query engine.</p>

      <title>Data access optimization</title>
      <p>Several optimization steps were designed for allowing acceptable query performances. As
the most critical part of the system involves data on SARS-CoV-2 virus and a human host,
the data on epitopes and matching variants regarding this fraction of the database have
been precalculated into several materialized views, one for each of the 12 distinct
proteins in the system (i.e. ORF1a, ORF1ab, Spike, ORF3a, E, M, ORF6, ORF7a, ORF7b, ORF8,
N and ORF10) and 16 sub-proteins (from NSP1 to NSP16).</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="s3-s4">
      <title>System development and sustainability</title>
      <p>In terms of the software architecture, EpiSurf is organized as a Web application where
the back-end runs on a Flask (Python) server, and the front-end is implemented with the
Javascript Vue.js framework. The underlying relational database is built with PostgreSQL
(Version 10.17); continuous interactions with the database are handled with the Python
sqlalchemy library. The code is available on GitHub at <ext-link xlink:href="https://github.com/DEIB-GECO/EpiSurf/" ext-link-type="uri">https://github.com/DEIB-GECO/EpiSurf/</ext-link>.</p>
      <p>The objective of EpiSurf is to offer a concrete public endpoint for research on the
interplay of epitopes with current viral sequences; its sustainability depends on the
timely provision of both sequences and epitope inputs, as well as on the interplay with
the ViruSurf database and VirusViz visualization application. Sequence data are currently
updated on EpiSurf and EpiSurf-GISAID weekly; SARS-CoV-2 epitopes from IEDB are updated
with the same frequency. We also periodically consider other species (SARS-CoV, MERS,
dengue and Ebola).</p>

    <title>Results</title>
    <p>The web interface of EpiSurf is composed of four sections, numbered in <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref> (i) the menu bar, for accessing services, documentation and
predefined example queries; (ii) the search interface over sequence metadata attributes;
(iii) the search interface over epitopes, available in three modes (user-defined epitopes,
IEDB epitopes with—and without—the calculation of statistics on variants) and (iv) the
results section, showing epitopes with their metadata, counters and visualization options.
Users should select exactly one host organism and one virus (pre-selected options are ‘homo
sapiens’ and ‘SARSCoV-2’), as this is the default configuration for matching sequences with
epitopes. Interaction over (<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>) and (<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>) is carefully designed in the three modes, as the
underlying system builds complex queries that intersect the sequences resulting from (<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>) with the epitopes resulting from (<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>) by considering the amino acid changes exhibited by sequences within
given epitope ranges.</p>

      <caption>
        <p>Overview of the EpiSurf interface, divided into four parts (see black rectangles).
‘Part 1’ (Top bar) allows clearing all filters selected in the interface or selecting
predefined example queries. ‘Part 2’ (Sequence population search) is used for selecting
sequences of interest. SARS-CoV-2 and human host are pre-selected, whereas the ‘Florida’
location has been added as an example (see red rectangles). After metadata search, users
select between three different modes (squared in green): (1) Custom epitopes (shown in
detail in <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>); (2) Use IEDB epitopes without
variant counts; (3) Use IEDB epitopes with variant counts. For Parts 3 and 4 of this
figure, we assume the selection of Modes 2 or 3, whereas <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref> shows Parts 3 and 4 after selecting Mode 1. ‘Part 3’ (Epitope/Variant
search) enables selecting epitopes from IEDB. The Spike protein is pre-selected (but
users can easily change the choice of protein), whereas other conditions allow filtering
the epitopes by using metadata available in IEDB. As an example, we show the selection
of T cell assay, HLA-A*02:01 restriction and a position range covering the receptor
binding domain (<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>)—see red rectangles. Finally,
‘Part 4’ (Result visualization) provides a table describing selected epitopes, further
vertically decomposed into three areas (shown in blue): ‘Area 1’ includes a number of
buttons to open the results within the IEDB page, VirusViz (considering only sequences
mutated on the epitope range or all the ones in the population selected in Part 2);
‘Area 2’ includes sortable and adjustable metadata about epitopes; and ‘Area 3’ is
present only in Mode 3 and includes counters that define the conservancy of the epitope
in the population of interest. The columns of the table are customizable and the full
table can be conveniently downloaded as a CSV file. The two most relevant counts in the
search, i.e. the number of sequences and of epitopes, are provided at the bottom right
corner of the web page.</p>

      <title>Sequence population search</title>
      <p>The Metadata search section is organized in four parts: ‘Virus’ and ‘Host Organism’ (from
the ‘biological’ perspective of the database schema), and ‘Technology’ and ‘Organization’
(from the corresponding perspectives). It includes attributes that are present in most of
the sources, described by an information tab that is opened by clicking on grey circles;
values can be selected using drop-down menus. At the side of each value, we report the
number of sequences in the repository with that value. The user can select the desired
sequence population by entering values from all the drop-down menus; the result is the set
of sequences matching all the filters. For numerical fields (age, length, GC% and
<italic toggle="yes">N</italic>%), the user must specify a range between a minimum and maximum value;
in addition, the user can check the Not Defined (N/D) flag, thereby including in the
result those sequences having an unknown value. Similarly, ranges of collection and
submission dates can be selected using calendar-like drop-down components, also supporting
the N/D flag.</p>

    <sec id="s4-s2">
      <title>Epitope search</title>
      <p>Interaction over epitope data can be conducted using three different modes, respectively,
for inputting user-defined epitopes, for extracting epitopes as they are imported from
IEDB and for associating to those epitope statistics computed over the mutated sequences
of the database. We detail the three scenarios in the following.</p>
      <sec id="s4-s2-s1">
        <title>Mode 1: custom epitopes</title>
        <p>This mode is particularly useful in the context of B cell epitopes, as these can be
examined regardless of the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) restriction on the targeted
population. The user is provided with a panel, shown in <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>, for defining candidate epitopes by providing its name, a specific
protein on the virus and a position range (possibly discontinuous) on the protein. The
epitope may be added to the list as is; in this case, the statistics will be computed
over the full sequence population selected with the Metadata search.</p>
        <fig position="float" id="F3" fig-type="figure">
          <label>Figure 3.</label>
          <caption>
            <p>Epitope definition panels in the ‘Custom Epitope’ Mode 1, where users can input
their defined epitopes, inserting a name, the protein and range (or collection of
ranges, when the proposed epitope is nonlinear). In addition, the user can
optionally add an amino acid condition for restricting the population selected in
the Sequence Population Search panel (see <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure
2</xref>) to the viruses carrying a specific amino acid change. Once created,
epitopes are added to a list, displayed on the page; each epitope information can be
inspected by using the MORE INFO button, updated with the REFRESH button, modified
with the RELOAD button or removed with the DELETE button. Epitopes can be downloaded
and then uploaded during a different session of the EpiSurf use. The bottom table
shows the results of the epitope design session, as further described in Example 1
of the Use Cases section.</p>
          </caption>
          <graphic xlink:href="baab059f3" position="float"/>
        </fig>
        <p>Optionally, the user may select an additional condition on one amino acid change, with
the purpose of instructing the system to compute statistics over the fraction of the
selected population that carries the amino acid change. The panel allows the selection
of a specific protein, a range of coordinates, a type of variation (insertion, deletion
or substitution), an original amino acid residue and the corresponding alternative
residue. The filter selection may be approved (ADD), deleted for choosing alternative
ones (CLEAR) or deleted for removing the entire amino-acid-related condition (CLEAR and
CLOSE).</p>
        <p>The choice of amino acid filters is supported by a practical add-on triggered by the
‘Analyze Substitutions’ button, which allows the inspection of the characteristics of a
specific replacement from the original into an alternative amino acid. Each involved
(source or target) residue is characterized by a series of structural categorical
properties (such as polarity, charge and flexibility) and of numerical properties (e.g.
molecular weight and hydrophobicity); the pair of residues involved in the change is
associated to a measure of its impact (Grantham distance (<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>)); a threshold on impact maps a change into radical or
conservative categories.</p>
        <p>After addition, the new epitope is inserted in a list of user-defined epitopes, which
are presented by providing summary information, including its name, creation and refresh
date, protein and position range, and virus/host taxon name and number of mutated
sequences and of variants. Current epitopes in the list can be downloaded as a JSON
file, thereby supporting the possibility of reloading specific files representing the
status of saved interaction with EpiSurf; in this way, users may organize and manage the
information collected about user-defined epitopes through many sessions of EpiSurf
use.</p>
        <p>Out of the current epitope list, users may read more information on the epitope (MORE
INFO); refresh its counters (REFRESH)—this option is typically used after uploading an
external JSON file as discussed above; reload all the values (originally used to create
that epitope) into the drop-down menus of the sequence and epitope search panels
(RELOAD)—this option facilitates the creation of a new epitope with different
coordinates or for testing its conservancy on a different underlying population; and
finally delete the element from the list (DELETE).</p>
        <p>The result table stores all the relevant information on the defined epitopes connecting
them with statistics on the sequences mutated on each epitope’s range. The table can be
downloaded for subsequent data analysis as a CSV file. The last five columns of the
table describe (i) ‘NUM SEQ POPULATION’: the number of sequences available in the
population where the epitope has been tested in EpiSurf (i.e. matching the filters in
the Metadata and Amino Acid Condition columns); (ii) ‘NUM MUT SEQ’: the number of
sequences in the selected population that has at least one amino acid change exactly
matching with the epitope position range; (iii) ‘TOT MUT’: the number of total amino
acid changes exhibited by the full population of sequences (note that any insertion
counts for one); (iv) ‘MUTATED FREQ’: the ratio of total variants (iii) over the number
of mutated sequences (ii) and (v) ‘MUTATED SEQ RATIO’: the ratio of mutated sequences
(ii) over the total of the selected population (i). When epitopes have been defined also
using an amino acid condition, Counters (ii) and (iii) are computed by considering the
fraction of the population that exhibits the specific selected amino acid condition.</p>
        <p>By clicking on the ‘NUM MUT SEQ’ number, the list of mutated sequences with their
metadata is shown in a table. From here, EpiSurf users may invoke VirusViz that will be
opened on a variant distribution that considers all the mutated sequences and highlights
the chosen epitope. By clicking on the ‘TOT MUT’ number, the user will open a new panel
called ‘Epitope mutation statistics’, where the number of mutated sequences can be
observed in a custom breakdown, grouping by several attributes concerning location,
collection time and phylogenetic classification methods. A table is generated providing,
for each specific amino acid change in a row, the number of sequences exhibiting such a
change in each formed group.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="s4-s2-s2">
        <title>Mode 2: IEDB epitopes without variant count</title>
        <p>Modes 2 and 3 take advantage of the epitopes publicly deposited to IEDB. In both modes,
the user can select epitopes by using seven different drop-down menus, representing
metadata attributes of epitopes, extracted from IEDB: the protein, the type of
experiment performed to recognize the epitope, the presence of specific HLA
restrictions, if it is linear or discontinuous, the allowed range of corrected response
frequency, a range of coordinates (i.e. all epitopes overlapping with the coordinate
range are selected) and the specific epitope identifier within IEDB. The selection
condition is determined as a conjunction of the filters selected in each drop-down menu;
the protein and position range accept a single value as a filter and the other
attributes accommodate multiple values (intended in disjunction).</p>
        <p>The results in the bottom panel are in a tabular format; each row of the table
represents one epitope, with links that refer it back to IEDB pages and relevant
metadata (columns can be sorted and selected/deselected); the full table can be
downloaded as a CSV file. VirusViz may be invoked on (i) the full population of
sequences and all epitopes in the results (using the button at the top of the table) and
(ii) the full population of sequences and one specific epitope (using the button on the
epitope’s row). In both cases, users should invoke the visualizer after selecting
populations of small size.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="s4-s2-s3">
        <title>Mode 3: IEDB epitopes with variant count</title>
        <p>This mode adds to Mode 2 the computation of statistics. It is the most sophisticated
use of EpiSurf and requires a heavier computational load on the back-end (therefore, in
addition to selecting small populations, users are also suggested to select a small
number of epitopes). The specific feature introduced by this mode is the addition of an
amino acid filter, which includes a variant position, type, original and alternative
amino acid residue; its effect is to restrict the calculation of the four statistics
only to sequences that exhibit matching amino acid changes. Changes may be chosen only
among positions that are allowed by the previously set position range filter. As in Mode
1, we provide the ‘Analyze Substitutions’ functionality to aid users in evaluating the
characteristics of amino acid replacements.</p>
        <p>As in Mode 2, the result table provides links to IEDB or to invoke VirusViz and entries
describing metadata from IEDB; in addition, as in Mode 1, the result table provides in
the last four entries a quantitative description of sequence changes over each epitope:
(i) ‘NUM MUT SEQ’: the number of sequences in the selected population that exhibits at
least one amino acid change within the epitope position range; (ii) ‘TOT MUT’: the
number of total amino acid changes exhibited by the full population of sequences; (iii)
‘MUT FREQ’: the ratio of total variants (ii) over the number of mutated sequences (i)
and (iv) ‘MUT SEQ RATIO’: the ratio of mutated sequences (i) over the total of the
selected population.</p>
        <p>For this mode, we have designed a mechanism that ensures that users carefully select
epitopes to be intersected with the population of interest. Indeed, while for B cell
epitopes no attention is needed w.r.t. alleles expressed in the population, much concern
should be dedicated when T cell or MHC ligand epitopes are targeted. In these cases, we
recommend considering epitopes with a high response frequency, by setting a
threshold—whose value was suggested by experts to be at least 0.2—using the response
frequency provided by IEDB. We opted to use this threshold with the corrected formula
proposed in (<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>), being the threshold even more
conservative in this case. Besides this, users should consider the percentages of ‘MUT
SEQ RATIO’ with care, ensuring that the HLA restriction is appropriate for the observed
population [by checking suitable population allele databases, e.g. the Allele Frequency
Net Database (<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>)]. Note that we have assigned a
color code to support users in understanding how much they can rely on the observed
statistics:</p>

          <list-item>
            <p>‘green’ denotes epitopes that have been derived by B cell assays and/or by T

          <list-item>
            <p>‘orange’ denotes epitopes that have been derived by reliable assays (i.e. B cell
assays or T cell/MHC ligand assays with response frequency ≥ 0.2) but also by less
reliable assays (i.e. T cell/MHC ligand assays with a response

      <title>GISAID-specific EpiSurf</title>
      <p>EpiSurf presents a version that is specific for the data imported from GISAID, as the
data agreement does not allow merging GISAID information with information from other
sources. The GISAID version has a panel for population selection offering restricted
options, otherwise Modes 1, 2, and 3 are available with no change, except that VirusViz
buttons are not available. Of course, since amino acid variants are sourced from different
databases, epitope mapping to amino acid variants produces different counts in the two
systems.</p>

      <title>Example 1</title>
      <p> Amrun <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> (<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>) present four
different immunodominant B cell assay epitopes, to be used as highly specific and
sensitive serological diagnostic targets, i.e. to test for the presence of the virus in
patients potentially exposed to SARS-CoV-2. The candidate epitopes are named S14P5, S20P2
and S21P2 on the Spike protein, and N4P5 on the N protein. In their study (<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>), authors studied the conservation of these epitopes
across 17 000 SARS-CoV-2 sequences publicly available at the time of writing. They
reported low rate of potential amino acid changes over the epitopes.</p>
      <p>By using Mode 1 of EpiSurf (Custom Epitopes), it is possible to replicate such epitopes
as ranges of positions on the proteins, respectively, on [553–570], [769–786] and
[809–826] on Spike and [153–170] on N. These may be checked, for instance, against the
EpiSurf sequence population from the USA, of about 205 000 sequences as of 9 May 2021.
<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref> shows a particular snapshot of the
analysis session where the user has already inserted all four epitopes. See the third red
rectangle framing the user-defined epitopes, where—for brevity—we only show the card
produced for the first S14P5 epitope. When all four have been inserted, the user will be
provided with the results framed by the green rectangle (<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). It is worth noting that the first epitope has a high ratio of altered
sequences, i.e. 25.1%. The user may be interested in inspecting the breakdown of such a
consistent set of sequences. By clicking on the number of total amino acid changes (i.e.
‘TOT MUT’), we open the ‘Epitope mutation statistics’ functionality. We may group by the
country attribute, thereby obtaining a table that, for each amino acid change, reports the
total of sequences exhibiting such changes, and the breakdown of such an amount by
‘country’. Through sorting by descending total count, we observe that the Spike A570D
position is the most commonly mutated one. We also check the most impacted US states
(grouping by the attribute ‘region’), which are Florida, Minnesota and Michigan. An
alternative grouping can be performed on ‘lineage’, highlighting that the sequences with
this mutation are almost always assigned to the B.1.1.7 lineage, corresponding to the
Variant of Concern [first defined on a Virological.org post in December 2020 (<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>)]. We can make our conservancy analysis more
specific by adding new epitopes to our list, tested against smaller populations; in <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>, Result section, box (<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>), we have created the candidate epitopes S14P5-USA-FL, S14P5-USA-MN
and S14P5-USAMI. In the ‘MUT SEQ RATIO’ column, we observe that Minnesota (MN) and
Michigan (MI) have a higher incidence of mutations on this epitope.</p>
      <p>We then focus on N4P5 [reported in (<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>) as the
most stable epitope out of the four]. In our knowledge base [a corpus of variants’
annotations regarding their increased/decreased effects on
kinetics/epidemiology/immunology levels, obtained through a systematic search of the
published or preprint literature (<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>)], we find three
amino acid changes falling within the scope of this epitope (namely, A156S, L161F and
P168S); it has been claimed that they may lower the protein stability and modify the
protein flexibility (<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). Due to these changes,
there is the possibility that the specificity and sensitivity of serological tests for
COVID-19 diagnosis may be impacted (leading to false negatives) (<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). In <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>, in the first red
box, we show how we insert the custom epitope condition. In the second red box, we input
an amino acid condition, N protein, 168–168 position range for a substitution for P
(Proline) to S (Serine). By adding this condition, we are instructing the system to
compute statistics only over the fraction of the selected population (all SARS-CoV-2,
human host sequences in this example) that carry the specified amino acid change. In the
Result section, green box (<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>), we observe that the
mutated sequence ratios for the N4P5 epitope over the three defined populations are quite
low (below 0.5%). Note that, if the ‘MUT FREQ’ is close to 1—when one of these three
changes is present—no other change is carried within the epitope scope. Overall, the
impacts on the epitope are minimal but attention should be paid, and further
investigations are needed to proceed with its use for serologic assays.</p>

      <title>Example 2</title>
      <p>Aiming to pave the way for designing novel vaccine candidates, Rakib
<italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> (<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>) propose to focus on
epitopes located along the nucleocapsid (N) protein, especially for its high conservancy
and dominant/long-lasting immune response [previously reported against SARS-CoV (<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>) and infectious bronchitis virus (<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>)]. From an immunological point of view, vaccine
development has historically relied mostly on B cell immunity, but recent discoveries
(<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>) revealed that T cell epitopes are also
promising, leading to a more long-lasting immune response mediated by CD8+ T cells (thus
recognizing viral peptides in the MHC class I area). By using EpiSurf in its Mode 2, we
may perform a search on the updated corpus of IEDB deposited epitopes and then test their
conservancy on selected populations. Drop-down menus may be employed to select epitopes on
the ‘protein = N (nucleocapsid phosphoprotein)’, with ‘assay type = T cell’ and ‘hla
restriction = HLA class I’. We then recommend selecting a high response frequency for
positive assays (at least 0.2). Alternatively, one could select specific alleles from the
‘hla restriction’ menu and test epitopes only on a population of sequences from hosts that
exhibit such alleles (in a statistically significant way).</p>
      <p>Suppose we are observing the Italian population of sequences from the Campania region (to
date, most Italian sequences were sequenced here and GISAID depositions are about 15 000,
as of 9 May 2021). From the Allele Frequency Net Database web portal (<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>), we gather that the most present (above a 40%
threshold) alleles in the ‘Italy South Campania Region’ are DRB1*11 (49.6%), A*02 (43.0%)
and C*07 (41.7%). In EpiSurf, we find no occurrence of T cell assay epitopes restricted to
HLA-DBR1*11. However, we do find 20 epitopes restricted to HLA-A*02 and 7 epitopes
restricted to HLA-C*07 (with two different subtypes). For observing the distribution of
mutations over such epitopes we switch to Mode 3, which preserves our previous selections.
By applying the epitope search, we obtain the table shown in <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>, where we appreciate the total of 25 epitopes (note that two of these,
IEDB 1 309 129 and 1 309 136, match multiple HLA restriction filter conditions). Out of
these, 13 of them exhibit a green mark, as their response frequency (for positive assays)
is above the 0.2 threshold, whereas the other 12 show a red mark, meaning that users
should carefully consider the statistics, as they may not be meaningful in the selected
population. We also note that the most mutated epitope (ID 2802) has almost 4900 amino
acid changes in the Campania population, most of which are of type L139F [also reported to
modify protein flexibility and stability (<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>)].</p>

      <title>Example 3</title>
      <p>In the last months of 2020, there has been interest in studying seven independent
lineages circulating in the USA all having a change in the Glutamine (Q) amino acid at
position 677 of the Spike protein. These all seemed to have originated and spread in the
last few months (<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). Q at 677 is more commonly
mutated into Histidine (H)—leading to a non-radical change—however, in a considerable
number of cases (predominantly in Texas), the change to Proline (P) has been observed,
being this a radical change (Grantham distance = 76).</p>
      <p>According to Hodcroft <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> (<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>), this change should be monitored as 677 is nearby to—although outside of—the
furin binding pocket (polybasic site), important for the S1/S2 cleavage; therefore,
hypothetically the presence of Proline in this precise spot could influence the cleavage
of S1/S2. As this change is radical, with potentially interesting effects and
geographically quite delimited, it serves as a good candidate to be monitored within
EpiSurf. From our system, we choose the full sequence population of Texas (about 12 000
sequences, as of 9 May 2021), then—using Mode 3—we select epitopes located on the Spike
protein that overlap the 677 position (obtaining 24 results) and finally, we set the
condition of one substitution at position 677 into the Proline (P) alternative residue. As
a result, we observe that all 24 epitopes exhibit 369 sequences where such change occurs.
This set of sequences may be further inspected by clicking on any number in the
<italic toggle="yes">TOT MUT</italic> column. The shown ‘Epitope mutation statistics’ functionality
can be employed to group by lineage and collection month to observe—as shown in <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>—that all such sequences belong to lineage
B.1.596 and that the Q677P change has been observed mostly between January and March 2021.
A user may further investigate the selected Texas population by, for example, clicking on
the ‘VirusViz All Epitopes’ button. The tool opens directly on the distribution of amino
acid variants of the Spike protein. From the left menu ‘Highlight region’, users may
select epitopes one at a time, thereby highlighting a specific position range in the bar
plot. Note that immediately from the first visualization it is evident that 34% of the
population exhibits the P681H amino acid change, feared for impacting the antibody
recognition of linear SARS-CoV-2 epitopes, reducing Class 3 antibody recognition [even if
this was only suggested in the non-peer reviewed literature (<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>) so far]. The user may then want to remove all epitopes that include
this critical position. This may be achieved in the ‘Regions’ page, where epitopes are
presented in the form of a list and can be dropped. Only two remain: IEDB ID 1 313 281
(position range 655–679) and 1 310 485 (position range 666–680). In the Population page,
the user may observe that there has been a considerable number of depositions of sequences
collected since 2021. It may be interesting to observe how the variant distributions
behave (in terms of percentages) in the initial months of this year. By building different
groups for the first 4 months of 2021, we produce a comparative visualization shown in
<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>. Here we observe that the mutation Q677P
decreases its occurrences in percentage, therefore diminishing the concerns on its
possible effects on epitopes designed in this position range.</p>

      <title>Example 4</title>
      <p>The focus of EpiSurf is on SARS-CoV-2; however, variation over epitopes of other viral
species may be analyzed. Chen <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> (<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>) generated 12 monoclonal antibodies as experimental candidates to develop
antibodies neutralizing Dengue Virus serotype 1 (DENV-1). They define an epitope on the
domain III of the DENV-1 E protein, spanning from residues 346 and 360 with the sequence
TQNGRLITANPIVTD, deemed as a highly conserved region among different genotypes of
DENV-1.</p>
      <p>The conservation of the epitope can be checked against EpiSurf sequences. We restrict our
search to Dengue Virus 1 sequences deposited in the GenBank that were collected from human
hosts before October 2017 (matching the publication date of the work from Chen
<italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>). We also select only complete sequences to ensure the accuracy
of the variation calling algorithm, thus retrieving a total of 1665 sequences. By using
Mode 1 of EpiSurf (Custom Epitopes), we then build the target epitope on the E protein
with the range 346–360. As a result, we observe that 64 of the sequences exhibit at least
one mutation (‘MUT FREQ’ of 1.06), representing the 3.84% of the total set (‘MUT SEQ
RATIO’).</p>
      <p>Chen <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> perform multiple sequence alignment of residues
corresponding to the proposed epitope, thereby showing that it contains three conserved
residues, namely G349, R350 and P356. By using the ‘Epitope mutation statistics’ panel, we
can check if any mutation occurs at these specific positions; specifically, we find only
one sequence with the G349D substitution and one with the P356H substitution. We can also
confirm the presence of L351V, an additional amino acid substitution mentioned by Chen
<italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, appearing in two sequences. Incidentally, we notice that the
mutation T346I, not mentioned in their work, is the most present in the dataset (29
sequences) and could thus be further investigated.</p>

    <title>Discussion</title>
    <p> During 2020 and the beginning of 2021, fueled by the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemics,
huge interest has been focused on studying epitopes, parts of the SARS-CoV-2 sequence that
can be recognized by vaccines, drugs and serological tests. For epitopes, IEDB is recognized
as the most important, fully public repository, as of today collecting about 5000 epitopes
of SARS-CoV-2 (along with many other viruses), well-described by means of attributes and
search panels.</p>
    <p>Several computational tools are used for supporting the prediction of epitopes. Our EpiSurf
system covers a different need, as it provides a flexible interface for testing their
conservancy, measured as the presence/absence of amino acid changes over epitope sequences.
The unique aspect of EpiSurf is the ability to perform such conservancy testing by
intersecting epitopes of interest, extracted by means of queries in the IEDB, against the
amino acid changes that are present in arbitrarily selected viral sequences, e.g. by
lineage, location or time of sequence collection. Such queries upon viral sequences can also
be used against custom epitopes, freely entered by EpiSurf users.</p>
    <p>Extensive analytical and visual support is offered to the users, including aggregations by
metadata, statistics of mutated sequences and distribution plots (through our connection to
VirusViz). EpiSurf aims to be a solid companion tool for researchers designing epitopes that
need to rely on the big corpus of sequences available online.</p>
