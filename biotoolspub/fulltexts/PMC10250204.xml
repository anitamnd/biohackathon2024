      <title>Abstract</title>
      <p>Although splicing occurs largely co-transcriptionally, the order by which introns are removed does not necessarily follow the order in which they are transcribed. Whereas several genomic features are known to influence whether or not an intron is spliced before its downstream neighbor, multiple questions related to adjacent introns' splicing order (AISO) remain unanswered. Here, we present <italic toggle="yes">Insplico</italic>, the first standalone software for quantifying AISO that works with both short and long read sequencing technologies. We first demonstrate its applicability and effectiveness using simulated reads and by recapitulating previously reported AISO patterns, which unveiled overlooked biases associated with long read sequencing. We next show that AISO around individual exons is remarkably constant across cell and tissue types and even upon major spliceosomal disruption, and it is evolutionarily conserved between human and mouse brains. We also establish a set of universal features associated with AISO patterns across various animal and plant species. Finally, we used <italic toggle="yes">Insplico</italic> to investigate AISO in the context of tissue-specific exons, particularly focusing on SRRM4-dependent microexons. We found that the majority of such microexons have non-canonical AISO, in which the downstream intron is spliced first, and we suggest two potential modes of SRRM4 regulation of microexons related to their AISO and various splicing-related features. <italic toggle="yes">Insplico</italic> is available on gitlab.com/aghr/insplico.</p>

    <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
    <p>Precursor mRNA (pre-mRNA) splicing is the processing step in the gene expression pathway that involves the removal of intronic sequences and ligation of exonic sequences to form mature RNAs (mRNAs). This process is carried out by the spliceosome, a complex molecular machinery that needs to be re-assembled <italic toggle="yes">de novo</italic> for every splicing reaction. By differentially selecting competing splice sites in each pre-mRNA molecule, the spliceosome can give rise to multiple mRNA isoforms per gene, a process referred to as alternative splicing. These alternative choices of splice sites are determined by intronic and exonic <italic toggle="yes">cis</italic>-acting elements and auxiliary proteins known as RNA binding proteins (RBPs). Some <italic toggle="yes">trans</italic>-acting factors have a tissue-specific expression and, therefore, contribute to the establishment of splicing regulatory networks responsible for cell specialization, particularly in the nervous system (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). The different steps of the gene expression pathway, including transcription itself, are interconnected and can form additional layers of (alternative) splicing regulation (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2–4</xref>).</p>
    <p>It is now well established in different species that the vast majority of genes undergo co-transcriptional splicing, i.e. splicing takes place as transcription is still occurring or shortly after (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5–8</xref>). However, this does not necessarily imply that splicing always follows the order in which introns are transcribed, as initially thought (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Single-gene studies as well as more recent genome-wide analyses have confirmed that intron splicing order does not always occur linearly following the order of transcription (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10–16</xref>). In fact, when considering the average internal exon as reference, the downstream intron is spliced before the upstream one nearly as often as the opposite (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). In this study, we refer to the relative order of splicing of the two introns around an internal exon of interest as Adjacent Introns' Splicing Order (AISO).</p>
    <p>Considering that early spliceosomal components are recruited at the time of transcription, multiple variables may influence AISO. As in alternative splicing regulation, both <italic toggle="yes">cis</italic>-acting elements – including strength of the splice sites and polypyrimidine tract, distance from branch point to the 3′ splice site (3′ ss), and other genomic features such as the size of the introns/exons and GC content (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>)—and <italic toggle="yes">trans</italic>-acting factors (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>), as well transcription kinetics (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17–19</xref>) have been reported to affect AISO. Importantly, it is known that AISO can impact splicing decisions. For instance, mutations in an acceptor splice site in the <italic toggle="yes">COL5A1</italic> gene leads to changes in AISO, which affect the inclusion rate of the neighboring exons (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). Moreover, the exon junction complex (EJC), deposited upon splicing completion, has been shown to impact the splice site selection in subsequent splicing events (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>), providing one possible mechanism by which AISO can modulate splicing decisions. However, the converse, i.e. whether (alternative) splicing regulation across tissues or conditions affects AISO, remains unknown. Similarly, how alternative splicing regulation through specific <italic toggle="yes">trans</italic>-acting factors relates to AISO is poorly understood.</p>
    <p>To investigate AISO across different cell and tissue types as well as regulatory conditions, and to facilitate further research on this topic, we developed <italic toggle="yes">Insplico</italic>, the first standalone software to investigate AISO applicable to both short and long RNA sequencing reads. We demonstrated its robustness and effectiveness using simulated RNA-seq data and by comparing it to previous studies on AISO (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>), which recapitulated previous findings and revealed unappreciated biases introduced by long read sequencing. Next, we compared AISO in different cell and tissue types from multiple species (mammals, non-vertebrate model organisms and plants), identifying universal genomic features associated with different modes of AISO and showing that AISO is highly constant across cell and tissue types within a given species. Finally, we explored AISO for introns flanking microexons whose inclusion is dependent on SRRM4 expression, and found two subsets of microexons with opposite AISO patterns and seemingly distinct features, suggesting two distinct modes of regulation.</p>

      <title><italic toggle="yes">Insplico</italic>: input data generation and exon definition</title>
      <p><italic toggle="yes">Insplico</italic> takes as input mapped RNA-seq reads in BAM format. These must have been aligned with a splice-aware mapper, e.g. STAR or HISAT2 for short reads, or with Minimap2 for ONT/PacBio long reads. Furthermore, <italic toggle="yes">Insplico</italic> needs a tab-separated table defining the exons for which read statistics are desired. Exons are defined by their start and end coordinates, strand, and the end/start coordinate(s) of their upstream/downstream neighbor exons, respectively. More details on this exon-defining table can be found on gitlab.com/aghr/insplico. In addition, a script (<italic toggle="yes">extract_exons_from_gtf.pl</italic>) that allows users to create such a suitable table from a gene annotation file in GTF format is provided. This script clusters overlapping exons from several transcripts of the same gene into complex exon entities with potentially several start and end coordinates (following the logic of <italic toggle="yes">vast-tools</italic> (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>)) and it implements a heuristic to identify intron-retention events that are not considered true exons. In addition, it identifies and assigns an exon type to each exon (Figure <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>), e.g. <italic toggle="yes">sfrst</italic> (second first), if the exon is the second-first exon in all transcripts where it appears, <italic toggle="yes">slst</italic> (second last), if it is always the second-last exon, or <italic toggle="yes">diverse</italic> if it appears in different positions in different transcripts. From the exon table, <italic toggle="yes">Insplico</italic> extracts for each exon the set of start coordinates, the set of end coordinates, the strand, and the upstream and downstream intron regions. These regions are defined by the intronic region between the exon and its direct upstream and downstream neighbor exons while considering the maximal extent of these exons. Importantly, to reduce potential biases stemming from upstream and downstream introns of different lengths, <italic toggle="yes">Insplico</italic> utilizes as effective length of both introns the length of the shorter intron. For instance, if the upstream intron is 500 nts and the downstream one is 3000 nts, only the neighboring 500 nts for both introns are considered by <italic toggle="yes">Insplico</italic>. This approach effectively results in no biases associated with F<italic toggle="yes">upfi</italic> quantifications for different intron lengths, as shown by simulated RNA-seq data (Figure <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2F</xref>, G).</p>

      <title><italic toggle="yes">Insplico</italic>: algorithmic details</title>
      <p><italic toggle="yes">Insplico</italic> is implemented in Perl, uses exclusively Perl libraries shipped with the standard installation of Perl and depends on Samtools (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>) and Bedtools. As such, it can be readily run after download on Unix-like systems where Perl, Samtools, and Bedtools are available. Considering all exon starts and ends and the upstream and downstream intronic regions of same length, <italic toggle="yes">Insplico</italic> inspects the mapped reads to identify those in <italic toggle="yes">upfi</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">dofi</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">bos</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">bus</italic> configurations (Figure <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>), as well as the counts for exon skipping, inclusion upstream and inclusion downstream. These read count statistics, together with estimates of F<italic toggle="yes">upfi</italic> (fraction of <italic toggle="yes">upfi</italic> reads over the total number of <italic toggle="yes">upfi</italic> + <italic toggle="yes">dofi</italic> reads), proportion of exon inclusion (using the standard proportion-spliced-in metric, PSI) and proportion of intron retention (PIR) of the upstream and downstream introns, are output as a tab-separated table where rows (exons) are ordered correspondingly to the rows of the input table. Unavailable estimates are indicated by NA.</p>

      <p>Three features of <italic toggle="yes">Insplico</italic>’s implementation facilitate its usability: (i) <italic toggle="yes">Insplico</italic> works out-of-the-box with mapped short and long reads. Algorithmically, long reads are treated identically to single-end short reads as there are no conceptual differences between these two for AISO analysis; (ii) users do not need to define the strandedness of the RNA-seq reads, which is often a cumbersome matter for incompletely documented RNA-seq data and (iii) users can use 0- or 1-based genetic coordinate systems without the need to change the reference system because <italic toggle="yes">Insplico</italic> uses a fuzzy matching of coordinates. When comparing the splice site coordinates of reads to exon start and end coordinates, <italic toggle="yes">Insplico</italic> can apply a user-definable fuzziness to detect matching coordinates; by default, coordinates are matched within ±3 nt. Fuzzy matching of coordinates is useful when ambiguities in splice site mapping occur where <italic toggle="yes">Insplico</italic> is capable of exploiting such reads for its count statistics.</p>
      <p>Another capability that sets <italic toggle="yes">Insplico</italic> apart from previous approaches is the bias correction for processing long reads such as those from ONT or PacBio. When these reads do not cover the entire transcript, from transcription start site to termination site, they might cause a bias in the <italic toggle="yes">upfi</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">dofi</italic> count statistics of the first and last internal exons covered by the reads. To reduce this bias, <italic toggle="yes">Insplico</italic> implements a simple but effective heuristic which can be activated by the user (see ‘Long read bias correction by <italic toggle="yes">Insplico</italic>’ for more details). Further details on <italic toggle="yes">Insplico</italic>, available command arguments and applications can be found on gitlab.com/aghr/insplico.</p>

      <title>Simulation of RNA-seq data and assessment of detection and quantification biases</title>
      <p>To generate the mRNA fasta file (i.e. transcriptome) used as input for each iteration of simulation of RNA-seq reads, 1000 random internal exons were selected from the Ensembl hg38 assembly (version 85), using only transcripts with support level 1 and limiting the number of selected exons to one per isoform and only one isoform per gene. The isoform selected per gene was chosen randomly weighting it by the number of exons; this means that isoforms with more exons were more likely to be selected per gene. Additionally, genes with an elevated number of exons had higher chances of being selected. For each gene we generated between 10 to 20 mRNA molecules with either the upstream intron or the downstream intron of the selected exon being ‘retained’ (i.e. not yet spliced out), whereas the rest of introns from the selected transcript were spliced out. The proportion of molecules with the upstream versus downstream retained intron (simulated F<italic toggle="yes">upfi</italic> value) was generated randomly using 0.1 intervals from 0 to 1 at equal probability (uniformly distributed). For each of these exons, we then extracted the internal exon length, upstream intron length and downstream intron length, as well as simulated F<italic toggle="yes">upfi</italic> value. We used the generated mRNA fasta file to simulate RNA-seq reads of different lengths (75 and 150 nts) that were either single-end or paired-end with different average insert sizes (250 or 500 nts, from the beginning of the forward read to the end of the reverse read) were generated employing the <italic toggle="yes">simulate_experiment_countmat</italic> function from the bioconductor R package <italic toggle="yes">polyester</italic> v.1.34.0 with the error model of ‘illumina5’ for 75 bp reads and ‘uniform’ for 150 bp and the options: strand_specific = F, error_rate = 0.005, bias = ‘none’. This process was repeated 20 times (<italic toggle="yes">i</italic> = 1...20 iterations) to generate data for a total of 20 000 internal exons, using seed = 20221107 + i to ensure reproducibility. Next, each generated RNA-seq file was mapped with STAR and processed with <italic toggle="yes">Insplico</italic>. For the different analyses of Figure <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, simulated exons were grouped according to their length or the length of their upstream or downstream introns. For detection assessment, we plotted the percent of simulated exons for which <italic toggle="yes">Insplico</italic> could extract at least one <italic toggle="yes">upfi</italic> or <italic toggle="yes">dofi</italic> read (i.e. N(<italic toggle="yes">upfi</italic> + <italic toggle="yes">dofi</italic>) ≥ 1). For quantification assessments, we restricted the analyses to exons with N(<italic toggle="yes">upfi</italic> + <italic toggle="yes">dofi</italic>) ≥ 10.

After download, we removed the Illumina universal adapter AGATCGGAAGAGC with cutadapt v2.4 from the 3′ ends of read1 and read2, keeping only reads with a minimum length of 15 nts. As per the original study, these reads were mapped to the human hg19 genome assembly with the splice-aware mapper STAR v2.7.1a, requiring a minimal overlap of 5 nts on both sides of splice junctions and keeping only uniquely mapping reads. The resulting BAM files with mapped reads were analyzed with <italic toggle="yes">Insplico</italic>. To create the exon definition table, we applied the script <italic toggle="yes">extract_exons_from_gtf.pl</italic> to the Ensembl v75 hg19 gene annotation GTF, which gave 266950 exons together with their exon types across all transcripts where they appear. The most prominent exon types were diverse/mixed (39.2%), internal (30.1%), first (10.7%) and last (8.9%), as shown in Figure <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3E</xref>. We discarded exons of the ‘diverse’ type as they may introduce noise, and focused on second-first, internal and second-last exons.

Finally, to investigate the cause of the difference in AISO profiles obtained by our and Kim <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>'s analysis for second-first exons, we matched the 17 273 second-first exons identified by Kim <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> to the exons types we extracted from the Ensembl hg19 gene annotation, which revealed that most of these exons were of the ‘diverse’ type.</p>

      <title>Long read bias correction by <italic toggle="yes">Insplico</italic></title>
      <p>Given the different profiles obtained for short and long reads in the re-analysis of Drexler <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> (2020), we hypothesized that these differences could be caused by specific biases introduced by ONT. Specifically, we reasoned that there could be two types of biases: those resulting from 5′ truncations of the RNA molecule or sequence (Figure <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">4C</xref>) and those from 3′ truncations (Figure <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">4D</xref>). Each of these can come from different sources. For instance, since ONT sequencing proceeds from 3′ to 5′, 5′ truncations can be caused by broken RNA molecules or by molecule stalling at the nanopore, leaving the sequencing incomplete. In the case of 3′ truncations, these can occur when transcription of the RNA has not finished, as it often occurs in datasets of nascent RNA. Since the probability of these biases to occur generally depend on the length of the RNA molecule, and <italic toggle="yes">Insplico</italic> needs both ends of the target exon to be present in the sequence to provide a valid count, this can lead to a relative depletion of <italic toggle="yes">upfi</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">dofi</italic> counts for 5′ and 3′ truncations, respectively, as exemplified in Figure <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">4C</xref>, D for an exon with two neighboring introns of equal length.</p>

        <graphic xlink:href="gkad244fig4" position="float"/>
      </fig>
      <p>To mitigate each of these types of bias, we implemented a simple heuristic in <italic toggle="yes">Insplico</italic> that users can activate with the option --biascorr. With this option activated, for each ONT read processed, <italic toggle="yes">Insplico</italic> identifies the first and last exons covered by the read and discards them for further processing as well as the sequence upstream or downstream to them, respectively. In other words, each ONT read will be cut at the first and last detected exons, which will account for 5′ and 3′ truncations, respectively. This implies that no <italic toggle="yes">upfi</italic> or <italic toggle="yes">dofi</italic> counts will be extracted for these discarded exons but, also, that in most cases no <italic toggle="yes">upfi</italic> or <italic toggle="yes">dofi</italic> counts will be extracted for the neighboring second-first and second-last exons from that read either. Therefore, with this heuristic activated, <italic toggle="yes">Insplico</italic> extracts <italic toggle="yes">upfi</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">dofi</italic> counts only for the subsequent internal exons covered by the read. It should be mentioned that, while this heuristic reduces global biases on AISO, it comes at the price of considerably reducing the number of extracted <italic toggle="yes">upfi</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">dofi</italic> counts. Moreover, as long read technologies and protocols improve, we expect fewer biases associated with AISO. Therefore, we opted for not having this correction active by default, but to leave its use to the user's discretion.</p>

      <title>Consistency of AISO across different replicates, tissues, experimental conditions and species</title>
      <p>For studying AISO across different replicates, cell types, tissues and experimental conditions, we first obtained exon input tables for human hg38 and mouse mm10 Ensembl v88 annotations enriched with <italic toggle="yes">VastDB</italic> exons, as described above. We then downloaded RNA-seq datasets from various sources (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table S1</xref>), removed the Illumina universal adapter AGATCGGAAGAGC with <italic toggle="yes">cutadapt</italic> v2.4 from the 3′ ends of read1 and read2, kept the reads with length ≥15 nts, and mapped them to the respective genomes using STAR v2.7.1a requiring a minimal overlap of 5 nts on both sides of splice junctions and keeping only uniquely mapping reads. These BAM files were used to run <italic toggle="yes">Insplico</italic>. In addition, for all datasets we also mapped and analyzed with <italic toggle="yes">Insplico</italic> the associated polyA-selected and/or cytoplasmic RNA samples, and utilized the estimated PIR values to filter out exons associated with retained introns (PIR ≤ 0.15 for the upstream or downstream intron), and only truly internal exons (as defined above) were used for these comparisons. Then, to compare AISO patterns between two conditions (biological replicates, different cell types, different species), we first selected exons with <italic toggle="yes">N</italic>(<italic toggle="yes">upfi + dofi)</italic> ≥ 10 in both conditions. Next, we defined <italic toggle="yes">upfi</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">dofi</italic> and intermediate exons in the query condition (first stack plot) as those with F<italic toggle="yes">upfi</italic> ≥ 0.8, F<italic toggle="yes">upfi</italic> ≤ 0.2 and 0.2 &gt; F<italic toggle="yes">upfi</italic> &gt; 0.8, respectively, and investigated what fraction of each of them was <italic toggle="yes">upfi, dofi</italic> or had intermediate F<italic toggle="yes">upfi</italic> values in the target condition (second to fourth stack plots). As explained in <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S2A</xref>, if AISO is similar in both conditions (‘Consistent’), most <italic toggle="yes">upfi</italic> exons of the query condition will also be <italic toggle="yes">upfi</italic> in the target condition (and the same for <italic toggle="yes">dofi</italic> exons). On the other hand, if AISO patterns are not maintained between conditions (‘Random’), the <italic toggle="yes">upfi</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">dofi</italic> exon sets in the query condition should have an AISO pattern similar to the genome-wide pattern in the target condition.</p>

      <title>Universal features associated with AISO patterns</title>
      <p>To investigate which intron-exon related features affected AISO genome-wide across multiple species, we first selected 13 RNA-seq datasets from different species (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table S1</xref>) and processed them with <italic toggle="yes">Insplico</italic>. As a standard procedure, we removed the Illumina universal adapter AGATCGGAAGAGC with <italic toggle="yes">cutadapt</italic> v2.4 from the 3′ ends of read1 and read2, keeping only reads with length ≥15 nts. These reads were mapped to the corresponding genomes of each species with the splice-aware mapper STAR v2.7.1a requiring a minimal overlap of 5 nts on both sides of splice junctions and keeping only uniquely mapping reads. The STAR index was built considering the gene annotations for each species and we obtained the exon-definition table applying <italic toggle="yes">extract_exons_from_gtf.pl</italic> to each GTF file together with exons annotated in <italic toggle="yes">vast-tools</italic> (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>), except for rice (not available). Specifically, we used the following species and genome versions: <italic toggle="yes">Homo sapiens</italic> (hg38, Ensembl v88), <italic toggle="yes">M. musculus</italic> (mm10, Ensembl v88), <italic toggle="yes">D. melanogaster</italic> (dm6, Ensembl Metazoa v26), <italic toggle="yes">C. elegans</italic> (ce11, Ensembl v87), <italic toggle="yes">A. thaliana</italic> (araTha10, Ensembl Plants v31) and <italic toggle="yes">O. sativa</italic> (IRGSP1, Ensembl Plants v48).</p>
      <p>Next, we plotted the distribution of F<italic toggle="yes">upfi</italic> values for subsets of exons according to multiple intron-exon related features extracted using <italic toggle="yes">Matt</italic> (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). Specifically, we used the <italic toggle="yes">Matt</italic> command <italic toggle="yes">cmpr_features</italic>, and, for each studied feature, we split the exons into five subsets of equal size with increasing feature value. These plots allow us to study how F<italic toggle="yes">upfi</italic> distributions change for subsets of exons with different feature values. A summary of these plots for those features consistently and significantly associated with AISO across species is shown in Figure <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">6C</xref> for all datasets. All the results, together with further details (violin plots with F<italic toggle="yes">upfi</italic> distributions, axis values, sample sizes, etc.) can be found in <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary File 1</xref>. It should be noted that, although we summarize the results in Figure <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">6C</xref> as median values, the distributions of F<italic toggle="yes">upfi</italic> values are bimodal, as it can be observed in the violin plots of <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary File 1</xref>. For all datasets, we only considered exons with N<italic toggle="yes">(upfi + dofi)</italic> ≥ 10 and for exons with multiple start and/or end coordinates, we chose the version with the longest length. In addition, for those datasets with matched polyA/cytoplasmic RNA-seq (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table S1</xref> and <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary File 1</xref>), we used the <italic toggle="yes">Insplico</italic> information to discard those exons whose upstream and/or downstream introns had PIR &gt; 0.1.</p>

In particular, we defined the following groups: (i) constitutively spliced (CS): exons with PSI &gt; 0.99 in both tissues; (ii) tissue-regulated (TR): exons with an absolute difference in PSI between brain and liver higher than 0.25; and (iii) alternatively spliced (AS): exons with 0.1 &lt; PSI &lt; 0.9 in liver and/or brain and that are not TR. Only exons with at least 20 reads contributing to the PSI estimates both in brain and in liver polyA-selected samples and at least N<italic toggle="yes">(upfi + dofi)</italic> ≥ 10 in the brain chromatin-associated RNA-seq sample were used for the analysis.

We then defined two sets of microexons, defined here as exons of length ≤51 nts: (i) SRRM4-dependent microexons: exons with a ΔPSI (SRRM4 - control) &gt; 0.15 and a PSI in control cells ≤0.2 in the polyA-selected samples; and (ii) control microexons: with |ΔPSI| &lt;0.02 and 0.05 ≤ PSI ≤ 0.95 in at least one of the samples. For exons with multiple start and/or end coordinates, we chose the version with the shortest length. Only exons with N(<italic toggle="yes">upfi + dofi</italic>) ≥ 5 in the SRRM4 OE total RNA sample were used for AISO analyses. Exons with <italic toggle="yes">upfi</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">dofi</italic> patterns were defined as those with F<italic toggle="yes">upfi</italic> ≥0.8 and ≤0.2, respectively.

Samples were incubated at 4°C head-over-tail overnight before being filtered through a 100 micron strainer (BD Biosciences) to remove the undissociated tissues. Cells pellets were obtained by centrifugation at 1000 rpm for 5 min at 4°C and washed once in 1 ml PBS. Pellets were resuspended in pre-chilled HMKE buffer (20 mM HEPES pH 7.2; 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>; 10 mM KCl; 1 mM EDTA; 250 mM sucrose; 1× protease inhibitors cocktail (Roche); 200 ug/ml digitonin (Sigma)) described in (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>); supplemented with 0.1% NP40. Samples were incubated for 10 min on ice and centrifuged at 500 g for 10 min at 4°C. The supernatant for each tissue was kept and saved as cytoplasmic fraction. The pellet, containing the nuclei, was washed in PBS supplemented with 1 mM DTT, centrifuged again and treated following the protocol described by (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). Briefly, pellets were resuspended in pre-chilled buffer 1 (20 mM Tris–HCl pH 7.9; 75 mM NaCl; 0.5 mM EDTA; 0.85 mM DTT; 1× protease inhibitors cocktail (Roche); 50% glycerol). An equal volume of pre-chilled buffer 2 (10 mM HEPES pH 7.6; 1 mM DTT; 7.5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>; 0.2 mM EDTA; 0.3 M NaCl; 1 M Urea; 1% NP40) was added and the samples were vortexed twice for 2 s before being incubated for 10 min on ice.</p>
      <p>The samples were centrifuged at 15 000 g for 2 min at 4°C. The pellet (chromatin fraction) was resuspended in PBS. All fractions were treated with proteinase K for one hour at 65°C (an equal volume of Proteinase 2x buffer (200 mM Tris 7.5, 25 mM EDTA, 300 mM NaCl, 2% SDS) was added to each fraction supplemented with 2 mg/ml proteinase K (Roche Diagnostics). A phenol/chloroform extraction was performed followed by a chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. The nucleic acid pellets were resuspended in water and treated with DNAse (RQ1, Promega) for one hour at 37°C according to the manufacturer's instructions. Phenol/chloroform and chloroform extractions and ethanol precipitation were performed and the pellets were resuspended in water.</p>

      <title>Algorithm overview and definitions</title>
      <p><italic toggle="yes">Insplico</italic> works with both short single-end or paired-end reads (Illumina or Ion Torrent) and long reads (Oxford Nanopore Technology [ONT] or PacBio), using as input BAM files of mapped reads together with a set of user-specified exons with flanking introns. Since splicing takes place in the nucleus during or shortly after transcription, chromatin-associated or nuclear RNA, or at least total ribo-depleted RNA, should preferably be used for studying AISO. <italic toggle="yes">Insplico</italic> automatically detects the read type (single-end or paired-end and their strandedness), and extracts counts of fragments mapping locally to each exonic region in different configurations (Figure <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">1A</xref>). Specifically, for a given exon, fragments mapping to the junction of that exon with any other upstream exon and to the unspliced downstream intron are labelled as upstream-first (<italic toggle="yes">upfi</italic>). Conversely, downstream-first (<italic toggle="yes">dofi</italic>) counts represent fragments that map to the unspliced upstream intron and the junction joining the exon with any other downstream exon. Besides these two types, <italic toggle="yes">Insplico</italic> quantifies fragments that map to both-unspliced (<italic toggle="yes">bus</italic>) flanking introns, as well as fragments supporting fully processed mRNA, i.e. mapping to both the upstream and downstream splice junctions with any upstream or downstream exon (both-spliced, <italic toggle="yes">bos</italic>). Additionally, it extracts counts of fragments supporting exon inclusion (from upstream or downstream exon-exon junctions) or exon exclusion, containing a splice junction that skips the exon (Figure <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">1A</xref>). With these counts, <italic toggle="yes">Insplico</italic> estimates different measures for each input exon (Figure <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">1B</xref>). The most relevant for AISO analysis of a given exon is F<italic toggle="yes">upfi</italic>, the fraction of <italic toggle="yes">upfi</italic> fragments in relation to the sum of <italic toggle="yes">upfi</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">dofi</italic> fragments. A F<italic toggle="yes">upfi</italic> close to 1 implies that the AISO of this exon is predominantly <italic toggle="yes">upfi</italic>, while F<italic toggle="yes">upfi</italic> close to 0 means it is predominantly <italic toggle="yes">dofi</italic>. In this study, we summarize the distributions of F<italic toggle="yes">upfi</italic> values for sets of exons of interest by empirical histograms (Figure <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">1C</xref>), which can be complemented with violin or density plots of F<italic toggle="yes">upfi</italic> values. In addition, for each input exon, <italic toggle="yes">Insplico</italic> provides: proportion of exon inclusion (PSI) and proportion of intron retention (PIR) for both flanking introns. These measures can be used to identify alternative versus constitutive exons, or exons that are specifically (mis-)regulated in a given condition (see below). Moreover, by additionally utilizing matched cytoplasmic and/or polyA-selected RNA-seq, PIR values of flanking introns can be estimated and used to remove stably retained introns, which may bias the analysis of AISO.</p>

      <title>Assessment of potential biases in AISO quantification using simulated reads</title>
      <p>To evaluate <italic toggle="yes">Insplico</italic>’s performance in terms of quantification precision and assess possible biases coming from exon and intron lengths both in terms of detection ability and F<italic toggle="yes">upfi</italic> quantification, we first performed a controlled study using simulated short RNA-seq reads. We simulated RNA-seq reads of different lengths (75 and 150 nts) that were either single-end or paired-end with different insert sizes (250 and 500 nts) for a total of 20 000 random internal human exons (see Methods). With regard to detection, as expected by design (Figure <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">1A</xref>), the capability of <italic toggle="yes">Insplico</italic> to extract count statistics for exons above a certain length is limited by the read length and the insert size, in the case of paired-end reads (Figure <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2A</xref>). For instance, with 75-nt single-end reads <italic toggle="yes">Insplico</italic> could extract counts only for exons of length ≤ 75 nts, while exons &gt; 300 nts were only partially detected by 150-nt paired-end reads with insert sizes of 500 nts (Figure <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2A</xref>, left panel). It should be noted, however, that exons &gt; 300 nts account for &lt; 5% of all internal exons in human (Figure <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2A</xref>, right panel). In the case of the neighboring introns, neither the length of the upstream intron nor of the downstream intron had a major impact on the capability of <italic toggle="yes">Insplico</italic> to extract counts (Figure <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2B</xref>, C). With regard to the quantification, we found no major differences in F<italic toggle="yes">upfi</italic> accuracy or precision related to the type of RNA-seq used (Figure <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2D</xref>). More importantly, we found that the lengths of neither the exon, the upstream intron nor the downstream intron introduced any biases in the distributions of F<italic toggle="yes">upfi</italic> values measured by <italic toggle="yes">Insplico</italic> when compared to the simulated ones (Figure <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2E</xref>–<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">G</xref>), strongly supporting the validity of <italic toggle="yes">Insplico</italic> to quantify and compare AISO across the genome.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="SEC3-3">
      <title><italic toggle="yes">Insplico</italic> analyses of published datasets reproduce previous results</title>
      <p>Next, we tested the effectiveness of <italic toggle="yes">Insplico</italic> by applying it to the publicly available RNA-seq datasets used in Kim <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>) (Figures <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> and <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S1A</xref>). We downloaded and mapped the same 57 human RNA-seq samples from GEO, summing up to 7.3 billion 72–76 nt paired-end reads for non-polyA-selected total or nuclear RNA fractions from 16 different human cell lines (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table S1</xref>). We then extracted all exons that were consistently second-first (i.e. always the second exon in every transcript in which it is present), truly internal, or second-last (i.e. always the second to last exon in every transcript in which it is present) from the complete Ensembl hg19 gene annotation (Figure 3A; see Materials and Methods), and applied <italic toggle="yes">Insplico</italic> to the mapped reads to extract AISO count statistics for exons with at least 10 (<italic toggle="yes">upfi</italic> + <italic toggle="yes">dofi</italic>) counts (N(<italic toggle="yes">upfi</italic> + <italic toggle="yes">dofi</italic>) ≥ 10). In agreement with Kim <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, we found that, genome-wide, the majority of truly internal exons had either a clear <italic toggle="yes">upfi</italic> or <italic toggle="yes">dofi</italic> AISO pattern (F<italic toggle="yes">upfi</italic> ≥ 0.8 or ≤ 0.2, respectively) (Figure <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3B,C</xref>; center plots), with a slight excess of <italic toggle="yes">upfi</italic> exons (Figure 3D; ratio <italic toggle="yes">upfi</italic>/<italic toggle="yes">dofi</italic> = 1.11; <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 6e-14, one-sided Binomial test). Second-last exons showed a stronger enrichment of <italic toggle="yes">upfi</italic> splicing patterns (Figure 3D; ratio <italic toggle="yes">upfi</italic>/<italic toggle="yes">dofi</italic> = 1.65; <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 2e–34, one-sided Binomial test), again in agreement with Kim <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> (Figure <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3B</xref>, C; right plots). However, for second-first exons, we found a similar excess of <italic toggle="yes">upfi</italic> AISO (Figure 3D; ratio <italic toggle="yes">upfi</italic>/<italic toggle="yes">dofi</italic> = 1.47; <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 3e–22, one-sided Binomial test), similar to the trend observed for second-last exons, while Kim <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> reported an excess of <italic toggle="yes">dofi</italic> AISO (Figure <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3B</xref>, C; left plots). To clarify this discrepancy, we further investigated the set of second-first exons as defined by Kim <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> using our exon-type classification. Remarkably, only a minority of these exons were truly second-first in all the transcripts in which they appear; the majority fell in the ‘diverse’ exon category (Figure <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3E</xref>), which was the most common one in the annotation (Figure <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3E</xref>). Restricting the analysis to the subset of exons used by Kim <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> that were strictly annotated as second-first by our annotation in combination with the F<italic toggle="yes">upfi</italic> values estimated by Kim <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> gave a pattern of AISO more similar to that obtained with <italic toggle="yes">Insplico</italic>, with an excess of <italic toggle="yes">upfi</italic> AISO (Figure <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3D</xref>, F; ratio <italic toggle="yes">upfi</italic>/<italic toggle="yes">dofi</italic> = 1.21; <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 3e–7, one-sided Binomial test).</p>

      <title>Correction of long read biases recovers short read splicing patterns</title>
      <p>We next used RNA-seq data of nascent chromatin-associated RNA from human K562 cells published by Drexler <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>) (Figures <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> and <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S1B</xref>). These data consist of ∼2 million long ONT reads, which we mapped to the human genome with <italic toggle="yes">Minimap2</italic>. Applying <italic toggle="yes">Insplico</italic> to these mapped reads showed an excess of <italic toggle="yes">dofi</italic> AISO (Figure 4A; ratio <italic toggle="yes">upfi</italic>/<italic toggle="yes">dofi</italic> = 0.41; <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 7e–69, one-sided Binomial test), in agreement with Drexler <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). However, this pattern disagrees with the slight excess of <italic toggle="yes">upfi</italic> AISO described above obtained using short reads (Figure 3; (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>)). To investigate potential causes of this discrepancy, we processed with <italic toggle="yes">Insplico</italic> ∼160 million 80-nt paired-end Illumina reads from 4sU-labelled RNA also from K562 cells generated by Drexler <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> We observed the same excess of <italic toggle="yes">upfi</italic> AISO (Figure 4B; ratio <italic toggle="yes">upfi</italic>/<italic toggle="yes">dofi</italic> = 1.41; <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 7e–26, one-sided Binomial test), suggesting that the nature of the sequencing data (long versus short read sequencing) may have a considerable impact on the results. We reasoned that this discrepancy could be explained by biases introduced by long reads. On the one hand, since ONT sequences the RNA molecule from 3′ to 5′, for broken molecules or those eventually stalled at the nanopore, the 5′-most exon identified in the read could have a bias towards <italic toggle="yes">dofi</italic> counts, since its upstream exon will often not be present and thus cannot produce <italic toggle="yes">upfi</italic> counts by definition (5′ truncations; Figure <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">4C</xref>). On the other hand, partially transcribed pre-mRNAs could generate a bias towards <italic toggle="yes">upfi</italic> splicing for the 3′-most exon identified in the sequenced molecule, since the upstream exon will already be transcribed (and thus potentially spliced to the focus exon) but not the downstream one (3′ truncations; Figure <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">4D</xref>). To reduce these potential biases, we added to <italic toggle="yes">Insplico</italic> an optional correction module for long reads. Effectively, the implemented strategy discards both the first and last exons identified in each long read from count extraction (see Methods). Correcting for each of these biases separately strongly shifted the F<italic toggle="yes">upfi</italic> distributions in the expected direction (Figure <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">4C</xref>, D, right panels). Importantly, correction of both biases at the same time retrieved a similar distribution to the one obtained by short reads, i.e. with an excess of <italic toggle="yes">upfi</italic> splicing (Figure 4C; ratio <italic toggle="yes">upfi</italic>/<italic toggle="yes">dofi</italic> = 1.25 versus 1.41; <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.48, two-sided Fisher's Exact test). This suggests that the observed discrepancies may be due to differences in the sequencing technology (i.e. long versus short read sequencing) and that <italic toggle="yes">Insplico</italic> can correctly account for such differences through its long read bias-correction module (option --biascorr).</p>

      <title>AISO is highly stable across different biological conditions</title>
      <p>Despite these consistent genome-wide patterns, the AISO of a given exon may vary across different cell/tissue types or conditions, a possibility that has not been investigated yet. To address this, we compared exons with strong <italic toggle="yes">upfi</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">dofi</italic> splicing (F<italic toggle="yes">upfi</italic> ≥ 0.8 or ≤ 0.2, respectively), in various pairs of deep chromatin-associated RNA-seq samples. We reasoned that if AISO is widely maintained between the two samples, the sets of <italic toggle="yes">upfi</italic> (red) and <italic toggle="yes">dofi</italic> (blue) exons in the first sample will tend to be <italic toggle="yes">upfi</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">dofi</italic>, respectively, in the second sample (‘consistent’, <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S2A</xref>). Otherwise, in the opposite scenario (‘random’ AISO), the background distribution will be observed in the second sample for each AISO type in the first sample (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S2A, B</xref>). First, we investigated the overall consistency of AISO patterns between replicates of the same studies for exons with sufficient informative reads (N<italic toggle="yes">(upfi + dofi)</italic> ≥ 10) in the two compared samples. Biological replicates of human K562 cells (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>) showed extremely consistent AISO patterns (Figures <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">5A</xref> and <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S2C</xref>), which can be statistically assessed using a Binomial test for <italic toggle="yes">upfi</italic> or <italic toggle="yes">dofi</italic> exons independently (e.g. 95% of <italic toggle="yes">upfi</italic> exons in replicate 1 are also <italic toggle="yes">upfi</italic> in replicate 2, compared to the 46% expected by chance; <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0, one-sided Binomial test; Figure <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">5A</xref>). This consistency can also be observed by the profile of F<italic toggle="yes">upfi</italic> values in both replicates, in which the same exons in both samples have been colored based on the type of AISO in the first replicate (Figure <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">5A</xref>, density plots). Moreover, AISO values in both samples can be compared using scatter plots, and the global consistency assessed through Pearson and Spearman correlations (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S3A</xref>). For instance, for the two replicates of K562 cells, Pearson's <italic toggle="yes">r</italic> = 0.97 (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0) and Spearman's <italic toggle="yes">rho</italic> = 0.924 (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0). Using these complementary metrics, we also found a similarly high consistency of AISO patterns between two RNA-seq replicates of human HeLa cells (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>) (Figures <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">5B</xref>, <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S2D</xref> and <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S3B</xref>). Second, we compared the patterns in K562 and HeLa cells, which also exhibited very consistent AISO distributions (Figures <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">5C</xref>, <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S2E</xref> and <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S3C</xref>). Third, we aimed at comparing cells of very different origin and function. For this purpose, we generated deep chromatin-bound RNA-seq data from mouse brain (cortex and cerebellum) and liver (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table S1</xref>), as well as paired cytoplasmic polyA-selected RNA-seq to identify and discard potential intron retention events. Remarkably, <italic toggle="yes">upfi</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">dofi</italic> exons in the brain showed nearly identical patterns in the liver (Figures <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">5D</xref>, <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S2F</xref> and <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S3D</xref>), suggesting that AISO patterns are highly consistent even across very divergent cell types. Moreover, we assessed if these patterns were conserved between species by comparing AISO between human and mouse brains (Figures <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">5E</xref>, <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S2G</xref> and <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S3E</xref>). Although the consistency was not as strong as within each species, we found significant conservation of AISO patterns: of 443 <italic toggle="yes">upfi</italic> exons in mouse, 283 were also <italic toggle="yes">upfi</italic> in human (64% versus 41% expected; <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 3e–22, one-sided Binomial test), and of 461 <italic toggle="yes">dofi</italic> mouse exons, 347 had their AISO conserved in human (75% versus 43% expected; <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 5e–45, one-sided Binomial test). Finally, we investigated whether AISO consistency may be disrupted upon major spliceosomal interference. We used RNA-seq of 5-Bromouridine (BrU)-labelled RNA from HeLa cells treated with two SF3B1-targeting drugs, spliceostatin (SSA) and sudemycin C1 (SudC1), which cause widespread intron retention and exon skipping (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). Even under these conditions, AISO was largely maintained with respect to DMSO-treated control cells (Figures <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">5F,G</xref>, <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S2H, I</xref> and <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S3F,G</xref>), including the AISO patterns around exons whose immediately upstream and downstream introns were both substantially affected by the treatments (ΔPIR (Treatment – DMSO) ≥ 0.25; Figures <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">5H</xref>, <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S2J</xref> and <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S3H</xref>).</p>

      <title>Universal genome-wide features of AISO</title>
      <p>Given the stability of AISO across different biological conditions, it is likely that its main determinants are to a large extent hardcoded in the genome. Consistently, different sequence features have been previously shown to influence this process (see Introduction). To further identify universal features across conditions and species, we separately processed with <italic toggle="yes">Insplico</italic> 13 short read RNA-seq datasets from nuclear or chromatin-associated RNA fractions from four animals (human, mouse, fruitfly and round worm) and two plants (Arabidopsis and rice) (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table S1</xref>), which have very different intron densities, genome architectures and alternative splicing patterns (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). From each dataset, we considered all truly internal exons with sufficient informative reads, computed their AISO pattern, and extracted 55 splicing-related genomic features using <italic toggle="yes">Matt</italic> (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>) (see Methods). To assess the possible contribution of each of these features on AISO, we partitioned for each feature the exons into five equal-sized subsets according to increasing feature values, and plotted the average F<italic toggle="yes">upfi</italic> value per bin (Figure 6A; note that, although we use average F<italic toggle="yes">upfi</italic> values for simplicity, F<italic toggle="yes">upfi</italic> distributions are largely bimodal, as shown in <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary File 1</xref> for all features). We identified several genomic features that systematically, linearly or nonlinearly, correlated with AISO with the same functional relationship across all datasets from all species (Figure <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">6B,C</xref>). Specifically, exons whose upstream flanking intron is removed first (<italic toggle="yes">upfi</italic> exons) have well-defined upstream introns with: (i) strong 5′ ss, (ii) strong 3′ ss, and (iii) branch points (BPs) close to their 3′ ss (AG). On the other hand, their downstream introns are (iv) long, (v) particularly with respect to the upstream intron, and (vi) their BP is far from their 3′ ss. Altogether, these results highlight the importance of a strongly defined upstream intron as well as the length and the BP-AG distance of both flanking introns relative to other sequence features.</p>

      <p>Given these consistent genomic features correlating with AISO and the global consistency in the patterns across cell types, we asked how tissue-specific regulation of alternative splicing relates to AISO. Previous studies have shown that alternatively spliced exons are more often <italic toggle="yes">dofi</italic>, compared to constitutive exons (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Interestingly, by separating mouse alternatively spliced exons (0.1 &lt; PSI &lt; 0.9 in liver and/or brain) into those that are or that are not regulated in a tissue-dependent manner (|ΔPSI liver versus neural| ≥ 0.25), we found that the excess of <italic toggle="yes">dofi</italic> AISO was only substantial and statistically significant for tissue-regulated (TR) exons and not for all alternatively spliced exons (Figure 7A; TR versus constitutive exons [CS], <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.002, Fisher's Exact test). However, when looking at the key genomic features identified above for TR exons we found a mix of patterns, indicating that their genomic features cannot solely explain the excess of <italic toggle="yes">dofi</italic> AISO (Figure <xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">7B</xref> and <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary File 2</xref>).</p>

      <p>Therefore, we hypothesized that their tissue-specific splicing regulators may impose unique regulatory architectures with non-canonical AISO patterns. To begin assessing this possibility, we focused on a particular case of extreme tissue-specific regulation: neural-specific microexons that are dependent on the splicing factor SRRM4 for their inclusion. The mode of action of the splicing factor SRRM4 is not fully understood, but interactions between its major functional protein domain, the eMIC domain, and early spliceosomal components have been demonstrated (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). To shed more light into the mechanism of SRRM4-dependent microexon inclusion, we generated total ribo-depleted RNA-seq data from human HEK293 cells ectopically expressing either GFP or SRRM4 and applied <italic toggle="yes">Insplico</italic> for PSI and F<italic toggle="yes">upfi</italic> estimations. We identified 677 exons that were more included upon SRRM4 overexpression (OE) compared to the control (ΔPSI ≥ 0.15) and that were lowly included in control cells (PSI &lt; 0.2). As expected, most of these (511/677, 76%) were microexons (defined here as length ≤ 51 nts). We then compared these SRRM4-dependent microexons with a control exon set of length ≤ 51 nts, high inclusion in the control (PSI &gt; 0.8) and not affected by SRRM4 OE (|ΔPSI| &lt; 0.1). As expected, by looking at all <italic toggle="yes">Insplico</italic> counts for unprocessed transcripts (i.e. <italic toggle="yes">upfi, dofi</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">bus</italic>; Figure <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>), we found that SRRM4-dependent microexons need SRRM4 even for partial processing (Figure <xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">7C</xref>). Remarkably, in SRRM4 OE cells, we found that 58% of SRRM4-dependent microexons had strongly <italic toggle="yes">dofi</italic> splicing patterns (F<italic toggle="yes">upfi</italic> ≤ 0.2), while only 26% of them seem to be spliced in an <italic toggle="yes">upfi</italic> manner (F<italic toggle="yes">upfi</italic> ≥ 0.8; Figure <xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">7D</xref>), in contrast to roughly equal percentages in the control set (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.013, Fisher's Exact test). Importantly, RNA-seq-based AISO patterns were validated experimentally using <italic toggle="yes">upfi</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">dofi</italic> specific primers for four SRRM4-dependent microexons (Figure <xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">7E</xref>, F).</p>
      <p>We next asked whether <italic toggle="yes">upfi</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">dofi</italic> SRRM4-dependent microexons showed distinct characteristics. First, being <italic toggle="yes">upfi</italic> or <italic toggle="yes">dofi</italic> was not significantly associated with a different magnitude of the response to SRRM4 OE (Figure 7G; <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.761, Wilcoxon Sum-Rank test). Second, despite all being microexons by definition, <italic toggle="yes">dofi</italic> microexons tended to be shorter than <italic toggle="yes">upfi</italic> microexons (medians 17 versus 24 nts, respectively), although this difference did not reach statistical significance (Figure 7H; <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.139). Third, a major feature previously associated with SRRM4-dependent microexons, namely weaker 3′ ss contexts in the upstream intron (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>), was significantly more prominent for <italic toggle="yes">dofi</italic> microexons (Figure 7I; <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.010, Wilcoxon Sum-Rank test; <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary File 3</xref>), consistent with the general pattern of all <italic toggle="yes">dofi</italic> exons (Figures <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">6</xref> and <xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">7B</xref>). Finally, the presence of the UGC motif near the 3′ ss, also characteristic of eMIC-dependent regulation by SRRM4 (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35–37</xref>), was more prevalent in <italic toggle="yes">dofi</italic> SRRM4-dependent microexons (Figure <xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">7J</xref>). In summary, these results suggest that the previously reported features associated with SRRM4 regulation are more associated with <italic toggle="yes">dofi</italic> splicing and raise the possibility that two modes of regulation by SRRM4 may exist in connection with opposite AISO patterns. However, further studies are required to increase the robustness of these conclusions and evaluate their mechanistic relevance.</p>

    <title>DISCUSSION</title>
    <p>We developed <italic toggle="yes">Insplico</italic>, the first publicly available standalone software dedicated to the study of the splicing order of adjacent introns applicable to both short and long read sequencing technologies, and demonstrated its effectiveness using simulated reads and by comparing it with two published studies of AISO (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Some previous studies had reported methods and code for the analysis of AISO with either short or long reads (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). However, <italic toggle="yes">Insplico</italic> facilitates the analysis of AISO by providing a single user-friendly and standalone tool that can process both types of sequencing technologies and that includes additional functionality. Importantly, despite specifically studying intron splicing, <italic toggle="yes">Insplico</italic> is an exon-centric, not intron-centric tool. It obtains key measurements to investigate pre-mRNA processing around user-specified exons of interest (<italic toggle="yes">upfi</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">dofi</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">bus</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">bos</italic> counts) and estimates the fraction of transcripts in which the upstream intron is spliced before the downstream one (F<italic toggle="yes">upfi</italic>). Moreover, another unique feature of <italic toggle="yes">Insplico</italic> is that it also quantifies the level of inclusion of exons (PSI) and the level of intron retention (PIR) of the two neighboring introns, allowing more complex integrated analyses as well as further filtering and stratification strategies within a single software.</p>
    <p>Contrary to short reads, which only give local information, long reads have the potential to provide a snapshot of all introns of a transcript at once, thus being particularly promising to study intron splicing order. Intriguingly, a pioneer study (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>) obtained AISO patterns in human using long reads that did not match those previously reported for short reads. Here, we showed that such discrepancies could be due to 5′ and 3′ biases in long read sequencing and library preparation that, when corrected for, harmonize the patterns obtained by both types of sequencing technologies. The optional module to perform these corrections is a unique feature of <italic toggle="yes">Insplico</italic>. On the other hand, short read sequencing has its own limitations. For example, given that <italic toggle="yes">upfi</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">dofi</italic> fragments require mapping across the entire exon to cover both splice sites (Figure <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">1A</xref>), the length of the reads (and the fragment size of paired-end reads) limits the maximum length of the exons that are quantifiable by <italic toggle="yes">Insplico</italic> using short reads, as we illustrated using simulated reads. Moreover, although we have explicitly focused on the relative splicing order of the pairs of introns directly flanking the input exons (AISO), short reads can barely provide splicing order information beyond them as long reads can do (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>).</p>
    <p>After demonstrating its effectiveness, we applied <italic toggle="yes">Insplico</italic> to multiple public and newly generated RNA-seq datasets to gain insights into AISO across cell types, conditions and species. Splicing is known to mainly occur co-transcriptionally and be influenced by transcriptional related features, RNA <italic toggle="yes">cis</italic>-acting elements and binding proteins. How these factors determine AISO and how it varies across different conditions is largely unknown. Remarkably, through our analyses, we not only observed a strong consistency of AISO across cell and tissue types from the same species, but also even under disruptive spliceosomal conditions such as those induced by SF3B1-targeting drugs. Thus, these findings suggest that, even though experimentally induced changes in AISO have been shown to affect splicing outcomes (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>), AISO is largely independent of the splicing outcome under physiological and non-physiological conditions. Moreover, these results argue that, for most exons, the main contributors to this predefined AISO are likely hardcoded in the genome. In line with this idea, our cross-species analysis revealed several universal genomic features that are strongly associated with exons whose upstream intron is spliced before the downstream one across various animal and plant species. In particular, such exons are typically flanked by a short upstream intron with strong 5′ ss and 3′ ss (including a long polypyrimidine tract and short BP-AG distance) and a long downstream intron with large BP-AG distance, but otherwise regular splice sites. Those features are generally in line with and expand previous studies (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>), and are consistent with the model known as ‘first come, first spliced’, whereby a co-transcriptional recruitment of the spliceosome occurs and triggers the splicing of well-defined introns as soon as they are fully transcribed (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10–14</xref>). However, consistent with previous studies (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>), we also found that there are nearly as many exons whose downstream introns are spliced prior to the upstream one as there are of the converse ‘canonical’ case, overall resulting in a strong bimodal distribution of F<italic toggle="yes">upfi</italic> values genome-wide for all studied species. This large number of <italic toggle="yes">dofi</italic> exons, which are particularly associated with tissue-regulated alternative exons, is consistent with previous studies indicating large fractions of delayed or post-transcriptional splicing (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>) and the exceptional dependence of these introns on specific <italic toggle="yes">trans</italic>-acting factors for their splicing (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). Therefore, to fully comprehend the universal AISO code, it will be necessary to not only dissect the role of spliceosomal components and RBPs in intron splicing order (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>), but also to expand and integrate recently developed mathematical modelling of co-transcriptional splicing (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>) and splicing decisions based on RBP binding rate and position on the pre-mRNA (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>) with chromatin features (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>), spliceosomal recruitment and splicing kinetics (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>).</p>
    <p>As an example of <italic toggle="yes">trans</italic>-acting dependent splicing regulation, we focused here on a unique case of tissue-regulated exons, neural microexons, which are characterized by their short length (defined here as smaller than 51 nts) and dependence on SRRM4 for inclusion (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). An appealing hypothesis, which we investigated here, is that these microexons are highly dependent on a particular AISO for inclusion. Along this line, and consistent with the pattern of AISO for TR exons, we observed that the majority of SRRM4-dependent microexons are preferentially spliced in a <italic toggle="yes">dofi</italic> manner. Such <italic toggle="yes">dofi</italic> microexons tend to be shorter, have significantly weaker 3′ ss, and much more marked UGC peak at a shorter distance to the 5′ ss than <italic toggle="yes">upfi</italic> ones. This suggests that the simultaneous assembly of U1 and U2 snRNPs is not possible on the surrounding 5′ and 3′ splice sites of these microexons due to steric hindrance. Therefore, it could be possible that they are mainly recognized at the level of their 5′ ss, which are known to be particularly strong (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>), by the U1 snRNP whose recruitment could then favor splicing of the downstream intron. After splicing of the downstream intron and, possibly, recruitment of RNPS1 (a component of the Exon Junction Complex) (<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>), SRRM4 binding could favor 3′ ss recognition by promoting the recruitment of early spliceosomal components (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>) and subsequent splicing of the upstream intron. Intriguingly, however, a non-negligible fraction of SRRM4-dependent microexons are spliced in an <italic toggle="yes">upfi</italic> manner. Those tend to be longer, with stronger 3′ ss and a less marked UGC peak, suggesting that they may be recognized and spliced in a way more similar to constitutive exons. Although those hypotheses remain to be formally tested, our AISO analysis thus suggests two possible mechanisms of splicing of SRRM4-dependent neural microexons.</p>
