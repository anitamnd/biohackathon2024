      <p id="Par1">Deconvolution of targets and action mechanisms of anticancer compounds is fundamental in drug development. Here, we report on ProTargetMiner as a publicly available expandable proteome signature library of anticancer molecules in cancer cell lines. Based on 287 A549 adenocarcinoma proteomes affected by 56 compounds, the main dataset contains 7,328 proteins and 1,307,859 refined protein-drug pairs. These proteomic signatures cluster by compound targets and action mechanisms. The targets and mechanistic proteins are deconvoluted by partial least square modeling, provided through the website <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://protargetminer.genexplain.com">http://protargetminer.genexplain.com</ext-link>. For 9 molecules representing the most diverse mechanisms and the common cancer cell lines MCF-7, RKO and A549, deep proteome datasets are obtained. Combining data from the three cell lines highlights common drug targets and cell-specific differences. The database can be easily extended and merged with new compound signatures. ProTargetMiner serves as a chemical proteomics resource for the cancer research community, and can become a valuable tool in drug discovery.</p>

    <title>Introduction</title>
    <p id="Par3">Deciphering the targets, mechanism of action (MOA) and cellular effects for compounds, especially for those derived from phenotypic screenings, are all indispensable and challenging tasks in drug discovery<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. These tasks can be addressed by connecting the affected cellular phenotypes to small molecules by connectivity maps<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Such approaches explore the similarity of the cell response signature produced by a compound of interest with signatures of other compounds in the database. However, majority of connectivity map studies are based on gene expression profiles. Since proteins are the targets of most drugs, proteome responses can be more specific to drug action. Only one recent effort has reported a connectivity map based on phosphoproteomic and chromatin signatures, measuring 100 phosphopeptides and 59 histone modifications for treatments with 90 drugs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>, but such focused signatures might not be relevant for all compounds. In principle, protein abundances should serve a good basis for connectivity maps; after all, biological systems are defined by their proteome state. Also, abundances of proteins are as much determined by their degradation as by expression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>, both reflected uniquely in proteomics data. Indeed, in several studies, no strong correlation between mRNA levels and protein concentrations exists even at the steady state<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. In dynamic situations where degradation processes play an important role, such as programmed cell death<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>, the relationship between the transcriptome and proteome may become even less direct.</p>
    <p id="Par4">Here we use chemical proteomics to study the relationship between the anticancer drug molecules and the dying cell phenotypes induced by these molecules<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Chemical proteomics has traditionally been defined as the use of small molecules (which are considered known entities) in studying the unknown functions of proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Recently, chemical proteomics began to designate also the opposite approach, in which proteome analysis is applied to studying functions of small molecules<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>.</p>
    <p id="Par5">We have previously shown that when sensitive cell lines are treated with a toxic compound, its targets and mechanistic proteins are consistently found among the most regulated ones; mapping these proteins on known networks can reflect the compound MOA. This observation served as a basis for the chemical proteomics method called Functional Identification of Target by Expression Proteomics (FITExP)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. In many cases, the affected target and other mechanism-related proteins are found up-regulated. This can be explained by a feedback effect when inhibition of certain proteins activates their (over)production<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. The alternative effect, involving target protein down-regulation, can be caused by, e.g., protein proteolysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. Such feedback phenomena have also been documented in more primitive organisms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>.</p>
    <p id="Par6">The classic FITExP experiment increases the specificity for a given compound by adding a panel of other molecules. The specificity parameter in FITExP reflects the protein regulation for a given compound compared to regulation by other molecules. Therefore, proteins specifically responding to a compound of interest can be identified. Using the specificity parameter, FITExP could successfully identify the targets of several chemotherapeutics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>, probe the targets and MOA of metallodrugs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup> and even toxic nanoparticles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. We have also shown that combining the proteomics data from treated matrix-attached and matrix-detached cells can improve the deconvolution of drug targets and MOAs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Achieving a high level of specificity in analysis usually requires the use of several compounds and cell lines. We hypothesized that the equivalent increase in specificity can be obtained in a single-cell line with a multitude of contrasting compounds.</p>
    <p id="Par7">Here, we profile 56 compounds at LC50 concentrations and show that contrasting the proteome signature of a single compound against others highlights a given compound’s target and mechanistic proteins on the top positions in most cases. Furthermore, we show that the contrasting panel for a single-cell line can be reduced to 8 compounds. With this miniaturization opportunity, using 9 molecules representing orthogonal MOAs, deep proteome datasets are obtained for 3 major cancer cell lines: MCF-7, RKO, and A549. When the data from the three cell lines are combined, common targets and MOAs are revealed, while investigation of the differences highlights important cell-specific mechanisms. The ProTargetMiner database is expandable using the provided user interface that, in turn, is modifiable as it is written in R Shiny. The input is the fold changes of proteins in a number of replicates for a given compound in the desired cell line(s), and the output is an interactive PLS-DA model with extractable rankings, providing the likely drug target and MOA. ProTargetMiner is also directly available through <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://protargetminer.genexplain.com">http://protargetminer.genexplain.com</ext-link>.</p>

      <title>Overview</title>
      <p id="Par8">Here we present the ProTargetMiner concept. The overview of the project’s objectives is given in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>. Employing the specificity concept (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>), orthogonal partial least square-discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) modeling (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>) contrasts the proteome signature of a given compound against those of the rest of the compounds, which reveals the compound targets, MOA, effects on protein complexes and potential resistance factors. The workflow is given in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref>.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p><bold>ProTargetMiner strategy and workflow. a</bold> an extensive proteome signature database of anticancer molecules will identify compounds with similar MOA in multidimensional space. <bold>b</bold> since the response of the target and mechanistic proteins to a compound is specific, <bold>c</bold> an OPLS-DA model contrasting the given compound with all other molecules in the database will identify the drug targets (red circles) and mechanistic proteins as specifically regulated proteins (among other proteins shown with gray circles). <bold>d</bold> workflow: determination of LC50 values for the library of compounds and selected cells; cell treatment with 56 compounds as well as vehicle-treated control and standard treatments (methotrexate, paclitaxel and camptothecin) in at least three biological replicates; lysis, digestion and labeling with TMT-10plex reagents; multiplexing the 10-plexed samples; fractionation of the pooled sample to increase the proteome coverage; analysis of individual fractions by LC-MS/MS; protein identification and relative quantification; data post-processing. The compound structures in panel a were taken from PubChem.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="41467_2019_13582_Fig1_HTML" id="d29e497"/></fig></p>
      <p id="Par9">We selected A549 human lung adenocarcinoma cell line as a model system, because it is well covered in literature, and showed the highest sensitivity to selected compounds among the tested cell lines (MCF-7 and RKO). Viability measurements were performed for 118 clinical anticancer molecules selected from Selleckchem FDA-approved drug library together with several experimental anticancer compounds with unknown targets. A collection of 56 compounds with LC50 below 50 µM was chosen to treat the cells (at LC50 concentrations) for 48 h in three replicates. With the biological effect (cell death) being of the same magnitude, the differences in the proteome states could be attributable to the differences in targets and MOAs. This is in contrast to other databases, where fixed concentrations were used. The selected compounds belong to 19 different classes with versatile targets and MOAs, spanning 112 known targets curated from DrugBank (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.drugbank.ca/">https://www.drugbank.ca/</ext-link>) in November 2019. These compounds and their known targets are listed in Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>. As standard drugs used for quality control, methotrexate, paclitaxel, and camptothecin were chosen and included in each TMT10 multiplexed proteomics experiment (labeling information is given in Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>).</p>
      <p id="Par10">For the main dataset, 287 proteomes were analyzed (10 conditions (compounds+controls) in 5 replicates in the first experiment+79 conditions in 3 replicates). Overall, to obtain the main dataset, 229 LC-MS/MS analyses were performed after multiplexing and fractionation. In total, 144,075 peptides were quantified, being attributed to 7,328 proteins with at least 2 unique peptides per protein. After selecting only proteins quantified with no missing values for 50 drugs, the list was reduced to 4,557 proteins (Supplementary Data <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">1</xref>) that were used in all subsequent analyses.</p>
      <p id="Par11">In each of the 9 multiplexed experiment for the original dataset, the compounds methotrexate, camptothecin and paclitaxel were included as controls, so that they can be used for data quality check. The Pearson correlation coefficient <italic>r</italic> for the average normalized intensities for the above drugs in different experiments was between 0.859 and 0.995 (only proteins with no missing values were used in this analysis), attesting to the quality of the proteomics data (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>).</p>
      <p id="Par12">Due to the nature of random sampling of peptides in shotgun proteomics, the missing values cumulatively increase by merging several datasets, as not all proteins are quantified in all 9 experiments. The comparison of number of proteins, number of peptides, average sequence coverage and the number of missing values for the 9 experiments as well as for the merged original dataset is given in Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>.</p>

      <p id="Par13">To reduce the number of dimensions and visualize the proteomic space, we employed a nonlinear dimension reduction method t-SNE that is widely used for projection of multidimensional molecular signatures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. On the resultant 2D Death map, where the drug-induced proteome signatures are mapped as points (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>), we used the proximity of these points to evaluate the similarity of the drug-induced signatures. As expected, drugs with similar MOAs (e.g., tubulin inhibitors paclitaxel, docetaxel, vincristine, and 2-methodyestradiol; proteasome inhibitors b-AP15 and bortezomib<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>; pyrimidine analogs 5-fluorouracil, floxuridine and carmofur; thioredoxin reductase 1 (TXNRD1) inhibitors auranofin, TRi-1 and TRi-2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>; and DNA topoisomerase 1 (TOP1) inhibitors camptothecin, topotecan and irinotecan) were proximate on the t-SNE plot, confirming that the Death map can be used for evaluating the MOA similarities.</p>
      <p id="Par14">We found tomatine to be a gross outlier in principal component analysis (PCA) (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4a</xref>). For tomatine, the total number of differentially regulated proteins with 1.5 and 2 fold cutoffs (vs. control) compared to the average of all other drugs was 9.4 and 14.6 fold higher, respectively. In Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4b</xref>, the number of differentially regulated proteins (fold change vs. control &gt;2 and &lt;0.5) for tomatine vs. other compounds is shown. Tomatine is likely to act via proteasome inhibition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>, along with unspecific membrane damage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>; these effects may explain the extraordinary changes induced by tomatine in the cell proteome. Therefore, we excluded tomatine from subsequent analyses.</p>
      <p id="Par15">PCA revealed 14 orthogonal dimensions contributing at least 1% to separation of proteome signatures (excluding tomatine) (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5</xref>). The first 3 components are shown in Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6</xref>.</p>
      <p id="Par16">We next employed a conventional correlation-based hierarchical clustering analysis, in which the compounds aggregated in clusters mostly based on common targets/MOA (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>). There are two super-clusters separating the compounds: one composed of the compounds that directly or indirectly lead to DNA damage, such as pyrimidine analogs, as well as TOP1 and TOP2 inhibitors, and the second super-cluster containing all the other molecules. The second super-cluster is in turn divided into proteasome inhibitors and the rest of molecules. This can be explained by dramatic accumulation of misfolded proteins or proteotoxicity of proteasome inhibitors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>, which is not the case with any other compound class. For example, for bortezomib the number of up-regulated proteins was much higher than down-regulated proteins (up/down ratio of 17.8 for bortezomib (vs. control) compared to the average of 2.9 for all other drugs at a minimum regulation of 1.5 fold). The ranking of drugs by the overall deviation of their molecular signatures from the untreated state is shown in Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">7</xref>.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p><bold>Hierarchical clustering of the proteome signatures by compounds and proteins. a</bold> compound clustering is largely consistent with their presumed MOAs (compound classes are denoted by colors). <bold>b</bold> top three most enriched gene ontology terms, representing either molecular function (MF), biological process (BP), or cellular component (CC).

      <p id="Par17">It must be noted that the a priori annotation of compounds is solely based on anticipated targets and disregards the off-targets effects, while proteome-based clustering is based on the overall change of the proteome. For example, auranofin clusters with b-AP15, consistent with its recently identified deubiquitinase inhibitor activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. Note that kinase inhibitors, although seemingly diverse in their cellular effects, also showed a fair degree of clustering.</p>
      <p id="Par18">We also performed clustering of proteins and identified 15 clusters (vertical axis in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>), subjecting each cluster to Gene Ontology analysis (Supplementary Data <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">2</xref> and Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>). Some of these clusters represent high density protein networks: e.g., cluster 13 maps to ribosome.</p>
      <p id="Par19">A quick look at the heat map in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref> reveals protein clusters due to which the compounds are placed in specific clusters. For example, the compounds in super-cluster 1 are separated from super-cluster 2 mostly due to the differences in protein clusters 6 and 15, which represent chromosome condensation and p53 signaling pathways, respectively. The DNA damaging agents lead to induction of p53 signaling pathway resulting in cell cycle arrest<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. As another example, pyrimidine analogs 5-fluorouracil, floxuridine and carmofur form a mini-cluster because they down-regulate ribosomal proteins in the protein cluster 13<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>.</p>
      <p id="Par20">Radar charts on Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c–i</xref> visualize the engagement of compound groups in different protein clusters. For example, proteasome inhibitors (and also everolimus) strongly induce cluster 12 related to protein folding (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>), and so does auranofin, unlike other TXNRD1 inhibitors (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref>). Unexpectedly, some kinase inhibitors including lapatinib, bosutinib, sunitinib, and gefitinib up-regulate the (chole)sterol synthesis pathways, represented by cluster 14 in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2e</xref>. We later verify that these kinase inhibitors indeed enhance cellular cholesterol levels. TOP1 and TOP2A inhibitors down-regulate cluster 6 related to chromatin condensation (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2f, g</xref>). Also down-regulated are the ribosomal proteins (cluster 13) by pyrimidine analogs as well as oxaliplatin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup> (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2h</xref>) and mitochondrial pathways (cluster 2) by a group of mitochondria-targeting compounds (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2i</xref><bold>)</bold>.</p>

      <title>Functional discovery at the protein level</title>
      <p id="Par21">Protein regulation is usually defined as a ratio of the protein abundances in the cells incubated with a drug and a vehicle (control). However, many proteins are involved in generic, drug-unspecific cell responses (e.g., detoxification, death, or survival pathways). To reveal the protein responses characteristic to a particular drug, FITExP introduced specificity as a ratio of the protein regulation in response to a particular drug to the median regulation in response to all other drugs, and used it for deconvolution of drug target/MOA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Here, we merge the regulation and specificity into one parameter by employing OPLS-DA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>, contrasting a given compound against all other molecules (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>).<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p><bold>OPLS-DA paradigm.</bold><bold>a</bold> a generalized OPLS-DA model contrasting a given compound proteome signature against all others. <bold>b</bold> the OPLS-DA loading or score scatter plot demonstrating proteins most contributing to class separation.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="41467_2019_13582_Fig3_HTML" id="d29e709"/></fig></p>
      <p id="Par22">OPLS-DA is a multivariate data analysis tool and a supervised modeling approach that is useful for highlighting what makes two groups or systems different<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. In ProTargetMiner, OPLS-DA is used for discriminant analysis. OPLS-DA would thus discover variables (here proteins) with the largest discriminatory power. The two-group comparison models are easiest to interpret, because there will be only one predictive component. This predictive component is rendered in the x axis in the loading or score scatter plot. Therefore, the horizontal axis in the score scatter plot will demonstrate the variation between the groups, while the vertical dimension and any higher orthogonal components will capture variation within the groups (the latter is quite unimportant in this study).</p>
      <p id="Par23">In thus obtained OPLS-DA models, where each protein is represented by a dot on a loading plot, the proteins specifically up- or down-regulated in response to a given treatment are found on the opposite sides of the plot on the x axis (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>). The proximity of a protein to the endpoint on either side of the x-axis reflects the magnitude and specificity of regulation of that protein in response to a given drug, taking into account the variation among the replicates. Since the y-axis coordinate reflects the contribution of the orthogonal components, the most specific target candidates are located near the x-axis.</p>
      <p id="Par24">Each OPSL-DA model is characterized by R2 value representing the goodness of the model fit. To avoid overfitting of the data in multivariate analysis, SIMCA employs leave-one-out cross-validation strategy. The result is the Q2 value, which is a measure of model predictive power. Q2 is also called the cross-validated R2 and should obviously have a smaller value. Therefore, a model with R2 of 1 perfectly describes the data, and the Q2 value of 1 indicates perfect predictivity of the model. In brief, for cross validation, the whole data-set is divided into seven groups and seven subsequent models are developed based on 6/7 of the data, leaving a new group aside each time<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>. The deleted data are then used as a verification set, and the differences are calculated between the actual and predicted values. These differences are normalized and subtracted from unity, which provides the Q2 value. For more detailed explanation, see Umetrics documentation [39].</p>
      <p id="Par25">As representative examples of drug target deconvolution, OPLS-DA models for several drugs are shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>. R2 and Q2 values are given on each plot. The methotrexate target dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) is convincingly identified as an obvious up-regulated outlier (p vs. control = 2E-5, two-sided Student’s <italic>t</italic>-test) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>). In SIMCA software, variable influence on projection (VIP) values can also be extracted from the model loading<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>, which show the total contribution of x variables to the OPLS-DA model. These VIP values are summed over all components and weighted with regards to the Y variation explained by each component. Therefore, VIP values can be used for ranking of target proteins. As an example, the VIP values indicate that DHFR is the second most contributing protein to methotrexate treatment (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>). Network analysis of the specifically regulated proteins on the either side of the model reflects compounds’ MOA. As an example, processes enriched for 30 top specifically up-regulated proteins in methotrexate treatment are deoxyribonucleoside monophosphate biosynthetic process (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 1E-6) and tetrahydrofolate metabolic process (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 7E-6) and the enriched function is folic acid binding (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 5E-5), in line with the known drug mechanism.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><p><bold>ProTargetMiner reveals drug targets, action mechanisms, and affected cellular complexes.</bold><bold>a</bold> OPLS-DA model for methotrexate. <bold>b</bold> variable influence on projection (VIP) values extracted from methotrexate OPLS-DA model. <bold>c</bold>–<bold>f</bold> OPLS-DA models for four other representative compounds (drug targets and/or mechanistic proteins are shown in red and dark blue circles).

Literature seems to support these results. Lapatinib and crizotinib can induce cholesterol accumulation in human cardiomyocytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>. Lapatinib can also induce the accumulation of cholesterol in late endosomes in breast cancer cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>. Increased cholesterol levels is a common side effect of cabozantinib in clinical trials. Furthermore, new-onset hyperlipidemia has been noted in patients taking sunitinib<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup> and in mice in vivo<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>.</p>
      <p id="Par32">To experimentally verify the effect of kinase inhibitors on cellular cholesterol levels, lapatinib, bosutinib, sunitinib, and gefitinib were tested, while sorafenib that did not induce up-regulation of lipid synthesis and/or cholesterol metabolism proteins, was used as a negative control. To avoid excessive cytotoxicity, we used a shorter incubation time of 20 h and a sub-LC50 concentration (4 µM) for all the compounds. A549, RKO, and human foreskin fibroblast (HFF-1) cells were used for the analysis. While all compounds increased the cellular total cholesterol levels by ~20–50% in A549 cells, in RKO cells, only lapatinib, gefitinib, and bosutinib had a similar effect, and in HFF-1 cells, only lapatinib and bosutinib enhanced the cholesterol levels.

When we combined sorafenib and regorafenib (at LC50) with the specific AXL inhibitor TP0903 in non-cytotoxic concentrations (&lt;100 nM), the combination treatment significantly increased cell death in A549 cells at 24 h and 48 h compared to pure sorafenib and regorafenib (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">10b</xref><bold>)</bold>, validating the ProTargetMiner prediction, that AXL might induce resistance to these drugs.</p>

      <title>On the minimum size of ProTargetMiner</title>
      <p id="Par34">Since compound-induced effects can be cell-specific, detailed characterization of drug action is desirable in the most relevant biological setting. Thus in the drug development process it would be advantageous to build a ProTargetMiner dataset with a customized drug panel and cell type. Creating a ProTargetMiner de novo, however, could be time-consuming and expensive. Miniaturization of the experiment requires determination of the minimal compound panel size for deducing the target and MOA. To address this issue, PLS-DA models were built for different numbers of contrasting compounds (<italic>n</italic> = 1–54, 50 molecule combinations randomized for each <italic>n</italic>). The mean rankings of the known targets for representative compounds camptothecin, methotrexate, OSW-1 and paclitaxel were determined for each number of contrasting drugs <italic>n</italic>.

While in the original dataset, samples were analyzed in 8 fractions, for obtaining deep datasets samples were fractionated into 16 (A549), 23 (MCF-7), or 24 (RKO), and the resulting fractions were analyzed using the Q Exactive HF mass spectrometer. The depths of the proteome profiles are 7398, 8735, and 8551 proteins, respectively, with no missing values in all three replicates.

      <p id="Par36">To showcase the applicability of the new deep datasets in target deconvolution, OPLS-DA models were built for the kinase inhibitor dasatinib vs. eight other treatments in each cell line (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6a</xref>). Comparison of the models revealed both similarities and cell-specific differences. As an example, the known target MAPK14 and the previously unknown target candidate PARG (Poly(ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase) were among the top target candidates in all three cell lines, while the other known kinase targets only appeared in certain cell lines (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6a</xref>). Dasatinib potently inhibits several tyrosine kinases, of which only 4 kinases including SRC, YES1, CSK, and LYN were among the top proteins in different cell lines.

      <title>Merging deep datasets to obtain common drug targets and MOA</title>
      <p id="Par37">In a previous study we have shown that a merged OPLS-DA model built for the proteomes of three cell lines perturbed by different drugs possesses an interesting property – it is rigid, meaning that such models created for a subset encompassing ≥500 most abundant proteins are very similar to the models encompassing ≈100 most drug-specific proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup>. This is in a sharp contrast to single-cell models that do not possess such a property, and thus are loose. Model rigidity is a desired property allowing one to deduce a common drug target<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup>. To obtain a rigid ProTargetMiner model, we performed OPLS-DA modeling for the merged three cell line dataset.</p>
      <p id="Par38">The combined deep-proteome dataset has a total depth of 11,293 proteins quantified with at least two peptides, of which 6496 proteins were common in all cell lines and without missing values (Supplementary Data <xref rid="MOESM10" ref-type="media">7</xref>). Compared to individual cell datasets, the merged model built for these proteins possesses higher specificity. For instance, for dasatinib, the known targets become more significant outliers (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6c</xref>).</p>
      <p id="Par39">On the other hand, some well-known targets faded in ranking, likely due to the cell-specific mechanistic differences.

Similarly, tubulins which had high rankings in MCF-7 and A549 cells in response to vincristine (3 tubulins were among the top 10 specifically down-regulated proteins in both cell lines), were not among the top proteins in RKO cells. As a result, top proteins for vincristine in the merged dataset had only two tubulins. On the other hand, the top 30 specifically down-regulated proteins for vincristine in the merged dataset, mapped very well to rRNA processing (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 4E-5) GO process and to the nucleolus (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 9E-6) component, in agreement with the known vincristine effect on RNA synthesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup>. Thus, the merged dataset presents two diverse MOAs of vincristine.</p>

      <p id="Par40">The ProTargetMiner datasets can be easily extended with new data on other compounds. In order to make the resource available to the community, a Shiny package was written in R, providing a user interface for data integration and PLS-DA modeling for either a selected cell line or all cell lines (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7a</xref>). In short, the user obtains the proteome signature of the desired compound at LC50 concentration (48 h treatment) in any, or all, of the above cell lines in form of the gene names and fold changes in preferably three replicates (only 6 proteomics analyses per cell line), and uploads this information (as an own dataset) through a user interface according to the step-by-step procedure given in Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7b</xref>. A template for the input.CSV file is shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7c</xref>. The package output will be the loading values of top specifically regulated proteins extracted from a PLS-DA model contrasting the given compound against the 9 diverse proteome signatures in that cell line (or all cell lines).<fig id="Fig7"><label>Fig. 7</label><caption><p><bold>The ProTargetMiner R Shiny package for deconvolution of drug target and MOA.</bold><bold>a</bold> the ProTargetMiner R Shiny package interface.

    <title>Discussion</title>
    <p id="Par41">We generated an installment of a proteome signature library for anticancer molecules at LC50 concentrations, and proposed a modeling scheme implemented in an R Shiny package for deconvolution of drug targets, drug metabolizing enzymes, MOA, resistance factors and overall cellular effects for new compounds. We consider ProTargetMiner as a complement to preceding drug target deconvolution databases, such as connectivity maps<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. The advantage of ProTargetMiner is that the response to anticancer molecules can be analyzed in detail on the protein level. Furthermore, the biological endpoint in this study is normalized, which makes the comparison of compound signatures more meaningful. The OPLS-DA modeling used in ProTargetMiner can be hypothetically applied to transcriptomics data or to non-anti-cancer treatments, as long as the biological endpoints for all used compounds are similar. We limited our discussion to the cases in which a single drug is contrasted against others, but the same approach can also be applied to characterize features shared among a selected class of compounds, or between any combinations of drugs. Such a methodology can also be applied to a panel of cell lines, e.g., inquiring which proteins specifically respond to a compound in a given cell line but not in other cell types.</p>
    <p id="Par42">Although the cytotoxicity of anticancer compounds was normalized in this study, it should still be noted that specific drugs might be imperfectly represented by proteomics profiles. For example, in the absence of expression of the primary targets in the cell system under study, off-target effects might dominate in the proteomic signature. Finding a single-cell system where all compounds can be tested in a specific way is very difficult if not impossible.</p>
    <p id="Par43">ProTargetMiner provided information on various aspects of different kinase inhibitors. One of the main challenges with kinase inhibitors is the high number of missing values in shotgun proteomics, especially when a large number of datasets are combined. Kinases are not among the most abundant cellular proteins. In the deep datasets we have tried to overcome this issue. While other types of enzymes can be hypothetically regulated by expression, the redundancy of function in most kinases results in insensitivity to differential regulation. It is yet to be seen what fraction of kinase inhibitor targets can be deconvoluted using ProTargetMiner.</p>
    <p id="Par44">The block-by-block and open source nature of this resource allow for expansion in various dimensions, e.g., by incorporating more perturbations, time points, and profiling more cell lines. Although expansion of the compound library seems desirable, one must consider that for a comprehensive database, enough perturbations must be done to saturate all possible cellular states. Ideally, highly specific inhibitors of every cellular protein are required. But given the astronomical number of potential perturbants, building a truly comprehensive library is a formidable project. While precision medicine targets specific cell types with defined mutations, building a comprehensive proteome response database for every such cell type seems impossible. Fortunately, as we have shown, ProTargetMiner approach can be easily customized and miniaturized. With top-of-the-line proteomics instruments reaching the depth of ≥10,000 proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref></sup>, a triplicate analysis of 9 perturbations requires less than a week of instrumental time. We hope that ProTargetMiner will be used by broad community of cancer researchers.</p>

HFF-1 cells (RRID:CVCL_3285; Cat#ATCC SCRC-1041) were cultured under the exact same conditions in IMDM (Biowest). Cells were routinely tested for mycoplasma by MycoAlert Mycoplasma Detection Kit (#Cat: 11650261, Thermo Fisher Scientific). No authentication was performed, since passage number 2 cells were thawed and used from the ATCC source in all the experiments. In LC50 determination, cells were seeded at a density of 4000 per well in 96-well plates and after a day of growth, treated with the molecules for 48 h. Thereafter cell viability was measured using CellTiter-Blue® Cell Viability Assay (Promega; Cat#G8081) according to the manufacturer protocol.</p>

      <p id="Par47">For proteomics analysis, the cells were seeded at a density of 250,000 per well and allowed to grow for 24 h in biological triplicates. Next, cells were either treated with vehicle (DMSO) or compounds at LC50 concentrations. Each 10 experiments included one vehicle-treated control, 3 control drugs, and 6 library compounds. After treatment, cells were collected, washed twice with PBS (Fisher Scientific; Cat#11629980) and then lysed using 8 M urea (Sigma; Cat#U5378), 1% SDS, and 50 mM Tris at pH 8.5 with protease inhibitors (Sigma; Cat#05892791001). The cell lysates were subjected to 1 min sonication on ice using Branson probe sonicator and 3 s on/off pulses with a 30% amplitude. Protein concentration was then measured for each sample using a BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo; Cat#23227). 50 µg of each sample was reduced with DTT (final concentration 10 mM) (Sigma; Cat#D0632) for 1 h at room temperature. Afterwards, iodoacetamide (IAA) (Sigma; Cat#I6125) was added to a final concentration of 50 mM. The samples were incubated in room temperature for 1 h in the dark, with the reaction being stopped by addition of 10 mM DTT. After precipitation of proteins using methanol/chloroform, the semi-dry protein pellet was dissolved in 25 µL of 8 M urea in 20 mM EPPS (pH 8.5) (Sigma; Cat#E9502) and was then diluted with EPPS buffer to reduce urea concentration to 4 M. Lysyl endopeptidase (LysC) (Wako; Cat#125-05061) was added at a 1: 100 w/w ratio to protein and incubated at room temperature overnight. After diluting urea to 1 M, trypsin (Promega; Cat#V5111) was added at the ratio of 1: 100 w/w and the samples were incubated for 6 h at room temperature.

      <title>Statistics</title>
      <p id="Par54">After removing all the contaminants, only proteins with at least two peptides were included in the final dataset. Protein abundances were normalized by the total protein abundance in each sample in deep datasets. In the original dataset, protein intensities in every experiment (sample set) were normalized to ensure same median intensity across all channels in all replicates. Then for each protein log2-transformed fold-changes were calculated as a log2-ratio of the intensity to the mean of all control replicates. As the last step, log2-ratio were normalized across the whole dataset to ensure close to zero median log-fold change. The latter normalization does not affect the number of differentially regulated proteins; it accounts for experimental variations and is preferred for high-dimensional mass spectrometry data<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref></sup>. The data distribution before and after median normalization, and before and after log2 median fold change normalization are shown in Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">12a–d</xref>, respectively, demonstrating the stabilization of the median fold change for replicates. To show that the same normalization would work for a subset of the dataset, we randomly took the data from experiment 4 and repeated the same procedure.
