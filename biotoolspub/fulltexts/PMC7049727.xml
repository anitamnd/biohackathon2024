      <title>Abstract</title>
      <p>High-throughput chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C) technology enables the investigation of genome-wide interactions among chromosome loci. Current algorithms focus on topologically associating domains (TADs), that are contiguous clusters along the genome coordinate, to describe the hierarchical structure of chromosomes. However, high resolution Hi-C displays a variety of interaction patterns beyond what current TAD detection methods can capture. Here, we present BHi-Cect, a novel top-down algorithm that finds clusters by considering every locus with no assumption of genomic contiguity using spectral clustering. Our results reveal that the hierarchical structure of chromosome is organized as ‘enclaves’, which are complex interwoven clusters at both local and global scales. We show that the nesting of local clusters within global clusters characterizing enclaves, is associated with the epigenomic activity found on the underlying DNA. Furthermore, we show that the hierarchical nesting that links different enclaves integrates their respective function. BHi-Cect provides means to uncover the general principles guiding chromatin architecture.</p>

    <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
    <p>Chromosome conformation is tightly linked to DNA function and activity as illustrated by heterochromatin condensation, enhancer-promoter looping or gene regulatory region accessibility (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). It is only until recently that we were able to probe such relations at a genome-wide scale with the emergence of chromosome conformation capture technologies, notably their high-throughput version coined Hi-C (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Hi-C, through deep sequencing of DNA fragments ligating proximal genomic DNA, yields a genome-wide inventory of physical interactions between every accessible locus, capturing the actual folding of the chromatin inside the nucleus.</p>
    <p>It is widely documented that chromosomes have the tendency to form insulated structures, that are believed to provide dynamic ‘microenvironments’ to fine-tune the activity of the underlying DNA regions (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). This notion motivated studies to apply various clustering methods on Hi-C data. One of the main insights these studies revealed is the existence of recurring insulated clusters at small and large scales displaying characteristic biological features. At small scales, topologically associating domains (TADs) were identified as megabase sized self-interacting contiguous chromosome regions (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). TADs are considered as fundamental units of chromosome organisation because of their segmentation of the chromosome into functionally cohesive regions (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4–7</xref>). At large scales, compartments (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>) were identified as a broad segmentation of the entire genome into active and inactive regions (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Furthermore, at a more general level, modeling analyses of Hi-C data indicated that the multi-scale hierarchical organisation of chromosomes is based on successive nesting of loci-clusters following a fractal globule conformation (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>).</p>
    <p>Eventually, a key goal would be to characterize how this hierarchical organisation of insulated chromosome clusters bridges whole chromosomes with individual loci. In this effort, TADs are widely used as a fundamental brick, whose aggregation eventually forms the whole chromosome in a bottom-up fashion (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10–15</xref>). However, TADs postulate clustering among neighboring loci that are contiguous along the genome coordinate, which can mask more complex interaction patterns often seen in more recent high resolution Hi-C data (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). These complex patterns often result from important processes such as some chromatin looping, chromatin allosteric effect or sub-TADs formation (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>).</p>
    <p>To overcome this limitation, we propose a new clustering method termed BHi-Cect. BHi-Cect clusters loci by considering all possible combinations without imposing contiguity along the genome coordinate using spectral clustering (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>), thus circumventing the limitations of current TAD-based methods. Furthermore, the recursive design of BHi-Cect enables us to find further embedded sub-clusters, revealing the nested organization of loci clusters at all scales of the chromosome hierarchy. The results from this novel top-down approach provide a description of chromosome architecture linking chromosomal hierarchy with the underlying DNA function and activity.</p>

      <title>Clustering algorithm</title>
      <p>BHi-Cect first formats the sequenced paired-end reads yielded by Hi-C methods (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>) into a Hi-C contact matrix <italic>W</italic>(<italic>i</italic>, <italic>j</italic>), where each entry stands for the total read number, or the interaction frequency, between loci <italic>i</italic> and <italic>j</italic>. Here, loci refer to the equally-sized and non-overlapping bins segmenting the genome at the resolution of the considered Hi-C dataset. The matrix is then normalized using the Knight–Ruiz (KR) matrix balancing normalization (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>) so as to compensate bias in enzymatic digestion frequencies at every locus. All Hi-C data were downloaded and processed into KR normalized interaction matrices using Juicer tools (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). Furthermore, the matrix is scaled with a Box–Cox transformation optimizing for normality to mitigate the dispersion of Hi-C interaction frequencies (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). We used a specific Box–Cox lambda for each chromosome using the MASS R package (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>), which implements the maximum likelihood estimate procedure described in (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>).</p>
      <p>The chromatin hierarchy is captured by recursively bisecting genomic loci sets starting from the whole chromosome. For the bisection, we use the principle of spectral clustering (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>) with some modifications. In this method, the chromatin interactions are considered as a network, where each vertex corresponds to a chromosome locus and edge weights between vertices is set by their normalized interaction frequency. The bisection is performed so as to maximize the total sum of edge weights within the bisected loci groups through spectral clustering (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). To compute this, we first derive the degree matrix, <italic>D</italic>, which is a diagonal matrix whose entries correspond to the sum of all the interaction weights for the considered loci. We then derive the Laplacian matrix, <italic>L</italic>, from the equation:<disp-formula><tex-math id="M1">\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

}{}$$\begin{equation*}{{L\ }} = {{\ I}} - {D^{ - 1}}{{W}}\end{equation*}$$\end{document}</tex-math></disp-formula>with <italic>I</italic> being the identity matrix of the same size as the Hi-C matrix <italic>W</italic>. Here, we use the random walk normalized formulation of the Laplacian matrix, which corrects for undesirable topological biases, notably regarding highly interacting loci, while maintaining statistical stability (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). Spectral clustering then requires the eigendecomposition of this Laplacian matrix to derive the second smallest eigenvalue and associated eigenvector, also known as the Fiedler vector. Finally, we perform a <italic>k</italic>-means clustering (<italic>k</italic> = 2) on this vector, for which we collect the consensus from five different seedings, in order to find the optimal bisection (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). This bisection is repeated until we only have a 2 × 2 matrix.</p>
      <p>For each bisection, we further evaluated the self-interaction level of the resulting partitions using the expansion metric (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). The expansion metric is defined as the ratio dividing the sum of edge weights crossing the considered partition over the sum of edge weights inside the considered partition. The mathematical formulation for the expansion metric for a particular partition <italic>C</italic><sub>1</sub> is given by:<disp-formula><tex-math id="M2">\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

We consider a partition well insulated when the expansion metric is smaller than 1, meaning a majority of edge weights exist within the considered partition. We named a bisection ‘split’ or ‘strip’ depending on whether it yielded two or one insulated partitions respectively. If neither partitions displayed an expansion value smaller than one, we stopped the algorithm. To summarize the result, we built a tree structure called a BHi-Cect partition tree (BPT) by aggregating the found partitions (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). To validate the scalability of BHi-Cect we benchmarked it against Hi-C datasets of different resolutions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S12</xref>).

      <title>Definition of top and bottom enclaves and BPT leaves</title>
      <p>We observed that all BPTs accumulated split branching at the top and then tended to have long streaks of strip branching toward their deeper end (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S5</xref>). These features can be captured through three characteristic BPT nodes or enclaves. Firstly top enclaves correspond to the all BPT nodes yielding a strip branching but above which we only find split branching events (first strips). Secondly bottom enclaves are defined as all BPT nodes below which we only find strip branching events and directly resulting from a split branching event (last splits). Thirdly leaves correspond to tree nodes marking the end of the BPT, meaning they don’t have any children nodes despite having an expansion metric smaller than 1 or they contain less than two loci.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="SEC2-3">
      <title>Definition of nestedness</title>
      <p>Nestedness (NS) allows a systematic exploration of the obtained BPT that is not affected by the topological differences observed between chromosomes. To do so, we assign the same value for partitions, which because of their BPT positions, are shared across all chromosomes. We refer to these topologically invariant partitions as top enclaves, bottom enclaves and BPT leaves as described above. We set the nestedness value of these partitions to 0 for top enclaves, 0.5 for bottom enclaves and 1 for leaf partitions. We then linearly interpolate nestedness values for any intermediary partitions. To achieve this, we consider partitions present below and above bottom enclaves partition separately.</p>
      <p>For partitions between top and bottom enclaves, nestedness is defined as:<disp-formula><tex-math id="M3">\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

      <p>Here, <italic>D<sub>i</sub></italic>, or root distance, is the number of branches needed to link the BPT root with the considered partition. min(<italic>D</italic><sub>i</sub>) corresponds to the root distance for the closest top enclave. max(<italic>D</italic><sub>i</sub>) corresponds to the root distance for the furthest bottom enclave directly descending from the considered partition. Adding 1 to the denominator ensures that the obtained nestedness values will be strictly smaller than 0.5.</p>

      <p>To assess the agreement in clustering results between different datasets, we used the variation of information (VI) (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>).

      <title>Analyses of functional similarity between bottom enclaves</title>
      <p>For this analysis, we used two approaches to evaluate the functional similarity between pairs of bottom enclaves. Firstly, we considered bottom enclave functionality as summarized by their TF content. Using the first two dimensions derived from the CA applied on the contingency table summarizing the TF content of every bottom enclave we obtained a reduced 2D space (described earlier). Within it, we evaluated functional similarity by computing the pairwise euclidean distance for every combination of bottom enclaves in each chromosome.</p>
      <p>Secondly we considered bottom enclave functionality as summarized by their significantly enriched GO-terms content.

      <p>The significance of the GO-term enrichment was empirically estimated for each bottom enclaves by considering only GO-terms with extreme fold enrichment (FE) values compared to the distribution of GO-terms FE values derived from randomly generated corresponding bottom enclaves. These random bottom enclaves come from a recursive bisection of the genome into clusters that match the size and number of loci in the original partition tree, but are otherwise chosen at random. The threshold used to identify ‘extreme’ FE values in the random FE distribution was set as:<disp-formula><tex-math id="M15">\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

      <p>This procedure gives us a set of enriched GO-terms for each bottom enclave which we can now use to evaluate the pairwise semantic similarity between bottom enclaves. We quantified the pairwise semantic similarity between the associated sets of enriched GO-terms using the resnik similarity metric (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). Briefly, the resnik similarity is based on the notion of information content of a GO-term defined as minus logarithm of the probability of finding the GO-term in the complete GO-annotation corpus.Thus, for the considered pair of GO-term sets, we compute the information content of the lowest common ancestor in the associated GO-tree (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>).</p>

      <title>Description of the method</title>
      <p>BHi-Cect is a top-down algorithm for the characterization of the chromosome's hierarchical structure. This top-down analysis was inspired by established image segmentation methods in computer vision, which identify distinct objects through the recursive partition of the full image (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). We applied this approach to detect isolated chromatin loci clusters from the totality of chromosomal interactions yielded by Hi-C.Similarly to the computer vision approach, BHi-Cect recursively partitions the chromosome's loci into two clusters, starting from the whole chromosome working its way down to individual loci (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). The partitioning was done using spectral clustering (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>), which finds the two loci clusters sharing the least number of chromosomal interactions. The recursive partitioning was repeated until the resulting chromosome clusters had &lt;2 loci. Eventually, the overall process forms a partition tree, which represents the nested hierarchical architecture of the chromatin structure (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>).</p>
      <p>Using BHi-Cect, we analyzed Hi-C data from human IMR90 chromosomes, in which interactions among the chromosome's loci were analyzed at a 50 kb resolution (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). We observed that BHi-Cect could isolate non-contiguous self-interacting loci clusters as indicated by the plaid pattern regions in the heatmap representation of the associated Hi-C data (e.g. the first partitioning in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). We confirmed that the isolated clusters were robustly detected when using datasets with different resolutions (5 kb–1 Mb), sparsity level, read depth, derived from different biological replicates and subjected to different normalisation schemes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figures S1, S2 and S4</xref>). Importantly, we noticed that BHi-Cect gave two kinds of bisection characterized by distinctive heatmap patterns derived from the resulting loci clusters. The first bisection kind, resulted in loci-clusters with similar interaction densities and covering different chromosome locations (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>, bottom left), indicating the presence of two strongly self-interacting chromosome-clusters nested within the original cluster. The second kind resulted in loci-clusters with interaction densities that were substantially higher in one compared to the other and covering deeply intersecting chromosome regions (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>, bottom right), indicating that the original cluster is composed of only one strongly self-interacting cluster with an associated auxiliary loci-cluster. These observations suggest that the clusters derived from our recursive partitioning display different hierarchical relations which can be efficiently represented with a tree structure whose branches will reflect the different nesting dynamics observed in the chromosome hierarchy.</p>
      <p>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref> shows an example of such a tree representation that captures the hierarchical relationships among the chromosome clusters, which we call the BHi-Cect partition tree (BPT). Here, the vertices in the BPT represent the chromosome clusters, and the branches from a vertex represent the existence of sub-clusters nested within the cluster. For convenience, we named branchings yielding one or two preferentially self-interacting chromosome clusters as strip and split branching respectively. By analyzing this BPT for every chromosome, we observed an extensive topological variety in terms of both tree depth and overall number of branching events (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). This highlights the variety of chromosome architecture both in terms of number of clusters found and their complexity.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="SEC3-2">
      <title>Enclaves as fundamental structural units</title>
      <p>Next we examined heatmap patterns in the genomic regions highlighted by the insulated loci clusters detected at different branching points (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">B</xref>). Since the detected clusters can be non-contiguous, we called them ‘enclaves’ to distinguish them from the more conventional contiguous clusters like TADs. Also, because enclaves have a parent-child relationship as described in the BPT, we classified them depending on their relative position in the BPT (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). Enclaves at the top of the BPT generally exhibited either the plaid patterns or entirely covered the heatmap (left column heatmaps in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). This indicated the presence of large-scale interwoven structures similar to compartments, and further suggested global interactions between loci across the whole chromosome. In terms of size, top enclaves spanned on average 120 Mb containing thousands of loci (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>). Enclaves lower in the BPT became smaller but the plaid-patterning or non-contiguity is retained (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>, middle and right column).</p>

      </fig>
      <p>Crucially, beyond delineating salient interaction patterns, we noticed how specific enclaves along the BPT highlighted topological features found in all BPTs. Typically, we observed that BPTs accumulated split branching at the top and then tended to have long streaks of strip branching toward their deeper end (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S5</xref>). We reasoned we could use these ‘universal’ topological features to systematize our description of BPTs and thus directly address their topological diversity showcased earlier (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). Briefly, we identified top enclaves as the deepest enclaves above which we only find split branching events; bottom enclaves as the highest enclaves below which we only find strip branching events and leaves as enclaves marking the end of the BPT (see Material and Methods). We verified the presence of these topological invariants with BPTs derived from Hi-C data with different resolutions (5 kb–1 Mb), from different cell types (IMR90, HUVEC and K562) and species (mouse and fly)(<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S5</xref>).</p>
      <p>Next, we examined the agreement of enclaves with compartments (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>) and TADs (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>) by computing the well-established variation of information metric (VI) (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>) between our enclave clustering and these benchmark clustering. Briefly, VI evaluates the level of agreement between two clusterings based on information theoretic quantities (see Materials and Methods). Our VI analysis confirmed that this agreement was significant (<italic>P</italic>-value &lt; 0.01) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>) and supported the visual agreement observed between bottom enclaves and TADs or compartments when comparing their respective heatmaps (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). The same trend was observed when using the average overlap metric (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S3</xref>). We further noticed that BHi-Cect could characterize the inner arrangement of TAD-like clusters into further nested clusters with a variety interaction patterns including, but not restricted to sub-TAD like structures (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S6</xref>). We also observed that this agreement extended to DNA loops. We evaluated the integration of DNA loops by computing the proportion of anchor sites pairs, characterizing a given DNA loop, that remained together within the same bottom enclave (see Materials and Methods). We noticed that with this metric, bottom enclaves by containing 79.9% of DNA loop anchor-site pairs, integrated DNA loops better than TADs (59.9%) detected at the same resolution (5 kb). Put together these observations support the notion that our enclave-based clustering integrates well with the current description of chromosome structure based on compartments, TADs or DNA loops.</p>

      <title>BHi-Cect segments the chromosome into functionally different clusters</title>
      <p>Following up on the observation that bottom enclaves coincided well with benchmark clusters (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>), we explored their potential biological relevance. We first examined the relation between the epigenomic context and the gene content of bottom enclaves. For this analysis we used the BHi-Cect results obtained at 5 kb resolution in IMR90 samples, to minimize the effect of binning. We summarized the epigenomic context of a given bottom enclave by computing the number of overlapping binding sites for a representative set of 10 transcription factors (TF) (see Material and Methods). We focused on characterizing the bottom enclave's TF content, because it outlines the regulatory context controlling the corresponding bottom enclave's gene content. We next characterized the variety of regulatory contexts formed by the different bottom enclaves as captured by their respective TF content. For this, we performed a correspondence analysis (CA) on the contingency table summarizing the number of binding sites for every TF found in each bottom enclave. Correspondence analysis is an extension of principal component analysis typically used to explore relationships between categorical variables, here bottom enclave and TF (see Materials and Methods). We found that the variety of TF contents found across bottom enclaves could be well summarized by the first two CA dimensions, accounting for 63.3% of the total variance (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>). Critically we noticed that bottom enclaves’ TF content could be described with respect to their relative position along two main ‘gradients’ in the reduced space formed by the first two CA dimensions (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>, left). Each of these gradient is characterized by a distinct set of TFs (MAFK vs. MAZ-MXI-RCOR1 and CEBP-FOS versus MAFK) and thus indicates that bottom enclaves vary mostly according to the relative prevalence in these distinct TFs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>, right).</p>

Structural proximity (x-axis) corresponds to the minimum number of branches needed to link the considered pair of bottom enclaves in their associated BHi-Cect tree. Functional similarity on the left plot corresponds to the euclidean distance between the considered bottom enclaves in the reduced space formed by the first two dimensions obtained from the TF-content based CA previously described. Functional similarity on the right plot corresponds to the semantic similarity (Resnik similarity) in terms of the significantly enriched GO-terms found in each of the considered bottom enclaves respectively.</p>

      <p>We next evaluated the extent to which the TF content of bottom enclaves associated with particular GO-terms through the GO annotation of the corresponding bottom enclaves’ genes. More specifically we performed a gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) where we ranked genes with respect to their corresponding bottom enclave's position along either the first or second CA-dimension (see Materials and Methods). We found that bottom enclaves characterized by an increased prevalence of MAZ, MXI and RCOR1, associated with GO-terms broadly corresponding to housekeeping functions (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>, first table). In contrast bottom enclaves characterized by an increased prevalence of MAFK, associated with GO-terms broadly corresponding to environmental or immune response (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>, second table). This highlights how bottom enclaves coincide with very distinct functions, the more comprehensive tables reporting these enriched GO-term sets can be seen in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Tables S3 and S4</xref>. For comparison, when comparing these GSEA results with results obtained by ranking genes based on their expression level, we couldn’t retrieve as significant results and, as expected, mostly found enrichment in ribosome functions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S2</xref>).</p>
      <p>We extended this analysis by next characterizing the GO-term enrichment associated with the prevalence of RNA polymerase II (RNAP2) in bottom enclaves. The GSEA results based on bottom enclave RNAP2 prevalence highlighted skin function, structural molecule activity (cytoskeleton) and DNA packaging (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>, third table). We found these functions to be consistent with the fibroblastic nature of the IMR90 cell line used for this analysis. We further found that applying this analysis based on H3K4me3 (active histone mark) prevalence in bottom enclaves derived from K562 Hi-C data (5 kb) highlighted mostly immune functions, which conforms well with the leukemic state of K562 cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>, fourth table). The more comprehensive tables reporting these enriched GO-term sets can be seen in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Tables S5–S6</xref>. We validated these results by running a similar GSEA using the same epigenomic marks (RNAP2 and H3K4me3) in the same samples (IMR90 and K562 respectively) but this time ranking genes based on the prevalence of these marks in the corresponding promoter regions. The results of these GSEA were more numerous in terms of significantly enriched GO-terms but also more heterogeneous (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Tables S7 and S8</xref>).</p>
      <p>We then examined whether this structure-function coupling could be extended beyond individual bottom enclaves by considering the BPT linking them. More specifically we evaluated how the BPT distance between pairs of bottom enclaves related to their corresponding functional similarity. Firstly we measured BPT distance by computing the minimum number of BPT branches required to join the considered bottom enclave pair. Secondly, we computed functional similarity based on the bottom enclaves’ TF content. Briefly, we computed the first two CA-dimensions derived from the contingency table summarizing the bottom enclave TF-content, as described earlier. We then computed the euclidean distance between the considered bottom enclave pair in that reduced space (TF-distance), to measure their functional similarity. When plotting BPT distance against the corresponding TF-distance we found a clear positive relation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>, left). We validated this relation by swapping the BPT distance for the chromosome coordinate distance between the same pairs of bottom enclaves (see Materials and Methods) and found the relation to be weaker as quantified by a Pearson correlation test (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>). We further confirmed this relation by swapping the TF-distance between bottom enclaves with the semantic similarity (Resnik similarity) in terms of the enriched GO-terms found respectively in each of the members of the considered bottom enclave pair (see Materials and Methods). Remarkably, 72% of bottom enclaves (3128/4361) displayed significantly enriched GO-terms and we also found the same relation, with the semantic similarity decreasing as we consider bottom enclaves located further apart in the BPT (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>, right). These results indicate that the overall chromosome architecture captured by the BPT also is coupled with the functionality of the chromosome regions it clusters.</p>

      <title>The position along the BPT coincides with DNA activity</title>
      <p>To extend our analysis beyond bottom enclaves, we next examined the biological relevance of the BPT as a whole. More specifically, we analyzed the relation of the chromosome's hierarchical structure, as captured by the whole BPT, with the biology of the underlying DNA. To this end, we systematically explored how different epigenomic features varied as we considered loci present at different positions or depths along the whole BPT. We quantified this depth based on the branching events that shape our BPT. Briefly, we defined a score, which we call ‘nestedness’, for each locus accounting for the number of branching events necessary to reach the locus relative to the total number of branching found in the considered BPT (see Materials and Methods). The reason we talk of nestedness, relates to the observation that branching events indicate the presence of some loci further preferentially self-interacting within the already found cluster. This suggests that the degree of confinement or nestedness for every locus within the chromosome architecture can be evaluated from the number of associated branching events. We further needed our nestedness score to universally apply to every BPT despite their characteristic topological diversity (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). To achieve this, we will leverage the topological invariants identified earlier (top/bottom enclaves and BPT leaves). Briefly, we set the nestedness score of these BPT positions to 0 for top enclaves, 0.5 for bottom enclaves and 1 for BPT leaves. We then linearly interpolate nestedness scores for any intermediary BPT positions (see Materials and Methods).</p>
      <p>Using this score on 50 kb IMR90 Hi-C data, we observed that the highly nested regions in enclaves tended to be accumulated in relatively narrow genomic regions spanning hundreds of kb with relatively higher interaction frequencies (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">C</xref>). In contrast, less nested regions spanned tens of Mb with relatively lower interaction frequencies.</p>

      </fig>
      <p>Next, we explored the physiological implications of nestedness by comparing it with previously reported epigenomic datasets (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). To comprehensively capture the multiple facets of epigenomic activity we considered the following epigenomic features: DNase accessibility, lamina associated domain (LAD), histone modifications as integrated by chromHMM annotations (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>), CAGE clusters, short and long read RNA-seq peaks, DNA-binding factor binding site for 10 representative TFs, RNAP2 and three chromatin remodeling factor binding sites (CTCF, RAD21 and CHD1).</p>

        <graphic xlink:href="gkaa004fig6"/>
      </fig>
      <p>When examining the epigenomic influence of nestedness across the whole BPT we noticed a clear antagonism between top and bottom enclave trends (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). Within top enclaves, we observed a progressive enrichment in epigenomic activity with nestedness. This is indicated by increased enrichment in active DNA marks such as DNase accessibility or transcription chromHMM annotations matched by a depletion of inactive DNA marks, such as LAD overlap or heterochromatin chromHMM labels, as we consider increasingly nested loci. This top enclave trend contrasts with the progressive depletion in epigenomic activity with increased nestedness observed within bottom enclaves. This antagonism results in loci present at the boundary between top and bottom enclaves, in terms of nestedness, concentrating the relatively more active regions within the chromosome. Furthermore we noticed that the long range interactions harbored by boundary-loci coincided with a significant enrichment in chromatin remodeling factors like CTCF (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref> bottom right), indicating that active looping mechanisms are bringing those distant genomic regions together. These trends suggest that the boundary loci correspond to the active and open chromatin regions of the chromosome. These trends were further observed in human umbilical vein endothelial and K562 (leukemic) cell lines suggesting their generalizability (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S10</xref>). We further validated these trends by running the same analysis with randomly generated BPT clustering of the corresponding Hi-C data and observed a complete loss of the trends described above (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S11</xref>).</p>
      <p>We also noticed that the average number of overlaps between the considered epigenomic features and the loci of interest provided the most consistent trend along nestedness (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S7</xref>) compared to average ‘intensity’ of the epigenomic features, whether it be average ChIP-Seq, CAGE or RNA-seq peak intensity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S8</xref>) or overlap size for epigenomic annotation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S9</xref>). This indicates that nestedness is most correlated with the density of epigenomic activity found across chromosome loci. The significance of the observed enrichment or depletion is reported in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S9</xref>.</p>

    <title>DISCUSSION</title>
    <p>This paper introduces BHi-Cect, a spectral clustering method to chart insulated, non-contiguous and nested chromosome clusters, which we map using our novel BPT framework. We developed a hierarchical description of chromosome structure, that provides key insights into chromatin architecture.</p>
    <p>Previous methods using spectral clustering applied to Hi-C focused on determining the scale at which the found clusters best matched already known clusters such as TADs or compartments (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35–37</xref>). Our clustering method augments existing structural descriptions by using the BPT representation for chromosome structure, which efficiently captures the diversity of hierarchical relations bridging the variety of preferentially self-interacting clusters that make up the chromosome.</p>
    <p>A unique feature of BHi-Cect is how it dynamically delineates chromosome clusters that emphasize the salient interaction patterns found in the input data. Notably, we show that with low resolution Hi-C data (50 kb), BHi-Cect highlights global clusters spanning the whole chromosome while with high resolution Hi-C data (5 kb), BHi-Cect will focus on local chromosome clusters spanning less than 1 Mb. We show how these different clustering outcomes are self consistent and agree well with corresponding global (compartments) and local (TADs) benchmark chromosome clusters.</p>
    <p>A key finding are enclaves, which are a novel form of chromosome clusters identified by our method, that are mostly non-contiguous and deeply interwoven. Critically our method targets preferentially self-interacting clusters expected to be arranged as a tightly packed ‘core’ loci-cluster nested within a looser ‘shell’ of long-ranging DNA loops. Enclaves complement TAD-based description of chromosome structure by offering a much more diverse and flexible range of possible conformations that supports the irregular chromosome organisation suggested by others, notably in a recent electron microscopy study (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). In this framework the overall structure of chromatin is shaped by different levels of compaction that generate 3D nuclear domains in which DNA is made more or less concentrated and thereby accessible by looping the flexible DNA fiber at various lengths and creating contacts between and within distant chromosome regions.</p>
    <p>Bottom enclaves are clusters found in all BPTs and capture key aspects of the structure-function coupling at play in the genome. Our CA results highlight how the bottom enclave's TF-content shapes distinct regulatory regimes. We found that the prevalence of MAZ, MXI, USF2 and RCOR1 in bottom enclaves indicated a ‘steady’ regulatory regime typically associated with housekeeping genes. In contrast, we found that the prevalence of MAFK in bottom enclaves indicated a ‘dynamic’ regulatory regime typically associated with environmental or immune response genes. This illustrates how chromosome clusters can form quite distinct regulatory micro-environments for the genes contained within them. GSEA results focusing on the prevalence of RNAP2 and H3K4me3 in bottom enclaves, indicated the colocalization of genes whose function directly contributed to biological functions of the considered cell lines (cytoskeleton and skin function enrichment in IMR90 fibroblast samples or immune function enrichment in K562 leukemia samples). Since the prevalence of RNAP2 or active histone marks (H3K4me3) promote transcription, this trend could indicate a direct involvement of chromosome structure in the functional specialization of the cell, by setting distinct micro-environments for specific gene sets to activate particular biological processes. Furthermore we argue that the more focused and biologically relevant set of functions highlighted by the 3D regulatory context provided by bottom enclaves supplements the more significant but heterogeneous set of functions highlighted by the 1D regulatory context provided by promoters. Overall these results suggest an integral structure-function coupling between the regulatory context of bottom enclaves and the gene content of bottom enclaves.</p>
    <p>Our analysis integrating loci nestedness and corresponding epigenomic features showed key implications stemming from our description of chromosome architecture. Inspired by early Hi-C results, revealing the correspondence between Hi-C data and a fractal globule conformation of the chromosome (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>), we developed the notion of nestedness. Critically nestedness, or the notion that structural hierarchy in the chromosome is driven by the tendency of smaller clusters to be nested within larger clusters, significantly coincided with epigenomic activity (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). We show that along this hierarchy, the transition into bottom enclaves harbors the maximal density for active DNA marks and that the most nested clusters (BPT leaves) display the maximal density for inactive DNA marks. Coupled with the trends observed for LADs, DNase and chromatin remodeling factors (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>), this could indicate that BPT leaves represent compact anchoring regions attached to the nuclear lamina, wrapped by a shell of DNA loops with chromatin remodeling factors (e.g. CTCF, RAD21, CHD1) co-localizing active chromosome regions into bottom enclaves to form transcription factory-like structures (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S13</xref>).</p>
    <p>Our results also suggest that depending on the position along the enclave hierarchy the cluster is found, different mechanisms might be shaping the strong loci-interaction observed within it. Firstly, for both top and bottom levels of hierarchy, increased nestedness is driven by the average increase in interaction frequency between the considered loci (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>). Secondly, this trend draws different epigenomic implications depending on whether we consider top or bottom levels of chromosome hierarchy. At the top level, increase in interaction frequency enables the colocalization of biologically active DNA regions. This contrasts with the trend observed at the bottom level of hierarchy where an increase in interaction frequency along nestedness colocalizes loci enriched in inactive DNA marks and LADs. This antagonism between top and bottom enclaves in terms of what kind of DNA marks get brought together by increased interaction strength, implies that possibly different factors and mechanisms might be setting these strong interactions at these different hierarchical levels of chromosome structure. This notion was hypothesized and tested in a recent simulation study (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). In this paper they argue that loop extrusion is setting local structures while phase separation is the driver of global cluster formation in the chromosome. A similar dynamic equilibrium between competing molecular mechanisms could also explain the trends we observed, though the details of which cannot be inferred with the present analysis.</p>
    <p>In conclusion, our method and the identified chromatin hierarchical structure may serve as a framework for drawing inferences from Hi-C and other advanced genome-wide studies toward unveiling key architectural principles guiding chromatin conformation. Further research should be done to examine how the arrangement of enclaves varies across tissues while integrating other known features of chromatin architecture, such as biophysical constraints derived from <italic>in vitro</italic> and molecular dynamics studies (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>) or DNA binding factor content derived from molecular biology studies (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>), to better inform the segmentation of the chromosome into more biologically realistic structures.</p>
