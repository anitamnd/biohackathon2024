      <p>The Center for Genetically
Encoded Materials (C-GEM) is an NSF
Phase I Center for Chemical Innovation that comprises six laboratories
spread across three university campuses. Our success as a multi-institution
research team demanded the development of a software infrastructure,
GEM-NET, that allows all C-GEM members to work together seamlessly—as
though everyone was in the same room. GEM-NET was designed to support
both science and communication by integrating task management, scheduling,
data sharing, and collaborative document and code editing with frictionless
internal and public communication; it also maintains security over
data and internal communications. In this Article, we document the
design and implementation of GEM-NET: our objectives and motivating
goals, how each component contributes to these goals, and the lessons
learned throughout development. We also share open source code for
several custom applications and document how GEM-NET can benefit users
in multiple fields and teams that are both small and large. We anticipate
that this knowledge will guide other multi-institution teams, regardless
of discipline, to plan their software infrastructure and utilize it
as swiftly and smoothly as possible.</p>

    <title>Introduction</title>
    <p>Multi-institutional
teamwork and center-based cross-disciplinary
research are associated with high scientific impact<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref></sup> and
have become ubiquitous within academia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>−<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref></sup> and industry.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref></sup> Many academic
and industrial teams span multiple and geographically distant research
sites, operate in different time zones, and favor different languages.
These “virtual” collaborations are supported by a proliferation
of Internet-based collaboration tools<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref></sup> that
facilitate natural communication between individuals in different
locations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>−<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref></sup> and across disciplines.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>−<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref></sup> The popularity
of remote collaboration has prompted efforts to formalize best practices
for virtual teams<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>−<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref></sup> and multiteam systems.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref></sup> Nonetheless,
it remains challenging to select and customize tools that allow a
virtual team within an academic specialty to manage large projects,
fulfilling the requirements of task management, scheduling, data sharing,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref></sup> data security, document and code collaboration,
and scientific and social team communication and coordination.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref>−<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34">34</xref></sup> Coordination challenges, in particular, increase with larger and
more heterogeneous teams or when more institutions are involved.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref36">36</xref></sup> This challenge is more demanding
still when constrained by an academic budget. Herein we describe the
design and implementation of GEM-NET, a set of more than 20 integrated
tools that support the research and broader impact activities of the
Center for Genetically Encoded Materials (C-GEM), an NSF Center for
Chemical Innovation. C-GEM spans three universities, at least five
disciplines, and six different laboratories and involves research
by more than 20 scientists. Here we present our design objectives
and motivating goals, provide details of each tool, and discuss the
lessons learned during the initial two years of GEM-NET development.</p>
  </sec>
  <sec id="sec2">
    <title>Design
Objectives</title>
    <p>A well-designed software infrastructure that adequately
supports
the interdependent processes of teamwork and taskwork<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref37">37</xref></sup> can dramatically enhance the success of a collaboration.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref39">39</xref></sup> For C-GEM, we sought to minimize the administrative lag between
the conception of research ideas and their execution, promote effective
communication and team cognition,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref41">41</xref></sup> develop a
knowledge infrastructure that stimulates new ideas, and fully document
scientific results.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref42">42</xref></sup> We also sought to
account for the team’s needs in early project phases and anticipate
changes in those needs over time, as C-GEM and GEM-NET itself went
through iterated phases of planning, implementation, and research
translation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref43">43</xref></sup> Our design also considered
human and social factors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref45">45</xref></sup> and sought to promote
a sense of common identity, team spirit, and personal investment in
the team’s success.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref46">46</xref></sup> We recognized
that in any transdisciplinary collaboration, members inevitably exhibit
different degrees of enthusiasm for adopting new platforms and altering
working habits.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref></sup> The workflows of constituent
laboratories may have been refined over many years, so one must be
prepared to accommodate these workflows where necessary or justify
the cost in time and effort of significant changes.</p>
  </sec>
  <sec id="sec2.1">
    <title>Step 1: Defining
Objectives</title>
    <p>Involving the entire team in software decision-making
by consulting
everyone about their work patterns, preferred software, and teamwork
strategies will result in a well-tailored design in which the team
can feel invested.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref47">47</xref></sup> In addition to representing
a wise starting point for software infrastructure design, an early
consultation process allows a smooth transition to the vital cycle
of seeking feedback<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref48">48</xref></sup> on user experience
and responding with refinements that will continue for the life of
the collaboration. Once informed by discussions with the team, the
infrastructure designer should create a list of objectives that define
the characteristics and functionality of the collaboration tools.
These objectives will serve as a checklist against which software
options can be evaluated and a reference point for future software
changes or customizations. This process is the equivalent of writing
the all-important “functional specification” in traditional
software design.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref49">49</xref></sup> Pinning down objectives
before launching into implementation gives the best chance for an
optimized design and swift construction. The objectives list for GEM-NET
(<xref rid="box1" ref-type="other">Box 1</xref>) is likely to be widely applicable
across fields and team sizes.<graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="oc-2019-001114_0009" id="box1" position="float"/></p>
  </sec>
  <sec id="sec3">
    <title>Tools</title>
    <p>On the basis
of our design objectives, we assembled a suite of
over 20 tools, including two custom-built applications that fulfilled
the needs of C-GEM. All tools are free or use the “freemium”
model (offering premium features for a fee). For each tool, we have
gathered details of benefits, version limitations, costs, setup times,
and dependencies and information on how they scale to large teams
(<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="other">Table <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="other">1</xref></xref>, <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acscentsci.9b00111/suppl_file/oc9b00111_si_001.pdf">Supplementary Table 1</ext-link>). The tools are highly
interlinked (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref></xref>) but can be broadly partitioned into seven categories: access control,
data storage, data browsing, project monitoring, teamwork, internal
communication, and public engagement. These categories are described
in turn later.</p>

  <sec id="sec4">
    <title>User Administration and Access Control (G Suite for Education,
Google Groups)</title>
    <p>Associating each team member with a primary
online identity and
using this identity for tool access greatly simplifies access control
and links team members to their associated data across services. To
manage these identities, and to satisfy our requirements for fine-grained
access control, we took advantage of Google’s Web-based applications
and services<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref50">50</xref></sup> through Google’s
G Suite. G Suite can create and manage user accounts for an organization
and bundle a wide range of Google’s popular services (Google
Calendar, Docs, Sheets, Drive, and many more) that are linked to the
organization’s domain name. As an official university-affiliated
center with responsibilities for teaching and training graduate students
and postdoctoral associates, C-GEM was eligible for the free academic
edition, G Suite for Education, which we linked to our domain “<uri xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="http://gem-net.net">gem-net.net</uri>”.</p>
    <p>For maximum
flexibility in setting up online identities for the
team and managing access privileges, we use Google Groups. Google
Groups is a service that manages e-mail address lists that can be
used to access control and mailing lists. Every C-GEM member was added
to a user group called everyone@gem-net.net using a domain-associated
account (e.g., “alanna@gem-net.net”) or generic Google-associated
account of their choice. Permissions assigned to a user group are
inherited by everyone in that group, so adding the “everyone”
group to Calendar and Team Drive, for example, grants everyone access
to these services. This association of user groups with authorization
allows a “single sign-on” approach, where one needs
only a single set of credentials to access multiple services, and
readily extends to custom apps. Custom apps can use Google’s
Oauth service for authentication and test for group membership using
the Directory API to unlock private features. We found that all members
opted for the convenience of using a pre-existing account rather than
creating a new “gem-net” account, allowing C-GEM resources
to be immediately visible in Google applications without the burden
of account switching.</p>
    <p>Group-based authorization can also be
used to provide flexibility
in account deprovisioning. Departing researchers could be moved from
a full-access group to a partial access-group, granting them read-only
access to select data and applications. For fine control over permissions,
groups can be nested within other groups, inheriting their access.</p>
  </sec>
  <sec id="sec5">
    <title>Data
Storage (Team Drive, Benchling, Strains List)</title>
    <p>To tailor a
data storage strategy to the specific data types being
handled, tool selection should incorporate the consideration of likely
file sizes, formats, indexing requirements (which features of the
data should be searchable?), and editing requirements (will files
be modified after storage?). C-GEM’s data needs led us to the
combination of a general purpose tool, a tool geared toward sequence
data, and a custom tool to serve as a directory for our biospecimen
repository.</p>
    <p>Our general purpose file storage tool is Google’s
Team Drive.
Team Drive is the cloud file management service in G Suite, extending
the functionality of the personal-account Drive service by providing
a shared file space that can be accessed by a whole team. At the time
of writing, the Team Drive provides unlimited file space and allows
members to upload and sync files up to 5 TB in size, providing an
opportunity for far more than archival storage of drafts and publications.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref51">51</xref></sup> C-GEM uses this service to share all of its
documents, including meeting minutes, progress reports, proposals,
protocols, blog post drafts, all organized in subdirectories that
can be accessed in Web browsers, in the Google Drive mobile app, or
on the desktop using the File Stream app (note: File Stream requires
a domain-associated user account).</p>
    <p>For the purpose of storing
and managing nucleotide sequence data,
the raw data used frequently by C-GEM, we use the sequence-focused
platform Benchling. Benchling allows sequences to be manually imported,
created from scratch, or directly downloaded from various public repositories
using a search interface. Sequences are grouped into “projects”
and stored in either a personal account or in the common storage area
of an “Organization” account. Our team stores its sequences
in the “GEM-NET” organization or in lab-specific organizations
as appropriate. Benchling includes an array of tools for annotating,
analyzing, aligning, and manipulating sequences, providing URLs that
let sequences be shared in editable or read-only form. Benchling gives
each sequence a unique identifier, which allows C-GEM to link every
experimental result back to the original sequence and its associated
metadata.</p>
    <p>The third strand of our data storage strategy is the
management
of our biospecimen repository, also known as the C-GEM Strains List.
The Strains List contains the subset of Benchling sequences that correspond
to “real-world” physical specimens in our laboratories.
This repository is stored as a shared spreadsheet, built using Google
Sheets and accessible in the Team Drive. The fields included in the
spreadsheet were selected so that each strain record is clear and
unambiguous but minimal enough that it is not laborious to manually
add new entries. Fields include physical location, organism (e.g., <italic>E. coli</italic>), strain (e.g., <italic>DH5alpha</italic>), plasmid
name, marker (e.g., <italic>Cb</italic>), origin (e.g., pBR322), promoter
(e.g., <italic>T7</italic>), extended description, benchling URL,
and submitting member. By gathering and maintaining this information
as a shared resource, we ensure its continuity when team members depart
and allow current and future members to know what is in our specimen
collections at a glance. We intend to release a version of this repository
to the public, as its size and meticulous annotation would make it
a valuable resource for the biochemistry community.</p>
  </sec>
  <sec id="sec6">
    <title>Data Browsing
(Strains App, Portal, Protocols)</title>
    <p>Whereas tools for data storage
generally include the ability to
browse and search the stored data, achieving the desired level of
data querying functionality may require the construction of additional
purpose-built tools. Creating a new layer of software for browsing
and searching has the additional benefits of enabling data aggregation
from multiple independent tools and helping to maintain data integrity,
preventing accidental modification by separating the data entry from
data reading operations. Building these custom applications requires
that the associated data storage tools expose their data through open
APIs. Using these APIs and constructing custom interfaces requires
programming knowledge, but this area is one where a little effort
goes a long way: most of the development “heavy lifting”
is done by libraries that allow one to create a basic Web server with
only a few lines of code, and even the most simple data merging functionality
can pay dividends. C-GEM uses two custom applications that harness
tool APIs and shares all source code for both on its GitHub account
(<uri xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://github.com/gem-net">https://github.com/gem-net</uri>). Both tools were built by a single developer (the first author
of this Article) in the Python language using the Flask Web server
library.</p>
    <p>Our first purpose-built tool is the C-GEM Strains App.
This application
has two main functions: It offers a convenient way to browse the strain
repository, and it offers “shipment requests”, allowing
any member of the team to request the delivery of any given strain.
Leveraging the Google Sheets API, the Strains App gathers the strains
from each lab worksheet and uses the Bokeh visualization library to
create an interactive browsing interface (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>). Strain characteristics (e.g., the <italic>marker</italic>, <italic>strain</italic>, and <italic>origin</italic> fields) are aggregated in a bar chart, and selecting these bars
(by touch or mouse-click) whittles down the data, which are shown
in a sortable table underneath. Clicking on a strain in the data table
brings the user to a request form to order the strain and provide
contact details. The appropriate lab is notified of new requests (with
notifications delivered to the members listed in the Strains List)
and can discuss shipment progress with the requester on a dedicated
discussion page. Overview pages allow all shipment requests to be
monitored at a glance.</p>

    <p>Our second custom application
is the GEM-NET Portal, a private
resource for C-GEM members. The portal provides a handy dashboard
of resource links, upcoming Google Calendar items, recently modified
documents in our Team Drive, and a summary of active and completed
shipment requests from our Strains app and will soon be expanded to
show personalized task lists (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref></xref>). By pulling data from all of the C-GEM tools, the
portal provides a high-level summary of data and progress in a single
location, reducing the burden on members to log in to individual services.</p>

    <p>The portal is also a natural home for resources that team
members
need to access frequently. Where these resources are files or folders
in the Team Drive, their metadata can be extracted using the Google
Drive API and used in specialized browsing interfaces within the Portal.
Indeed, this approach is currently being used for our growing collection
of chemistry protocols. The experimental protocol for each synthetic
step used to produce a desired compound is stored in its own subdirectory
of our “chemistry protocols” Team Drive folder, comprising
a document and corresponding image and data files (e.g., NMR). To
make these folders as easy to browse as possible, the Portal features
a dedicated Protocols page where entries can be explored at a user
level without having to open Google Drive (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref></xref>).</p>

    <title>Project Monitoring</title>
    <p>Our project monitoring
needs are met by Asana. Asana is a project
management tool that lets teams organize and follow tasks and subtasks
in lists or kanban-style boards, designate assignees and due dates,
and attach files and comments to task items. C-GEM structures its
task lists as six Asana “Projects” that correspond to
the six “Impact Areas” delineated during our initial
Strategic Planning Meeting: Management, Education, Innovation, Participation,
Communication, and Research. Using the Asana API, we imported our
lists of action items for each project, setting assignees, due dates,
and extended descriptions. With initial tasks in place, each member
could see an “inbox” list of tasks assigned to them
(or any other team member) ordered by due date and would receive weekly
summaries and notifications of impending deadlines. For highly interdependent
tasks, sublists of items were created and assigned to different individuals.
This centralized “to-do list” allows everyone on the
team to monitor the progress of the collaboration in real time and
provides a record of this progress through the history of completed
tasks.</p>
  </sec>
  <sec id="sec8">
    <title>Teamwork: Collaborating on Documents and Code</title>
    <p>The ability
to work together on documents is crucial to any academic
collaboration, and for this task we use Google Docs. Google Docs has
transformed the way people can remotely collaborate on documents by
allowing multiple users to work on the same document simultaneously.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref52">52</xref></sup> This simultaneous access removes the need to
circulate draft documents by e-mail, accelerating the writing and
revision process—an important consideration for an agile team
with trainees as major contributors who have an urgent need to publish<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref53">53</xref></sup>— and also provides a way to designate
access privileges to contributing users. We also make use of Google
Sheets and Google Slides, which offer the same concurrent editing
ability for spreadsheets and presentations, respectively. Each of
these cloud services maintains a history of all file changes, with
the ability to create named versions, making it easy to revert to
past versions. They also make it possible to create comment threads
on any part of the file and convert comments into tasks that can be
assigned to specific users.</p>
    <p>When writing manuscripts, our team
uses the Paperpile Google Docs
add-on to add citations. The free version of Paperpile allows one
to search for publications based on identifiers such as author name,
title, DOI, or ISBN, to edit reference details, and to generate citations
and document bibliography using journal-specific formatting, all without
leaving the document.</p>
    <p>For collaborative reference management
outside of Google Docs,
we use Mendeley. Mendeley lets teams create public or private groups
that store a shared reference library, accessible by a Web browser
or a desktop app. Browser plugins and search functionality make it
very easy to add references to the library, and references can be
exported in multiple formats. C-GEM uses Mendeley to manage its Web
site publication list.</p>
    <p>Our team also collaborates on code. C-GEM
code is organized in
“repositories” on GitHub using a free GitHub for Education
organization account. GitHub repositories can be synchronized with
local copies on team members’ machines, where they are managed
with the tool “Git”. Git is a version control system
that maintains a complete version history of the code and allows features
to be developed in isolated “branches” before being
merged with the main codebase. The C-GEM Web site,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref54">54</xref></sup> the Strains App, and the GEM-NET Portal are all developed
using Git and GitHub.</p>
  </sec>
  <sec id="sec9">
    <title>Internal Communication and Coordination</title>
    <p>C-GEM has managed to almost entirely replace e-mail using the communication
software Slack. Slack is a messaging system that can be used from
a Web browser or from mobile and desktop apps. Messages are published
to topic-specific “channels” which can either be public
to the team or private to a list of members. Slack also offers private,
direct messaging, and fine-grained control over user notifications.
This centralization of our team communication makes it very easy to
communicate, find messages when they are needed, and share message
history with new members. Slack has become our go-to platform for
day-to-day scientific interaction, such as protocol sharing and troubleshooting.
Slack features emoji, which have been demonstrated to enhance user
satisfaction and convey a sense of personal communication.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref56">56</xref></sup></p>
    <p>Slack can be integrated with a large number of third party
services
that can enhance its functionality. Using the Asana integration, our
team members are notified in a private channel when tasks are assigned
to them or when a deadline is approaching, and they can update the
tasks directly from Slack. To stay up to date with current literature,
we created a gem-net domain user account that subscribes to multiple
Google Scholar alerts, and use an IFTTT applet to generate new posts
in a “publications” channel when alert e-mails arrive.</p>
    <p>C-GEM meetings are primarily conducted as video conferences using
the software Zoom. We have access to Pro accounts through Yale University,
which (as with free accounts) can support up to 100 participants in
a call. To maintain a record of our meetings, we record meeting minutes
and comments live in a shared Google Docs file and add slides to a
shared Google Slides presentation. Presenters are granted control
of the meeting slides using Zoom’s remote control function.</p>
    <p>To schedule meetings and other events, C-GEM uses a centralized
calendar in Google Calendar. As with other Google tools, we control
access based on the membership of our “everyone” Google
Group, allowing team members to see the C-GEM calendar alongside their
personal calendars. Google Calendar allows timezone-specific scheduling,
which is useful for geographically dispersed collaborations, and its
API and Slack integration make it easy to link to other applications.</p>
  </sec>
  <sec id="sec10">
    <title>Public
Engagement</title>
    <p>To share news and events with the outside world,
we use three primary
outlets: Twitter, the GEM-NET Web site, and the C-GEM podcast.</p>
    <p>Our team makes frequent use of Twitter using the handle @cgem_cci
to share short updates, to keep up with breaking science news, and
to converse directly with the public. Propagating scientific knowledge
via Twitter has been argued to broaden audiences, speed up communication,
force clearer and more concise descriptions of a researcher’s
work,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref57">57</xref></sup> and even potentially reorganize
semantic thinking.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref58">58</xref></sup> In August 2018, we
held our first Twitter Q&amp;A in partnership with the American Chemical
Society, responding to questions from the public that included the
hashtag “#AskCGEM”. To allow multiple team members to
tweet from our account, we use the “Team” feature of
TweetDeck, specifying personal accounts that can post on behalf of
C-GEM.</p>
    <p>The GEM-NET Web site (<uri xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="http://gem-net.net">http://gem-net.net</uri>) is the central resource for information
about C-GEM. It details
our mission and gives a primer on the underlying science; it introduces
our team, with bios for investigators; and it includes our publications
list, contact information, and links to other C-GEM resources on the
Web. Frequently updated information can be found on our “Updates”
page, where visitors can see our Twitter feed and listings for C-GEM
news and events. The Web site is also home to our “Chemical
Matters” blog, where our team posts about recent advances in
the literature, and features a landing page for our podcast, with
the ability to stream episodes and read show notes for each episode.
The Web site is set up to be easily modified to accommodate new types
of content in the future, as we develop educational materials, videos,
and a partnership with the citizen-science videogame EteRNA.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref59">59</xref></sup></p>
    <p>Our Web site was built using the static
Web site generator Jekyll.
Jekyll simplifies Web site building by separating text content from
code for page structure and styling and can generate a blog (or other
collection of pages with a shared template) from a folder of text
files. Text content can be written in Markdown, which provides an
intuitive, easy-to-learn, easy-to-read syntax for creating Web page
elements that Jekyll converts to HTML. This ease-of-use enables anyone
on our team to update Web site content. Because Markdown is a superset
of HTML, we can mix in HTML to accomplish functionality that is not
covered by the basic syntax.</p>
    <p>There are numerous prebuilt Jekyll
“themes” available
online that can be used to handle page structure and styling. We use
the blog-oriented “Minimal Mistakes” theme,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref60">60</xref></sup> which allows public commenting on blog posts,
among other features. Plugins enable more complicated functionality,
such as generating the RSS feed for our blog (using jekyll-feed),
automatically building our interactive publications page from a Mendeley
bibtex file (with jekyll-scholar), and embedding our Twitter feed
(with jekyll-twitter-plugin). When performing Web site updates, we
first test changes locally using Jekyll’s built-in Web server,
then push the final Web site files to GitHub, which provides free
Web site hosting through GitHub Pages.</p>
    <p>Our other public outlet
is our podcast, which we record and release
with the help of the Yale Broadcasting and Media Center. There are
numerous podcasting hosting platforms available. We opted for SoundCloud,
releasing our episodes as a “set” (i.e., playlist) within
the Yale’s SoundCloud account. For each set, SoundCloud generates
an RSS feed, the file used by podcast aggregation and subscription
services. This feed is compatible with iTunes, one of the largest
podcast aggregators. Uploading the feed to iTunes makes the podcast
available through Apple Podcasts and numerous other subscription services
that automatically pull from the iTunes Store, such as Overcast, PlayerFM,
and Blubrry. Some aggregators require extra information to be embedded
within the RSS feed, so to maximize compatibility (and further customize
metadata, such as images and contact information), we modify our SoundCloud
feed using a script that is available on our GitHub account.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref61">61</xref></sup> We host this customized feed on our Web site
and use it to list the podcast with Google Play Music, TuneIn (which
makes the podcast available through Amazon’s Alexa), Stitcher,
Spotify, and others, all of which provide listings for free.</p>

    <title>Discussion:
Lessons from GEM-NET</title>
    <p>In the course of developing our current
software infrastructure,
we encountered the occasional instructive challenge—little
quirks in software or bumps in the road to teamwork efficiency. We
list a few of these here, in the form of six lessons.</p>
    <p>Lesson
1: <italic>There are no perfect all-in-one tools</italic>. Our initial
efforts at software infrastructure design focused on
tools that bridged categories, meeting as many of our needs as possible,
but these invariably lost out to tools that do one thing well. We
hoped, for example, to find software that can manage tasks and handle
all internal communication. But the messaging options provided by
task management software were too limited or cumbersome to suit the
flexibility and control we desired, and the messaging-oriented tools
we tried lacked the full functionality we hoped for in task management
software. This example is one of several cases of overlap in tool
functionality, but our setup avoids confusing redundancy by matching
a single purpose with a single tool (satisfying our “simplicity”
objective). A desire to limit costs also limits potential redundancies,
as the free versions of the chosen software have less overlap. For
instance, Paperpile could replicate Mendeley’s reference library
management, but only in the premium version, whereas Mendeley cannot
format citations in a Google Doc. Slack could support multiuser video
conferencing, but only in the premium version. Our choice of Zoom
for video conferencing rather than Hangouts Meet, which is included
in G Suite, was based on its recording and remote control abilities
and—crucially—on its service being provided free through
our university. Hangouts Meet could be a good free alternative for
other teams.</p>
    <p>Lesson 2: <italic>Trial new tools with real tasks,
not generic
demos</italic>. We have had the most success launching new tools when
team members are given a walkthrough that performs a real, team-relevant
task, shortly followed by the team trying out the tool to accomplish
something that actually needs to be done. This boosts learning, promotes
software uptake, quickly reveals shortcomings of the tools, and makes
efficient use of everyone’s time. A corollary is that tools
are ready for launch only after enough customization and testing to
handle real use.</p>
    <p>Lesson 3: <italic>Some tools are only effective
once everyone is
using them</italic>. This is especially true for messaging and task
management. If the whole team is not active on Slack, then your message
to the team will not get to everyone, and you will find yourself falling
back on e-mail. If members do not update tasks in Asana, project statuses
quickly diverge from reality. Both of these scenarios happened in
the early days of C-GEM. We found e-mail particularly hard to phase
out and still fall back on it occasionally. The tools listed in this
paper are still <italic>useful</italic> to those who use them, but
that usefulness is limited, and partial uptake may lead to inefficient,
redundant systems, and faltering usage. The solution is in the next
two lessons.</p>
    <p>Lesson 4: <italic>A team leader should make tool
use mandatory</italic>. The quickest way to achieve full uptake for
a tool is to have someone
in a leadership role apply pressure on everyone to use it. If the
tool is worthwhile, then the utility of the tool (and cost of not
using it) will be evident to the team in the first use, so an initial
nudge should suffice to solve the coordination problem of Lesson 3.</p>
    <p>Lesson 5: <italic>Administrative oversight and role designation
are important</italic>. In principle, the software listed here could
let a team operate in a self-organizing way, with everyone adding
their own tasks, posting blog entries and tweets, and keeping data
up to date. However, in practice, designated administrators will prove
necessary for chasing things up and filling in gaps. We rely on an
administrator to take the lead writing up minutes, to create and assign
tasks based on meeting discussions, to check up on people near deadlines,
to send reminders about upcoming meetings, and to nudge people to
update collaborative documents. Building momentum on Twitter also
required a designated principal tweeter, and updating the Web site
fell to a specific team member. (Markdown proved a bridge too far
for most of the team, so blog posts are often submitted as Word documents,
then converted by the Web site administrator.) Even more importantly,
the administrator is responsible for monitoring and promoting team
engagement on GEM-NET and identifying any barriers that may be hindering
participation.</p>
    <p>Lesson 6: <italic>Make the occasional concession
to chaos (or,
perfect is the enemy of good)</italic>. In some cases, we found that
a planned “optimum” workflow gave way to an easier-to-attain
alternative, as with the blog posting method mentioned above. Another
example is in Benchling, where sequence data would ideally be organized
within projects in the C-GEM Benchling account and annotated according
to a precise set of rules. This would obviate the need for an independent
Strains List, make all sequence data available through the Benchling
API, and allow our Strains app to extract the repository directly
from Benchling and offer extended functionality. Instead, we found
it more practical for laboratories and individual users to manage
their sequences however it suited them. We also found that the simplicity
and ease of access of the independent Strains List made it very easy
to keep up to date and helped it become one of our most frequently
used tools—benefits that may outweigh the potential data redundancy.</p>

  <sec id="sec12">
    <title>Conclusions</title>
    <p>The activities of all collaborative research teams, regardless
of discipline or size, are well-served by applications that address
the seven key areas of access control, data storage, data browsing,
project monitoring, teamwork, internal communication, and public engagement.
A universal challenge is to identify a minimal set of applications
that fully satisfies the needs of a team in each of these areas while
remaining both user- and budget-friendly. GEM-NET, the set of tools
that make up the software infrastructure of the NSF Center for Genetically
Encoded Materials (C-GEM), offers a solution to this challenge that
was stress-tested over two years by all team members. GEM-NET supported
and enhanced C-GEM’s collaborative research goals by organizing,
documenting, and simplifying the communication of ideas, data, and
analysis. Assembled according to a carefully considered set of design
objectives (<xref rid="box1" ref-type="other">Box 1</xref>) and fine-tuned according
to team feedback, GEM-NET meets the wide-ranging collaboration needs
of the team while remaining intuitive in structure, so that every
team member knows what tool to use for any particular task and simultaneously
provides a high level of security, reliability, and ease of maintenance.
Some tools are off-the-shelf and others are novel, but all are both
transferable and scalable.</p>
    <p>Our aim has been to provide sufficient
details of the function
of each tool within GEM-NET and how these tools connect to and complement
each other to help other teams easily reproduce our setup or adapt
it to their needs. We provide information on feature distinctions
between free and premium tool versions (all of the tools use the free
or freemium model), upgrade pricing (to support budgeting for the
costs of increasing team size or requirements), and pointers on how
to adapt these tools to work with large teams, including how the tools
support work within subteams (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acscentsci.9b00111/suppl_file/oc9b00111_si_001.pdf">Supplementary Table 1</ext-link>). Notably, the vast majority of tools within GEM-NET are
agnostic of research area and thus are suitable for any collaborative
team. For teams that handle sequence data, GEM-NET can be replicated
in its entirety. Other teams may wish to swap Benchling, our chosen
sequence management tool, for an alternative platform geared toward
another data format or to manage all data through Team Drive; its
unlimited storage and comprehensive API work with any data type. Our
custom apps demonstrate how simple, tailor-made code can harness the
APIs of powerful, well-established software to merge data between
services and create new functionality. We have documented and shared
the source code of our apps, including a biospecimen repository browser
with interlab shipment tracking and a members portal with protocols
listing.</p>
    <p>Because most of the functionality works “out
of the box”,
teams can use GEM-NET to establish a collaborative network with minimal
delay: jointly authoring documents and code, sharing data, video conferencing,
scheduling meetings, tracking progress, and publicizing their work
through a Web site, blog, podcast, and Twitter feed. Supplementing
the initial tool set with custom applications that merge data across
platforms, we gained additional abilities to browse and query our
data and produce a unified interface through a member portal. The
first steps in reproducing GEM-NET are to register a domain, to set
up a basic Web site, and then to apply for a G Suite for Education
license. Once the license is granted, set up admin user accounts and
then user groups in Google Groups, using these to provision access
to the range of G Suite tools. Next, set up organizations in Benchling,
Asana, GitHub, and Slack. The remaining tools can be set up in any
order, satisfying the dependencies listed in <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acscentsci.9b00111/suppl_file/oc9b00111_si_001.pdf">Supplementary Table 1</ext-link>.</p>
