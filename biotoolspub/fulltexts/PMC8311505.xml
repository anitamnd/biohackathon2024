    <abstract>
      <p>Few challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic strike at the very core of our
humanity as the inability of family to sit at the bedside of their
loved ones when battling for their lives in the ICU. Virtual visiting
is one tool to help deal with this challenge. When introducing virtual
visiting into our ICU, we identified 5 criteria for a sustainable
system that aligned with patient-family-centered care: virtual
visiting needed to (1) simulate open and flexible visiting; (2) be
able to accommodate differences in family size, dynamics, and cultural
practices; (3) utilize a video conferencing platform that is private
and secure; (4) be easy to use and not require special teams to
facilitate meetings; and (5) not increase the workload of ICU staff.
There is a growing body of literature demonstrating a global movement
toward virtual visiting in ICU, however there are no publications that
describe a system which meet all 5 of our criteria. Importantly, there
are no papers describing systems of virtual visiting which mimic open
and flexible family presence at the bedside. We were unable to find
any off-the-shelf video conferencing platforms that met all our
criteria. To come up with a solution, a multidisciplinary team of ICU
staff partnered with healthcare technology adoption consultants and
two technology companies to develop an innovative system called HowRU.
HowRU uses the video conferencing platform Webex with the integration
of some newly designed software that automates many of the laborious
and complex processes. HowRU is a cloud based, supported, and
simplified system that closely simulates open and flexible visiting
while ensuring patient and family privacy, dignity, and security. We
have demonstrated the transferability of HowRU by implanting it into a
second ICU. HowRU is now commercially available internationally. We
hope HowRU will improve patient-family-centered care in ICU.</p>

    <title>Introduction</title>
    <p>Of the many challenges that the COVID-19 pandemic has brought, few strike at
the very core of our humanity as the inability of family to sit at the
bedside of their loved ones when battling for their life in the Intensive
Care Unit (ICU). We have seen this distressing impact of visitor
restrictions documented in both pubic media<sup><xref rid="bibr1-08850666211030845" ref-type="bibr">1-</xref><xref rid="bibr2-08850666211030845" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr3-08850666211030845" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> and medical literature alike.<sup><xref rid="bibr4-08850666211030845" ref-type="bibr">4-</xref><xref rid="bibr5-08850666211030845" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr6-08850666211030845" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr7-08850666211030845" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> Not only are patients and their families affected, but ICU staff too.
Moral injury can occur when ICU staff are unable to facilitate holistic
care, which involves providing emotional support and guidance for the
families throughout their ICU journey, particularly at the end of a
patient’s life.<sup><xref rid="bibr6-08850666211030845" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> A recent study looking at the mental wellbeing of intensive care
staff across 21 French ICUs during the COVID-19 pandemic found that regret
about visiting restriction policies was an important determinant of poor
mental health.<sup><xref rid="bibr7-08850666211030845" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>
</p>
    <p>It is no surprise, then, that in today’s era of modern technology there has
been an almost intuitive move to virtual visiting, using video conferencing
to bridge the physical gap between patients and families across the world.
Virtual visiting has been endorsed by organizations such as the Australia
and New Zealand Society of Intensive Care,<sup><xref rid="bibr8-08850666211030845" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> Society of Critical Care,<sup><xref rid="bibr9-08850666211030845" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> Intensive Care Society,<sup><xref rid="bibr10-08850666211030845" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> and the International COVID-19 Intensive Care Advisory Group.<sup><xref rid="bibr11-08850666211030845" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> In a recently published national survey of ICUs across the UK, 97%
had some form of virtual visiting established.<sup><xref rid="bibr12-08850666211030845" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> When understanding the challenging conditions under which many ICUs
have been running during the pandemic, the ability to quickly implement
virtual visiting is remarkable.</p>
    <p>Across the literature we see extensive heterogeneity in how virtual visiting is
facilitated. The most obvious variation is the use of different video
conferencing platforms: in the UK, for example, at least 19 different video
conferencing platforms were used across the NHS.<sup><xref rid="bibr12-08850666211030845" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> Many other components of virtual visiting vary too. We see variation
in the type and set up of device used for virtual visiting (from mobile
devices held by staff or mounted to stands, to existing bedside computers
with mounted cameras, to existing telecritical care systems), the number and
availability of devices used within units (from one device per patient, to
one or a small handful of devices shared across the unit or hospital), and
the manner in which virtual visiting is coordinated and facilitated (from a
communication team often consisting of additional staff, to a re-purposed
telecritical care coordination center, to bedside nurses).<sup><xref rid="bibr13-08850666211030845" ref-type="bibr">13-</xref><xref rid="bibr14-08850666211030845" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr15-08850666211030845" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr16-08850666211030845" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr17-08850666211030845" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr18-08850666211030845" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr19-08850666211030845" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr20-08850666211030845" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr21-08850666211030845" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr22-08850666211030845" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr23-08850666211030845" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>
</p>
    <p>While there have been limited formal qualitative studies, the feedback about
virtual visiting from patients, families, and staff is grossly positive.
Patients are sent love and emotional support and are reminded of what waits
for them when they get better.<sup><xref rid="bibr13-08850666211030845" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> This provides patients with a sense of hope and motivation to engage
in therapies, thereby promoting physical recovery.<sup><xref rid="bibr12-08850666211030845" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> Virtual visiting is also perceived as therapeutic in being able to
help re-orientate patients with delirium, and overcoming
language/communication barriers.<sup><xref rid="bibr12-08850666211030845" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> Families appreciate receiving information and emotional support.<sup><xref rid="bibr12-08850666211030845" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> They are reassured and alleviated of a sense of helplessness. They
value feeling connected to their loved ones, witnessing their loved ones
being well cared for and treated as a person, and sharing stories of a
patient’s legacy with healthcare staff.<sup><xref rid="bibr13-08850666211030845" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="bibr14-08850666211030845" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="bibr16-08850666211030845" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="bibr21-08850666211030845" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="bibr23-08850666211030845" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> Staff have described the experience of virtual visiting as
“surprisingly intimate and rewarding,” finding that it fosters a deeper
connection with and recognition of the person in the bed<sup><xref rid="bibr14-08850666211030845" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>; other staff report it being a “profoundly powerful experience.”<sup><xref rid="bibr13-08850666211030845" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> In the National UK Study, 68% perceived virtual visiting as improving
staff morale.<sup><xref rid="bibr12-08850666211030845" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>
</p>
    <p>Taken together, the current literature clearly shows immense value in having
some sort of system of virtual visiting in the ICU when physical visitation
is restricted. The next questions that arise are: is there an optimal system
of virtual visiting? What have we learned from the heterogeneous methods
trialed thus far? How can virtual visiting best align with
patient-family-centered care?</p>
    <p>Sasangohar et al, who re-purposed their existing telecritical care system for
virtual visiting, performed a qualitative evaluation of 59 participants and
offer valuable insight into what families suggest in order to improve
virtual visiting. Over half of the participants expressed the desire to have
on-demand access to the technology to initiate calls instead of the limited
access controlled by the coordination center. Other areas of improvement
included improved scheduling processes and improved technical capabilities.<sup><xref rid="bibr16-08850666211030845" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>
</p>
    <p>Another study looking at family and staff perspectives of telephone and video
communication in ICU during the pandemic found that the main suggestion to
improve virtual visiting was to use technology that more closely
approximated the experience of families being at the bedside. Specifically,
these suggestions included positioning the camera so that the family can see
the patient and their surroundings, offering families the opportunity to ask
questions about tubes and devices, and offering time for patients and
families to interact without clinician participation.<sup><xref rid="bibr24-08850666211030845" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>
</p>
    <p>While these areas of improvement pertain to the particular model of virtual
visiting used by Sasangohar et al and Kennedy et al, the suggestions for
improvements made by families are likely broadly applicable to many of the
other published systems that demonstrate similar limitations in terms of
restricted access to video calls, utilizing platforms not specifically
designed for virtual visiting in the ICU setting, and laborious organization
of each virtual visit. Families from Sasangohar et al and Kennedy et al’s
studies are essentially asking us to offer what would be considered the
usual standard of practice in many ICUs—open and flexible visiting—but to do
this in a virtual format. We are now starting to see this request echoed
professionally, by colleagues suggesting that the concept of ‘open
visitation’ could be further broadened to include “virtual open visitation.”<sup><xref rid="bibr25-08850666211030845" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>
</p>
    <p>We know of the constellation of adverse phycological outcomes that can occur in
ICU patients and their families, termed ICU trauma and post-intensive care
syndrome-family respectively.<sup><xref rid="bibr26-08850666211030845" ref-type="bibr">26-</xref><xref rid="bibr27-08850666211030845" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr28-08850666211030845" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr29-08850666211030845" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr30-08850666211030845" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr31-08850666211030845" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> We also know that providing open and flexible visiting has the effect
of reducing the risk of developing such outcomes.<sup><xref rid="bibr32-08850666211030845" ref-type="bibr">32-</xref><xref rid="bibr33-08850666211030845" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr34-08850666211030845" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup> While having some sort of virtual visiting may reduce this risk of
developing ICU trauma and post-intensive care syndrome-family, having
on-demand virtual access for patients and families that meets their needs
for information and support is more likely to further reduce the risk.<sup><xref rid="bibr35-08850666211030845" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup>
</p>
    <p>The authors of the National UK study state that “although family members might
prefer on-demand access to virtual visiting, workload and privacy concerns
make this prohibitive.”<sup><xref rid="bibr12-08850666211030845" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> We, however, disagree. In this paper, we will present a new system of
open and virtual visiting, HowRU, that does meet families’ wishes for
on-demand access, while ensuring patient privacy, dignity, and data
security. HowRU is a cloud-based, fully supported, easy-to-use system that
requires no technical expertise and places minimal additional workload on
ICU staff.</p>
    <p>In this article we examine the barriers we encountered to using off-the-shelf
video conferencing products in the ICU setting for virtual visiting. We then
describe the criteria we devised for a functional and sustainable system of
virtual visiting that simulates our usual standard of open and flexible
visiting. This is followed by a discussion of the unique collaboration
between multidisciplinary ICU staff, patients, families, a technology
adoption specialist company, and 2 technology companies to devise our
tailored solution, HowRU, to meet these criteria. We then describe how HowRU
works in our unit, and the various stages of development, culminating in the
implantation of HowRU into another ICU. Lastly, we discuss the potential

    <title>Why Off-the-Shelf Video Conferencing Platforms Failed to Meet the Needs of
Our Intensive Care Unit</title>
    <p>When trying to quickly implement virtual visiting at the beginning of the
COVID-19 pandemic, we explored many off-the-shelf video conferencing
platforms. We expected this to be a straightforward endeavor, but found this
not to be the case. Here we discuss the barriers we encountered to using
off-the-shelf video conferencing products for virtual visiting in our
ICU.</p>
    <sec id="section3-08850666211030845">
      <title>Using Patient’s Private Accounts</title>
      <p>When thinking about our unconscious or incapacitated ICU patients, it was
immediately apparent that it was not appropriate to use patients’
private accounts such as Facebook, WhatsApp or Facetime. This would
require obtaining patients’ private account details and ICU staff
signing in on the patient’s behalf. This was a clear breach of patient
privacy and therefore precluded its use in our ICU.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="section4-08850666211030845">
      <title>Using Generic Accounts for the ICU</title>
      <p>The alternative to using patients’ private accounts was to create generic
accounts for the ICU using off-the-shelf video conferencing platforms.
These generic accounts could then be shared between patients. There
were several barriers that arose when attempting this solution.</p>
      <sec id="section5-08850666211030845">
        <title>Accounts requiring a phone number</title>
        <p>On platforms where a phone number is used to make video calls,
there is a risk of inadvertently giving families a contact
number that is presumed to belong to the ICU. This has led to
situations where subsequent calls from family members have
caused distress to both parties.<sup><xref rid="bibr20-08850666211030845" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> There is also the risk of families being able to call
into these generic accounts when other families are using the
account, risking breeches in patient confidentiality.</p>
        <p>The only way to avoid establishing an inappropriate 2 way line of
communication using shared accounts would be for staff to always
block the caller details, meaning all video calls would have to
be outbound and scheduled. This creates the problem with
scheduling discussed in the next section.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="section6-08850666211030845">
        <title>Accounts using scheduled virtual meetings</title>
        <p>Many video-conferencing platforms create scheduled virtual
meetings. An invitation link, meeting ID, or passcode can then
be sent out to family members by email or text message. While
this ensures a secure meeting space, the major issue is the
process through which these meetings are scheduled and
facilitated. Scheduling, and then communicating the meeting
details to family members, is a multistep, time-consuming
process that requires coordination across the unit to equitably
share time and to ensure meetings will not overlap.</p>
        <p>Having to send email or text message invites to virtual meetings
also raises the question of how to maintain a digitally secure
list of family contacts easily accessible to the clinical team
in ICU. ICU staff will need to locate, confirm, and re-enter
phone numbers or email addresses each time a video call is made.
This is another step that adds to the workload of overstretched
clinical staff.</p>
        <p>As we see in the literature, some units have been able to overcome
the issues with scheduling and facilitating calls by having a
dedicated team whose job it is to organize virtual meetings with
families. These teams have consisted of nurse practitioners,
medical students, residents, non-ICU seconded medical staff, or
pre-existing telecritical care coordination centers. We did not
have the option of developing a separate virtual visiting
coordination team; the virtual visits would have to be
facilitated by our existing clinical staff, most likely the
bedside nurses. Not only would it be unfair to place an
additional workload on our clinical staff, we also knew that
having to use new technology would be stressful and challenging,
if not impossible, for some of our clinical staff. We felt
confident that as a unit in the short term we could pull
together to overcome these challenges, like has been done in
many units globally, but it was clear that this was not a
sustainable long-term solution.</p>

    <sec id="section7-08850666211030845">
      <title>Scheduled Virtual Meetings Did Not Adhere to Our Usual Standard of
Open and Flexible Family Visiting</title>
      <p>We identified that having limited scheduled meetings did not align with
our usual practice of open and flexible family visiting. Having to
schedule meetings did not allow the flexibility that is often required
in the dynamic ICU environment, and does not accommodate for the
common scenario of family members being in different time zones.
Scheduled meetings do not provide families the opportunity to check in
on their loved ones when they feel the need to, leaving them feeling
disempowered and anxiously awaiting the next scheduled meeting. We saw
this first hand expressed by the families of our first COVID-19
patients when trialing scheduled virtual visiting using off-the-shelf
video conferencing platforms.</p>
      <p>We also recognized the importance of not limiting the number of family
members that could be involved in a virtual meeting. We wanted to be
able to accommodate the differences in family size, preferred type of
interactions, complex dynamics, and cultural practices. We wanted to
ensure that family members were not excluded, and that no single
family member was burdened with the sole responsibility of
communicating often complex and confronting medical information to
other family members.</p>

    <sec id="section8-08850666211030845">
      <title>Barriers When Trying to Simulate Open and Flexible Visiting</title>
      <p>To provide more open and flexible virtual visiting, we sourced an iPad
for each ICU bed. We then explored having a private and secure account
for each patient where we could create a virtual meeting space for the
family that could accommodate multiple family members if required. The
barrier that we came up against was how to create a secure account for
each patient easily. All the video conferencing platforms required an
accessible unique email address to create and then verify a new
account using 2-step verification. There was no simple or
straightforward way of establishing an email account for each patient,
nor for going through the process of opening and verifying each new
account.</p>

  <sec id="section9-08850666211030845">
    <title>Our Criteria for a Functional and Sustainable System of Virtual Visiting
That Simulates Open and Flexible Visiting</title>
    <p>At this point we realized off-the-shelf video conferencing solutions were
unable to meet the needs of our ICU. The limitations of applying a platform
designed for 2 non-disabled and conscious people to the unique constraints
of our ICU setting were clear.</p>
    <p>We summarized the criteria for a functional and sustainable system of virtual
visiting for our ICU as the following. Virtual visiting should:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Utilize a video conferencing platform that is private and
secure in line with hospital data protection guidance</p></list-item><list-item><p>Closely simulate our usual standard of open and flexible
visiting</p></list-item><list-item><p>Be flexible to accommodate the differences in our patients’
family size, preferred type of interactions, complex
dynamics, and cultural practices</p></list-item><list-item><p>Be easy to use, require minimal technical skills, and require
no special teams to organize or facilitate meetings</p></list-item><list-item><p>Not increase the workload of the ICU staff</p></list-item></list>

    <title>Finding a Solution</title>
    <sec id="section11-08850666211030845">
      <title>Collaboration</title>
      <p>In coming up with a solution to address the criteria listed above, with
the support of our hospital executive and IT department, we partnered
with healthcare technology adoption consultants from the company
Taleka, who then collaborated with the technology companies Cisco and
Citrus Health. Our ICU working party consisted of doctors, nurses,
social workers, and administration staff, as well as former ICU
COVID-19 patient families.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="section12-08850666211030845">
      <title>The Solution: HowRU</title>
      <p>The solution we came up with is HowRU. HowRU is a fully supported,
cloud-based system of virtual visiting that utilizes the video
conferencing platform Webex, with the addition of innovative automated
programming to tailor to our ICU needs.</p>
      <p>The workflow from the time a patient arrives in ICU to virtual visiting
with family is demonstrated in <xref rid="fig1-08850666211030845" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> and is described

      <sec id="section13-08850666211030845">
        <title>How HowRU works</title>
        <p>When a new patient arrives in ICU we offer the patient and/or
family access to virtual visiting through HowRU. We refer the
family to our website at <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="http://www.connectingpatients.com.au" ext-link-type="uri">www.connectingpatients.com.au</ext-link> where they can
find all the information they need to understand and use HowRU.
This information is presented in instructional videos, guides,
and links to download Webex on different devices, with a clear
layout of the steps to initiate the first virtual visit and
troubleshooting information. The website also contains a consent
form that covers the rules of use, which families must agree to
prior to their first virtual visit. Having all this information
on an accessible website precludes the need to physically hand
out information and is essential when visitors are unable to
enter ICU or family members are not local.</p>
        <p>After consent is obtained, the ICU staff set up a patient account
using an account creation bot (an automated software program
designed to perform a specific task) on one of our central
computers. As seen in <xref rid="fig2-08850666211030845" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>, the staff
simply enter the patient’s name and the email addresses of
family members wanting to virtually visit, and the bot performs
multiple tasks to produce and verify a new Webex patient
account. The bot produces a unique de-identified username and
password for the patient’s account. The bot also creates a
virtual meeting space for the family inside Webex, invites
family members to join the family space by triggering off email
invites, and publishes a welcome message in the family space
that includes a link to an introductory video as well as a
reminder on how to initiate the first virtual visit.</p>

        </fig>
        <p>This bot is a key component of HowRU. It takes away from our
clinical staff all the time-consuming and complex IT tasks
required to set up and verify a private and secure patient
account that abides by our hospital data protection
guidance.</p>
        <p>Our staff then obtain an iPad assigned to the patient and sign into
Webex using the username and password produced by the bot. This
is a one-time sign in and no further security steps are
required. The staff place the iPad in a wheeled adjustable
stand, positioned appropriately for the patient (<xref rid="fig3-08850666211030845" ref-type="fig">Figure
3a</xref>).</p>
        <p>Once the family have downloaded the Webex app to their individual
devices, the first virtual meeting is set up. This is a
facilitated meeting where ICU staff prepare the family prior to
directing the video onto the patient, ensuring the families are
supported when confronted with seeing their loved one in ICU for
the first time. The bedside nurse opens the family virtual
meeting space with just 2 taps on the iPad (<xref rid="fig3-08850666211030845" ref-type="fig">Figure 3b</xref>). Each
family member receives a notification on their device telling
them the family virtual meeting space is open for them to visit,
which they can do with just 2 taps on their personal device.
Once the family is oriented and comfortable, the staff can then
leave the bedside with the family virtual meeting space open so
that family members can come and go as they please (<xref rid="fig3-08850666211030845" ref-type="fig">Figure
3c</xref> and <xref rid="fig3-08850666211030845" ref-type="fig">3d</xref>).</p>
        <p>After that first visit, the family space can be opened easily at
any time by the bedside nurse. This can occur at the discretion
of the bedside nurse whenever there is time available during the
day, at a formally organized time, or, if appropriate, at the
spontaneous request of a family member. Family members can visit
individually or as a group. There is no limit on how many family
members can be in the virtual meeting space at any one time.</p>
        <p>This simulates our usual practice of flexible and open visiting,
accommodating families of all sizes and in different time zones.
It also means that when a family member wakes up in the middle
of the night worrying about their loved one, they can simply ask
the bedside nurse to open the family space so they can virtually
check in and feel connected to their loved one. Family members
can have unrushed time visiting their loved one together or
separately and can at different times interact with the bedside
nurse, or be left alone with their loved one in privacy. Should
the nurse be required to attend to the patient privately while
the virtual room is open, they simply leave the space with one
tap, and can re-open the space when finished with their
task.</p>
        <p>When the patient leaves the ICU, the patient’s account is deleted.
The family will still have access to all the messages in the
family space from their personal devices, but the patient’s
account is deleted and therefore no personal data can be
accessed from the ICU iPad.</p>

        <title>HowRU facilitates families to support each other in
non-COVID-19 patients</title>
        <p>While initially designed with COVID-19 patients in mind, as
hospital visiting and travel restrictions limit those able to be
present the bedside in non-COVID-19 patients, we have found
HowRU important not just for virtual visiting, but also as a
means for families to support each other. One example is an
elderly man whose children all lived overseas, attending his
critically unwell wife in ICU. He was alone and lacked
confidence in his ability to understand medical information.
When he would visit his wife, or attend family meetings, his
children would use HowRU to be present with him virtually. This
allowed the children to participate in their mother’s care
journey and support their father with shared decision
making.</p>

        <title>Other benefits of HowRU</title>
        <p>Other benefits of HowRU include:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Multimodal communication is possible: photos,
text messages, voice messages and GIFs can be sent
between patients and families at any time allowing
a range of options for each individual to best
express themselves. This is particularly useful

speak, such as those with a tracheostomy.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Much like an ICU diary, the families have a
record of their interactions with their loved one
throughout their journey in ICU which can be
helpful in processing their ICU experience.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The system is adaptable for each stage of the
patient’s journey through ICU. As the patient
becomes more independent, they can take on a more
active role in managing their interactions in the
family virtual meeting space. The same is true in
reverse if the patient were to deteriorate.</p></list-item><list-item><p>There is enormous potential for additional ways
in which HowRU could be used in ICU. For example,
we have integrated our hospital chaplain service
into HowRU. If a patient requires a chaplain
visit, the chaplain can do this virtually either
individually or with family members present. Other
potential uses would include communication between
patients and health care workers,
inter-departmental communication, consults and
supervision.</p></list-item></list>

    <title>The Key Pieces That Make HowRU a Tailored and Supported System, Not Just an
App</title>
    <p>There are 3 key components that make HowRU a sustainable system. The first key
component is the automated patient account creation and family space
creation using the innovative bot as discussed above. The second component
is the support for families, which has also been discussed above. The third
component is the support for ICU staff.</p>
    <p>We support our ICU staff in the following ways:</p>
    <list list-type="bullet">
      <list-item>
        <p><bold>HowRU Champions</bold>: We have trained 12 social work,
nursing, and administration champions in our unit to use HowRU
in its entirety. The training takes approximately one hour. The
champions are then able to train other ICU staff as they go,
assist with common issues that arise, and escalate issues they
cannot fix. The champions are also in a Webex space with experts
from Taleka and Citrus Health where they can ask questions to
learn collectively. These champions receive quarterly refresher
training.</p>
      </list-item>
      <list-item>
        <p><bold>Step-by-step guide</bold>: We have designed and tested a

    <title>Development, Testing, and Ongoing Improvements of HowRU</title>
    <p>The process of developing HowRU has occurred over 5 phases as demonstrated in
<xref rid="fig4-08850666211030845" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>. The
entire process has been collaborative between our ICU working party,
technology adoptions specialists from Taleka, and technology experts from
our hospital IT department, Citrus Health and Cisco. Technology adoption
specialists from Taleka were vital to this process, as they acted as
intermediaries and translators between our ICU team and the technology
companies. Our ICU working party presented to Taleka the problems we
encountered with off-the-shelf video conferencing platforms and explained
the criteria we needed to have a functional virtual visiting system. Taleka
then worked with the technology experts to develop a cohesive solution that
met our needs.</p>

    </fig>
    <p>At each phase of development, we have taken feedback from those using the
system, including the patients, their families, and ICU staff to improve
upon HowRU.</p>
    <p>In phases 1 and 2, we trialed the prototype, ironed out all the early issues,
and developed a lot of the support material. We also formally consulted
family members of former COVID-19 ICU patients for their input into system
design and usability. An important piece of this early development was the
review and subsequent modifications suggested by our IT Security Architect
to ensure appropriate hospital-level data security. This guidance aligns
with that produced by The Intensive Care Society’s Legal and Ethical
Advisory Group.<sup><xref rid="bibr10-08850666211030845" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>
</p>
    <p>In phase 3 we introduced HowRU into our ICU and sought out patients and
families who were willing to trial virtual visiting and provide us with
feedback. Once we were confident that HowRU was fully functional, we began
phase 4 where we were able to offer HowRU to all our ICU patients and
families.</p>
    <p>During phase 4, HowRU was transformed into a fully managed and supported
cloud-based service. This was an important transition for several reasons:
(1) It provided an agile service that was able to adapt to the everchanging
technology, ensuring the website, videos, guides, and champions were all
kept up to date; (2) It reassured us that if there was an issue with
connectivity, particularly during a critical moment for a family, there was
help available; (3) It allowed HowRU to be easily implanted into another
unit. This led to phase 5, where HowRU was introduced into a different
hospital ICU. That implementation was very successful and was ready for live
patients and families within a timeframe of 3 weeks once all the existing
support content was tailored and the iPads had been configured. Less than 24
hours after training was completed for the Champions, a live patient-family
connection occurred.</p>
    <p>HowRU is now well established in 2 ICUs and is being reviewed and trialed by
others. We continue to take feedback from all users to improve HowRU. It has
been designed to evolve as new technology emerges and is easily adapted for
improvements.</p>

  <sec id="section18-08850666211030845">
    <title>Potential Challenges in Implementing HowRU Into a New ICU</title>
    <p>When introducing HowRU into a new ICU, there are several challenges that may
arise. We believe the biggest challenge will be getting key decision-makers
to understand and value “the why”: why families and patients need open and
flexible virtual visiting; why off-the-shelf video conferencing platforms
are not adequate; why having a secure and protected virtual space is
essential; and why a supported system is important for staff and families.
Communicating and justifying “the why” may be particularly difficult in
units where there is no pre-COVID culture of open and flexible visiting. It
may also be difficult in units that have come up with some sort of
family-patient-staff communication solution during COVID. In such units, the
level of expectation and what is considered sufficient, even if sub-optimal,
may already be set and difficult to re-imagine.</p>
    <p>From a monetary perspective, there are potential challenges in justifying the
return on investment of HowRU because the returns of are not easily
quantifiable. The more obvious benefits around patient-family-centered care,
mental health of patients and families, and staff morale have been discussed
in this article. There are additional benefits, however, such as improved
patient-family communication and overall satisfaction, which could reduce
complaints and the cost associated with addressing these. In addition, many
hospitals have relied upon teams staffed by medical students, healthcare
workers seconded from other departments, or volunteers to organize
communication in ICUs during the pandemic. As a result, the true cost of a
communication team may be hidden. This makes it difficult to compare
existing communication costs with HowRU. In addition, video is seemingly so
available in the world that it is commonly viewed as being a free commodity.
Those without insights into the unique challenges of the ICU may struggle to
appreciate the need to pay for a unique service.</p>
    <p>The maximal benefit of HowRU comes from patients that are unconscious or
dependent on ICU staff for communication. Therefore, in lower acuity ICUs
where there are more patients able to use their own devices, the perception
of the value of HowRU may be diminished.</p>
    <p>Once “the why” is clear and accepted, “the how” will be much easier. However,
like the successful implementation of any new product, the uptake of HowRU
will depend on strong leadership, buy-in from staff, local champions,
effective messaging, appropriate training, incentivization, and the
development of policy and systems to standardize its use. One major
advantage of HowRU is that the work required for implementation is in large
part done by the technology adoption specialists who support the ICU through
the implementation process. The technology adoption specialists provide
training, develop messaging material, liaise between IT and clinical staff,
and problem-solve technical and non-technical issues that arise. This
significantly reduces the ICU investment in time, energy, and creativity. It
also greatly reduces the burden and stress that many healthcare workers
experience when adopting new technology.</p>

    <title>Conclusion</title>
    <p>There is no equal substitute for being able to offer physical comfort to a
loved one who is critically ill or dying. However, when visitation in person
is not possible, we can now provide open and flexible virtual visiting that
aligns with patient-family-centered care using HowRU. HowRU aligns with our
usual code of conduct, ensuring patient and family privacy, dignity, and
security. It facilitates an open and flexible line of communication that can
be adapted to the needs of each individual patient and family. HowRU is a
tailored and supported system that is simple to use, requires no special
technical expertise, and places minimal additional workload upon ICU staff.
We have demonstrated that HowRU can easily be implanted into another
ICU.</p>
    <p>It has been predicted that the psychological impact of COVID 19-related
separation on ICU families will reverberate for years, and likely result in
high numbers of people needing trauma-related services.<sup><xref rid="bibr36-08850666211030845" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup> We sincerely hope that our system of open virtual visiting will
minimize the harmful effects of visitor restriction during such critical and
often life-changing moments in our patients’ and families’ lives.</p>
    <p>HowRU is now commercially available internationally in any country with Cisco
Webex access.

    <p>HowRU would not have been possible without the Wollongong ICU multidisciplinary
working party consisting of Jill Bright, Aaron Chadwick, Kimberly Fleming,
Agatha Fryday, Margot Gemmellsmith, Marissa Hales, Sofia Karipidis, Shanna
Priestly and Ellen Robinson. Special thanks to the teams at both Taleka, in
particular Andrea West, and Citrus Health, who, during the NSW lockdown,
generously donated their time and expertise completely free of charge to
