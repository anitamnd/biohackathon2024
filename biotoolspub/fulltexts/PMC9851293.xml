      <title>Abstract</title>
      <p>Chromosomal translocations in cancer genomes, key players in many types of cancers, generate chimeric proteins that drive oncogenesis. Genomes with chromosomal rearrangements can also produce fusion circular RNAs (f-circRNAs) by backsplicing of chimeric transcripts, as first shown in leukemias with <italic toggle="yes">PML::RARα</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">KMT2A::MLLT3</italic> translocations and later in solid cancers. F-circRNAs contribute to the oncogenic processes and reinforce the oncogenic activity of chimeric proteins. In leukemia with <italic toggle="yes">KMT2A::AFF1</italic> (<italic toggle="yes">MLL::AF4</italic>) fusions, we previously reported specific alterations of circRNA expression, but nothing was known about f-circRNAs. Due to the presence of two chimeric sequences, fusion and backsplice junctions, the identification of f-circRNAs with available tools is challenging, possibly resulting in the underestimation of this RNA species, especially when the breakpoint is not known. We developed CircFusion, a new software tool to detect linear fusion transcripts and f-circRNAs from RNA-seq data, both in samples for which the breakpoints are known and when the information about the joined exons is missing. CircFusion can detect linear and circular chimeric transcripts deriving from the main and reciprocal translocations also in the presence of multiple breakpoints, which are common in malignant cells. Benchmarking tests on simulated and real datasets of cancer samples with previously experimentally determined f-circRNAs showed that CircFusion provides reliable predictions and outperforms available methods for f-circRNA detection. We discovered and validated novel f-circRNAs in acute leukemia harboring <italic toggle="yes">KMT2A::AFF1</italic> rearrangements, leading the way to future functional studies aimed to unveil their role in this malignancy.</p>

    <title>Introduction</title>
    <p>Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are stable RNA molecules generated by backsplicing, which juxtaposes a downstream 5′ donor splice site to an upstream 3′ splice acceptor site [<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. CircRNAs can regulate biological processes and drive cancer development and progression with different mechanisms, such as the interaction with microRNAs and RNA-binding proteins, and encoding specific peptides [<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Dysregulation of circRNAs plays a role in solid cancer as well as in several hematological malignancies, including leukemias of the myeloid [<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3–8</xref>] and lymphoid lineages [<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9–12</xref>]. As stable molecules detectable in body fluids, circRNAs are regarded as ideal diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers [<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Plus, they can represent interesting new targets for therapeutic applications.</p>
    <p>Chromosomal translocations harbored by cancer genomes are important oncogenic drivers. These rearrangements join parts of different genes often located on different chromosomes generating chimeric proteins that are well-known players in many types of malignancies, valid diagnostic markers and therapeutic targets, as exemplified by the paradigmatic case of <italic toggle="yes">BCR::ABL1</italic> leukemia [<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p>
    <p>Besides linear fusion transcripts, rearranged cancer genomes also express fusion-circRNAs (f-circRNAs), as reviewed in [<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>],. In acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) with <italic toggle="yes">PML::RARα</italic> translocations and acute myeloid leukemia with <italic toggle="yes">KMT2A::MLLT3</italic> (<italic toggle="yes">MLL::AF9</italic>) fusions, f-circRNAs can be oncogenic or sustain the oncogenic properties of chimeric proteins [<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In lung cancer, two f-circRNAs derived from <italic toggle="yes">EML4::ALK</italic> fusion have been identified, and proposed as a liquid biopsy biomarker [<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], whereas another f-circRNA from <italic toggle="yes">SLC34A2::ROS1</italic> translocation was proven to boost cancer cell migration [<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. In chronic myelogenous leukemia with <italic toggle="yes">BCR::ABL1</italic> fusion, the f-circRNA circBA9.3 was shown to promote proliferation and repress apoptosis by improving <italic toggle="yes">BCR::ABL1</italic> transcript translation or preventing its degradation [<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. As a proof of concept that f-circRNAs derive from genomes with rearrangements, cells engineered with <italic toggle="yes">NPM1::ALK</italic> fusion were proven to express <italic toggle="yes">de novo</italic> the same f-circRNAs found in patients [<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p>
    <p>The <italic toggle="yes">KMT2A::AFF1</italic> (<italic toggle="yes">MLL::AF4</italic>) translocation is common in patients with <italic toggle="yes">MLL</italic> rearranged acute lymphoblastic leukemia and marks an aggressive subtype of infant disease. Data about circRNA expression and role in this leukemia are still scanty. We previously showed that both <italic toggle="yes">KMT2A</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">AFF1</italic> genes each express several circular isoforms in normal hematopoiesis, whose expression can be affected by the rearrangement in leukemic cells [<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], and the contribution to leukemogenesis of a circAFF1 isoform had been suggested [<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. However, nothing is known about f-circRNAs generated from the <italic toggle="yes">KMT2A::AFF1</italic> fusion. Therefore, the aim of this study is the development of a bioinformatic pipeline and its evaluation and application in case studies.</p>
    <p>RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) approaches have allowed researchers to identify several fusions in cancer that were not detected by routine cytogenetic analyses [<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Nevertheless, f-circRNA detection from RNA-seq data is not trivial since they include two sequences not present in the normal genome: the fusion junction, in which two genomic regions far apart in normal genomes are juxtaposed, and the backsplice junction, typical of circRNAs, connecting in reverse order two sequences of the fusion partner genes.</p>
    <p>Although many tools have been developed to detect linear fusion transcripts, only Fcirc [<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] and Acfs [<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] can find f-circRNAs. Fcirc predicts f-circRNAs based on known fusions and reports only the transcripts coherent with a single fusion for each pair of translocation partner genes. This can be limiting when analyzing samples with complex rearrangements, with two or more breaks in the same chromosomal region and with non-corresponding reciprocal translocations, commonly found in cancer cells [<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27–30</xref>]. Acfs detects circRNAs and f-circRNAs, but not linear fusions, and hardly discriminates fusion junctions originating from gene family members with high sequence similarity [<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].</p>
    <p>We developed CircFusion, a bioinformatics tool to detect linear fusions and f-circRNAs from RNA-seq data, in samples in which the translocation breakpoint or only the fusion gene pair is known. Moreover, CircFusion can be run in a ‘discovery mode’ using a broad list of fusion partner gene pairs observed in diseases. CircFusion can also treat complex cases including multiple breakpoints and non-corresponding junctions in the first and second chromosome derivatives. Our tests on simulated and real data showed that CircFusion performs well in detecting f-circRNAs and linear fusion transcripts, representing an advance compared with current methods. Importantly, in this case study, we report the discovery with this software tool of new f-circRNAs in acute leukemia harboring <italic toggle="yes">KMT2A::AFF1</italic> rearrangements.</p>

      <title>Simulations of RNA-seq datasets</title>
      <p>Two RNA-seq datasets were generated, containing reads of f-circRNAs and linear fusions from chimeric genes, to evaluate CircFusion ability to correctly detect and classify them. Eighteen pairs of genes were considered, arranged in 4 direct fusions (‘single breakpoint’), 4 reciprocal fusions (‘reciprocal’), 4 fusions joined genes with two breakpoints for each gene pair (‘multiple breakpoints’) and 6 fusions originated from pairs of paralog genes (‘paralog gene’). Furthermore, for 6 gene pairs, the fusion read junction mapped at the ends of the annotated exons (‘annotated exon junction’), while for 12, it mapped in the middle of the fused exons (‘not annotated exon junction’) (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table S1</xref>).</p>
      <p>Fusion, alternative fusion transcript and f-circRNA reads were simulated with coverage 4×, 2× and 2×, respectively. For each gene pair, one or two f-circRNAs were simulated, plus the fusion transcripts deriving from the direct and or the reciprocal translocation events, along with one or two additional linear fusions transcripts simulating products of alternative breakpoints. Overall, we simulated 40 reads encompassing the f-circRNA backsplices and 114 reads supporting the linear fusion transcripts (of which 72 for fusion transcripts and 42 for fusion alternative transcripts) (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table S1</xref>). All read sequences were generated error-free, for both read lengths of 100 and 150 nt.</p>
      <p>A dataset of B-cells from peripheral blood of a healthy donor (GEO series ID GSE110159), without any translocation expected, was used as negative control, to test CircFusion detection of false positive reads. First, CirComPara2 [<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] was run to detect and quantify linear transcripts from the RNA-seq sample of B-cells. Then, linearly unmapped reads, i.e. reads that failed to be linearly aligned to the reference genome, were used as a background dataset for the simulation test, to which the simulated reads from the two aforementioned sets of fusions were added separately.</p>
      <p>For the parameter tuning analysis, 12 different overlap values over the breakpoint junction (1 to 10, 15 and 20 nt), and 5 minimal numbers of matches (4, 5, 10, 15 and 20 matches) required in the alignment were tested.</p>

      <title>RNA-seq datasets from samples with chromosomal rearrangements</title>
      <p>RNA-seq datasets of cancer samples and cell lines bearing chromosomal translocations, in which f-circRNAs were previously identified and validated were downloaded from NCBI: 8 APL samples harboring the <italic toggle="yes">PML::RARα</italic> fusion (3 NB4 cell line and 5 patient samples; average sequencing depth of 49 million single-end reads) (BioProjectID PRJNA315254) [<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], and 9 samples of lung adenocarcinoma H3122 cell line harboring the <italic toggle="yes">EML4::ALK</italic> fusion (average sequencing depth of 15 million pair-end reads) (BioProjectID PRJNA350335) [<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] were downloaded from NCBI.</p>
      <p>We further obtained RNA-seq data of the RS4;11 cell line (DSMZ), and five samples of patients with B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP-ALL) carrying <italic toggle="yes">KMT2A::AFF1</italic> (<italic toggle="yes">MLL::AF4</italic>) rearrangements, including three patients and two patient-derived xenograft samples [<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>].</p>
      <p>For each sample, high-depth RNA-seq data were obtained using total RNA extracted with TRIzol reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, Massachusetts) and precipitated with isopropanol, with RNA integrity number (RIN) &gt; 7, assessed with Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Santa Clara, CA, USA). RNA libraries were prepared with the TruSeq Stranded Total RNA Ribo-Zero Gold kit and sequenced with an Illumina® HiSeq2000 (San Diego, CA, USA) at an average sequencing depth of 70 million reads per sample for patients (paired-end reads of 150 bp) and 400 million reads for the cell line. RNA-seq samples were analyzed through CirComPara2, and linearly unmapped reads for each sample were used by CircFusion to search for fusion RNAs.</p>
      <p>Written informed consent was obtained from the parents or legal guardians of patients before sample collection and in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. The study approval was granted by institutional review committees at each participating center.</p>

      <title>Generation of the fusion reference sequence set and read alignment</title>
      <p>Bedtools v2.28.0 [<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] was used for file manipulation and exon sequence extraction for each fusion gene, as described in the Results section. R v4.1.2 and Bash programming languages were used to create the reference file in FASTA format with all the possible combinations between the exons of the fusion genes.</p>
      <p>A reference sequence with exon combinations is generated for each translocation given in input (<xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>), including, for the direct translocation, all the exon pairwise combinations, where the first exon belongs to the first gene in the pair and the second exon to the second gene, and, for the reciprocal translocation, all the combinations by inverting the gene order. The reference sequence files of all translocations are then collected into a single file.</p>
      <p>A list of 305 fusion partner gene pairs observed in cancer, provided in the file ‘known_fusions.txt’ uploaded in GitHub, was collected from the Cosmic database.</p>
      <p>The STAR aligner v2.7.5 [<xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] was used to align RNA-seq reads to the fusion reference sequence (See <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Methods</xref>).</p>

      <title>Fusion transcript definition</title>
      <p>The reads mapping on the reference sequence set and overlapping the direct or the reciprocal translocation junctions are considered for fusion transcript definition. An alignment of at least 50 nt, and, at the size of shorter overlap, of at least 5 nt and at most 17% of mismatches, was required.</p>
      <p>Then, for both the direct and the reciprocal translocations, the reads are classified in fusion transcripts and f-circRNAs, based on the exons of the reference sequences where they map (<xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). Moreover, additional fusion transcripts from breakpoints different from those indicated by the user are classified as ‘alternative fusion transcripts’.</p>

      <title>The CircFusion workflow</title>
      <p>CircFusion is a new bioinformatics tool to detect f-circRNAs and linear fusion transcripts from RNA-seq data and is freely available on GitHub (<ext-link xlink:href="https://github.com/annadalmolin/CircFusion" ext-link-type="uri">https://github.com/annadalmolin/CircFusion</ext-link>) and DockerHub (<ext-link xlink:href="https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/annadalmolin/CircFusion" ext-link-type="uri">https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/annadalmolin/CircFusion</ext-link>). The software is written in Bash and R programming languages, allows full customization of the parameters for read alignment and fusion transcript definition, and leverages parallel computing to save computational time.</p>
      <p>CircFusion takes as input the genome sequence in FASTA format, the gene annotation file in GTF format, the list of genomic translocations of interest (i.e. the two genes involved and, optionally, the exons flanking the direct and the reciprocal translocation junction and thus expected to be joined in fusion transcripts) and the RNA-seq reads in FASTQ format. A HTML summary file and the list as CSV table and plain text of f-circRNAs and linear fusions detected, along with additional information about read alignments supporting the detected fusion transcripts, are given in the output.</p>
      <p>The pipeline consists of three main steps: (i) generation of reference sequences for the translocation junctions given in input; (ii) alignment of the RNA-seq reads to the reference sequences; (iii) detection of linear fusion and f-circRNA transcripts from the alignments (<xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>).</p>
      <p>At first, a reference sequence set is generated with all the translocations in the input file, joining in all the pairwise combinations both the exons of the first to the exons of the second gene (‘direct’ reference), and inverting the gene order (‘reciprocal’). CircFusion can be run searching for one or more translocations of interest, or in a ‘discovery mode’ extending the search to a larger set of fusion partner gene pairs observed in cancer. The user can benefit from the provided file ‘known_fusions.txt’ in the GitHub page of CircFusion (see Data Availability) collecting a large number of known fusions in cancer, or by customizing the file by adding or removing fusion gene pairs.</p>
      <p>In the second step, the RNA-seq reads of each sample are aligned on the reference sequence set through the STAR aligner with optimized settings, as specified in Methods section. The alignments are then scanned to detect the reads crossing the fusion junction, for each translocation gene pair, and to classify them according to the provided input, as follows:</p>
      <list list-type="simple">
        <list-item>
          <p>(i) When only the gene pair is specified in the input, without information on the fused exons, then the complete reference sequence set is scanned;</p>
        </list-item>
        <list-item>
          <p>(ii) If the exons fused in both derivatives are given in input, then CircFusion uses them to define fusion transcripts;</p>
        </list-item>
        <list-item>
          <p>(iii) When only the exons of the direct fusion are indicated, the corresponding reciprocal translocation is considered to retrieve the exons of the reciprocal compatible with the fusion.</p>
        </list-item>
      </list>
      <p>The reads mapping on the fusion junction define ‘fusion transcripts’, and read alignments indicating a backsplice on the fusion transcript define ‘f-circRNAs’ (<xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). The reads mapped on the fusion transcript in paired exons other than those indicated as the fusion junction exons are labeled as ‘alternative fusion transcripts’, which can denote additional translocations in the sample. In this case, the user can run the analysis again, indicating these newly discovered translocations, to search for further f-circRNAs compatible with the newly discovered junctions.</p>
      <p>The output includes an HTML report with the f-circRNAs and linear RNAs identified, summarized for each translocation. Plain text and CSV files for each sample report the genomic coordinates of the fusion translocations, also of the backsplice for f-circRNAs, and the number of fusion supporting reads. In addition, for each translocation and for each sample analyzed, information is given for each fusion read, specifying the genes and the exons involved in the translocation and other details about the read alignment. Furthermore, CircFusion provides two plain text report files for each translocation, with the number of supporting reads and the number of fusions detected for each type, respectively.</p>

      <title>Simulation of f-circRNAs and linear fusions in RNA-seq data</title>
      <p>The ability of CircFusion to accurately detect and classify, in simulated RNA-seq data, f-circRNAs and fusion transcripts was tested and compared with the similar purpose tools Fcirc [<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] and Acfs [<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].</p>
      <p>We simulated two RNA-seq read datasets (with reads 100 and 150 bases long, respectively) containing sequences derived from f-circRNAs and linear fusion RNAs compatible with translocation events under different scenarios (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table S1</xref> and Methods). In particular, we considered three types of fusion reads, derived from: (i) the direct translocation (‘single breakpoint’), (ii) the reciprocal translocation and (iii) multiple breakpoints for the same pair of genes (‘multiple breakpoints’). Plus, fusion reads derived from pairs of genes paralog to those given in input. Finally, since we observed in real data that the fusion junction does not always fit with the annotated exon junctions, in our simulations, we mixed reads that encompass annotated exon junctions and mapping within exon boundaries, i.e. on ‘not annotated’ junctions.</p>
      <p>Simulated data were based on rearrangements reported in the literature. For instance, the <italic toggle="yes">SLC34A2::ROS1</italic> translocation [<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] represents complex rearrangements in which the same pair of genes is joined with multiple breakpoints. Moreover, the <italic toggle="yes">BCR::ABL1</italic> [<xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] and <italic toggle="yes">NSMCE2::PVT1</italic> [<xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] fusions were included along with their reciprocal translocations (<italic toggle="yes">ABL1::BCR</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">PVT1::NSMCE2</italic>, respectively). Reads from paralog genes (i.e. <italic toggle="yes">KMT2B, MLLT3</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">MLLT10</italic> genes, paralogs of <italic toggle="yes">KMT2A, MLLT1</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">MLLT6</italic>, respectively) were added to the read-set to test the tool capability in discriminating them, in a more challenging scenario.</p>

      <title>CircFusion correctly detects f-circRNAs in simulated data</title>
      <p>Test on simulated data validated CircFusion algorithm, showing as well that it is an improvement over Fcirc and Acfs (<xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S1A</xref>).</p>
      <p>CircFusion achieved high precision and recall, correctly identifying all the fusion reads without false positives in 5 cases out of 12, and scoring close to one in the others (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S1A</xref>).</p>
      <p>Both in the detection of f-circRNAs and linear fusion transcripts, CircFusion F<sub>1</sub> score was high, performing better compared with Fcirc (range 0.94–1 versus 0.71–0.77). Moreover, both methods surpassed Acfs (range 0–0.12) (<xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). Also considering the results obtained in the different scenarios separately, CircFusion performed better than the other methods, in most cases (<xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B–D</xref> and <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S1B–D</xref>). Regarding the three fusion types (single breakpoint, multiple breakpoints and presence of a reciprocal translocation), the major difference between methods was observed for recall and F<sub>1</sub> scores, underlying the low rate of false negatives of CircFusion (<xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S1B</xref>). In the case of a single breakpoint, both for the alternative fusion and f-circRNA detection, and for both read lengths, the recall and F1 score of CircFusion were maximal among the three methods. With multiple breakpoints, CircFusion recall and F<sub>1</sub> score remained maximal in most cases, while Fcirc varied more, and Acfs performed worse. The gap between the CircFusion and Fcirc was more evident in the presence of reciprocal translocations and for f-circRNA detection. Regarding the junction type, the performances were as above, with main improvements of CircFusion applied to f-circRNA discovery (<xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref> and <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S1C</xref>). Finally, CircFusion performed better also in the scenario with confounding reads derived from paralog genes, particularly with longer reads when searching for f-circRNAs (<xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref> and <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S1D</xref>).</p>
      <p>In the parameter tuning analysis, we tested CircFusion using 60 combinations of values for minimum read overlap over the backsplice junction and number of matches required in the alignment, to assess the performance of the tool (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S2</xref>). For both linear fusions and f-circRNAs, the precision increased with stringency, already exceeding 0.8 with an overlap of at least 4 nt. The F<sub>1</sub> score increased for f-circRNA detection when raising both tested parameters, whereas it slightly decreased for fusion transcript detection. Thus, we set as default an overlap of 5 nt, to reduce almost the 90% of FP, and a minimum number of matches of 5, to reduce about the 90% of FP and find at least the 80% of TP.</p>
      <p>Regarding computational efficiency, CircFusion spent 17 s for each translocation to generate the reference sequence file. Then, it took 7.46 and 7.50 min analyzing the 100 and 150 nt read datasets (4.9 million reads, 8 processors), resulting faster than Acfs (10.19 and 10.27 min) and slower than Fcirc (4.22 and 4.13 min). The better performance of CircFusion is, therefore, associated with a slightly increased computational time, compared with Fcirc.</p>

      <title>CircFusion efficiently detects known f-circRNAs in RNA-seq data of cancer samples with chromosomal rearrangements</title>
      <p>We next tested CircFusion on RNA-seq data of cancer cells expressing f-circRNAs and linear fusion transcripts that were previously identified by PCR-based techniques and experimentally validated: 8 APL samples harboring the <italic toggle="yes">PML::RARα</italic> fusion (3 NB4 cell line and 5 patient samples) [<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], and 9 samples of lung adenocarcinoma H3122 cell line with the <italic toggle="yes">EML4::ALK</italic> fusion [<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].</p>
      <p>Both the APL and H3122 RNA-seq data have been used in the publication presenting the Fcirc method [<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], whereas Acfs was tested only on the APL data [<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Thus, we could compare the new results obtained by the CircFusion analysis of APL data with those previously obtained by both Fcirc and Acfs, whereas the results of the H3122 cell line only with Fcirc.</p>
      <p>In APL samples, CircFusion successfully identified both previously validated <italic toggle="yes">PML::RARα</italic> f-circRNAs [<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], supported by from 1 to 11 reads (average sequencing depth of 49 M reads).

      <title>Discovery of f-circRNAs in acute leukemia samples with <italic toggle="yes">KMT2A::AFF1</italic> translocation</title>
      <p>Using CircFusion, we identified for the first time f-circRNAs in acute lymphoblastic leukemia with <italic toggle="yes">KMT2A::AFF1</italic> translocation.</p>
      <p>Initially, we focused on the RS4;11 cell line carrying multiple direct <italic toggle="yes">KMT2A::AFF1</italic> (K-A) and reciprocal <italic toggle="yes">AFF1::KMT2A</italic> (A-K) fusions, concordantly detected by PCR and Sanger sequencing (<xref rid="f4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref> and <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table S2</xref>) and by CircFusion analysis (<xref rid="f4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). We identified four linear fusion transcripts, likewise K8-A4 (joining <italic toggle="yes">KMT2A</italic> exon 8 to <italic toggle="yes">AFF1</italic> exon 4) and K9-A4 from the <italic toggle="yes">KMT2A</italic>-derivative, and A3-K10 and A3-K11 from the <italic toggle="yes">AFF1</italic>-derivative. Due to the different depth of the dataset carrying the <italic toggle="yes">KMT2A::AFF1</italic> fusion, to better compare the findings in the different samples, we considered the fusion supported reads as normalized over 10 M linearly unmapped reads (NR). Thus, the reciprocal fusion transcript A3-K10 was supported by 11.6 NR, whereas 0.86 NR were associated with the less expressed transcript (K8-A4) (<xref rid="f4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>).</p>

      <p>It is worth noting that f-circRNAs were discovered in all the patient samples (<xref rid="f5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref> and <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table S3</xref>), with a total of six distinct f-circRNAs detected, two derived from the K-A and 4 from the A-K translocation.</p>
      <p>Two fusion circRNAs were recurrently detected in patients, f-circA19-K7 in ALL1 and ALL5, and f-circK34-A2 in ALL3 and ALL4. Three patients expressed two f-circRNAs each, with f-circA19-K7 coexisting with f-circA7-K11 in ALL1 and with f-circK14-A3 in ALL5, and ALL3 expressing both f-circK34-A2 and f-circA19-K4. In ALL1 and ALL5, the exons flanking the fusion junction (i.e. A3 and K7) were used in f-circRNAs (f-circK14-A3 and f-circA19-K7), while in the remaining cases, the circularized exons were more apart from the exons involved in fusion junctions.</p>
      <p>Regarding the expression level of the discovered f-circRNAs, in ALL2, f-circA15-K7 was as abundant as the linear fusion transcript (linear junction K8-A4); in ALL5, both f-circRNAs detected were expressed at 50% of the linear fusion RNA, whereas in the other samples, the f-circRNAs were less expressed than linear transcripts (<xref rid="f5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>).</p>
      <p>Considering the f-circRNAs produced by leukemia cells found by the present study and the circKMT2A and circAFF1 isoforms expressed in normal blood cells according to [<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], we observed that half of the exons used in ‘aberrant chimeric’ f-circRNAs were commonly backspliced also in ‘canonical’ circRNAs (<xref rid="f5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>)<italic toggle="yes">. KMT2A</italic> exon 7, found in the recurrent f-circA19-K7 and in the most abundant f-circA15-K7, <italic toggle="yes">AFF1</italic> exon 2, backspliced in the recurrent f-circK34-A2, and in the f-circK10-A2 detected in the RS4;11 cell line, and <italic toggle="yes">AFF1</italic> exon 7 found in the f-circA7-K11, were also used in canonical circRNAs. In particular, <italic toggle="yes">KMT2A</italic> exon 7 was expressed in circKMT2A_A(K8-K7), previously shown to be the most abundantly expressed from the <italic toggle="yes">KMT2A</italic> gene, <italic toggle="yes">AFF1</italic> exon 2 was included in the very highly expressed circAFF1_A(A3-A2), and <italic toggle="yes">AFF1</italic> exon 7 was part of the less expressed circAFF1_E(A7-A4). Of note, <italic toggle="yes">AFF1</italic> exon 3, backspliced in the f-circK14-A3, was also used in circAFF1_A(A3-A2), joined through a splicing junction in 3′ instead of 5′.</p>
      <p>In BCP-ALL, f-circRNAs expression levels were comparable with those of canonical circKMT2A and circAFF1 isoforms, when excluding circAFF1_A(A3-A2), which was far more abundant of all the other circRNAs in most samples (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S3</xref>).</p>

    <title>Discussion</title>
    <p>This study presents two highlights: the definition of the landscape of f-circRNAs in BCP-ALL with <italic toggle="yes">KMT2A::AFF1</italic> translocations and the development of CircFusion, a new software tool to identify fusion linear and circular RNAs from RNA-seq data performing better than state-of-the-art tools and that can have broad applications.</p>
    <p>CircFusion has several advantages over the few similar existing tools. It can search for f-circRNAs both in samples where the exact fusion junction breakpoint is known and when only the two partner genes are defined, scanning all exon pair combinations to detect f-circRNAs compatible with any breakpoints. Importantly, CircFusion can manage complex rearrangements, which are commonly found in cancer cells, such as fusions with two or more breakpoints and non-corresponding reciprocal translocations in the first and second chromosome derivatives. Plus, in the ‘discovery mode’, CircFusion search can be broadened to a large set of fusion partner gene pairs customizable by the user.</p>
    <p>The default parameters were optimized, but the analysis stringency can be conducted by the user, tuning the parameters for read alignment (f.i. the number of multiple alignments per read, and the minimum number of matches) and for fusion transcript definition (f.i. the number of mismatches allowed in the alignment, and the minimum base overlap on the fusion junction).</p>
    <p>Notably, we demonstrated that CircFusion correctly identifies f-circRNAs and fusion transcripts from RNA-seq data with tests on simulated datasets containing known chimeric transcripts and by the reanalysis of samples, including leukemia and solid tumors bearing chromosomal rearrangements, in which f-circRNAs were previously detected and validated. For both linear fusion transcript and f-circRNA detection, in the simulation test, CircFusion had a lower rate of both false positives and false negatives than Fcirc and, especially, Acfs. Challenging the methods in scenarios different for fusion type, junction type, and presence of reads coming from translocations involving paralog genes revealed precision values comparable with Fcirc, and superior recall and F<sub>1</sub> scores in most cases, underlying the low rate of false negatives of CircFusion. Moreover, when tested on real RNA-seq datasets of cancer cells bearing chromosomal translocations, CircFusion successfully identified all three previously experimentally validated f-circRNAs. Collectively, the benchmarking tests indicated that CircFusion can be a useful and performing tool to identify f-circRNAs from RNA-seq data. Some of the previously validated f-circRNAs were supported by a low number of reads. Thus, we recommend to consider that a low depth (e.g. lower than 10 M reads) would hamper the identification of weakly expressed transcripts, and to tune the stringency of the search parameters according to the sequencing depth.</p>
    <p>The second highlight of this study came from the investigation of leukemia with the <italic toggle="yes">KMT2A::AFF1</italic> (<italic toggle="yes">MLL::AF4</italic>) fusion. We focused on this translocation since it marks an aggressive subtype of infant acute lymphoblastic leukemia with a still poor outcome. Data about circRNA expression and role in this particular disease is very limited [<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="ref42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. After the breakthrough discovery of oncogenic f-circRNAs in leukemia with <italic toggle="yes">KMT2A::MLLT3</italic> (<italic toggle="yes">MLL::AF9</italic>) [<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], followed by the finding of f-circRNAs in other malignancies with different translocations [<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19–22</xref>], no data emerged about chimeric circRNAs in leukemias with other rearrangements involving the <italic toggle="yes">KMT2A</italic> gene.</p>
    <p>By RNA-seq profiling and CircFusion analysis, we identified f-circRNAs produced by <italic toggle="yes">KMT2A::AFF1</italic> and cognate reciprocal fusions in all the samples analyzed, including the RS4;11 cell line and specimens of pediatric patients. The RS4;11 cell line bears multiple breakpoints, with four fusion transcripts detected. The breakpoint picture was in line with literature data for which the direct breakpoints in RS4;11 cell line have been shown to span between exon 8 and 9 of <italic toggle="yes">KMT2A</italic> and between exon 4 and 5 of <italic toggle="yes">AFF1</italic> [<xref rid="ref43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>, <xref rid="ref44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], and two reciprocal transcripts were identified [<xref rid="ref45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Also in patients with <italic toggle="yes">KMT2A::AFF1</italic> fusions, up to 4 different breakpoints were present in most cases.</p>
    <p>Of importance, f-circRNAs were discovered in all the leukemia samples analyzed, both in the RS4;11 cell line and in the patient specimens. In three out of five cases, we found two different f-circRNAs each. Two fusion circRNAs, f-circA19-K7 and f-circK34-A2, were recurrently detected in two cases. Of the 6 distinct f-circRNAs identified in patients, 4 were expressed from the <italic toggle="yes">AFF1</italic>-derivative and 2 were expressed from the <italic toggle="yes">KMT2A</italic>-derivative, as the f-circK10-A2 detected and validated in the RS4;11 cells. Considering all the samples and the cell line together, the expression of f-circRNAs and linear fusion transcripts was comparable in half of the cases, with the f-circRNAs being less abundant in the others. The f-circK10-A2 detected in RS4;11 cell line was not represented in patients, but the exon A2 was backspliced to generate the recurrent f-circK34-A2 in two patients (ALL3–4). We previously showed that, in normal haematopoiesis, multiple ‘canonical’ circRNAs are expressed by both <italic toggle="yes">KMT2A</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">AFF1</italic> genes [<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. In BCP-ALL, f-circRNA expression was lower than the very abundant canonical circAFF1_A(A3-A2), but comparable with that of the remaining several canonical circKMT2A and circAFF1 isoforms. Of note, specific exons (<italic toggle="yes">KMT2A</italic> exon 7, and <italic toggle="yes">AFF1</italic> exons 2 and 7) backspliced to generate the most abundant circRNAs of these genes in normal blood cells are also used in f-circRNAs produced by leukemia cells with rearranged genomes.</p>
    <p>In conclusion, we propose a new, useful and effective software tool to define circular and linear fusion transcripts in cancer cells with rearranged genomes, and with our case study, we provide new data about f-circRNA expression in BCP-ALL with <italic toggle="yes">KMT2A::AFF1</italic> rearrangements and highlight new aberrant transcripts that can be searched for in other possibly larger patient cohorts. The discovery of f-circRNAs derived from pathognomonic <italic toggle="yes">KMT2A::AFF1</italic> fusions in infant ALL incites further investigation into their possible functional role in the future.</p>
