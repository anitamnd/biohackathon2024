      <title>Abstract</title>
      <p>Next-generation sequencing (NGS) enables massively parallel acquisition of large-scale omics data; however, objective data quality filtering parameters are lacking. Although a useful metric, evidence reveals that platform-generated Phred values overestimate per-base quality scores. We have developed novel and empirically based algorithms that streamline NGS data quality filtering. The pipeline leverages known sequence motifs to enable empirical estimation of error rates, detection of erroneous base calls and removal of contaminating adapter sequence. The performance of motif-based error detection and quality filtering were further validated with read compression rates as an unbiased metric. Elevated error rates at read ends, where known motifs lie, tracked with propagation of erroneous base calls. Barcode swapping, an inherent problem with pooled libraries, was also effectively mitigated. The ngsComposer pipeline is suitable for various NGS protocols and platforms due to the universal concepts on which the algorithms are based.</p>

    <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
    <p>With over a decade of mainstream use in biological research, next-generation sequencing (NGS) is a widely applicable technology. Nevertheless, ambiguity regarding best practices in data preprocessing and quality control remains [<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Illumina short-read sequencing, the predominantly used platform due to its affordability and high yield, is considered the gold standard for NGS data quality. The sequence reads are often used for error correction of long reads derived from other NGS platforms such as PacBio and Nanopore [<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. However, Illumina short reads regularly contain sequencing errors that can significantly impact inferences [<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Instrument-derived metrics for evaluating base calling accuracy vary across platforms and analytical thresholds are often subjective. Similarly, elevated error rates at read ends or equipment-generated artifacts (e.g. strings of A or G bases) are not always accounted for [<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Even at low error rates, applications such as variant calling, <italic toggle="yes">de novo</italic> genome and transcript assembly, and microbial strain-level profiling are sensitive to sequencing errors [<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. For example, infrequent errors are misconstrued as minor alleles during variant calling and can result in false positives and false negatives during microbiome strain-level identification, an analysis that is based on exact sequence matching. Quality-trimming of reads has been reported to have a profound impact on sequence assembly, SNP-calling and gene expression [<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].</p>
    <p>Drawing biologically accurate inferences from NGS data requires high-quality sequence reads and each dataset requires <italic toggle="yes">ad hoc</italic> filtering based on desired application and library preparation technique. Trimming, demultiplexing, adapter removal, quality threshold filtering, artifact removal and error-correction are common pre-processing steps [<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Multiple tools exist for each of these steps, each with its own parameters as well as limitations. For example, demultiplexing tools often lack the ability to accurately assign barcodes to pooled samples [<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Some of these tools lack the ability to handle variable length barcodes, and misassignment of sample identities due to barcode swapping is an unresolved problem acknowledged by both independent research laboratories and Illumina [<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Adapter removal algorithms vary in sensitivity and searching for variable barcodes in highly multiplexed libraries can be tedious. Error-correction methods assume a high-degree of sequencing depth [<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Overall, with each tool, the number of individual parameters and the optimal sequential order of their application can have significant impact on type I (false positive) and II (false negative) error rates.</p>
    <p>Quality scores (<italic toggle="yes">Q</italic> scores) are a valuable metric for selecting high-quality reads. ASCII-encoded <italic toggle="yes">Q</italic> scores report the per-base probability of miscall based on optical fluorescence profiles measured as <italic toggle="yes">Q</italic>â=ââ10log<sub>10</sub> (probability) [<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Typically, reads are processed based on <italic toggle="yes">Q</italic> scores to avoid inclusion of erroneously called bases. Over time, changes in Illumina sequencing platforms have modified the interpretation of <italic toggle="yes">Q</italic> scores and consequently altered the practicality and uniformity of their filtering performance [<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. As the capacity to generate more sequence reads in a single sequencing run, newer platforms now bin <italic toggle="yes">Q</italic> scores for practical reasons such as reducing data storage footprint and allowing for realistic data transfer and processing time of ensuing data. The latest Illumina platform (NovaSeq 6000) has superior sequencing quality and yield but only adopts 4 out of the standard 41 Phred quality scores for binning. In addition to instrumentation, <italic toggle="yes">Q</italic> scores are largely influenced by sample and library preparation [<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16â18</xref>]. Here, independent of library preparation methods, we investigate the ability to empirically improve quality filtering by using known sequence motifs to parse reads. We propose a universal set of best practices for empirical quality filtering, and introduce ngsComposer, a user-directed, fully automated, and modular (walkthrough and walkaway mode) pipeline that prioritizes best practices.</p>
    <p>There is a community need for standardized practices in performing data preprocessing that makes few assumptions of <italic toggle="yes">Q</italic> scores, and instead relies on knowledge of library preparation and read sequence composition. We present metrics that highlight the efficacy of filtering reads using known sequence motifs coupled with, and in contrast with, <italic toggle="yes">Q</italic> score filtering. NGS reads from multiple Illumina platforms were measured for alignment accuracy and the fate of these reads under different filtering schemes, including optimal order of tools, was evaluated. Furthermore, we developed a fully automated pipeline that handles highly multiplexed data and allows for motif detection as a means of error/adapter detection and removal.</p>

        <title>Materials</title>
        <p>The MiSeq Nano 150-PE and NovaSeq SP 150-PE datasets were derived from the quantitative reduced representation sequencing (OmeSeq/qRRS) of a diverse population of 16 hexaploid sweetpotato MDP accessions. These accessions include NASPOT 10 (Kabode), SPK004 (Kakamega), NASPOT7, NASPOT 5/58, NASPOT 11, New Kawogo, Magabali, Wagabolige, NASPOT 5, NASPOT 1, Ejumula, NK259L, Dimbuka-Bukulula, Resisto, Mugande and Haurmeyano. The HiSeq 2500 high output (150-PE) and rapid run (250-PE) datasets were derived from the whole genome sequencing of a temperate-adapted sweetpotato cultivar (Beauregard) and tropical-adapted sweetpotato accession (Tanzania). DNA was extracted from young leaf tissue based on a modified CTAB DNA extraction method. The quality of the DNA samples resuspended in 1X TE buffer was determined on a 0.7% agarose gel to ensure high molecular weight (HMW) DNA. HMW DNA samples were quantified and normalized to 20Â ng/ul using PicoGreen assay, diluting with molecular grade water. All subsequent reactions were performed in NEB CutSmart buffer and all the enzymes used are compatible with this buffer.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec5">
        <title>OmeSeq/qRRS library</title>
        <p>HMW DNA was sequentially double digested with NsiI-HF and NlaIII. After digestion with Nsi-HF, 96 forward (P1) barcoded adapters were incorporated into genomic fragments by using the isothermal strand displacement activity of the Bst 2.0 warmstart polymerase. Subsequent digestion with NlaIII followed and the 96 reverse (P2) barcoded adapters were incorporated using Bst 2.0 warmstart polymerase. All combinations of the barcoded adapters, resulting in 9216-plex (96 x 96 dual barcoded), were used to ensure nucleotide diversity along entire length of fragments. Although 9216-plex is always achieved, barcoded adapters were pooled before use depending on the number of samples. Consequently, when samples are less than 9216, each sample is dual indexed multiple times. The variable length barcodes ensure nucleotide diversity at the non-variable restriction sites. Aliquots of samples are pooled into a single tube, cleaned and concentrated using Ampure magbeads, and then size selected with BluePippin for fragments between 300 and 600Â bp (construct containing genomic insert and adapters). Using the high-fidelity NEB Phusion polymerase, a PCR amplification was performed at 12Â cycles in order to incorporate sequences that bind DNA probes on Illumina flow cells. Libraries were diluted to 10Â nmol/l for sequencing on each of the Illumina sequencing platforms. To provide quality control, libraries are evaluated on the Tapestation automated electrophoresis at each step after samples are pooled.</p>

      <sec id="sec6">
        <title>OmeSeq/WGS library</title>
        <p>Using AluI and HaeIII, a partial digest was performed on the HMW DNA in order to enriched for 250â600Â bp fragments (peak intensity at 450Â bp). The blunt ends of the WGS samples were A-tailed with Klenow fragment exo-. Similar to the qRRS protocol, the 96 forward (P1) and 96 reverse (P2) barcoded adapters with T overhangs and that are complementary to the A overhang of the A-tailed genomic fragments were ligated to the genomic fragments using T4 DNA ligase. The samples were pooled, cleaned and concentrated using Ampure magbeads, and then a secondary digest was performed to eliminate all possible chimeric fragments. The restriction site at the adapter-genomic fragment conjunction are destroyed (adapters are designed so that restriction sites are not re-constituted), so the desired adapter-genomic fragment constructs remain intact. This design was also implemented for the OmeSeq/qRRS adapters. Size selection, quantitative PCR amplification, quality controls and dilution for sequencing are performed as described for the qRRS protocol.</p>

        <p>Crinoid provides summary statistics on <italic toggle="yes">Q</italic> score and nucleotide distribution. Read and quality score lines of a fastq file are traversed <italic toggle="yes">k</italic> bases at a time. Each unique sequence of bases or ASCII scores are stored as a dictionary key. The total number of encounters with that sequence is stored in a list corresponding with the <italic toggle="yes">k</italic> walk position along the read. After all reads have been summarized, the positional information in the dictionary is converted to a matrix of 5 x <italic toggle="yes">n</italic> for nucleotides and 41 x <italic toggle="yes">n</italic> for <italic toggle="yes">Q</italic> scores, where <italic toggle="yes">n</italic> is the maximum read length.</p>

        <p>Scallop is a simple read trimmer and end-trimming tool. Fixed read positions at the front (â<italic toggle="yes">f</italic>) or back (â<italic toggle="yes">b</italic>) of the read are provided for manual trimming of reads. Users may also opt for quality-based end-trimming using a sliding window approach. In this setting, a window of fixed size (â<italic toggle="yes">w</italic>) walks base-by-base from 3â² to 5â² until the window contains only bases consisting of a given end-trimming <italic toggle="yes">Q</italic> score (â<italic toggle="yes">e</italic>) or higher.</p>

        <title>anemone.py</title>
        <p>Anemone demultiplexes single- or paired-end reads using a tab-separated matrix of barcode and sample names. Reads are first examined for exact matches against the expected set of forward barcodes. To avoid possible <italic toggle="yes">I</italic>/<italic toggle="yes">O</italic> limitations of simultaneous file accession, the corresponding reverse reads are assigned in a separate pass. Although this creates some redundancy in processing, it allows for extreme flexibility in R1/R2 barcoding combinations (e.g. 96 forward and 96 reverse barcoded libraries produced by omeSeq protocol yield 9216 paired output files, 9216 unpaired R1 output files and 9216 unpaired R2 output files). Reads that are not assigned with exact matches (Hamming distanceâ=â0) are optionally subject to further passes through a lenient barcode search with greater leniency in Hamming distance, or mismatch (â<italic toggle="yes">m</italic>). In the instance that multiple barcodes match the queried read, the read is kept as an unknown to avoid sample misassignment.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec11">
        <title>rotifer.py</title>
        <p>User-defined lists of sequences are used to search the start of forward and reverse reads for expected motifs. Motifs corresponding to the forward (â<italic toggle="yes">m</italic>1) and reverse (â<italic toggle="yes">m</italic>2) reads are expected in the beginning region of reads due to library construction using restriction enzymes and/or A-tailing of blunt ends. Reads failing to contain these motifs are assumed to begin with sequencing error. Paired-end reads that both pass this test are kept as paired reads, while single ends that pass but that are missing their pair are outputted with a âse.â prefix.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec12">
        <title>porifera.py</title>
        <p>A newline separated list of expected adapters (âa1) is provided by the user, optionally containing expected buffer sequences, barcode sequences and known sequence motifs. Adapters are split into substrings of size <italic toggle="yes">k</italic> (â<italic toggle="yes">k</italic>) and each is stored in a dictionary of sequence and distance from the adapter start index. All <italic toggle="yes">k</italic>-mers of distance 0 are scanned for matches within the read, followed by <italic toggle="yes">k</italic>-mers of distance <italic toggle="yes">k</italic>, then 2Â <italic toggle="yes">k</italic> and so on. This search process is repeated next with <italic toggle="yes">k</italic>-mers of distance 1, <italic toggle="yes">k</italic>â+â1, and repeats for rounds (â<italic toggle="yes">r</italic>) or until all <italic toggle="yes">k</italic>-mers are exhausted. <italic toggle="yes">K</italic>-mer matches pointing to the same start index are assessed per-read until a set of matching positions (â<italic toggle="yes">m</italic>) is reached or the adapter is assumed not to be present. An optional mode (â<italic toggle="yes">t</italic>) allows for a modified Smith-Waterman local alignment to be performed with <italic toggle="yes">t</italic> base overlap to qualify as a hit.</p>

        <title>krill.py</title>
        <p>Integer values for desired <italic toggle="yes">Q</italic> score (â<italic toggle="yes">q</italic>) and percent read composition (â<italic toggle="yes">p</italic>) are provided by the user for threshold filtering. ASCII characters at and above <italic toggle="yes">q</italic> are stored as a list of passing scores. For each read, a failing number of bases is determined by (100 â <italic toggle="yes">p</italic>)*read length. Fastq <italic toggle="yes">Q</italic> scores are then tested 3â² to 5â² for membership in the pass list. If the non-passing characters exceed the failing number of bases, the read is rejected.</p>

      <title>Comparing performance of motif and threshold filtering</title>
      <p>For each of the datasets tested (MiSeq Nano, HiSeq 2500 high output 2 x 125, HiSeq 2500 rapid run 2 x 250, NovaSeq 6000), reads were first trimmed to remove buffer sequences (6Â bp) and demultiplexed with 1 mismatch using anemone.py. Reads were used as the basis for downstream analysis of motif-detection and threshold filtering tools, as they are expected to begin with the RE digest motif immediately following the barcode sequence.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec15">
      <title>Filtering methods</title>
      <p>Filtering was performed using threshold-filtering (krill.py) and motif-filtering (rotifer.py). Under threshold filtering, only reads consisting 90% of above of <italic toggle="yes">Q</italic> scores 30 or higher were considered as passing filtering. Motif filtering was performed in a library-specific manner. The HiSeq 2500 datasets were blunt-end fragmented using AluI/HaeIII, followed by A-tailing and adapter ligation. Only HiSeq reads beginning with the sequences âTCCâ and âTCTâ were considered passing. The MiSeq and NovaSeq datasets were prepared using the Omeseq/qRRS protocol that fragmented the genome with NsiI/NlaIII restriction enzymes. R1 reads in these libraries contained a âTGCATâ motif and R2 reads contained a âCATGâ motif. For each dataset, reads were first processed using threshold- and motif-filtering tools with failed reads written separately to file. For each of these output files, all passing and failing reads were processed again using the corresponding tool to be compared. For example, reads passing and failing the krill.py threshold filtering steps were then motif-filtered using rotifer.py, producing four final output files representing all combinations of pass and fail for combinations of the first and second tool.</p>

      <p>After demultiplexing using variable length barcodes, reads within each library were end-trimmed to identical length before filtering to facilitate unbiased read comparisons downstream. After filtering methods were applied, all sequences were extracted from the fastq output using âsedâ commands. An awk command was then applied to sequence files to collapse identical reads while retaining the frequency of the unique reads. The ratio of collapsed reads to the total number of reads was calculated per-file.</p>

      <title>Calculating empirical base-calling error rates in barcode sequences</title>
      <p>All forward (R1) reads from the MiSeq, HiSeq 2500 Rapid Run, HiSeq 2500 High Output and NovaSeq 6000 datasets were subjected to multiple rounds of demultiplexing using the ngsComposer tool anemone.py. After first demultiplexing perfect matches, the unassigned reads were subsequently demultiplexed with a Hamming distance of 1. This process was repeated with unknown reads, increasing the mismatch value at each step until reads could no longer be identified having exceeded their inherent minimum Levenshtein distance of 3 (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://github.com/roy-ht/editdistance" ext-link-type="uri">https://github.com/roy-ht/editdistance</ext-link>). For each step, the reads in the resulting output files were compared base-by-base to their corresponding barcode sequence. On a per-position basis, the probability of error was calculated as the number of bases in that position that did not match the assigned barcode divided by the total number of reads assessed at that level of mismatch and fewer. The ASCII-encoded <italic toggle="yes">Q</italic> scores were counted and grouped in the same manner.</p>

      <title>Validating software performance using simulated reads</title>
      <p>A set of 998 611 reads were simulated using the first chromosome of the <italic toggle="yes">Ipomoea batatas</italic> assembly (NCBI GenBank assembly accession: <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="GCA_002525835.2" ext-link-type="gen">GCA_002525835.2</ext-link>). Simulation of restriction enzyme fragmentation was performed using <italic toggle="yes">NsiI</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">NlaIII</italic>, and each fragment was concatenated with variable length adapters containing variable length barcodes (simulating the OmeSeq/qRRS library preparation method). Resulting fragments were drawn randomly from a normal distribution with a mean read length of 400Â bp and a standard deviation of 100Â bp. The unmutated reads were saved separately alongside the known adapter position, if present. Multiple adapter trimming tools were compared with ngsComposer. A minimum adapter overlap value of length 12 was used as this was found to avoid an overabundance of misassignments and allowed a better unbiased comparison of tools. The standalone version of porifera used adapter validation by supplying the <italic toggle="yes">NsiI</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">NlaIII</italic> sequences and was compared with a pipeline instance of the tool that automatically reduces the search space on a per sample basis.</p>

      <title>Library design and empirical <italic toggle="yes">Q</italic> score assessment</title>
      <p>To assess the effectiveness of <italic toggle="yes">Q</italic> scores compared to motif-detection as a filtering parameter, NGS data from sweetpotato (<italic toggle="yes">Ipomoea batatas</italic>) accessions and cultivars were considered from multiple Illumina platforms, each with distinct profiles. Fastq files originating from various Illumina platforms (i.e. Miseq, HiSeq 2500 Rapid Run, HiSeq 2500 High Output and NovaSeq 6000) represent a variety of read length, dye chemistry and levels of Q score binning (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figures S1</xref>â<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4</xref>). All DNA libraries were prepared using custom-designed adapters and enzyme fragmentation. Each of the adapter pairs of the dual-barcoded datasets include a 6Â bp buffer sequence region upstream of the barcode sequence, 7â10Â bp variable length barcode sequence and a 3â5Â bp motif complementary to each of the two restriction cut sites in the insert DNA (<xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). For the whole genome sequencing libraries, a T motif after the barcode is complementary to the A overhang on genomic fragments following A-tailing of blunt ends. By using adapters that contain a fixed-length and high-diversity âbuffer sequenceâ region (as implemented in the OmeSeq protocol), the sequencing-by-synthesis reaction is allowed to stabilize before base-calling in the barcode regions begins. This has a protective effect on the barcode sequences used to determine sample identity, as the initial bases in a sequencing-by-synthesis reaction tend to harbor lower <italic toggle="yes">Q</italic> scores or elevated base calling error (<xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figures S1</xref>â<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4</xref>) [<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].

      <p>Variable length barcodes with a minimum Levenshtein/edit distance of three were implemented to reduce platform-derived phasing error [<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Using variable length barcodes is also very important for achieving high nucleotide diversity in libraries fragmented with restriction enzymes or that were A-tailed, since the sequence motif region of fragments inherently lack the nucleotide diversity required for optimal run performance and generation of high-quality reads. The tool âanemone.pyâ was used to demultiplex the libraries using a dual-indexed barcoding scheme, which is known to improve assignment accuracy [<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Anemone.py prevents sample misassignment in the event that multiple barcodes have equal Hamming distance from a given read. Reads that align to multiple barcodes remain unassigned. Misassignment can be found in several widely used demultiplexing tools, which apply sample identities preferentially to the first indexed barcode when ânestingâ occurs (<xref rid="f3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>).</p>

      <p>Taking advantage of anemone.pyâs false positive sensitivity, we tested the sequencing accuracy of barcode regions by demultiplexing at increasing values of hamming distances. The per-base error rate was calculated alongside the reported instrument-derived per-base <italic toggle="yes">Q</italic> scores (<xref rid="f4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>). Empirically calculated miscall probabilities were lower than those produced by the sequencing hardware with quality score mean differences across platforms ranging between 7.81 and 18.7 (<xref rid="f4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>, <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table S1</xref>). These corresponds to approximately 6â74 times increased probability of miscall.

      <title>Evaluating read populations using expected motifs</title>
      <p>After barcode removal, we used the presence of error-free restriction enzyme site motifs as an early indicator of read reliability (motif-based error detection and filtering). Reads with error in the motifs were observed to also contain higher error rates along the entire length of the read when compared with the intact motifs (<xref rid="TB1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figures S1</xref>â<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4</xref>). Reads filtered sequentially using classic <italic toggle="yes">Q</italic> score-dependent threshold-filtering followed by motif-filtering produced populations of passing and failing reads, which were then used to evaluate the performance of both approaches. We expect a high false negative rate for stringent <italic toggle="yes">Q</italic> score threshold filtering and a high false positive rate for relaxed <italic toggle="yes">Q</italic> score threshold filtering. Since the threshold is subjective, there is currently no objective setting for the optimal threshold to minimize these false positive and false negative rates.</p>

      <p>Read compression was applied to the results of filtering as an unbiased determinant of base calling accuracy. Read depth refers to the frequency of reads aligning uniquely to a given reference locus. The restriction enzyme-based qRRS libraries examined in this study consist of numerous, identical fragments of DNA that align flush and perfectly overlap the other allelic sequences originating from the same locus and across samples. Collapsing instances of identical sequence reads within NGS datasets, termed the compression rate, were used as a proxy for unbiased error rate estimates. The compression rate value approximates the average read depth across the genome, i.e. number of times an allele was sequenced. High error rates will increase the generation of new novel reads and consequently lower compression rates. The compression rate was found to be a more sensitive metric for error rate estimation compared to using a reference genome, where alignment scores (e.g. <italic toggle="yes">E</italic>-value) are sensitive to sequence length and other parameters in the alignment algorithm [<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p>

The difference in read compression between the subsetted filtered reads was normalized against compression of MiSeq-derived raw data of the same sample size.

      <p>The motif-based filtering approach complemented the <italic toggle="yes">Q</italic> score threshold-filtering approach. In all datasets analyzed across all NGS sequencing platforms in this study, the highest compression was achieved when both filtering approaches were applied (<xref rid="f5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>). Read sequences failing these filtering approaches consisted of more unique/singleton reads due to increased error rates and consequently had a negative change in compression when normalized against random sampling of the unfiltered dataset to account for the effect of reduced sample size. These patterns persisted in the failed reads even when limiting the scope to the body of the read while excluding the motif region, further validating that a failure to sequence the motif accurately will lead to miscall within the rest of the read (<xref rid="TB1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Motif-filtering improvement of compression was found to be most effective in the MiSeq dataset (2.48% improvement alone, 6.06% improvement combined with threshold of q30 at 90%). In some instances, the improvement was marginal (0.45% improvement in HiSeq 2500 high output); however, the number of reads removed using motif-filtering was much lower than with threshold filtering (<xref rid="TB1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). It is also worth noting that the OmeSeq protocol produced raw sequence reads with high-quality, hence, we would typically expect significantly higher improvement with data derived from most library preparation protocols. The subset of reads removed by the two filtering methods had little overlap as each appeared to target nearly distinct reads within the overall dataset.</p>

      <title>Improved adapter detection using barcode-specific search schema</title>
      <p>Adapter removal is an important step in many NGS libraries and detection can be improved using expected motifs. Adapter sequences including barcode and restriction site motifs are expected to increase adapter detection sensitivity as these sequences are further upstream of the characteristic 3â² drop in sequence quality [<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Herten <italic toggle="yes">etÂ al</italic>. [<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] showed the inclusion of restriction motifs improved adapter detection. Here, the tool porifera.py has been developed to k-mer walk through a list of adapters (i.e. combination of adapter, buffer sequences, barcode sequences and known motifs) and search a user-defined number of rounds (or default) until aligned <italic toggle="yes">k</italic>-mers point to the same start index or a read is deemed to be adapter-free. The <italic toggle="yes">k</italic>-mer approach avoids local alignment issues encountered when a string of âAâ or âGâ sequencing artifacts appear in the instance of a deeply embedded adapter. The ngsComposer pipeline narrows the adapter search space by only attempting to align reads with their associated adapters, which contain sample-specific barcodes. Adapters including barcodes and barcodes with restriction sites detected reads at a higher frequency and removed non-genomic DNA (<xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>).</p>

      <title>Validating software performance using simulated reads</title>
      <p>Simulation of Illumina reads allowed for testing the performance of the motif-based NGS filtering approach highlighted in the ngsComposer pipeline and tools. We confirmed our findings that a motif-based filtering approach is useful for NGS data filtering, as shown in both real and simulated data (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figures S9</xref> and <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">S10</xref>). We also confirmed the obvious benefit to including barcodes, a contaminating non-genomic sequence, in the adapter searching step (<xref rid="TB2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figures S11</xref> and <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">S12</xref>). Overall, the false positive rates were similar across all tools except for AdapterRemoval, which had very high false positive rates. While including the barcodes as part of the contaminating adapter sequence should be considered best practice for multiplexed libraries, we evaluated a naÃ¯ve approach that only uses the Illumina adapter sequence. While using a single adapter sequence also produced low false positives, it led to about twice as much false negative rate (i.e. reduced detection of adapters in reads). The false negative rates were similar across all tools tested, with Cutadapt and AdapterRemoval performing slightly better but typically at the expense of elevated false positive rates. The ngsComposer pipeline leverages speed and accuracy by only searching for those adapters containing the unique barcodes associated with the appropriate sample (<xref rid="TB2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). In pipeline mode, porifera is 7â38 times faster compared to other tools tested. In standalone mode, the speed is similar to AdapterRemoval and 5â5.6 times faster than Cutadapt and Skewer, respectively (<xref rid="TB2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>).</p>

      <title>Implementation</title>
      <p>The software, ngsComposer, is designed with simplified user input at every critical step in data filtering. Any of the provided tools may be run individually or as an automated pipeline. In pipeline mode, users have the option to see read summaries and qc plots and re-define variables on the fly as a part of âwalkthroughâ mode. Multiple libraries from different sequencing runs may be combined for preprocessing, each with its own set of barcodes and associated unique sample IDs. In pipeline mode, paired end reads are automatically recognized and pairing preserved throughout. Reads that become unmated due to removal of paired R1 or R2 reads are retained in all subsequent steps in a single end reads directory.</p>

    <title>DISCUSSION</title>
    <p>Filtering NGS data are a routine procedure intended to retrieve sequence reads with minimal base calling error, as well as identification and removal of low-quality base calls by trimming reads at the 5â² and 3â² ends. Traditionally, <italic toggle="yes">Q</italic> scores are the exclusive determinant of the reliability of sequencing certainty. While <italic toggle="yes">Q</italic> scores are useful as a filtering metric, there is mounting evidence and suggesting that <italic toggle="yes">Q</italic> scores should not be taken at face value and can have variable interpretations across NGS platforms. The higher empirical estimates of error rates in the barcode and restriction site regions described here imply that <italic toggle="yes">Q</italic> scores may not match the expected logarithmic Phred base-calling error probability. Some SNP calling and filtering approaches have opted to ignore <italic toggle="yes">Q</italic> scores altogether due to a biasing tendency against SNPs on distal ends of reads [<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Only a few efforts exist that attempt to determine read accuracy with certainty and independent of platform-derived quality scores. Alignment to reference assemblies is possible with smaller genomes but may vary based on reference assembly and the significance of single base mutations may not be captured by alignment scoring penalties alone. Studies reveal that accuracy of various error correction algorithms differed considerably across all types of data set [<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p>
    <p>Our pipeline works off the assumption that reads containing high-quality base calls in expected sequence (barcodes, restriction site and A-tailed reads) near the 5â² end will contain higher quality base-calling across the entire read length and will contain fewer erroneous base calls internal to the read body. This assumption was confirmed by elevated error rates in entire read length whenever there was base calling error in the motif. Emphasizing motif-filtering retains reliable high-quality base-calls required for applications such as variant calling, strain-level microbiome profiling and <italic toggle="yes">de novo</italic> assembly of genomes and transcriptomes. Motif-detection is independent of platform and encompasses some of the errors that might be detected in other filtering approaches.</p>
    <p>To provide additional validation for the efficacy of motif-based filtering, we used the read compression rates to confirm that errors in motif region are often tied to additional error elsewhere in the body of the read. Read compression is an unbiased measure of sequencing accuracy. Lower compression rates indicate that at least one base miscall or indel has occurred in the read. An increase in read compression indicates that filtering has recovered high-quality reads and eliminated unique reads derived from erroneous base calls that would normally reduce compression. Not surprisingly, read reliability was most improved by implementing empirical motif-detection alongside machine-generated <italic toggle="yes">Q</italic> score threshold-filtering. In combination with the motif-based approach, <italic toggle="yes">Q</italic> score filtering thresholds can be relaxed to reduce false negative rates without the consequence of increasing false positive rates. While subsets of reads filtered by motif-presence always had an improvement in read compression, these reads were often classified independently from reads containing high <italic toggle="yes">Q</italic> score composition. This underscores the sensitivity of motif-based filtering and utility for identifying false negatives associated with <italic toggle="yes">Q</italic> score-based filtering. Motif inclusion has been a previously subtle feature investigated by Herten <italic toggle="yes">etÂ al</italic>. [<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. It has the potential to bypass platform and even sequencing run variation. It is possible that strict motif-filtering and the compression rate analysis reported here could have applications in reviving the wealth of previously published sequencing data.</p>
    <p>The ngsComposer software is a fastq preprocessing pipeline designed for straightforward and repeatable results that extend the power of <italic toggle="yes">Q</italic> score-based filtering. As revealed by the datasets generated with the OmeSeq protocol, reported here, consideration of assay design during library preparation can improve overall sequencing reaction quality and features in library constructs can provide information and quality control that can enhance data preprocessing. Furthermore, ngsComposer provides researchers with a practical framework to reliably handle multi-sample projects with complex barcoding schema and organizing paired-end data from their raw to analysis-ready state.</p>
