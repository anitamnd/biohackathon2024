      <title>Abstract</title>
      <p>Genetic mapping in 2-generation crosses requires genotyping, usually performed with single nucleotide polymorphism markers arrays which provide high-density genetic information. However, genetic analysis on raw genotypes can lead to spurious or unreliable results due to defective single nucleotide polymorphism assays or wrong genotype interpretation. Here, we introduce stuart, an open-source R package, which analyzes raw genotyping data to filter single nucleotide polymorphism markers based on informativeness, Mendelian inheritance pattern, and consistency with parental genotypes. The functions of this package provide a curation pipeline and formatting adequate for genetic analysis with the R/qtl package. stuart is available with detailed documentation from <ext-link xlink:href="https://gitlab.pasteur.fr/mouselab/stuart/" ext-link-type="uri">https://gitlab.pasteur.fr/mouselab/stuart/</ext-link>.</p>

    <title>Introduction</title>
    <p>Genetic mapping of Mendelian or quantitative traits in inbred strains is classically achieved in 2-generation crosses such as intercrosses (F2) and backcrosses (N2), in which the inheritance of the trait is compared with the genotypes at multiple genetic markers encompassing the genome map. Variations of a quantitative trait are controlled by one or more quantitative trait loci (QTLs). A QTL is defined as a marker at which individuals carrying different genotypes show different average trait values. QTL mapping searches for QTLs by testing the association between trait values and genotypes at markers spanning the genome map. The statistical significance of the association is expressed as logarithm of the odds (LOD) score which is calculated for each genotyped marker and, at intermediates positions, for pseudomarkers created by interval mapping, generating an LOD score curve (<xref rid="jkac219-B1" ref-type="bibr">Broman 2001</xref>). The curve peaks at regions potentially associated with the trait. These peaks are called QTLs if they reach predefined statistical thresholds established either from general statistical models (<xref rid="jkac219-B10" ref-type="bibr">Lander and Kruglyak 1995</xref>) or by permutation tests performed on the cross data. For each permutation, phenotypes are shuffled between individuals to break real associations, and LOD scores are calculated to identify peaks, which are all false positives. The distribution of the peak LOD scores over a large number (&gt;1,000) of permutations provides statistical thresholds: if a LOD score of 3.8 or higher is observed in 5% of the permutations, this value will be taken as the <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.05 threshold (<xref rid="jkac219-B7" ref-type="bibr">Doerge and Churchill 1996</xref>). QTL mapping on F2s and N2s can be conducted with R packages such as R/qtl (<xref rid="jkac219-B4" ref-type="bibr">Broman <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2003</xref>) and R/qtl2(<xref rid="jkac219-B3" ref-type="bibr">Broman <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2019</xref>).</p>
    <p>With genome sequencing, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have become the standard across species for their very high frequency, low cost, and high-throughput analysis using various genotyping platforms. In mice, several generations of Mouse Universal Genotyping Arrays (MUGA) have been developed, the most recent being GigaMUGA (143k SNPs; <xref rid="jkac219-B13" ref-type="bibr">Morgan <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2015</xref>) and MiniMUGA (10.8k SNPs; <xref rid="jkac219-B14" ref-type="bibr">Sigmon <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2020</xref>). GigaMUGA provides high-density coverage for the fine characterization of inbred strains or outbred populations such as the Diversity Outbred (<xref rid="jkac219-B15" ref-type="bibr">Svenson <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2012</xref>), while the modest number of SNPs in MiniMUGA is largely sufficient to genotype intercrossed or backcrossed individuals. However, SNP reliability is affected by the performance of genotyping platforms and polymorphism between and within inbred strains. Spurious or unreliable mapping outputs can result from defective SNP assays or wrong genotype interpretations. Therefore, raw data obtained from genotyping services must be curated before performing genetic analyses.</p>
    <p>Several tools exist for quality control of SNP genotyping arrays, including Illumina's GenomeStudio. R packages such as argyle (<xref rid="jkac219-B12" ref-type="bibr">Morgan 2015</xref>) analyze hybridization intensity signals from MUGA arrays. The simple genetic structure of 2-generation crosses provides specific and efficient means for identifying spurious genotyping data, such as consistency with parental genotypes and expected Mendelian proportions. The R/qtl package includes functions to build genetic maps and check for genotype consistency (<ext-link xlink:href="https://rqtl.org/tutorials/geneticmaps.pdf" ext-link-type="uri">https://rqtl.org/tutorials/geneticmaps.pdf</ext-link>). However, this control is performed once genotypes have been imported and involves multiple steps of manual curation. To provide a more automated process of data curation before genetic analysis, we have developed stuart, an R package that implements a pipeline for automatic filtering and curation of SNP genotyping data from 2-generation crosses based on simple rules. This package formats raw SNP allele calls from Illumina files into genotypes ready for importation in R/qtl. Using 3 intercross datasets, we illustrate the consequences of inconsistent genotypes on the estimated marker map and QTL mapping, and how the curation achieved by each function in stuart leads to trustable results.</p>

    <title>Materials and methods</title>
    <p>stuart is a tidyverse (<xref rid="jkac219-B17" ref-type="bibr">Wickham <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2019</xref>) based R package requiring R version 3.5.0 or later. Its open source is available on Institut Pasteur’s GitLab: <ext-link xlink:href="https://gitlab.pasteur.fr/mouselab/stuart/" ext-link-type="uri">https://gitlab.pasteur.fr/mouselab/stuart/</ext-link> and can be installed with devtools (<xref rid="jkac219-B18" ref-type="bibr">Wickham <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2021</xref>). stuart’s vignette provides detailed descriptions of data import and of each function.stuart imports SNP allele calls from MUGA Illumina platform or other sources using the same file format. The central object of stuart is the marker table which summarizes for each marker, the alleles found in the population, the number of individuals of each genotype and the exclusion status resulting from the curation steps. stuart exports curated data to an R/qtl compatible format. The SNP annotation file used was downloaded from <ext-link xlink:href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kbroman/MUGAarrays/master/UWisc/mini_uwisc_v2.csv" ext-link-type="uri">https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kbroman/MUGAarrays/master/UWisc/mini_uwisc_v2.csv</ext-link> (last accessed August 29, 2022).</p>
    <p>Three datasets were used to test the package. This article presents the results from 176 (CC001/Unc X C57BL/6J-<italic toggle="yes">Ifnar1</italic> KO) F2 mice (dataset 1). The analysis of 2 other data sets, 94 (C57BL/6J-<italic toggle="yes">Ifnar1</italic> KO X 129S2/SvPas-<italic toggle="yes">Ifnar1</italic> KO) F2 mice (dataset 2) and 89 (C57BL/6NCrl X CC021/Unc) F2 mice (dataset 3) is presented as <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary data</xref>. Quantitative traits were studied in the 3 F2s. Phenotype distributions are presented in <xref rid="f1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>. Genotyping was performed by Neogen (Auchincruive, Scotland) with MiniMUGA on DNA prepared from tail biopsies using standard phenol-chloroform extraction. Genotype call rate was 0.927, 0.931, and 0.948 for dataset 1, dataset 2, and dataset 3, respectively. QTL mapping was performed using R/qtl. Statistical significance of phenotype–genotype association was computed by data permutation (<xref rid="jkac219-B7" ref-type="bibr">Doerge and Churchill 1996</xref>), which provides genome-wide thresholds accounting for multiple testing. The following thresholds were used, as commonly accepted (<xref rid="jkac219-B11" ref-type="bibr">Members of the Complex Trait Consortium 2003</xref>): <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.05 for significant association, <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.1 and <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.63 for the suggestive association. All figures were designed with ggplot2 (<xref rid="jkac219-B16" ref-type="bibr">Wickham 2016</xref>) or R/qtl.</p>

      <title>Consequences of inconsistent genotypes</title>
      <p>SNP data delivered by the Illumina platform are base alleles that need to be translated into genotypes for genetic analysis. From our experience on multiple 2-generation crosses, we identified several types of genotype inconsistencies that were responsible for distorted marker maps and spurious QTL mapping results. Recombination fraction (RF), which measures the genetic distance between 2 markers, is estimated in a cross by analyzing the proportion of recombinants between adjacent markers in all individuals. The map of markers calculated from the cross data should be consistent with their known positions. The R/qtl est.map() and plotMap() functions produce a graphical comparison of the 2 maps (<xref rid="jkac219-F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref> and <xref rid="f2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>, <xref rid="f2" ref-type="supplementary-material">a</xref> and <xref rid="f2" ref-type="supplementary-material">b</xref>). For each chromosome, the known position of each marker provided in the annotation file (left) is connected with the estimated position (right) based on observed RF. With minimally curated genotypes (exclusion of nonpolymorphic markers and markers with over 50% missing genotypes), large RF was found in many instances between closely linked markers, resulting in fan-like patterns. To further describe these distortions, we computed the distribution of the ratio between the calculated and the known genetic distances between adjacent markers (<xref rid="jkac219-F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref> and <xref rid="f2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 2, c</xref> and <xref rid="f2" ref-type="supplementary-material">d</xref>; to avoid exaggerated ratios, we considered only markers with a known distance of 1 cM or more). This analysis revealed 2 groups of markers. In dataset 1, for 43% % of them, the ratio was below 5 and followed a Gaussian distribution with mean = 1.31 and SD = 0.77. The other markers (57%) showed a ratio between 5 and 981.87 (<xref rid="jkac219-F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>) which necessarily results from incorrect genotypes, as only a few individuals should show recombination between adjacent markers. On chromosome 1, while the known marker positions spanned ∼100 cM, the cumulated genetic distance estimated from observed RF was ∼40,000 cM. As QTL mapping relies on coherent genotypes at a series of markers encompassing a genetic interval, problematic genotypes at a given marker will perturb the analysis and, in some cases, may result in peaks of the LOD score curve in the absence of true association (<xref rid="jkac219-B5" ref-type="bibr">Cheung <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2014</xref>). Such false positives increase significance thresholds calculated by data permutation.</p>

          <p>Analysis of the dataset 1 illustrating the consequences of genotyping errors and inconsistencies on QTL mapping. Nonpolymorphic markers and markers with more than 50% missing genotypes were excluded to avoid excessive calculation time. a) Comparison of the known marker map (left) and the genetic map estimated from observed RF (right), as calculated by est.map() and represented by plotMap() functions of R/qtl. Lines connect the positions of each marker in the 2 maps. The estimated map is considerably expanded because of multiple genotype inconsistencies. b) Distribution of the ratio between estimated and known distances between adjacent markers. Markers with known and calculated distances below 1 cM were removed as they may lead to extremely small or large ratios. The expansion of the estimated map leads to a distribution tail of high ratios. The <italic toggle="yes">y</italic>-axis is in logarithmic scale. Fifty-seven percent of markers have a ratio above 5 (dashed line). c) Output of the scanone function of R/qtl showing the identification of narrow LOD score peaks. Genome-wide significance thresholds computed by data permutation are shown as plain (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.05), dotted (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.1), and dashed (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.63) lines. d) Magnification of the scanone plot restricted to chromosome 13 (peak p2). The LOD score peak is located on one marker (red tick) distant by 1.728 and 1.24 cM from the proximal and distal markers, respectively, on the known marker map, but by 1,001.582 and 1,001.506 cM based on calculated RF.</p>

      <p>These 2 consequences of genotyping inconsistencies are illustrated in <xref rid="jkac219-F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref> and <xref rid="f3" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 3, a</xref> and <xref rid="f3" ref-type="supplementary-material">b</xref> which were obtained using the R/qtl scanone() function on a quantitative trait from the uncurated F2 datasets. For dataset 1, the <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.05 significance threshold was estimated at 19.4 (<xref rid="jkac219-F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>), while it usually ranges between 3.3 and 4.3 depending on the inheritance model for crosses of this type and size (<xref rid="jkac219-B10" ref-type="bibr">Lander and Kruglyak 1995</xref>). Several peaks were detected although none reached <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.05 significance. Moreover, their narrow profile was highly unexpected in F2 crosses. Indeed, these peaks involved only 1–3 markers, and the LOD score curve felt abruptly between these and adjacent markers on both sides (<xref rid="jkac219-F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref>), while genetic linkage between closely linked markers should result in progressive decrease of the LOD score curve on both sides of a peak (<xref rid="jkac219-B9" ref-type="bibr">Guénet <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2015</xref>). Among the 3 datasets, we identified 4 narrow peaks reaching suggestive significance level (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &lt; 0.63): 2 were located at a marker with non-Mendelian allelic proportions and 2 were located at 1–3 pseudomarkers adjacent to a marker with non-Mendelian proportions (<xref rid="f3" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 3, c, d</xref> and <xref rid="f3" ref-type="supplementary-material">e, f</xref>, respectively). We identified 5 other narrow peaks (LOD score between 6.72 and 10.03) out of which 4 resulted from the same situations as above and one was located on a pseudomaker and a marker with non-Mendelian proportions.</p>
      <p>Inconsistent marker maps may also originate from the wrong assignment of markers to their chromosome and position provided to the mapping program. Indeed, R/qtl developer K. Broman identified errors in MUGA arrays annotation files affecting marker positions, probe sequences mapping to several locations, and unmappable markers. We recommend using K. Broman’s corrected annotation files available on GitHub. The conversion of SNP alleles (A, C, T, G) observed in second-generation individuals (SGIs) to genotypes encoded according to the parental alleles may also create genotype errors. Reference SNP alleles established for many mouse strains may be used to infer the SGI genotypes. However, we recommend genotyping individuals of the parental strains used in the cross since they could differ from the reference panel. In our example dataset, the 2 parental strains used in the cross showed allelic differences with their reference panel counterpart at 200 markers.</p>

        <title>Data importation</title>
        <p>Genetic mapping requires both genotype and phenotype data. Required formats and instructions are detailed in the vignette (see example of phenotype data in <xref rid="t1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). Parental strains’ genotyping data can be loaded from the same genotyping results as the SGI, from a previous genotyping file or from a reference file. Annotation data from K. Broman can be imported directly from GitHub. The geno_strains() function formats parental genotypes from a 2-allele encoding in Illumina format into a single letter encoding, and merges these data with the annotation table into a table with parental allele and marker positions.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>Consistency between parents and SGI alleles and genotypes</title>
        <p>Several generations of MUGA arrays have been developed (Mega, Giga, Mini), each with successive versions differing by multiple SNP markers. If parental and SGI data were produced on different versions, the marker lists must be compared to retain only common SNPs. This is achieved by the mark_match() function.</p>
        <p>Converting alleles into genotypes requires that SGI segregate for the 2 parental alleles, and that each allele is found only in one parent. The aim of the mark_allele() function is to control consistency of allele's origin at multiple levels.</p>
        <p>First, this function excludes markers with missing data in both parents. If allele data are available for only one parent and this allele is also found in SGI, the other allele present in SGI will be assigned to the parent with missing allele. However, this imputation is not error-free since we have observed, in rare occasions, markers which alleles were identical in the parental strains but were polymorphic in the SGI (<xref rid="jkac219-T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> for such SNPs in dataset 1). This situation may occur when the parental strains used in the cross have diverged from those of the reference panel, or if one parent is heterozygous. Such markers will be excluded by the mark_allele() function but they could escape detection if allele information was missing in one parent. Adding the parNH = FALSE argument to the mark_allele() function will exclude markers missing one parental allele or for which one parent is heterozygous. However, while preventing rare errors, this option will also exclude a number of truly informative markers.</p>

        <title>Mendelian proportions</title>
        <p>In 2-generation crosses between inbred strains, the proportions of the 2 or 3 classes of genotypes are predictable, i.e. for autosomes, 25% of each type of homozygotes and 50% of heterozygotes in an intercross, and 50% of homozygotes and 50% of heterozygotes in a backcross. Comparing the observed proportions with these expectations provides another criterion of filtering.</p>
        <p>The mark_prop() function filters markers based either on a minimum proportion of each genotype or on the statistically significant departure from the expected proportions (Chi<sup>2</sup> test, with a <italic toggle="yes">P</italic>-value threshold). <xref rid="jkac219-F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2b</xref> shows the exclusions of the autosomal markers depending on the proportion of each genotype. X chromosome genotypic proportions differ from autosomes, therefore, different arguments of mark_prop() function are used to filter X-linked markers for more precise curation.</p>

        <title>Filtering report and impact on QTL mapping results</title>
        <p>At every step, the markers filtered out are annotated in a marker table which can be exported for further inspection. The last column of <xref rid="jkac219-T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> shows the number of markers retained after each step in the example dataset 1. Most of the starting markers (7,180/11,125 = 65%) which were eventually removed by stuart's functions were removed by mark_poly() as nonpolymorphic, a ratio expected for crosses between 2 standard mouse inbred strains (<xref rid="jkac219-B8" ref-type="bibr">Frazer <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2007</xref>). mark_allele() rejected 750 markers, mark_na() 457 and mark_prop() 484. Across the 3 datasets, we found 1,546 markers with either non-Mendelian proportions or allele inconsistencies between parental strains and SGIs. Overall, 619 of them were retained by stuart’s filtering in at least one of the other crosses, ruling out their misassignment to the genetic map. Out of the residual markers, 85 were removed from all datasets for another criterion than absence of polymorphism and were therefore considered as unreliable.</p>
        <p>At this step, the dataset may still contain markers showing high RFs with adjacent markers either for a reason not tested by the current version of stuart or due to the parameters used in mark_na() and mark_prop() functions. These markers can be identified by calculating the estimated map using R/qtl est.map() and using stuart’s mark_estmap() function which excludes markers presenting high RFs with adjacent markers. Over the 3 datasets, 9 markers were removed by mark_estmap(). Five of them were retained in at least one other dataset, indicating the problem was dataset specific. Finally, for dataset 1, 2,251 markers passed all steps resulting in an average genetic interval between adjacent markers lower than 2 cM, which is largely sufficient to perform QTL mapping (<xref rid="jkac219-B6" ref-type="bibr">Darvasi <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 1993</xref>). After curation, phenotype and genotype data are combined and exported in the R/qtl format using the write_rqtl() function. The qtl2convert package (<xref rid="jkac219-B2" ref-type="bibr">Broman 2021</xref>) converts this output into the adequate format required by the more recent R/qtl2 package.</p>

The known marker map and the estimated genetic map are consistent, with minimal expansions or contractions. Large ratios between the calculated and the known genetic distances between adjacent markers have been eliminated (<xref rid="jkac219-F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>, <xref rid="f4" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 4, c</xref> and <xref rid="f4" ref-type="supplementary-material">d</xref>).

Refer to <xref rid="jkac219-F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> for comparison with original data. a) The estimated marker map is now consistent with the known marker map. Despite some contraction or expansion of specific intervals, the genome length of the observed marker map for each chromosome is consistent with the known map (ratio between the calculated and the known length of the genome: 1.12). b) The distribution of the ratio between estimated and known distance between adjacent markers. Markers with known and calculated distances below 1 cM were removed as they may lead to extremely small or large ratios. Ratios are normally distributed with mean = 1.33 and SD = 0.81 showing consistency between the known and estimated maps. c) The LOD score curve shows several peaks, one of which is significant at <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &lt; 0.05 (plain line, genome-wide significance computed by data permutation). Note that the significance thresholds are much lower than in <xref rid="jkac219-F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>.

        <p>Being very simple to use and efficient at curating genotyping errors, stuart will facilitate the use of genotyping arrays for genetic mapping purposes in 2-generation crosses, bridging the gap between raw allele data produced by SNP platforms and genetic analysis software. Moreover, its functions can be used independently to analyze inbred strains genotypes. For example, geno_strain() creates a genotype consensus between 2 or more individuals of the same strain suitable for further inspection, which can be useful when genotyping or regenotyping a strain of interest. Comparing genotyping results of an inbred strain after several generations of breeding with mark_allele() will readily identify variants that have emerged or been selected over time. Likewise, this function will help identifying genetic variants between substrains.</p>

    <title>Data Availability</title>
    <p>All datasets used as examples in this article are available from <ext-link xlink:href="https://gitlab.pasteur.fr/mouselab/stuart/" ext-link-type="uri">https://gitlab.pasteur.fr/mouselab/stuart/</ext-link>. Dataset 1 is included in the package and can be loaded once the package is loaded (see the vignette for details). The 2 other datasets are available from GitLab in the “article” directory in separate folders (i.e. “data2” and “data3”). Each folder contains the genotypes of the SGIs in file “geno_dataX.csv,” the phenotypes of the SGIs in file “pheno_dataX.csv,” the parental strains’ genotypes in file “parents_dataX.csv” and the reference genotypes for the parental strains in file “ref_geno_dataX.csv.” Analysis of each cross is in each folder in an R markdown file (“dataX.Rmd”).</p>
