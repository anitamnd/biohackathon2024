    <title>1 Introduction</title>
    <p>Finding biologically meaningful groups exhibiting coherent within-group similarities and between-group differences is often the first critical step in any analysis of modern high-throughput data. An interesting characteristic that real biological networks represent is the clustering or community structure, under which the network topology is organized into modules commonly known as communities or clusters. While clustering and community discovery differ in their representation of detected group entities, they share many commonalities and our use case in this study is based on biological questions benefiting both finding clusters and detecting communities.</p>
    <p>Despite being a highly researched unsupervised problem supported by a myriad of algorithms from diverse scientific disciplines, clustering and community structure detection remains computationally and biologically challenging. This is particularly due to the technical nature of the associated data, which are typically noisy and high dimensional with confounding effects unique to individual technology (e.g. platform-specific batch effects). With ever-increasing multi-omics efforts and the associated technology-specific challenges, there is a need for more data-driven methods that are capable of finding biologically meaningful communities in a technology-agnostic manner.</p>
    <p>In addition to the omics-specific challenges, there are some long standing issues shared by most existing clustering (<xref rid="btab317-B1" ref-type="bibr">Altman, 1992</xref>; <xref rid="btab317-B34" ref-type="bibr">Sibson, 1973</xref>) and community detection algorithms (<xref rid="btab317-B4" ref-type="bibr">Blondel <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="btab317-B5" ref-type="bibr">Bohlin <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>). Clear challenges remain to determine the most appropriate number of clusters as well as the most appropriate distance metric for a particular dataset. For example, a problem akin to hierarchical clustering is the careful tuning of the resolution parameter as well as the selection of appropriate evaluation criteria. When applied in high-throughput biology contexts, these are exacerbated by sparse and highly variable measurements with additional challenges introduced by the heterogeneity of the associated features. For instance, in metabolomics, some groups of metabolites have greater inter-feature distances than others or in microbial communities, distance between species is often related to sample environment (<xref rid="btab317-B24" ref-type="bibr">Lloyd-Price <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>). These, together with the inter-individual differences introduced by the potential confounding factors (e.g. gender and age), calls for an algorithm that detects communities and attributes putatively meaningful biological factors to the detected community structure.</p>
  </sec>
  <sec>
    <title>2 Materials and methods</title>
    <p>Multi-resolution clustering (<italic toggle="yes">omeClust</italic>) identifies communities within datasets potentially consisting of heterogeneous âfeaturesâ. Features can be biomarkers from omics molecular profiles (e.g. taxa, genes, pathways, chemicals, etc.) potentially accompanied by the associated metadata (e.g. epidemiological variables, clinical, pharmaceutical and environmental covariates, among others). The relevant features are therefore, specifically defined in a study-specific manner relative to the data and research question posed by the individual study. To achieve generality of our approach, a key <italic toggle="yes">omeClust</italic> input is a distance matrix of features. For an input dataset containing values from samples alongside a pre-calculated distance matrix between points (measurements) (<xref rid="btab317-F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>), the <italic toggle="yes">omeClust</italic> algorithm proceeds by (i) building a representation of the overall structure of point distances (a hierarchy) using hierarchical clustering (zoom out) (<xref rid="btab317-F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>), (ii) descending the hierarchy to find heterogeneous clusters (zoom in) using a <bold>binary-silhouette score</bold>, (iii) calculating resolution scores (defined as the harmonic mean of the number of cluster members and the similarity between cluster members) for each cluster to prioritize important clusters and <bold>enrichment scores</bold> including normalized mutual information (NMI) and frequency-based scores for each metadata to rank the influence of the variable on the detected communities (if provided) and (iv) finally, generating graphic visualizations (<xref rid="btab317-F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref> and <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. S1</xref>) and reporting interpretable clustering results (<xref rid="btab317-F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref>). We cover each of these key workflow elements in more detail below.</p>

The distance matrix can be obtained using any appropriate metric, such as BrayâCurtis distance for microbiome data or nucleotide-based distance for DNA sequence data. (<bold>b</bold>) Two-stage cluster detection applies (i) hierarchical clustering to find the hierarchical distance structure among features and (ii) trace up-down using a binary-silhouette score to find cluster nodes. (<bold>c</bold>) omeClust provides several ordination plots to represent the clustering results. The color represents cluster membership; the shape is used to present the most influential metadata in the detected clusters.

    </fig>
    <p>In summary, <italic toggle="yes">omeClust</italic> finds communities by generating an overall structure of relationships between points (samples or features) in the form of a hierarchical cluster based on a user-defined distance matrix, and then descends the hierarchy to find communities of homogeneous features. This approach uses two unique algorithms: (i) Algorithm 1 is designed to descend a hierarchy and return intermediate nodes in the hierarchy that represent communities, and (ii) Algorithm 2 is similarly designed to find heterogeneous clusters using a binary-silhouette score.</p>
    <sec>
      <title>2.1 Binary-silhouette score</title>
      <p>Binary-silhouette, defined in Algorithm 2, is a measurement to quantify how well members within a branch are related compared to the sibling branch in a hierarchy. A hierarchy is a binary tree, and each node has two children nodes. We calculate a binary-silhouette score, which is similar to a silhouette score (<xref rid="btab317-B30" ref-type="bibr">Ogbuabor and Ugwoke, 2018</xref>) except that, in binary-silhouette scoring, we only consider two clusters, left and right, rather than all clusters, when the score is measured. When we measure the binary-silhouette score for the left child (<italic toggle="yes">from</italic>: a) in a node, we use the immediate right child as another cluster (<italic toggle="yes">to</italic>: b) and vice-versa.</p>

      </p>
    </sec>
    <sec>
      <title>2.2 Enrichment score</title>
      <p>To measure the influence of each metadatum on the community structure, <italic toggle="yes">omeClust</italic> implements two approaches, <bold><italic toggle="yes">freq</italic></bold> and <bold><italic toggle="yes">nmi</italic></bold>. While <italic toggle="yes">omeClust</italic> by default, discretizes the continuous metadata, essentially any metadata that can be converted to a float data type can be used as an input to the <italic toggle="yes">omeClust</italic> algorithm. For the <bold><italic toggle="yes">freq</italic></bold>approach, enrichment scores are computed by calculating the number of occurrences of the most frequent category of a metadata in a community, which is then scaled by dividing by the number of community members. The mean enrichment scores for each major cluster are then used to rank the influence of each metadatum on the detected community structure. Major clusters with &gt;0.05 enrichment scores are highlighted and returned. The <bold><italic toggle="yes">nmi</italic></bold> approach, on the other hand, directly uses the NMI (<xref rid="btab317-B11" ref-type="bibr">EstÃ©vez <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="btab317-B21" ref-type="bibr">KvÃ¥lseth, 2017</xref>) between the community labels and the metadata values as enrichment scores. NMI is a measure to evaluate the dependency between two variables, and it is a variant of mutual information from information theory which provides an interpretable quantification. If two variables are completely independent (no association) the NMI will be 0, whereas, for two identical variables, the NMI will be 1.</p>
      <p>At a deeper level, <italic toggle="yes">omeClust</italic> uses hierarchical clustering to build an overall structure of potentially heterogeneous features and subsequently detects communities of related features. For hierarchical clustering, by default, <italic toggle="yes">omeClust</italic> uses a complete-linkage approach (<xref rid="btab317-B17" ref-type="bibr">GroÃwendt and RÃ¶glin, 2017</xref>); however, the algorithm is robust to the specification of the linkage method (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. S2</xref>) as other well-used approaches, such as <italic toggle="yes">single</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">average</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">complete</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">weighted</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">centroid</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">median</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">ward</italic> can be provided as options by the user. Specifically, for community detection, <italic toggle="yes">omeClust</italic> undertakes a top-down recursive approach beginning at the root of the hierarchical tree and descending to a set of nodes within the tree. For descent, <italic toggle="yes">omeClust</italic> compares a nodeâs binary-silhouette score with its two direct children. This procedure is repeated until termination, i.e. when the selected nodes represent single features in their respective data trees or the current nodesâ binary-silhouette score is larger than its children. All tips under a node in the hierarchy are considered a cluster if the node has a greater score than its children. Philosophically, <italic toggle="yes">omeClustâ</italic>s approach is similar to a static tree cut (e.g. <italic toggle="yes">the cutree</italic> function in R) that creates groups from hierarchical clustering using an arbitrary cut threshold and returns groups in branches under the cut level (<xref rid="btab317-B22" ref-type="bibr">Langfelder <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). However, <italic toggle="yes">omeClustâ</italic>s approach differs fundamentally from <italic toggle="yes">cutree</italic> in that <italic toggle="yes">omeClust</italic> finds the cut levels adaptively at various distance levels, whereas <italic toggle="yes">cutree</italic> cuts all the hierarchy at an arbitrary and constant level provided by the user.</p>

    <title>3 <italic toggle="yes">OmeClust</italic> increases community detection power in omics data</title>
    <p>When applied to datasets with no clear cluster structure, <italic toggle="yes">omeClust</italic> reports singleton clusters, as expected, ruling out the possibility of data artifacts and false positive findings (results not shown). To determine <italic toggle="yes">omeClust</italic>âs ability to recapitulate true positive clusters, we further validated <italic toggle="yes">omeClust</italic> on datasets with known cluster structure (detailed in Section 3.1). Since <italic toggle="yes">omeClust</italic> coherently looks at multiple resolution levels of the underlying hierarchical structure, it is expected to discover clusters (communities) above and beyond those detectable only by computing average distances between clusters. This is particularly relevant for omics data, where large groups of molecular features (e.g. expression values for genes in a metabolic pathway) form communities with variable mean distances between members and it is desirable to incorporate the entire resolution spectrum of the intra-cluster distances into the clustering algorithm.</p>
    <sec>
      <title>3.1 Synthetic data validation of <italic toggle="yes">omeClust</italic></title>
      <p>To evaluate <italic toggle="yes">omeClust</italic>, we tested our algorithm along with existing state-of-the-art approaches (<xref rid="btab317-B39" ref-type="bibr">You and You, 2018</xref>) in a variety of synthetic datasets containing built-in known communities (âground truthâ) and evaluated their statistical and computational performance across a range of parameters. For generating synthetic clusters with âground truthâ membership information, we used <italic toggle="yes">clusterlab</italic> (<xref rid="btab317-B18" ref-type="bibr">John <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2020</xref>), which is a recent method that allows simulation of Gaussian clusters (<xref rid="btab317-B26" ref-type="bibr">Maugis <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>) with controlled spacing, size and variance among the generated clusters. Specifically, we generated 135 synthetic datasets of varying capacity across a range of pairwise combinations of cluster size (4, 6, 8) and per-cluster sample size (10, 20, 40), while also varying the feature dimensions (500, 1000, 1500) and inter-cluster distances (0.05, 0.10, 0.25, 0.5, 1).</p>
      <p>We found that <italic toggle="yes">omeClust</italic> vastly outperforms popular community detection methods, such as the Louvain approach (<xref rid="btab317-B4" ref-type="bibr">Blondel <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>) and Infomap (<xref rid="btab317-B5" ref-type="bibr">Bohlin <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>) in terms of (i) the adjusted Rand index (<xref rid="btab317-F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>), (ii) Jaccard index (<xref rid="btab317-F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>), (iii) FowlkesâMallows index (<xref rid="btab317-F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref>) and (iv) <italic toggle="yes">F</italic>1 score (<xref rid="btab317-F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d</xref>). While these network community detection approaches tend to perform well in readily distinguishable communities, they suffer in the presence of inherent multicollinearity, noise and overlap as typically observed in omics samples and can in turn give rise to misleading communities (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. S1</xref>). In addition to superseding these more sophisticated methods and improving community detection, <italic toggle="yes">omeClust</italic> further exhibited improved performance as compared to several other state-of-the-art domain-agnostic clustering algorithms, such as the partitional [e.g. Sincell (<xref rid="btab317-B19" ref-type="bibr">JuliÃ¡ <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>), pcaReduce (<xref rid="btab317-B42" ref-type="bibr">Å½urauskienÄ and Yau, 2016</xref>) and Seurat (<xref rid="btab317-B32" ref-type="bibr">Satija <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>)], network-based [e.g. Infomap (<xref rid="btab317-B5" ref-type="bibr">Bohlin <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>) and Louvain (<xref rid="btab317-B4" ref-type="bibr">Blondel <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="btab317-B8" ref-type="bibr">Csardi <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>)], model-based [e.g. Hcmodel (<xref rid="btab317-B13" ref-type="bibr">Fraley <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>)], density-based [e.g. DBSCAN (<xref rid="btab317-B23" ref-type="bibr">Liu <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>)], subspace-based [e.g. Hddc (<xref rid="btab317-B6" ref-type="bibr">Bouveyron <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2007; BergÃ© <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., 2013</xref>)] and shared nearest neighbor-based [e.g. sNNclust (<xref rid="btab317-B10" ref-type="bibr">ErtÃ¶z <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>) and sscClust (<xref rid="btab317-B31" ref-type="bibr">Ren <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2019</xref>)] community detection methods [<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Tables S1 and S2</xref> and <xref rid="btab317-F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2(aâd)]</xref>. The superior performance of <italic toggle="yes">omeClust</italic> remained consistent across a range of feature dimensions, inter-cluster distances and linkage methods, which further highlights the flexibility and robustness of <italic toggle="yes">omeClust</italic> in realistically unbalanced community structures. Taken together, these findings confirm that by taking into account the overall high-level structure of diverse features, in addition to feature-wise distances, which alone may not be sufficient to reproducibly recover biologically complex communities, <italic toggle="yes">omeClust</italic> is able to capture biologically relevant communities, missed by other methods, across a broad range of realistically complex scenarios.</p>

        <title>3.2.1 Niche association of human microbial species and strains</title>
        <p>We first applied <italic toggle="yes">omeClust</italic> to 2484 metagenomes from the expanded human microbiome project (HMP1-II) (<xref rid="btab317-B24" ref-type="bibr">Lloyd-Price <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>). In this application, the âfeaturesâ included the microbial speices inferred from the metagenomic data (<xref rid="btab317-B14" ref-type="bibr">Franzosa <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2018</xref>) as well as clinical metadata for each sample (including body area of the collection site). <italic toggle="yes">omeClust</italic> identified body area as the most influential metadata (NMI=0.83) responsible for the clustering structure (<xref rid="btab317-F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>). <italic toggle="yes">omeClust</italic> also reports four major clusters (resolution score &gt;0.05) each corresponding to a human body site from which samples were collected, confirming the compositional structure of microbial species and their niche associations. Two metadata, RANDSID (random ID for patients) and SNPRNT (specimen barcode ID), had the lowest frequency-based enrichment scores (&lt;0.05), as expected. The overlaps of color and shape explain how well our computational approach defines the underlying clustering structure, providing actionable interpretations of the detected clusters or communities. Several ordination plots, such as principal coordinates analysis, <italic toggle="yes">t</italic>-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding and multidimensional scaling were used to visualize the results. We also combined HMP1-II samples with the iHMP (<xref rid="btab317-B25" ref-type="bibr">Lloyd-Price <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2019</xref>) shotgun metagenomic data on the human stool samples, and profiled additional 1149 microbial strains that passed the strain conditions (<xref rid="btab317-B37" ref-type="bibr">Truong <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>). <italic toggle="yes">omeClust</italic> detected three communities of <italic toggle="yes">Haemophilus parainfluenzae</italic> with body site being the most influential metadata, also confirmed with an independent PERMANOVA analysis (<xref rid="btab317-B2" ref-type="bibr">Anderson, 2017</xref>) using the <italic toggle="yes">adonis</italic> R function in the <italic toggle="yes">vegan</italic> package (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic>-value = 0.001 with 999 permutations). These communities largely correspond to two body sites, supragingival plaque (two communities) and tongue dorsum (one community) with NMI of 0.49 (<xref rid="btab317-F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>). Our novel findings thus suggest that microbial species can have more than one strain in each sample. We detected similar patterns for oral microbial species, including <italic toggle="yes">Actinomyces johnsonii</italic> (<xref rid="btab317-F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c</xref>), <italic toggle="yes">Rothia mucilaginosa</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Campylobacter showae</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">Porphyromonas sp oral taxon 279</italic>, and stool microbial species including <italic toggle="yes">Eubacterium siraeum</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">Escherichia coli</italic> that showed evidence of multiple subclades of strains consistent with the literature (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. S3</xref>).</p>

        <title>3.2.2 Cross-tissue analysis of gene and protein expression in cell lines</title>
        <p>Cell line gene expression has been extensively used to investigate intracellular activities in diseases, such as cancer (<xref rid="btab317-B15" ref-type="bibr">Ghandi <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2019</xref>) and inflammatory bowel disease (<xref rid="btab317-B33" ref-type="bibr">Schulze <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). We applied <italic toggle="yes">omeClust</italic> to gene expression datasets from three breast cancer studies (<xref rid="btab317-B27" ref-type="bibr">McCall <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>, <xref rid="btab317-B28" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; <xref rid="btab317-B41" ref-type="bibr">Zilliox and Irizarry, 2007</xref>). In this application, the omics âfeaturesâ are gene expression and the clinical metadata include cell line type (i.e. kidney versus cerebellum) and spatial information (whether the sample is collected from the left or right side). Cell line gene expression serves as a strong application to validate our technique as we hypothesized these samples to be clustered according to the kind of tissue from which they originated. <italic toggle="yes">omeClust</italic>, indeed, found that cells establish communities based on their drawn tissues. Using the high-resolution mode of <italic toggle="yes">omeClust</italic>, we detected nine communities from seven tissue cell lines with NMI of 0.84 (<xref rid="btab317-F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref>). Cell lines from the kidney and cerebellum formed two communities suggesting spatial heterogeneity of these organs (e.g. whether samples have been collected from the left or right side). Although we did not have spatial resolution data to validate this information, this leads to an interesting hypothesis of spatial gene expression patterns of the left and right side of the kidney and cerebellum, which has been indicated in previous animal studies (<xref rid="btab317-B12" ref-type="bibr">Evans <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2018</xref>; <xref rid="btab317-B29" ref-type="bibr">Nakamura <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). This finding also highlights the versatility of <italic toggle="yes">omeClust</italic>'s clustering capabilities, suggesting that depending on the biological signal present in the dataset, the user may choose the appropriate resolution level. The ability to use multiple resolutions within <italic toggle="yes">omeClust</italic> allows users the flexibility to interpret communities at multiple vantage points (e.g. specific communities associated with different sets of metadata at various resolution levels).</p>

In particular, inferred ethnicity (<xref rid="btab317-F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4c</xref>), histology, pathology and gender were the most influential metadata (in decreasing order) and the least enriched metadata in the communities corresponded to the ID variables (i.e. name and depMapID), as expected. This testing strategy is very similar in spirit to a standalone approach like PERMANOVA, where it is possible to attribute the percentage of variation in the distance matrix explained by a metadata of interest. However, unlike PERMANOVA, <italic toggle="yes">omeClust</italic> explicitly uses the clustering and community results to derive the enrichment scores, providing a sophisticated and biologically balanced information for further follow-up experimentation.</p>

        <p>Finally, we applied <italic toggle="yes">omeClust</italic> to the NICHD Fetal Growth Studies-Singletons (<xref rid="btab317-B16" ref-type="bibr">Grewal <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2018</xref>) data that included placental samples at delivery from 301 pregnant women from four race/ethnic groups including non-Hispanic white (25.6%), non-Hispanic black (23.9%), Hispanic (33.9%) and Asian/Pacific Islander (16.6%). The samples were genotyped to obtain fetal single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) using HumanOmni2.5 Beadchips (Illumina Inc, San Diego, CA) with â¼2 million SNPs (<xref rid="btab317-B9" ref-type="bibr">Delahaye <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., 2018</xref>). In this application, the SNP data are the genomic âfeaturesâ and the associated clinical metadata include birth weight, prenatal environment, race, education, etc. Using genetic relationship information among the SNPs as a measure of distance, we set out to detect communities with higher affinity to babies with extremely small or large weight at birth. To this end, we considered several prenatal environments (e.g. maternal age, socio-economic status and parity, among others) as well as low birth weight status (defined as birth weight &lt;2500 g), small for gestational age defined as birth weight less than the 10th percentile for gestational age based on sex-specific birth weight references, and large-for-gestational age defined as birth weight greater than the 90th percentile for gestational age based on sex-specific birth weight references as metadata in the <italic toggle="yes">omeClust</italic> analysis. <italic toggle="yes">omeClust</italic> reported four major clusters primarily overlapping with self-identified race/ethnicity (<xref rid="btab317-F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a</xref>). The top three most influential metadata were maternal demographic factor (race), socio-economic status (education) and cardiometabolic factors (gestational weight gain), consistent with previous evidence for population differences in size at birth (<xref rid="btab317-B7" ref-type="bibr">Buck Louis <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>; <xref rid="btab317-B35" ref-type="bibr">Tekola-Ayele <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2018</xref>; <xref rid="btab317-B35" ref-type="bibr">TekolaâAyele <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., 2019</xref>) [<xref rid="btab317-F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5(bâc)]</xref>.

    <title>4 Discussion</title>
    <p><italic toggle="yes">omeClust</italic> represents a newly developed method to detect clusters and communities in heterogeneous biological datasets. Its validation and applications show that <italic toggle="yes">omeClust</italic> is well suited for finding biologically meaningful subsets of samples or features in a diverse range of omics studies. Key to our approach is the use of the overall structure of the feature-wise relationships in a dataset that allows capturing biologically relevant communities and clusters in different resolutions of similarity. We optimized and validated <italic toggle="yes">omeClust</italic> using realistic synthetic datasets of known community structure, where our approach outperformed existing approaches across a range of scenarios. Notably, <italic toggle="yes">omeClust</italic> remains one of the best-performing methods in the scRNASeq-specific evaluation despite not being optimized for the specific application domain.<italic toggle="yes">omeClust</italic> can also be used for specific downstream tasks, such as discretizing omics data, dimension reduction, microbial beta-diversity analysis and subclade finding in microbial strains using nucleotide-based distances, among others. Further, our approach can be paired with existing network analysis and community detection methods. For example, <italic toggle="yes">omeClust</italic> can find an optimal threshold for sparse edge discovery that can be embedded in a network analysis approach, such as <italic toggle="yes">Infomap</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">Louvain</italic> to improve their performance. Further, <italic toggle="yes">omeClust</italic> outputs an enrichment score for each desired metadata that can be used to select the most influential features in any clustering analysis. This arguably leads to more interpretable communities that are potentially explainable by a few metadata, which can also be used as covariates in streamlined downstream discovery (e.g. differential expression and abundance analysis).</p>
    <p>Clearly, the development of robust computational and statistical methods for accurate community detection is an ongoing effort. We, therefore, hope that future work could further fine-tune the task of feature selection and dimensionality reduction based on detected communities (e.g. feature engineering and feature extraction for deep learning). Another opportunity for future extension of our method is allowing multiple omics simultaneously especially allowing multiple time points and tissues to comprehensively detect communities in tandem. Combined, such extensions will allow researchers to use other downstream methods in parallel with <italic toggle="yes">omeClust</italic>, moving toward a robust, unified framework for omics-driven biomarker discovery, development and validation. We believe that the <italic toggle="yes">omeClust</italic> framework and the improved detection of communities represent an important step in this direction that can ultimately aid in better interpretation and understanding of omics data while also encouraging further methodological advances in this area. An open-source (Python) implementation of <italic toggle="yes">omeClust</italic> is freely available at <ext-link xlink:href="http://github.com/omicsEye/omeClust" ext-link-type="uri">http://github.com/omicsEye/omeClust</ext-link> along with documentation, demo datasets, real-world applications and a user forum.</p>
