        <title>Design, Setting, and Participants</title>
        <p>This study used published journal articles as training, testing, and validation sets to develop, refine, and evaluate the CONSORT-NLP tool. Articles reporting randomized clinical trials were selected from 25 high-impact-factor journals under the following categories: (1) general and internal medicine, (2) oncology, and (3) cardiac and cardiovascular systems.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="ab-zoi200554-7">
        <title>Main Outcomes and Measures</title>
        <p>For an evaluation of the performance of this tool, an accuracy metric defined as the number of correct assessments divided by all assessments was calculated.</p>

      <sec id="ab-zoi200554-8">
        <title>Results</title>
        <p>The CONSORT-NLP tool uses the widely used Portable Document Format as an input file. Of the 37 CONSORT reporting items, 34 (92%) were included in the tool. Of these 34 reporting items, 30 were fully implemented; 28 (93%) of the fully implemented CONSORT reporting items had an accuracy of more than 90% for the validation set. The remaining 2 (7%) had an accuracy between 80% and 90% for the validation set. Two to 5 articles were selected from each of these journals for a total of 158 articles to establish a training set of 111 articles to train CONSORT-NLP for CONSORT reporting items, a testing set of 25 articles to refine CONSORT-NLP, and a validation set of 22 articles to assess the performance of CONSORT-NLP. The CONSORT-NLP tool used the Portable Document Format of the articles as input files. A CONSORT-NLP graphical user interface was built using Java in 2019. The time required to complete the CONSORT checklist manually vs using the CONSORT-NLP tool was compared for 30 articles. Two case studies for randomized clinical trials are provided as an illustration for the CONSORT-NLP tool. For the 30 articles investigated, CONSORT-NLP required a mean (SD) 23.0 (4.1) seconds, whereas the manual reviewer required a mean (SD) 11.9 (2.2), 22.6 (4.6), and 57.6 (7.1) minutes, for 3 reviewers, respectively.</p>

        <title>Conclusions and Relevance</title>
        <p>The CONSORT-NLP tool is designed to assist in the reporting of randomized clinical trials. Potential users of CONSORT-NLP include clinicians, researchers, and scientists who plan to publish a randomized trial study in a peer-reviewed journal. The use of CONSORT-NLP may help them save substantial time when generating the CONSORT checklist. This tool may also be useful for manuscript reviewers and journal editors who review these articles.</p>

    <title>Introduction</title>
    <p>Inadequate reporting of randomized clinical trials (RCTs) may complicate the interpretation of study results and thereby negatively impact future research or even the application of study results to clinical care. Proper reporting may also improve the likelihood that published results are reproducible and may contribute to the transparency and structured thinking necessary for high-quality research. Enhancing and harmonizing reporting in publications may advance research and may ultimately improve patient outcomes.<sup><xref rid="zoi200554r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> The well-known reporting guideline for RCTs is called the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.equator-network.org/reporting-guidelines/consort/">CONSORT</ext-link>), and it has been a fundamental element of quality considerations in clinical trial reporting. At present, the CONSORT reporting guideline (updated in 2010) has already been cited more than 10 000 times.<sup><xref rid="zoi200554r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup></p>
    <p>To improve adherence to the CONSORT reporting guideline, extensions of the guideline have been proposed.<sup><xref rid="zoi200554r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="zoi200554r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> Despite efforts to promote proper reporting, adherence to the CONSORT reporting guideline remains an issue.<sup><xref rid="zoi200554r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="zoi200554r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> For example, Limb et al<sup><xref rid="zoi200554r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> reported that 63% of general surgical studies investigated did not report the funding sources. A recent literature search with the key words “randomized” AND “controlled” AND “trial” on PubMed yielded more than 40 000 articles in 2017. With these many articles, the issue regarding adherence can be significant. In addition, tremendous effort and resources are required to check these reporting items manually.</p>
    <p>The structured format of CONSORT would seem to lend itself to natural language processing (NLP), thus enabling researchers to reduce that amount of effort and to ensure their own adherence but also providing a means for others to acquire the needed structured data in an automated fashion. Natural language processing is a subfield of artificial intelligence. In recent years, automated tools like NLP have increasingly been used in various biomedical research fields, such as oncology, dermatology, gastroenterology, neurology.<sup><xref rid="zoi200554r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="zoi200554r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="zoi200554r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="zoi200554r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="zoi200554r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> The goal of this study is to develop an NLP tool for authors of RCTs to automatically generate a CONSORT report and check for CONSORT adherence. The latest version of CONSORT-NLP and a step-by-step tutorial guide (eAppendix in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="note-ZOI200554-1-s">Supplemen</xref>t) can be downloaded from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.consort-nlp.org">http://www.consort-nlp.org</ext-link>.<sup><xref rid="zoi200554r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup></p>

    <title>Methods</title>
    <sec id="H2-1-ZOI200554">
      <title>NLP Techniques in CONSORT-NLP</title>
      <p>The CONSORT-NLP tool uses processing techniques that can be broadly categorized into syntactic and semantic approaches. Syntax-based NLP techniques focus on the grammatical structure of sentences. In CONSORT-NLP, we used syntax-based methods such as tokenization, lemmatization, part-of-speech tagging, sentence breaking, terminology extraction, and word segmentation.<sup><xref rid="zoi200554r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> Lemmatization removes inflectional endings to return the canonical form of a word.</p>
      <p>Semantics-based NLP techniques encompass the meaning of sentences. Among these techniques, CONSORT-NLP uses named entity recognition, relationship extraction, and word-sense disambiguation. Named entity recognition locates and classifies the name of real-world objects, such as WHO (ie, World Health Organization) for organizations and New York for locations. Relationship extraction identifies associations among named entities. Word-sense disambiguation recognizes the meaning of a word in a sentence where more than 1 meaning is possible. Our tool is primarily rule-based with the incorporation of previously machine learning–trained corpus. The study was performed from February 7, 2019, and January 31, 2020.</p>

      <title>Flow Diagram for CONSORT-NLP</title>
      <p>The process of CONSORT-NLP mainly includes 4 steps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="zoi200554f1">Figure 1</xref>). The first step involves the extraction of text from the PDF input before the reconstructed article is processed with NLP. Processing of the article begins in the second step. In brief, the reconstructed article is divided by sections and then further broken down into sentences. The third step involves the identification of CONSORT items. In this step, a combination of NLP methods is used to identify the relevant sentences for each CONSORT item. Item numbers 2a and 22 of CONSORT are less objective in nature, and item number 17b is only a recommendation. Therefore, they are not implemented in CONSORT-NLP. The final step is report generation. The CONSORT-NLP tool automatically fills out the CONSORT checklist in word document format and summarizes the notification messages, if applicable, in a separate word document.</p>

    <sec id="H2-3-ZOI200554">
      <title>Graphical User Interface of CONSORT-NLP</title>
      <p>The CONSORT-NLP tool has 3 main functions: article upload, feedback on CONSORT items, and report generation. There are 2 main pages of the graphical user interface. On page 1, we provide the upload page for the document to be checked by CONSORT-NLP. The second page consists of an interactive page where users are provided feedback on the CONSORT items. As displayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="zoi200554f2">Figure 2</xref>, the interactive page is divided into 3 parts: Article view, Matching sentence view, and Checklist items. Article view displays the text that highlights the relevant sentences of the checklist items. The buttons with different colors in checklist items are clickable. The blue highlighted text indicates that the sentence matches the checklist item. White text suggests that no relevant information in the article has been identified for the item. When a notification message is provided for the item, pink highlighting will be shown. For example, a notification message will be shown when the reporting item is presented in a different section of the manuscript from the one specified in the CONSORT checklist. Gray highlighting indicates that the item is not implemented in CONSORT-NLP. After a click of the button, the detected sentence(s) for that item are displayed in the matching sentence view. On page 2, a CONSORT report based on the reporting guideline<sup><xref rid="zoi200554r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> can be generated using the tool as well. A summary of items with notification messages can also be exported. We present 2 real articles, one for randomized study on drug efficacy and another on comparing therapeutic options as case studies in the results section.</p>

      <title>Target Users</title>
      <p>The CONSORT-NLP tool was designed for checks of CONSORT items in an RCT. Potential users of CONSORT-NLP include researchers, scientists, and clinicians who plan to publish an RCT in a peer-reviewed journal. This tool can also be useful for manuscript reviewers and journal editors who review these articles.</p>

      <title>Identification of Journals and Articles for Training, Testing, and Validating CONSORT-NLP</title>
      <p>We selected journals from 3 major categories of medical research: (1) general and internal medicine, (2) oncology, and (3) cardiac and cardiovascular systems, according to their International Scientific Indexing impact factor. These journals are ranked in the top 50 in those categories and publish primarily original research. Articles reported with key phrases (ie, “randomized trial,” “randomised trial,” “randomized study,” or “randomised study”) in the title or subtitle were identified. Comments, reviews, meta-analyses, and studies focusing on additional analysis were excluded. We picked 2 to 5 articles from each of these chosen journals for a total of 158 articles to establish a training set of 111 articles to train CONSORT-NLP for CONSORT reporting items, a testing set of 25 articles to refine CONSORT-NLP, and a validation set of 22 articles to assess the performance of CONSORT-NLP.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="H2-6-ZOI200554">
      <title>Metric for Assessing Performance</title>
      <p>Accuracy is measured for each item across all articles. Correct assessment for a reporting item of an article means that (1) CONSORT-NLP correctly extracts the relevant reporting item from the article or (2) CONSORT-NLP reports null finding and the article truly does not contain the relevant reporting item. As is standard, accuracy for each item is measured as the number of articles correctly assessed divided by the total number of articles. Item number 10 of CONSORT was not fully implemented because of some ambiguity in the definition and so is not included in our accuracy calculation. Item numbers 13a, 13b, and 16 are also excluded from the accuracy calculation because some of the required information may be embedded in figures or tables. The remaining 30 implemented items were categorized into those achieving less 80% accuracy, 80% to 90% accuracy, and more than 90% accuracy in bar charts.</p>

    <sec id="H2-7-ZOI200554">
      <title>Training CONSORT-NLP</title>
      <p>During review of the articles in the training set, sentences describing CONSORT reporting items were manually extracted and summarized separately by item. We analyzed the sentences of each CONSORT item and developed a natural language processing strategy based on several common features in those sentences. We used these strategies to detect information from the training set articles. We filtered the extracted sentences into 3 groups: positive, negative, and undetected. The positive group includes sentences that are extracted with the relevant information about the CONSORT item. The negative group includes sentences that are extracted with information unrelated to the CONSORT item. Another group of sentences that contains the relevant information but is not detected by CONSORT-NLP is classified as undetected. We analyzed the sentences in the negative group and the undetected group to improve our strategies until the proportion of these 2 groups is less than 10% for the training set.</p>

      <title>Testing and Refining CONSORT-NLP</title>
      <p>We used the testing set to pilot the first version of CONSORT-NLP. We checked the articles manually to assess whether the appropriate items were correctly detected. After reviewing all the articles, we calculated the accuracy of the first test version of CONSORT-NLP with the testing set. To refine this version, item search strategies were modified. The second test version of CONSORT-NLP resulted from the refinement.</p>

    <sec id="H2-9-ZOI200554">
      <title>Validation of CONSORT-NLP</title>
      <p>An independent set of articles in the validation set was used to evaluate the performance of the CONSORT-NLP. F.W. and H.P. independently reviewed the CONSORT-NLP output and the original article.

F.W. performed a detailed review on the implemented CONSORT items for each article and met with H.P. to discuss and resolve difficult reported item cases. To understand the difference in the time required to complete the CONSORT checklist manually vs the CONSORT-NLP tool, we timed the number of seconds or minute required to complete the CONSORT checklist for 30 articles manually. Ten articles each were randomly selected and assigned to F.W., X.W., and H.P. X.W. was added to represent an experienced reviewer but with less training on the CONSORT checklist. We compared the time required manually against the time needed by the CONSORT-NLP tool. CONSORT-NLP was developed with JAVA 8 Update 181, Python 3.5, and Stanford NER.<sup><xref rid="zoi200554r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup></p>

      <title>Characteristics of Included Articles</title>
      <p>A total of 158 articles were included in this study. The study articles were obtained from 25 journals with an International Scientific Indexing impact factor (as of 2018) of 3 to 75 from 3 major categories of medical research: (1) general and internal medicine, (2) oncology, and (3) cardiac and cardiovascular systems. For general and internal medicine, 8 journals were selected, including the <italic>New England Journal of Medicine</italic>, <italic>Lancet</italic>, and <italic>JAMA</italic>. For oncology, 9 journals were selected, including <italic>Lancet Oncology</italic>, <italic>Journal of Clinical Oncology</italic>, and <italic>Annals of Oncology</italic>. For cardiac and cardiovascular systems, 8 journals were selected, including <italic>Circulation</italic>, <italic>Journal of the American College of Cardiology</italic>, and <italic>Circulation Research</italic>. Of the 158 articles, 111 (70%) were selected as the training set to allow us to train CONSORT-NLP for CONSORT reporting items. To improve CONSORT-NLP, 1 article from each selected journal was chosen for the testing set. Of all 159 articles, 22 (14%) were used to validate the performance of the tool, and 134 (85%) were published between March 2010 and July 2019 after the release of the CONSORT 2010 Statement. The <xref rid="zoi200554t1" ref-type="table">Table</xref> presents the journals included and describes the characteristics of the training, testing, and validation sets.</p>

      <title>Performance of CONSORT-NLP</title>
      <p>The accepted document format for CONSORT-NLP is the widely used PDF. Of the 37 CONSORT reporting items, 34 (92%) were included in our tool. A testing set of articles not included in the training set was used to evaluate the performance of the tool. Of the 30 fully implemented items, 24 (80%) had an accuracy of more than 90% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="zoi200554f3">Figure 3</xref>). To further refine and enhance CONSORT-NLP, articles in the testing set were used for a new round of training. The updated CONSORT-NLP after refinement was able to achieve an accuracy of more than 90% for all items except for number 9 on allocation concealment mechanism for randomization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="zoi200554f3">Figure 3</xref>). An independent validation set was used to assess the performance of the updated tool. Of the 30 fully implemented items, 28 (93%) had an accuracy of more than 90% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="zoi200554f3">Figure 3</xref>).</p>

          <title>Performance of Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials–Natural Language Processing (CONSORT-NLP)</title>
          <p>Compared with the tool before refinement, the updated CONSORT-NLP was able to achieve an accuracy of more than 90% for all items except for 1 item in the validation set. Accuracy is calculated as the number of articles correctly assessed divided by the total number of articles. Correct assessment for a reporting item of an article means that (1) CONSORT-NLP correctly extracts the relevant reporting item from the article or (2) CONSORT-NLP reports null finding and the article truly does not contain the relevant reporting item.</p>

      <p>The back-end code of CONSORT-NLP was written in Python. The graphical user interface was implemented with Java and was designed to run on various operating systems, including Windows, Mac, and Linux. On Windows 10 with Intel Core i7 3.40-GHz CPU, the mean run time of the program was approximately 12 seconds after the target article has been loaded in the tool. For the 30 articles investigated, CONSORT-NLP required a mean (SD) 23.0 (4.1) seconds, whereas the reviewers F.W., H.P., and X.W. required a mean (SD) 11.9 (2.2), 22.6 (4.6), and 57.6 (7.1) minutes, respectively.</p>

        <title>Case Study 1</title>
        <p>The first case study is an example of an RCT for testing drug efficacy and safety. The primary objective of the HERO (Hydroxychloroquine Effectiveness in Reducing Symptoms of hand Osteoarthritis) trial is to determine the effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine vs placebo as a symptomatic treatment for hand osteoarthritis.<sup><xref rid="zoi200554r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> We used CONSORT-NLP to generate the CONSORT 2010 checklist.<sup><xref rid="zoi200554r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup></p>
        <p>On page 1 (eAppendix in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="note-ZOI200554-1-s">Supplement</xref>), we uploaded the HERO article to CONSORT-NLP in PDF format. After approximately 10 seconds of wait time, CONSORT-NLP will refresh to the second page as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="zoi200554f2">Figure 2</xref>. The second page provides feedback on the CONSORT items. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="zoi200554f2">Figure 2</xref>, the sentence highlighted in blue in the Article view with prefix “1a” indicates that the sentence was matched to item 1a: Identification as a randomized trial in the title. The buttons with different colors in the Checklist items are clickable. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="zoi200554f2">Figure 2</xref>, we demonstrate the result after clicking the light blue–highlighted item 2b: Specific objectives or hypotheses. After clicking, the detected sentence for the objective of HERO trial is displayed in the Matching sentence view. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="zoi200554f4">Figure 4</xref>A, a pink-highlighted item was clicked; it indicates that a notification message is available for this item. As shown in Matching sentence view, we observe that CONSORT-NLP found a sentence that matches this item; however, this sentence should be present in the Results section of an article instead of the current Method section according to the CONSORT guideline. On page 2, a CONSORT report based on the reporting guideline is generated using our tool as well (eAppendix in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="note-ZOI200554-1-s">Supplement</xref>). Messages in the Notifications panel can also be exported (eAppendix in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="note-ZOI200554-1-s">Supplement</xref>).</p>

    <title>Discussion</title>
    <p>The CONSORT-NLP tool may help improve the quality of reporting of RCTs and the efficiency in generating the CONSORT reporting checklist by enabling authors and reviewers to automatically assess how well their manuscripts conform to the CONSORT reporting standard. The CONSORT checklist is also provided by this tool and can be submitted along with the manuscript for journal publication. Guidelines like the CONSORT are essential to promote the reproducibility and interpretability of RCTs.</p>
    <p>In recent years, tools have been developed to help authors follow the CONSORT guidelines. For example, web-based writing aid tools based on the CONSORT statement have been developed and studied.<sup><xref rid="zoi200554r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="zoi200554r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> One of them contains a series of textboxes for authors to fill out that address CONSORT items. The other tool has been implemented at the manuscript revision stage. Neither of these tools is based on NLP, nor do they automatically check for compliance of a draft manuscript directly. Although there are reported improvements since the introduction of the CONSORT guidelines and new tools, calls have been made for better adherence to the standards, even in high-impact general medical journals.<sup><xref rid="zoi200554r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> The situation is particularly severe in specialty journals for disciplines such as anesthesiology, cardiology, psychiatry, and surgery.<sup><xref rid="zoi200554r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="zoi200554r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="zoi200554r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="zoi200554r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> Adherence to guidelines is associated with the impact factors and is less satisfactory in lower-impact-factor journals than higher ones because high-impact-factor journals are, in general, more resourceful.<sup><xref rid="zoi200554r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> Therefore, we believe that CONSORT-NLP is timely and may help readers, publishers, and authors of RCTs in the biomedical research ecosystem.</p>
    <sec id="H2-13-ZOI200554">
      <title>Limitations</title>
      <p>This study is not without limitations. Item numbers 2a, 22, and 17b of the 37 CONSORT items have not been implemented owing to their complexity and the level of subjectivity involved in assessing adherence to them. However, with more data and more sophisticated training algorithms, the CONSORT-NLP tool may be improved further.</p>

    <title>Conclusions</title>
    <p>Currently, for the majority of journals, the responsibility for adhering to the reporting criteria in the CONSORT guidelines still lies with the author. The CONSORT-NLP tool, a standalone software tested on the major desktop operating systems, takes advantage of NLP techniques to automatically generate a report on the ready-to-submit manuscript. Moreover, an editable CONSORT checklist can also be generated for the manuscript. This time-saving feature may encourage adoption of the tool. The CONSORT-NLP tool may improve the reporting and interpretability of RCTs. The tool is not intended to completely replace human evaluation of CONSORT adherence but to encourage and increase the adherence to CONSORT guidelines by reducing the time for completing checklists manually.</p>
